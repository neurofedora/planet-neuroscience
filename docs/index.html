<p>The Kuramoto model (KM) is a theoretical paradigm for investigating the
emergence of rhythmic activity in large populations of oscillators. A
remarkable example of rhythmogenesis is the feedback loop between excitatory
(E) and inhibitory (I) cells in large neuronal networks. Yet, although the
EI-feedback mechanism plays a central role in the generation of brain
oscillations, it remains unexplored whether the KM has enough biological
realism to describe it. Here we derive a two-population KM that fully accounts
for the onset of EI-based neuronal rhythms and that, as the original KM, is
analytically solvable to a large extent. Our results provide a powerful
theoretical tool for the analysis of large-scale neuronal oscillations.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05177">fMRI Semantic Category Decoding using Linguistic Encoding of Word Embeddings. (arXiv:1806.05177v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The dispute of how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge has been
argued in many scientific fields. Brain imaging studies have shown that the
spatial patterns of neural activation in the brain are correlated with thinking
about different semantic categories of words (for example, tools, animals, and
buildings) or when viewing the related pictures. In this paper, we present a
computational model that learns to predict the neural activation captured in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of test words. Unlike the
models with hand-crafted features that have been used in the literature, in
this paper we propose a novel approach wherein decoding models are built with
features extracted from popular linguistic encodings of Word2Vec, GloVe,
Meta-Embeddings in conjunction with the empirical fMRI data associated with
viewing several dozen concrete nouns. We compared these models with several
other models that use word features extracted from FastText, Randomly-generated
features, Mitchell's 25 features [1]. The experimental results show that the
predicted fMRI images using Meta-Embeddings meet the state-of-the-art
performance. Although models with features from GloVe and Word2Vec predict fMRI
images similar to the state-of-the-art model, model with features from
Meta-Embeddings predicts significantly better. The proposed scheme that uses
popular linguistic encoding offers a simple and easy approach for semantic
decoding from fMRI experiments.

Double strand breaks (DSB) in the DNA backbone are the most lethal type of defect induced in the cell nucleus by chemical and radiation treatments of cancer. However, little is known about the outcomes of damage in nucleosomal DNA, and on its effects on damage repair. We performed microsecond-long molecular dynamics computer simulations of nucleosomes including a DSB at various sites, to characterize the early stages of the evolution of this DNA lesion. The damaged structures are studied by the essential dynamics of DNA and histones, and compared to the intact nucleosome, thus exposing key features of the interactions. All DSB configurations tend to remain compact, with only the terminal bases interacting with histone proteins. Umbrella sampling calculations show that broken DNA ends at the DSB must overcome a free-energy barrier to detach from the nucleosome core. Finally, by calculating the covariant mechanical stress, we demonstrate that the coupled bending and torsional stress can force the DSB free ends to open up straight, thus making it accessible to damage signalling proteins.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TrSQAWSy52w" width="1" />

To achieve the 90-90-90 goals set by UNAIDS, the number of new HIV infections needs to decrease to approximately 500,000 by 2020. One of the ‘five pillars’ to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP. Despite its advantages, Truvada is costly and requires individuals to adhere to the once-daily regimen. To improve PrEP, many next-generation regimen, including long-acting formulations, are currently investigated. However, pre-clinical testing may not guide candidate selection, since it often fails to translate into clinical efficacy. On the other hand, quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic and requires to conduct long (years) and large (N&gt;1000 individuals) trials, precluding systematic evaluation of candidates and deployment strategies. To prioritize- and help design PrEP regimen, tools are urgently needed that integrate pharmacological-, viral- and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. Integrating the aforementioned factors, we developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir (DTG). Combining the population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework, we predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50- and 90% sexual transmissions respectively. We then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP ‘on demand’ and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after virus exposure. Once daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99–100% infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP ‘on demand’ prevented 79–84% infections and PEP &gt;80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. While the simulation framework can easily be adapted to other PrEP candidates, our simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada. Moreover, the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v-VbLFXyYXc" width="1" />

<p>by Vivek Navale, Philip E. Bourne</p>

Biomedical research has become a digital data–intensive endeavor, relying on secure and scalable computing, storage, and network infrastructure, which has traditionally been purchased, supported, and maintained locally. For certain types of biomedical applications, cloud computing has emerged as an alternative to locally maintained traditional computing approaches. Cloud computing offers users pay-as-you-go access to services such as hardware infrastructure, platforms, and software for solving common biomedical computational problems. Cloud computing services offer secure on-demand storage and analysis and are differentiated from traditional high-performance computing by their rapid availability and scalability of services. As such, cloud services are engineered to address big data problems and enhance the likelihood of data and analytics sharing, reproducibility, and reuse. Here, we provide an introductory perspective on cloud computing to help the reader determine its value to their own research.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LKfBBSl42Rc" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Midbrain dopamine neurons project to numerous targets throughout the brain to modulate various behaviors and brain states. Within this small population of neurons exists significant heterogeneity based on physiology, circuitry, and disease susceptibility. Recent studies have shown that dopamine neurons can be subdivided based on gene expression; however, the extent to which genetic markers represent functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations has not been fully explored. Here we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of mouse dopamine neurons and validated studies showing that <i>Neurod6</i> and <i>Grp</i> are selective markers for dopaminergic subpopulations. Using a combination of multiplex fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology in mice of both sexes, we defined the anatomy, projection targets, physiological properties, and disease vulnerability of dopamine neurons based on <i>Grp</i> and/or <i>Neurod6</i> expression. We found that the combinatorial expression of <i>Grp</i> and <i>Neurod6</i> defines dopaminergic subpopulations with unique features. <i>Grp<sup>+</sup>/Neurod6</i>  <sup>+</sup> dopamine neurons reside in the ventromedial VTA, send projections to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, and have noncanonical physiological properties. <i>Grp<sup>+</sup>/Neurod6-</i> dopamine neurons are found in the VTA as well as in the ventromedial portion of the SNc, where they project selectively to the dorsomedial striatum. <i>Grp-/Neurod6</i>  <sup>+</sup> dopamine neurons represent a smaller VTA subpopulation, which is preferentially spared in a 6-OHDA model of Parkinson’s disease. Together, our work provides detailed characterization of <i>Neurod6</i> and <i>Grp</i> expression in the midbrain and generates new insights into how these markers define functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations.</p>

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin<br /> Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Manuel   Valero, Liset Menendez   de la Prida<br /> Understanding how the brain represents events is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="159" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Yutaka   Yoshida, Tadashi   Isa<br /> An ability to control dexterous hand movements is considered to parallel the evolutionary development of the corticospinal tract and the appearance of direct connections between corticospinal neurons and motoneurons (the corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway), which developed uniquely in higher primates. However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Robert R   Rozeske, Cyril   Herry<br /> The behavioral repertoire of an organism can be highly diverse, spanning from social to defensive. How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Tara E   Tracy, Li   Gan<br /> The accumulation of pathological tau in the brain is associated with neuronal deterioration and cognitive impairments in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Henrik   Boije, Klas   Kullander<br /> The spinal circuitry governing the undulatory movements of swimming vertebrates consist of excitatory and commissural inhibitory interneurons and motor neurons. This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Haiwen   Chen, Ai-Hui   Tang, Thomas A   Blanpied<br /> Synapses differ markedly in their performance, even amongst those on a single neuron. The mechanisms that drive this functional diversification are of great interest because they enable adaptive behaviors and are targets of pathology. Considerable effort has focused on elucidating mechanisms of plasticity that involve changes to presynaptic release probability and the number of postsynaptic receptors. However, recent work is clarifying that nanoscale organization of the proteins within glutamatergic synapses impacts synapse function. Specifically, active zone scaffold proteins form nanoclusters that define sites of neurotransmitter release, and these sites align transsynaptically with clustered postsynaptic receptors. These nanostructural characteristics raise numerous possibilities for how synaptic plasticity could be expressed. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Adil G   Khan, Sonja B   Hofer<br /> Vision is an active process. What we perceive strongly depends on our actions, intentions and expectations. During visual processing, these internal signals therefore need to be integrated with the visual information from the retina. The mechanisms of how this is achieved by the visual system are still poorly understood. Advances in recording and manipulating neuronal activity in specific cell types and axonal projections together with tools for circuit tracing are beginning to shed light on the neuronal circuit mechanisms of how internal, contextual signals shape sensory representations. Here we review recent work, primarily in mice, that has advanced our understanding of these processes, focusing on contextual signals related to locomotion, behavioural relevance and predictions. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Anne   Bertolotti<br /> Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disorders are devastating neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence in aging populations. Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Emilia   Favuzzi, Beatriz   Rico<br /> The complexity and precision of cortical circuitries is achieved during development due to the exquisite diversity of synapse types that is generated in a highly regulated manner. Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Clinton   Cave, Shanthini   Sockanathan<br /> The embryonic generation of motor neurons is a complex process involving progenitor patterning, fate specification, differentiation, and maturation. Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne<br /> Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Kanika   Bansal, Johan   Nakuci, Sarah Feldt   Muldoon<br /> Many recent efforts in computational modeling of macro-scale brain dynamics have begun to take a data-driven approach by incorporating structural and/or functional information derived from subject data. Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="93" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Takuji   Iwasato, Reha S.   Erzurumlu<br /> Molecular identification of neuronal types and genetic and imaging approaches to characterize their properties reveal morphological, physiological and dynamic aspects of sensory circuit development. Here we focus on the mouse tactile sensory circuitry, with particular emphasis on the main trigeminal pathway that connects the whiskers, the major tactile organ in rodents, to the neocortex. At each level of this pathway, neurogenesis, axonal elongation, pathfinding, target recognition and circuit reorganization including dendritic refinement of cortical layer 4 neurons occur contemporaneously and a multitude of molecular signals are used in differing combinations. We highlight recent advances in development of tactile circuitry and note gaps in our understanding. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Rebecca A   Piskorowski, Vivien   Chevaleyre<br /> The hippocampus is a central region in the coding of spatial, temporal and episodic memory. Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. <br /><br />

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Craig   Blackstone<br /> Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurologic disorders characterized by prominent lower-extremity spasticity, resulting from a length-dependent axonopathy of corticospinal upper motor neurons. They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy. Most notably, these include organelle shaping and biogenesis as well as membrane and cargo trafficking. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier<br /> Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Patrick   Lüningschrör, Michael   Sendtner<br /> Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): David   Robbe<br /> A long-standing hypothesis postulates that the striatum is essential for the concurrent selection of adaptive actions and repression of inappropriate alternatives. Here, classical and recent anatomical and physiological studies are reviewed to show that, in mammals, the striatum can detect discrete task-relevant sensory stimuli and continuously track somatosensory information associated with the generation of simple movements and more complex actions. Rather than contributing to the immediate selection of actions, the striatum may monitor the sensorimotor state of animals by integrating somatosensory information and motor-related signals on a moment-by-moment basis. Such function could be critical for the progressive acquisition or updating of adaptive actions and the emergence of an embodied sense of time. <br /><br />

<p>The application of network techniques to the analysis of neural data has
greatly improved our ability to quantify and describe these rich interacting
systems. Among many important contributions, networks have proven useful in
identifying sets of node pairs that are densely connected and that collectively
support brain function. Yet the restriction to pairwise interactions prevents
us from realizing intrinsic topological features such as cavities within the
interconnection structure that may be just as crucial for proper function. To
detect and quantify these topological features we must turn to methods from
algebraic topology that encode data as a simplicial complex built of sets of
interacting nodes called simplices. On this substrate, we can then use the
relations between simplices and higher-order connectivity to expose cavities
within the complex, thereby summarizing its topological nature. Here we provide
an introduction to persistent homology, a fundamental method from applied
topology that builds a global descriptor of system structure by chronicling the
evolution of cavities as we move through a combinatorial object such as a
weighted network. We detail the underlying mathematics and perform
demonstrative calculations on the mouse structural connectome, electrical and
chemical synapses in \textit{C. elegans}, and genomic interaction data. Finally
we suggest avenues for future work and highlight new advances in mathematics
that appear ready for use in revealing the architecture and function of neural
systems.

<p>What can we learn from a connectome? We constructed a simplified model of the
first two stages of the fly visual system, the lamina and medulla. The
resulting hexagonal lattice convolutional network was trained using
backpropagation through time to perform object tracking in natural scene
videos. Networks initialized with weights from connectome reconstructions
automatically discovered well-known orientation and direction selectivity
properties in T4 neurons and their inputs, while networks initialized at random
did not. Our work is the first demonstration, that knowledge of the connectome
can enable in silico predictions of the functional properties of individual
neurons in a circuit, leading to an understanding of circuit function from
structure alone.

<p>A new quantized ion channel model, called five-anchor model, is proposed

ion channel: the polarity of the protein beam can be changed by electron
transition. With this model, many unique properties and behaviors of ion
channels can be explained, including the real physical working mechanism of
optogenetics, the refractory period in activation of action potential, the
stochastic gating pattern of single ion channel and the nerve conductance
block. Meanwhile, this model is consistent with our previous C-P theory. In
this study, the probability calculus equation is amended and expanded to a more
general scenario, thus called a general probability for differentiation with
the probability calculus in C-P theory.

<p>Among the more important hallmarks of human intelligence, which any
artificial general intelligence (AGI) should have, are the following. 1. It
must be capable of on-line learning, including with single/few trials. 2.
Memories/knowledge must be permanent over lifelong durations, safe from
catastrophic forgetting. Some confabulation, i.e., semantically plausible
retrieval errors, may gradually accumulate over time. 3. The time to both: a)
learn a new item, and b) retrieve the best-matching / most relevant item(s),
i.e., do similarity-based retrieval, must remain constant throughout the
lifetime. 4. The system should never become full: it must remain able to store
new information, i.e., make new permanent memories, throughout very long
lifetimes. No artificial computational system has been shown to have all these
properties. Here, we describe a neuromorphic associative memory model, Sparsey,
which does, in principle, possess them all. We cite prior results supporting
possession of hallmarks 1 and 3 and sketch an argument, hinging on strongly
recursive, hierarchical, part-whole compositional structure of natural data,
that Sparsey also possesses hallmarks 2 and 4.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Emotional distraction may come from the external world and from our mind, as internal distraction. Although external emotional distraction has been extensively investigated, less is known about the mechanisms associated with the impact of internal emotional distraction on cognitive performance, and those involved in coping with such distraction. These issues were investigated using a working memory task with emotional distraction, where recollected unpleasant autobiographical memories served as internal emotional distraction. Emotion regulation was manipulated by instructing participants to focus their attention either on or away from the emotional aspects of their memories. Behaviorally, focusing away from emotion was associated with better working memory performance than focusing on the recollected emotions. Functional MRI data showed reduced response in brain regions associated with the salience network, coupled with greater recruitment of executive prefrontal and memory-related temporoparietal regions, and with increased frontoparietal connectivity, when subjects focused on nonemotional contextual details of their memories. Finally, temporal dissociations were also identified between regions involved in self-referential (showing faster responses) versus context-related processing (showing delayed responses). These findings demonstrate that focused attention is an effective regulation strategy in coping with internal distraction, and are relevant for understanding clinical conditions where coping with distressing memories is dysfunctional.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/347658v1?rss=1">Default mode and primary visual network coupling is associated with increased mind-wandering frequency in Parkinson\'s disease with visual hallucinations</a></h4>

Background: An imbalance between top-down expectations and incoming sensory information is implicated in the genesis of hallucinations across neuropsychiatric disorders. In Parkinson's disease (PD) with visual hallucinations, over-activity in the default mode network (DMN) is a hypothesised source of excessive top-down influence that can dominate visual perception. Methods: In 38 PD patients (18 with hallucinations; 20 without) and 20 age-matched controls, we administered a validated thought-sampling task to establish whether PD hallucinators experienced increased mind-wandering - a form of spontaneous thought strongly associated with DMN activity. Neural correlates of the behavioural differences in mind-wandering frequency were established via resting-state functional connectivity and voxel-based morphometry analyses. Results: PD hallucinators (PD+VH) exhibited significantly higher mind-wandering frequencies compared to non-hallucinators (PD-VH), who showed reduced levels relative to controls. Inter-network connectivity and seed-to-voxel analyses confirmed increased mind-wandering in PD+VH was associated with greater coupling between the DMN and primary visual cortex (V1). In contrast, reduced mind-wandering was associated with grey matter loss in the left posterior parietal cortex in PD-VH. Conclusions: Elevated mind-wandering associated with DMN-visual network coupling emerged as a distinguishing feature of PD hallucinators. We propose that increased mind-wandering reflects excessive spontaneous thought and mental imagery, which can furnish the content of visual hallucinations. DMN-V1 coupling may provide a neural substrate by which regions of the DMN exert disproportionate influence over ongoing visual perception. Our findings refine current models of visual hallucinations by identifying a specific cognitive feature and neural substrate consistent with the excessive top-down influences over perception that lead to hallucinations.

Neurons recorded in behaving animals often do not discernibly respond to sensory input and are not overtly task-modulated. These nominally non-responsive neurons are difficult to interpret and are typically neglected from analysis, confounding attempts to connect neural activity to perception and behavior. Here we describe a trial-by-trial, spike-timing-based algorithm to reveal the hidden coding capacities of these neurons in auditory and frontal cortex of behaving rats. Responsive and nominally non-responsive cells contained significant information about sensory stimuli and behavioral decisions, and network modeling indicated that nominally non-responsive cells are important for task performance. Sensory input was more accurately represented in frontal cortex than auditory cortex, via ensembles of nominally non-responsive cells coordinating the behavioral meaning of spike timings on correct but not error trials. This unbiased approach allows the contribution of all recorded neurons - particularly those without obvious task-modulation - to be assessed for behavioral relevance on single trials.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/347427v1?rss=1">Aberrant Information Transfer Interferes with Functional Axon Regeneration</a></h4>

Functional axon regeneration requires regenerating neurons to restore appropriate synaptic connectivity and circuit function. To model this process, we developed a single-neuron assay in C. elegans that links axon regeneration and synapse reformation with recovery of relevant behavior. After axon injury to the DA9 neuron, regeneration restores synapses to their pre-injury location. Surprisingly, presynapses also accumulate in the dendrite. Both axonal and dendritic synapses are functional. Dendritic synapses result in information misrouting that suppresses behavioral recovery. Formation of dendritic synapses is specifically dependent on dynein-mediated transport and jnk-1. However, even when information transfer is corrected, axonal synapses fail to adequately transmit information. Our study reveals unexpected plasticity during functional regeneration. Regeneration of the axon is not sufficient for the reformation of correct neuronal circuits after injury. Rather, synapse reformation and function are also key variables, and manipulation of circuit reformation improves behavioral recovery.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/347419v1?rss=1">Biological motion as an innate perceptual mechanism driving social affiliation</a></h4>

Collective behavior, such as shoaling in teleost fish, is driven by the perceptual recognition of conspecific animals. Because social interactions are mutual, it has been difficult to disentangle the exact sensory cues that trigger affiliation in the first place from those that are emitted by receptive and responsive shoal mates. Here we overcome this challenge in a virtual reality assay in zebrafish. We discovered that simple visual features of conspecific biological motion provide an irresistible shoaling cue. Individual juvenile fish interact with circular black dots projected onto a screen, to the same extent as they do with real conspecifics, provided these virtual objects mimic the characteristic kinetics of zebrafish swim bouts. Other naturalistic cues previously implicated in shoaling, such as fish-like shape, pigmentation pattern, or non-visual sensory modalities are not required. During growth, the animals' stimulus preferences shift gradually, matching self-like kinetics, even in fish raised in isolation. Virtual group interactions and our multi-agent model implementation of this perceptual mechanism demonstrate sufficiency of kinetic cues to drive assortative shoaling, a phenomenon commonly observed in field studies. Coordinated behavior can emerge from autonomous interactions, such as collective odor avoidance in Drosophila, or from reciprocal interactions, such as the codified turn-taking in wren duet singing. We found that individual zebrafish shoal autonomously without evidence for a reciprocal choreography. Our results reveal individual-level, innate perceptual rules of engagement in mutual affiliation and provide experimental access to the neural mechanisms of social recognition.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/347260v1?rss=1">Representational structure or task structure? Bias in neural representational similarity analysis and a Bayesian method for reducing bias</a></h4>

The activity of neural populations in the brains of humans and animals can exhibit vastly different spatial patterns when faced with different tasks or environmental stimuli. The degree of similarity between these neural activity patterns in response to different events is used to characterize the representational structure of cognitive states in a neural population. The dominant methods of investigating this similarity structure first estimate neural activity patterns from noisy neural imaging data using linear regression, and then examine the similarity between the estimated patterns. Here, we show that this approach introduces spurious bias structure in the resulting similarity matrix, in particular when applied to fMRI data. This problem is especially severe when the signal-to-noise ratio is low and in cases where experimental conditions cannot be fully randomized in a task. We propose Bayesian Representational Similarity Analysis (BRSA), an alternative method for computing representational similarity, in which we treat the covariance structure of neural activity patterns as a hyper-parameter in a generative model of the neural data. By marginalizing over the unknown activity patterns, we can directly estimate this covariance structure from imaging data. This method offers significant reductions in bias and allows estimation of neural representational similarity with previously unattained levels of precision at low signal-to-noise ratio. The probabilistic framework allows for jointly analyzing data from a group of participants. The method can also simultaneously estimate a signal-to-noise ratio map that shows where the learned representational structure is supported more strongly. Both this map and the learned covariance matrix can be used as a structured prior for maximum a posteriori estimation of neural activity patterns, which can be further used for fMRI decoding. We make our tool freely available in Brain Imaging Analysis Kit (BrainIAK).

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/347252v1?rss=1">Spike burst-pause dynamics of Purkinje cells regulate sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

Cerebellar Purkinje cells mediate accurate eye movement coordination. However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of targeted medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation.

Chronic cocaine and alcohol use impart significant stress on biological and cognitive systems, resulting in changes consistent with an allostatic load model of neurocognitive impairment. The present study measured potential markers of allostatic load in individuals with comorbid cocaine/alcohol use disorders (CUD/AUD) and control subjects. Measures of brain white matter (WM) integrity, telomere length, and impulsivity/attentional bias were obtained. WM integrity (CUD/AUD only) was indexed by diffusion tensor imaging metrics, including radial diffusivity (RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). Telomere length was indexed by T/S ratio. Impulsivity and attentional bias to drug cues were measured via eye-tracking, and were also modeled using the Hierarchical Diffusion Drift Model (HDDM). Average whole-brain RD and FA were associated with years of cocaine use (R2 = 0.56 and 0.51, both p &lt; .005) but not years of alcohol use. CUD/AUD subjects showed more anti-saccade errors (p &lt; .01), greater attentional bias scores (p &lt; .001), and higher HDDM drift rates on cocaine-cue trials (Bayesian probability CUD/AUD &gt; control = p &gt; 0.99). Telomere length was shorter in CUD/AUD, but the difference was not statistically significant. Within the CUD/AUD group, exploratory regression using an elastic-net model determined that more years of cocaine use, , older age, larger HDDM drift rate differences and shorter telomere length were all predictive of white matter integrity as measured by RD (model R2 = 0.79). Collectively, the results provide modest support linking CUD/AUD to putative markers of allostatic load.

This paper presents a study regarding group behavior in a controlled experiment focused on differences in an important attribute that vary across cultures - the personal spaces - in two Countries: Brazil and Germany. In order to coherently compare Germany and Brazil evolutions with same population applying same task, we performed the pedestrian Fundamental Diagram experiment in Brazil, as performed in Germany. We use CNNs to detect and track people in video sequences. With this data, we use Voronoi Diagrams to find out the neighbor relation among people and then compute the walking distances to find out the personal spaces. Based on personal spaces analyses, we found out that people behavior is more similar in high dense populations. So, we focused our study on cultural differences between the two Countries in low and medium densities. Results indicate that personal space analyses can be a relevant feature in order to understand cultural aspects in video sequences.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/347054v1?rss=1">Metastable brain waves</a></h4>

Traveling patterns of neuronal activity -- brain waves -- have been observed across a breadth of neuronal recordings, states of awareness, and species, but their emergence in the human brain lacks a firm understanding. Here, we analyze the complex nonlinear dynamics that emerge from modeling large-scale spontaneous neural activity on a whole-brain network derived from human tractography. We find a rich array of three-dimensional wave patterns, including traveling waves, spiral waves, sources, and sinks. These patterns are metastable, such that system visits multiple spatiotemporal wave patterns in sequence. Transitions between metastable states correspond to reconfigurations of an underlying phase flow, characterized by complex nonlinear instabilities. These metastable dynamics accord with empirical data from multiple imaging modalities, including electrical waves in cortical tissue, the presence of sequential spatiotemporal patterns in resting state MEG data, and large-scale waves in human electrocorticography. By moving the study of functional networks from a static to an inherently dynamic frame, our work unifies apparently diverse phenomena across functional neuroimaging modalities and makes specific predictions for further experimentation.

Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons contribute to reinforcement learning by signaling prediction error, the difference between actual and predicted outcome, but it remains unclear how error is computed. Here we identify in songbirds that a VTA-projecting ventral basal ganglia (vBG) region outside the classic song system is required for song learning and sends prediction error signals to VTA. vBG neurons, including identified VTA-projectors, recorded during singing heterogeneously encoded song timing, predicted error, actual auditory error, and the difference between the two (prediction error). Viral tracing revealed novel inputs to vBG from auditory and vocal motor thalamus, auditory and vocal motor cortex, and VTA. Our findings reveal a classic actor-critic circuit motif, previously unrecognized in the songbird BG, in which a ventral critic learns the prediction component of a prediction error signal that is relayed by dopaminergic midbrain to a dorsal actor (the vocal motor BG nucleus Area X). Thus a circuit motif with established utility in foraging for reward in mammals is ancestral and can be repurposed for computing predicted performance error during motor sequence learning.

The main olfactory bulb (MOB) is differentiated into subregions based on their innervation by molecularly distinct chemosensory neurons. For example, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that employ a cGMP-mediated transduction cascade (guanylyl-cyclase D-expressing (GC-D+) OSNs of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and chemosensory neurons of the Grueneberg ganglion (GGNs)) project to distinct groups of necklace glomeruli encircling the caudal MOB. To better understand the unique functionality and neural circuitry of the necklace glomeruli and their associated sensory neurons, we sought to identify additional molecular markers that would differentiate GC-D+ OSNs and GGNs as well as their target glomeruli. We found in mouse that GC-D+ OSNs, but not other MOE OSNs or GGNs, express the neuropeptide CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript). Both GC-D+ OSNs and GGNs, but not other MOE OSNs, express the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase Pde1a, which is immunolocalized throughout the dendrites, somata and axons of these neurons. Stronger Pde1a immunolabeling in necklace glomeruli innervated by GGNs than in those innervated by GC-D+ OSNs suggests either greater Pde1a expression in individual GGNs than in GC-D+ OSNs or a difference in sensory neuron innervation density between the two types of necklace glomeruli. Together, the unique molecular signatures of GC-D+ OSNs, GGNs and their MOB targets offer important tools for understanding the processing of chemosensory information by olfactory subsystems associated with the necklace glomeruli.

When at rest, our mind wanders from thought to thought in distinct mental states, portrayed by William James as the brief flights and perchings of a bird. Despite the marked importance of ongoing mental processes, in cognitive neuroscience and clinical contexts alike, it is challenging to capture and relate these states to specific cognitive contents. In this work, we employed ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to study the ongoing thoughts of participants instructed to retrieve self-relevant past episodes for periods of 20s. These task-initiated, participant-driven activity patterns were compared to a distinct condition where participants performed serial mental arithmetic operations, thereby shifting from self-related to self-unrelated thoughts. BOLD activity mapping revealed selective activity changes across conditions, namely in temporal, parietal and occipital areas ("posterior hot zone"), evincing their role in integrating the re-experienced past events into conscious representations during memory retrieval. Functional connectivity analysis showed that these regions were organized in two major subparts of the default mode network, previously associated to "scene-reconstruction" and "self-experience" subsystems. EEG microstate analysis allowed studying these brief participant-driven thoughts in the millisecond range. While the microstate topographies were found stable across conditions, the occurrence and duration of specific microstates were selectively modulated. EEG source analysis revealed similar spatial distributions between the sources of these microstates and the regions identified with fMRI. These findings imply a functional link between BOLD activity changes in regions related to a certain mental activity and the temporal dynamics of mentation, and support growing evidence that specific fMRI networks can be captured with EEG as repeatedly occurring, integrated brief periods of synchronized neuronal activity, lasting only fractions of seconds.

Recent advances in neuro-imaging allowed big brain-initiatives and consortia to create vast resources of brain data that can be mined by researchers for their individual projects. Exploring the relationship between genes, brain circuitry, and behavior is one of key elements of neuroscience research. This requires fusion of spatial connectivity data at varying scales, such as whole brain correlated gene expression, structural and functional connectivity. With ever-increasing resolution, those exceed the past state-of-the art in several orders of magnitude in size and complexity. Current analytical workflows in neuroscience involve time-consuming manual aggregation of the data and only sparsely incorporate spatial context to operate continuously on multiple scales. Incorporating techniques for handling big connectivity data is therefore a necessity. We propose a data structure to explore heterogeneous neurobiological connectivity data for integrated visual analytics workflows. Aggregation Queries, i.e. the aggregated connectivity from, to or between brain areas allow experts the comparison of multimodal networks residing at different scales, or levels of hierarchically organized anatomical atlases. Executed on-demand on volumetric gene expression and connectivity data, they enable an interactive dissection of networks, with billions of edges, in real-time, and based on their spatial context. The data structure is optimized to be accessed directly from the hard disk, since connectivity of large-scale networks typically exceed the memory size of current consumer level PCs. This allows experts to embed and explore their own experimental data in the framework of public data resources without large-scale infrastructure. Our novel data structure outperforms state-of-the-art graph engines in retrieving connectivity of local brain areas experimentally. We demonstrate the application of our approach for neuroscience by analyzing fear-related functional neuroanatomy in mice. Further, we show its versatility by comparing multimodal brain networks linked to autism. Importantly, we achieve cross-species congruence in retrieving human psychiatric traits networks, which facilitates selection of neural substrates to be further studied in mouse models.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/346213v1?rss=1">Direct evidence for prediction signals in frontal cortex independent of prediction error</a></h4>

Predictive coding (PC) has been suggested as one of the main mechanisms used by brains to interact with complex environments. PC theories posit top-down prediction signals, which are compared with actual outcomes, yielding in turn prediction-error signals, which are used, bottom-up, to modify the ensuing predictions. However, disentangling prediction from prediction-error signals has been challenging. Critically, while many studies found indirect evidence for predictive coding in the form of prediction-error signals, direct evidence for the prediction signal is mostly lacking. Here we provide clear evidence, obtained from intracranial cortical recordings in human surgical patients, that the human lateral prefrontal cortex generates prediction signals while anticipating an event. Patients listened to task-irrelevant sequences of repetitive tones including infrequent predictable or unpredictable pitch deviants. The amplitude of high frequency broadband (HFB) neural activity was decreased prior to the onset of expected relative to unexpected deviants in the frontal cortex only, and its amplitude was sensitive to the increasing likelihood of deviants following longer trains of standards in the unpredictable condition. Single trial HFB amplitudes predicted deviations and correlated with post-stimulus response to deviations. These results provide direct evidence for frontal cortex prediction signals independent of prediction-error signals.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/345991v1?rss=1">Common recruitment of angular gyrus in episodic autobiographical memory and bodily self-consciousness</a></h4>

Parietal cortex and adjacent parts of the temporal cortex have recently been involved in bodily self-consciousness (BSC) and in episodic autobiographical memory (EAM). However, the neuroanatomical relationship between both fundamental aspects of self-related processing remains currently unexplored. Here we investigated whether regions in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) that have been involved in BSC (self-location and first-person perspective) are also activate in studies investigating autobiographical memory. To examine this relation, we performed a meta-analytical study based on functional neuroimaging studies on EAM and SAM and compared them with BSC activations. We report an anatomical overlap bilaterally in the angular gyrus (AG), but not in other parietal or temporal lobe structures between BSC and EAM. Moreover, there was no overlap between BSC and SAM, suggesting that the bilateral AG is a key structure for the conscious re-experiencing of past life episodes (EAM) and the conscious on-line experience of being located and experiencing the world in first-person (BSC).

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/345645v1?rss=1">Accuracy and reliability of PBR28 specific binding estimated without the use of a reference region</a></h4>

[11C]PBR28 is a positron emission tomography radioligand used to estimate the expression of 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO). TSPO is expressed on glial cells and can function as a marker for immune activation. Since TSPO is expressed throughout the brain, no true reference re- gion exists. For this reason, an arterial input function is required for accurate quantification of [11C]PBR28 binding and the most common outcome measure is the total distribution volume (VT). Notably, VT reflects both specific binding (VS) and non-displaceable binding (VND). Therefore, estimates of specific binding, such as binding potentials (e.g., BPND) and specific distribution vol- ume (VS) should theoretically be more sensitive to underlying differences in TSPO expression. It is unknown, however, if unbiased and accurate estimates of these measures are obtainable for [11 C]PBR28. The Simultaneous Estimation (SIME) method uses time-activity-curves from multiple brain regions with the aim to obtain a brain-wide estimate of VND, which can subsequently be used to improve the estimation of BPND and VS. In this study we evaluated the accuracy of SIME- derived VND, and the reliability of resulting estimates of specific binding for [11C]PBR28, using a combination of simulation experiments and in vivo studies in healthy humans. The simulation experiments showed that VND values estimated using SIME were both precise and accurate. Data from a pharmacological competition challenge showed that SIME provided VND values that were on average 19% lower than those obtained using the Lassen plot, but similar to values obtained using the Likelihood-Estimation of Occupancy technique. Test-retest data showed that SIME-derived VS values exhibited good reliability and precision, while larger vari- ability was observed in SIME-derived BPND values. The results support the use of SIME for quantifying specific binding of [11C]PB28, and suggest that VS can be used in preference to, or as a complement to the conventional outcome measure VT. Additional studies in patient cohorts are warranted.

Neuroimaging biomarkers show promise for improving precision diagnosis and prognosis after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), but none has yet been adopted in routine clinical practice. Biophysical modeling of multishell diffusion MRI, using the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) framework, may improve upon conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in revealing subtle patterns of underlying white matter microstructural pathology, such as diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and neuroinflammation, that are important for detecting mTBI and determining patient outcome. With a cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we assessed structural MRI, DTI and NODDI in 40 mTBI patients at 2 weeks and 6 months after injury and 14 matched control participants with orthopedic trauma but not suffering from mTBI at 2 weeks. Self-reported and performance-based cognitive measures assessing postconcussive symptoms, memory, executive functions and processing speed were investigated in post-acute and chronic phase after injury for the mTBI subjects. Machine learning analysis was used to identify mTBI patients with the best neuropsychological improvement over time and relate this outcome to DTI and NODDI biomarkers. In the cross-sectional comparison with the trauma control group at 2 weeks post-injury, mTBI patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) on DTI mainly in anterior tracts that corresponded to white matter regions of elevated free water fraction (FISO) on NODDI, signifying vasogenic edema. Patients showed decreases from 2 weeks to 6 months in white matter neurite density on NODDI, predominantly in posterior tracts. No significant longitudinal changes in DTI metrics were observed. The machine learning analysis divided the mTBI patients into two groups based on their recovery. Voxel-wise group comparison revealed associations between white matter orientation dispersion index (ODI) and FISO with degree and trajectory of improvement within the mTBI group. In conclusion, white matter FA and MD alterations early after mTBI might reflect vasogenic edema, as shown by elevated free water on NODDI. Longer-term declines in neurite density on NODDI suggest progressive axonal degeneration due to DAI, especially in tracts known to be integral to the structural connectome. Overall, these results show that the NODDI parameters appear to be more sensitive to longitudinal changes than DTI metrics. Thus, NODDI merits further study in larger cohorts for mTBI diagnosis, prognosis and treatment monitoring.

<p>by Alexander Borst</p>

Seeing the direction of motion is essential for survival of all sighted animals. Consequently, nerve cells that respond to visual stimuli moving in one but not in the opposite direction, so-called ‘direction-selective’ neurons, are found abundantly. In general, direction selectivity can arise by either signal amplification for stimuli moving in the cell’s preferred direction (‘preferred direction enhancement’), signal suppression for stimuli moving along the opposite direction (‘null direction suppression’), or a combination of both. While signal suppression can be readily implemented in biophysical terms by a hyperpolarization followed by a rectification corresponding to the nonlinear voltage-dependence of the Calcium channel, the biophysical mechanism for signal amplification has remained unclear so far. Taking inspiration from the fly, I analyze a neural circuit where a direction-selective ON-cell receives inhibitory input from an OFF cell on the preferred side of the dendrite, while excitatory ON-cells contact the dendrite centrally. This way, an ON edge moving along the cell’s preferred direction suppresses the inhibitory input, leading to a release from inhibition in the postsynaptic cell. The benefit of such a two-fold signal inversion lies in the resulting increase of the postsynaptic cell’s input resistance, amplifying its response to a subsequent excitatory input signal even with a passive dendrite, i.e. without voltage-gated ion channels. A motion detector implementing this mechanism together with null direction suppression shows a high degree of direction selectivity over a large range of temporal frequency, narrow directional tuning, and a large signal-to-noise ratio.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0wnUcwMjsc4" width="1" />

<p>by Sergio Luengo-Sanchez, Isabel Fernaud-Espinosa, Concha Bielza, Ruth Benavides-Piccione, Pedro Larrañaga, Javier DeFelipe</p>

The dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons are the targets of most excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex. They have a wide variety of morphologies, and their morphology appears to be critical from the functional point of view. To further characterize dendritic spine geometry, we used in this paper over 7,000 individually 3D reconstructed dendritic spines from human cortical pyramidal neurons to group dendritic spines using model-based clustering. This approach uncovered six separate groups of human dendritic spines. To better understand the differences between these groups, the discriminative characteristics of each group were identified as a set of rules. Model-based clustering was also useful for simulating accurate 3D virtual representations of spines that matched the morphological definitions of each cluster. This mathematical approach could provide a useful tool for theoretical predictions on the functional features of human pyramidal neurons based on the morphology of dendritic spines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wlClIi7WzLw" width="1" />

A challenge in studying diverse multi-copy gene families is deciphering distinct functional types within immense sequence variation. Functional changes can in some cases be tracked through the evolutionary history of a gene family; however phylogenetic approaches are not possible in cases where gene families diversify primarily by recombination. We take a network theoretical approach to functionally classify the highly recombining <i>var</i> antigenic gene family of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. We sample <i>var</i> DBLα sequence types from a local population in Ghana, and classify 9,276 of these variants into just 48 functional types. Our approach is to first decompose each sequence type into its constituent, recombining parts; we then use a stochastic block model to identify functional groups among the parts; finally, we classify the sequence types based on which functional groups they contain. This method for functional classification does not rely on an inferred phylogenetic history, nor does it rely on inferring function based on conserved sequence features. Instead, it infers functional similarity among recombining parts based on the sharing of similar co-occurrence interactions with other parts. This method can therefore group sequences that have undetectable sequence homology or even distinct origination. Describing these 48 <i>var</i> functional types allows us to simplify the antigenic diversity within our dataset by over two orders of magnitude. We consider how the <i>var</i> functional types are distributed in isolates, and find a nonrandom pattern reflecting that common <i>var</i> functional types are non-randomly distinct from one another in terms of their functional composition. The coarse-graining of <i>var</i> gene diversity into biologically meaningful functional groups has important implications for understanding the disease ecology and evolution of this system, as well as for designing effective epidemiological monitoring and intervention.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bJL1bWAPlbo" width="1" />

<p>Two factors play important roles in shaping perception: the allocation of selective attention to behaviorally relevant sensory features, and prior expectations about regularities in the environment. Signal detection theory proposes distinct roles of attention and expectation on decision-making such that attention modulates early sensory processing, whereas expectation influences the selection and execution of motor responses. Challenging this classic framework, recent studies suggest that expectations about sensory regularities enhance the encoding and accumulation of sensory evidence during decision-making. However, it is possible, that these findings reflect well documented attentional modulations in visual cortex. Here, we tested this framework in a group of male and female human participants by examining how expectations about stimulus features (orientation and color) and expectations about motor responses impacted electroencephalography (EEG) markers of early sensory processing and the accumulation of sensory evidence during decision-making (the early visual negative potential and the centro-parietal positive potential, respectively). We first demonstrate that these markers are sensitive to changes in the amount of sensory evidence in the display. Then we show, counter to recent findings, that neither marker is modulated by either feature or motor expectations, despite a robust effect of expectations on behavior. Instead, violating expectations about likely sensory features and motor responses impacts posterior alpha and frontal theta oscillations, signals thought to index overall processing time and cognitive conflict. These findings are inconsistent with recent theoretical accounts and suggest instead that expectations primarily influence decisions by modulating post-perceptual stages of information processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Expectations about likely features or motor responses play an important role in shaping behavior. Classic theoretical frameworks posit that expectations modulate decision-making by biasing late stages of decision-making including the selection and execution of motor responses. In contrast, recent accounts suggest that expectations also modulate decisions by improving the quality of early sensory processing. However, these effects could instead reflect the influence of selective attention. Here we examine the effect of expectations about sensory features and motor responses on a set of electroencephalography (EEG) markers that index early sensory processing and later post-perceptual processing. Counter to recent empirical results, expectations have little effect on early sensory processing but instead modulate EEG markers of time-on-task and cognitive conflict.</p>

<p>Basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops mediate all motor behavior, yet little detail is known about the role of basal ganglia nuclei in speech production. Using intracranial recording during deep brain stimulation surgery in humans with Parkinson's disease, we tested the hypothesis that the firing rate of subthalamic nucleus neurons is modulated in sync with motor execution aspects of speech. Nearly half of 79 unit recordings exhibited firing-rate modulation during a syllable reading task across 12 subjects (male and female). Trial-to-trial timing of changes in subthalamic neuronal activity, relative to cue onset versus production onset, revealed that locking to cue presentation was associated more with units that decreased firing rate, whereas locking to speech onset was associated more with units that increased firing rate. These unique data indicate that subthalamic activity is dynamic during the production of speech, reflecting temporally-dependent inhibition and excitation of separate populations of subthalamic neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The basal ganglia are widely assumed to participate in speech production, yet no prior studies have reported detailed examination of speech-related activity in basal ganglia nuclei. Using microelectrode recordings from the subthalamic nucleus during a single-syllable reading task, in awake humans undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation surgery, we show that the firing rate of subthalamic nucleus neurons is modulated in response to motor execution aspects of speech. These results are the first to establish a role for subthalamic nucleus neurons in encoding of aspects of speech production, and they lay the groundwork for launching a modern subfield to explore basal ganglia function in human speech.</p>

<p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) plays an integral role in patterning the sympathetic nervous system during development. Initially, p75NTR is expressed at low levels as sympathetic axons project toward their targets, which enables neurotrophin-3 (NT3) to activate TrkA receptors and promote growth. Upon reaching nerve growth factor (NGF) producing tissues, p75NTR is upregulated, resulting in formation of TrkA-p75 complexes, which are high-affinity binding sites selective for NGF, thereby blunting NT3 signaling. The level of p75NTR expressed on the neuron surface is instrumental in regulating trophic factor response; however, the mechanisms by which p75NTR expression is regulated are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, translation independent increase in surface expression of p75NTR in response to NGF in rat sympathetic neurons. p75NTR was mobilized to the neuron surface from GGA3-postitive vesicles through activation of the GTPase Arf6, which was stimulated by NGF, but not NT3 binding to TrkA. Arf6 activation required PI3 kinase activity and was prevented by an inhibitor of the cytohesin family of Arf6 guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Overexpression of a constitutively active Arf6 mutant (Q67L) was sufficient to significantly increase surface expression of p75NTR even in the absence of NGF. Functionally, expression of active Arf6 markedly attenuated the ability of NT3 to promote neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, whereas the NGF response was unaltered. These data suggest that NGF activation of Arf6 through TrkA is critical for the increase in p75NTR surface expression that enables the switch in neurotrophin responsiveness during development in the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> p75NTR is instrumental in the regulation of neuronal survival and apoptosis during development and is also implicated as a contributor to aberrant neurodegeneration in numerous conditions. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate p75NTR surface availability may provide insight into how and why neurodegenerative processes manifest and reveal new therapeutic targets. Results from this study indicate a novel mechanism by which p75NTR can be rapidly shuttled to the cell surface from existing intracellular pools and explores a unique pathway by which NGF regulates the sympathetic innervation of target tissues, which has profound consequences for the function of these organs.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5596?rss=1">Polyamine Modulation of Anticonvulsant Drug Response: A Potential Mechanism Contributing to Pharmacoresistance in Chronic Epilepsy</a></h4>

<p>Despite the development of numerous novel anticonvulsant drugs, ~30% of epilepsy patients remain refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Many established and novel AEDs reduce hyperexcitability via voltage- and use-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. For the widely used anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ), use-dependent block of Na<sup>+</sup> channels is significantly reduced both in experimental and human epilepsy. However, the molecular underpinnings of this potential cellular mechanism for pharmacoresistance have remained enigmatic.</p>
<p>Here, we describe the mechanism that leads to the emergence of CBZ-resistant Na<sup>+</sup> channels. We focused on the endogenous polyamine system, which powerfully modulates Na<sup>+</sup> channels in a use-dependent manner. We had shown previously that the intracellular polyamine spermine is reduced in chronic epilepsy, resulting in increased persistent Na<sup>+</sup> currents. Because spermine and CBZ both bind use-dependently in spatial proximity within the Na<sup>+</sup> channel pore, we hypothesized that spermine loss might also be related to diminished CBZ response. Using the pilocarpine model of refractory epilepsy in male rats and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we first replicated the reduction of use-dependent block by CBZ in chronically epileptic animals. We then substituted intracellular spermine via the patch pipette in different concentrations. Under these conditions, we found that exogenous spermine significantly rescues use-dependent block of Na<sup>+</sup> channels by CBZ. These findings indicate that an unexpected modulatory mechanism, depletion of intracellular polyamines, leads both to increased persistent Na<sup>+</sup> currents and to diminished CBZ sensitivity of Na<sup>+</sup> channels. These findings could lead to novel strategies for overcoming pharmacoresistant epilepsy that target the polyamine system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pharmacoresistant epilepsy affects ~18 million people worldwide, and intense efforts have therefore been undertaken to uncover the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. One of the key known candidate mechanisms of pharmacoresistance has been a loss of use-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channel block by the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ), both in human and experimental epilepsies. Despite intense scrutiny, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been elucidated. We now show that a loss of intracellular spermine in chronic epilepsy is a major causative factor leading to the development of CBZ-resistant Na<sup>+</sup> currents. This finding can be exploited both for the screening of anticonvulsants in expression systems, and for novel strategies to overcome pharmacoresistance that target the polyamine system.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5584?rss=1">Prostaglandin Transporter OATP2A1/SLCO2A1 Is Essential for Body Temperature Regulation during Fever</a></h4>

<p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the hypothalamus is a principal mediator of the febrile response. However, the role of organic anion transporting polypeptide 2A1 (OATP2A1/<i>SLCO2A1</i>), a prostaglandin transporter, in facilitating this response is unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of <i>Slco2a1</i> deficiency on the body core temperature (Tc) and on the PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in hypothalamus interstitial fluid (<i>C</i><sub>isf</sub>) and CSF (<i>C</i><sub>csf</sub>) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 μg/kg, i.p.)-treated mice of both sexes. <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice did not develop a febrile response. <i>C</i><sub>csf</sub> was increased in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice, and <i>C</i><sub>csf</sub> of <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice was well maintained at 5 h after LPS injection (1160 pg/ml) compared with <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice (316 pg/ml). A microdialysis study revealed that <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub> peaked at 2 h after LPS injection in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice (841 pg/ml), whereas the increase in <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub> was negligible in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice. The PGE<sub>2</sub> plasma concentration in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice (201 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice (54 pg/ml) at 1 h after LPS injection, whereas the two groups showed similar PGE<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the hypothalamus. Strong Oatp2a1 immunoreactivity was observed in F4/80-positive microglia and perivascular cells and in brain capillary endothelial cells. The changes in Tc and <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub> seen in LPS-injected <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice were partially attenuated in monocyte-/macrophage-specific <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>–/–</sup> (<i>Slco2a1</i><sup>Fl/Fl</sup>/<i>LysM</i><sup>Cre/+</sup>) mice. Thus, OATP2A1 facilitates the LPS-induced febrile response by maintaining a high level of <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub>, possibly by regulating PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from F4/80-positive glial cells and/or facilitating PGE<sub>2</sub> transport across the blood–brain barrier. These findings suggest that OATP2A1 is a useful therapeutic target for neuroinflammation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fever is a physiological response caused by pyrogen-induced release of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the hypothalamus, which plays a central role in regulating the set-point of body temperature. However, it is unclear whether the prostaglandin transporter OATP2A1/<i>SLCO2A1</i> is involved in this response. We show here that LPS-induced fever is associated with increased PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in hypothalamus interstitial fluid (<i>C</i><sub>isf</sub>), but not in CSF (<i>C</i><sub>csf</sub>), by means of a microdialysis study in global <i>Slco2a1</i>-knock-out mice and monocyte-/macrophage-specific <i>Slco2a1</i>-knock-out mice. The results suggest that OATP2A1 serves as a regulator of <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub> in F4/80-positive glial cells. OATP2A1 was detected immunohistochemically in brain capillary endothelial cells and, therefore, may also play a role in PGE<sub>2</sub> transport across the blood–brain barrier.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5567?rss=1">A Central Extended Amygdala Circuit That Modulates Anxiety</a></h4>

<p>Both the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) have been implicated in maladaptive anxiety characteristics of anxiety disorders. However, the underlying circuit and cellular mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we show that mice with <i>Erbb4</i> gene deficiency in somatostatin-expressing (SOM<sup>+</sup>) neurons exhibit heightened anxiety as measured in the elevated plus maze test and the open field test, two assays commonly used to assess anxiety-related behaviors in rodents. Using a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, genetic, and pharmacological techniques, we demonstrate that the abnormal anxiety in the mutant mice is caused by enhanced excitatory synaptic inputs onto SOM<sup>+</sup> neurons in the central amygdala (CeA), and the resulting reduction in inhibition onto downstream SOM<sup>+</sup> neurons in the BNST. Notably, our results indicate that an increase in dynorphin signaling in SOM<sup>+</sup> CeA neurons mediates the paradoxical reduction in inhibition onto SOM<sup>+</sup> BNST neurons, and that the consequent enhanced activity of SOM<sup>+</sup> BNST neurons is both necessary for and sufficient to drive the elevated anxiety. Finally, we show that the elevated anxiety and the associated synaptic dysfunctions and increased dynorphin signaling in the CeA–BNST circuit of the <i>Erbb4</i> mutant mice can be recapitulated by stress in wild-type mice. Together, our results unravel previously unknown circuit and cellular processes in the central extended amygdala that can cause maladaptive anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The central extended amygdala has been implicated in anxiety-related behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we found that somatostatin-expressing neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) controls anxiety through modulation of the stria terminalis, a process that is mediated by an increase in dynorphin signaling in the CeA. Our results reveal circuit and cellular dysfunctions that may account for maladaptive anxiety.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5551?rss=1">A Critical Neurodevelopmental Role for L-Type Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels in Neurite Extension and Radial Migration</a></h4>

<p>Despite many association studies linking gene polymorphisms and mutations of L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the roles of specific L-type VGCC during brain development remain unclear. Calcium signaling has been shown to be essential for neurodevelopmental processes such as sculpting of neurites, functional wiring, and fine tuning of growing networks. To investigate this relationship, we performed submembraneous calcium imaging using a membrane-tethered genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) Lck-G-CaMP7. We successfully recorded <i>s</i>pontaneous regenerative calcium transients (SRCaTs) in developing mouse excitatory cortical neurons prepared from both sexes before synapse formation. SRCaTs originated locally in immature neurites independently of somatic calcium rises and were significantly more elevated in the axons than in dendrites. SRCaTs were not blocked by tetrodoxin, a Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker, but were strongly inhibited by hyperpolarization, suggesting a voltage-dependent source. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations revealed the critical importance of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (CACNA1C) pore-forming subunit of L-type VGCCs, which were indeed expressed in immature mouse brains. Consistently, knocking out Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 resulted in significant alterations of neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, expression of a gain-of-function Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 mutant found in Timothy syndrome, an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder exhibiting syndromic autism, resulted in impaired radial migration of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons, whereas postnatal abrogation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 enhancement could rescue cortical malformation. Together, these lines of evidence suggest a critical role for spontaneous opening of L-type VGCCs in neural development and corticogenesis and indicate that L-type VGCCs might constitute a perinatal therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric calciochannelopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite many association studies linking gene polymorphisms and mutations of L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the roles of specific L-type VGCCs during brain development remain unclear. We here combined the latest Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator technology, quantitative pharmacology, and <i>in utero</i> electroporation and found a hitherto unsuspected role for L-type VGCCs in determining the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling landscape of mouse immature neurons. We found that malfunctional L-type VGCCs in immature neurons before birth might cause errors in neuritic growth and cortical migration. Interestingly, the retarded corticogenesis phenotype was rescued by postnatal correction of L-type VGCC signal aberration. These findings suggest that L-type VGCCs might constitute a perinatal therapeutic target for neurodevelopment-associated psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>There is now compelling evidence that selective stimulation of A nociceptors eliciting first pain evokes robust responses in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). In contrast, whether the C-fiber nociceptive input eliciting second pain has an organized projection to S1 remains an open question. Here, we recorded the electrocortical responses elicited by nociceptive-specific laser stimulation of the four limbs in 202 humans (both males and females, using EEG) and 12 freely moving rats (all males, using ECoG). Topographical analysis and source modeling revealed in both species, a clear gross somatotopy of the unmyelinated C-fiber input within the S1 contralateral to the stimulated side. In the human EEG, S1 activity could be isolated as an early-latency negative deflection (C-N1 wave peaking at 710–730 ms) after hand stimulation, but not after foot stimulation because of the spatiotemporal overlap with the subsequent large-amplitude supramodal vertex waves (C-N2/P2). In contrast, because of the across-species difference in the representation of the body surface within S1, S1 activity could be isolated in rat ECoG as a C-N1 after both forepaw and hindpaw stimulation. Finally, we observed a functional dissociation between the generators of the somatosensory-specific lateralized waves (C-N1) and those of the supramodal vertex waves (C-N2/P2), indicating that C-fiber unmyelinated input is processed in functionally distinct somatosensory and multimodal cortical areas. These findings demonstrated that C-fiber input conveys information about the spatial location of noxious stimulation across the body surface, a prerequisite for deploying an appropriate defensive motor repertoire.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Unmyelinated C-fibers are the evolutionarily oldest peripheral afferents responding to noxious environmental stimuli. Whether C-fiber input conveys information about the spatial location of the noxious stimulation to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) remains an open issue. In this study, C-fibers were activated by radiant heat stimuli delivered to different parts of the body in both humans and rodents while electrical brain activity was recorded. In both species, the C-fiber peripheral input projects to different parts of the contralateral S1, coherently with the representation of the body surface within this brain region. These findings demonstrate that C-fiber input conveys information about the spatial location of noxious stimulation across the body surface, a prerequisite for deploying an appropriate defensive motor repertoire.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5523?rss=1">Suppression of AMPA Receptor Exocytosis Contributes to Hippocampal LTD</a></h4>

<p>The decrease in number of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) at excitatory synapses causes LTD, a cellular basis of learning and memory. The number of postsynaptic AMPARs is regulated by the balance of exocytosis and endocytosis, and enhanced endocytosis of AMPAR has been suggested to underlie the LTD expression. However, it remains unclear how endocytosis and exocytosis of AMPAR change during LTD. In this study, we addressed this question by analyzing exocytosis and endocytosis of AMPAR by imaging super-ecliptic pHlorin (SEP)-tagged AMPAR around postsynaptic structure formed directly on the glass surface in the hippocampal culture prepared from rat embryos of both sexes. Contrary to a prevailing view on the LTD expression by endocytosis enhancement, the LTD induction by NMDA application only transiently enhanced endocytosis of SEP-tagged GluA1 subunits of AMPAR, which was counteracted by simultaneous augmentation of exocytosis. As a result, soon after the start of the LTD induction (~1 min), the surface AMPAR did not markedly decrease. Thereafter, the surface GluA1-SEP gradually decreased (2–5 min) and kept at a low level until the end of observation (&gt;30 min). Surprisingly, this gradual and sustained decrease of surface AMPAR was accompanied not by the enhanced endocytic events of GluA1, but by the suppression of exocytosis. Together, our data highlight an unprecedented mechanism for the LTD expression by attenuation of exocytosis of AMPAR, but not by enhanced endocytosis, together with a reduction of postsynaptic AMPAR scaffolding protein PSD95.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been generally assumed that LTD is expressed by enhancement of AMPAR endocytosis. Previous studies reported that endocytosis-related protein was involved in LTD and that significant amount of cell-surface AMPAR moved into intracellular compartments during LTD. Here, we report changes of cell-surface amount of AMPAR, and where and when individual exocytosis and endocytosis occurred during LTD. Cell-surface AMPAR gradually decreased in synchrony with suppression of exocytosis but not with enhancement of endocytosis. These results suggest that the decrease of cell-surface AMPAR amount during LTD was caused not by enhancement of endocytosis but rather by suppression of exocytosis, which revises current understanding of the expression mechanism of LTD.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5507?rss=1">Identification of a Rhythmic Firing Pattern in the Enteric Nervous System That Generates Rhythmic Electrical Activity in Smooth Muscle</a></h4>

<p>The enteric nervous system (ENS) contains millions of neurons essential for organization of motor behavior of the intestine. It is well established that the large intestine requires ENS activity to drive propulsive motor behaviors. However, the firing pattern of the ENS underlying propagating neurogenic contractions of the large intestine remains unknown. To identify this, we used high-resolution neuronal imaging with electrophysiology from neighboring smooth muscle. Myoelectric activity underlying propagating neurogenic contractions along murine large intestine [also referred to as colonic migrating motor complexes, (CMMCs)] consisted of prolonged bursts of rhythmic depolarizations at a frequency of ~2 Hz. Temporal coordination of this activity in the smooth muscle over large spatial fields (~7 mm, longitudinally) was dependent on the ENS. During quiescent periods between neurogenic contractions, recordings from large populations of enteric neurons, in mice of either sex, revealed ongoing activity. The onset of neurogenic contractions was characterized by the emergence of temporally synchronized activity across large populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This neuronal firing pattern was rhythmic and temporally synchronized across large numbers of ganglia at ~2 Hz. ENS activation preceded smooth muscle depolarization, indicating rhythmic depolarizations in smooth muscle were controlled by firing of enteric neurons. The cyclical emergence of temporally coordinated firing of large populations of enteric neurons represents a unique neural motor pattern outside the CNS. This is the first direct observation of rhythmic firing in the ENS underlying rhythmic electrical depolarizations in smooth muscle. The pattern of neuronal activity we identified underlies the generation of CMMCs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How the enteric nervous system (ENS) generates neurogenic contractions of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has been a long-standing mystery in vertebrates. It is well known that myogenic pacemaker cells exist in the GI tract [called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs)] that generate rhythmic myogenic contractions. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation of rhythmic neurogenic contractions of smooth muscle in the GI tract remains unknown. We developed a high-resolution neuronal imaging method with electrophysiology to address this issue. This technique revealed a novel pattern of rhythmic coordinated neuronal firing in the ENS that has never been identified. Rhythmic neuronal firing in the ENS was found to generate rhythmic neurogenic depolarizations in smooth muscle that underlie contraction of the GI tract.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5495?rss=1">The Frequency Response of Outer Hair Cell Voltage-Dependent Motility Is Limited by Kinetics of Prestin</a></h4>

<p>The voltage-dependent protein SLC26a5 (prestin) underlies outer hair cell electromotility (eM), which is responsible for cochlear amplification in mammals. The electrical signature of eM is a bell-shaped nonlinear capacitance (NLC), deriving from prestin sensor-charge (Q<sub>p</sub>) movements, which peaks at the membrane voltage, V<sub>h</sub>, where charge is distributed equally on either side of the membrane. Voltage dependencies of NLC and eM differ depending on interrogation frequency and intracellular chloride, revealing slow intermediate conformational transitions between anion binding and voltage-driven Q<sub>p</sub> movements. Consequently, NLC exhibits low-pass characteristics, substantially below prevailing estimates of eM frequency response. Here we study in guinea pig and mouse of either sex synchronous prestin electrical (NLC, Q<sub>p</sub>) and mechanical (eM) activity across frequencies under voltage clamp (whole cell and microchamber). We find that eM and Q<sub>p</sub> magnitude and phase correspond, indicating tight piezoelectric coupling. Electromechanical measures (both NLC and eM) show dual-Lorentzian, low-pass behavior, with a limiting (<sub>2</sub>) time constant at V<sub>h</sub> of 32.6 and 24.8 μs, respectively. As expected for voltage-dependent kinetics, voltage excitation away from V<sub>h</sub> has a faster, flatter frequency response, with our fastest measured <sub>2</sub> for eM of 18.2 μs. Previous observations of ultrafast eM (  2 μs) were obtained at offsets far removed from V<sub>h</sub>. We hypothesize that trade-offs in eM gain-bandwith arising from voltage excitation at membrane potentials offset from V<sub>h</sub> influence the effectiveness of cochlear amplification across frequencies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Of two types of hair cells within the organ of Corti, inner hair cells and outer hair cells, the latter evolved to boost sensitivity to sounds. Damage results in hearing loss of 40–60 dB, revealing amplification gains of 100–1000<font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> that arise from voltage-dependent mechanical responses [electromotility (eM)]. eM, driven by the membrane protein prestin, may work beyond 70 kHz. However, this speed exceeds, by over an order of magnitude, kinetics of typical voltage-dependent membrane proteins. We find eM is actually low pass in nature, indicating that prestin bears kinetics typical of other membrane proteins. These observations highlight potential difficulties in providing sufficient amplification beyond a cutoff frequency near 20 kHz. Nevertheless, observed trade-offs in eM gain-bandwith may sustain cochlear amplification across frequency.</p>

<p>Axon degeneration and disruption of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are key events in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology. Although the disease's etiology is not fully understood, it is thought to involve a non–cell-autonomous mechanism and alterations in RNA metabolism. Here, we identified reduced levels of miR126-5p in presymptomatic ALS male mice models, and an increase in its targets: axon destabilizing Type 3 Semaphorins and their coreceptor Neuropilins. Using compartmentalized <i>in vitro</i> cocultures, we demonstrated that myocytes expressing diverse ALS-causing mutations promote axon degeneration and NMJ dysfunction, which were inhibited by applying Neuropilin1 blocking antibody. Finally, overexpressing miR126-5p is sufficient to transiently rescue axon degeneration and NMJ disruption both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying ALS pathology, in which alterations in miR126-5p facilitate a non–cell-autonomous mechanism of motor neuron degeneration in ALS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite some progress, currently no effective treatment is available for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We suggest a novel regulatory role for miR126-5p in ALS and demonstrate, for the first time, a mechanism by which alterations in miR126-5p contribute to axon degeneration and NMJ disruption observed in ALS. We show that miR126-5p is altered in ALS models and that it can modulate Sema3 and NRP protein expression. Furthermore, NRP1 elevations in motor neurons and muscle secretion of Sema3A contribute to axon degeneration and NMJ disruption in ALS. Finally, overexpressing miR126-5p is sufficient to transiently rescue NMJ disruption and axon degeneration both <i>in vitro</i> and <b><i>in vivo</i></b>.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5466?rss=1">Neural Signatures of the Processing of Temporal Patterns in Sound</a></h4>

<p>The ability to detect regularities in sound (i.e., recurring structure) is critical for effective perception, enabling, for example, change detection and prediction. Two seemingly unconnected lines of research concern the neural operations involved in processing regularities: one investigates how neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularities (e.g., frequency modulation; FM) in sounds, whereas the other focuses on increases in sustained activity during stimulation with repeating tone-frequency patterns. In three electroencephalography studies with male and female human participants, we investigated whether neural synchronization and sustained neural activity are dissociable, or whether they are functionally interdependent. Experiment I demonstrated that neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularity (FM) in sounds, and that sustained activity increases concomitantly. In Experiment II, phase coherence of FM in sounds was parametrically varied. Although neural synchronization was more sensitive to changes in FM coherence, such changes led to a systematic modulation of both neural synchronization and sustained activity, with magnitude increasing as coherence increased. In Experiment III, participants either performed a duration categorization task on the sounds, or a visual object tracking task to distract attention. Neural synchronization was observed regardless of task, whereas the sustained response was observed only when attention was on the auditory task, not under (visual) distraction. The results suggest that neural synchronization and sustained activity levels are functionally linked: both are sensitive to regularities in sounds. However, neural synchronization might reflect a more sensory-driven response to regularity, compared with sustained activity which may be influenced by attentional, contextual, or other experiential factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Optimal perception requires that the auditory system detects regularities in sounds. Synchronized neural activity and increases in sustained neural activity both appear to index the detection of a regularity, but the functional interrelation of these two neural signatures is unknown. In three electroencephalography experiments, we measured both signatures concomitantly while listeners were presented with sounds containing frequency modulations that differed in their regularity. We observed that both neural signatures are sensitive to temporal regularity in sounds, although they functionally decouple when a listener is distracted by a demanding visual task. Our data suggest that neural synchronization reflects a more automatic response to regularity compared with sustained activity, which may be influenced by attentional, contextual, or other experiential factors.</p>

<p>Sensory systems evolve in the ecological niches that each species is occupying. Accordingly, encoding of natural stimuli by sensory neurons is expected to be adapted to the statistics of these stimuli. For a direct quantification of sensory scenes, we tracked natural communication behavior of male and female weakly electric fish, <i>Apteronotus rostratus</i>, in their Neotropical rainforest habitat with high spatiotemporal resolution over several days. In the context of courtship, we observed large quantities of electrocommunication signals. Echo responses, acknowledgment signals, and their synchronizing role in spawning demonstrated the behavioral relevance of these signals. In both courtship and aggressive contexts, we observed robust behavioral responses in stimulus regimes that have so far been neglected in electrophysiological studies of this well characterized sensory system and that are well beyond the range of known best frequency and amplitude tuning of the electroreceptor afferents' firing rate modulation. Our results emphasize the importance of quantifying sensory scenes derived from freely behaving animals in their natural habitats for understanding the function and evolution of neural systems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The processing mechanisms of sensory systems have evolved in the context of the natural lives of organisms. To understand the functioning of sensory systems therefore requires probing them in the stimulus regimes in which they evolved. We took advantage of the continuously generated electric fields of weakly electric fish to explore electrosensory stimulus statistics in their natural Neotropical habitat. Unexpectedly, many of the electrocommunication signals recorded during courtship, spawning, and aggression had much smaller amplitudes or higher frequencies than stimuli used so far in neurophysiological characterizations of the electrosensory system. Our results demonstrate that quantifying sensory scenes derived from freely behaving animals in their natural habitats is essential to avoid biases in the choice of stimuli used to probe brain function.</p>

<p>Neocortical pyramidal neurons with somata in layers 5 and 6 are among the most visually striking and enigmatic neurons in the brain. These deep-layer pyramidal neurons (DLPNs) integrate a plethora of cortical and extracortical synaptic inputs along their impressive dendritic arbors. The pattern of cortical output to both local and long-distance targets is sculpted by the unique physiological properties of specific DLPN subpopulations. Here we revisit two broad DLPN subpopulations: those that send their axons within the telencephalon (intratelencephalic neurons) and those that project to additional target areas outside the telencephalon (extratelencephalic neurons). While neuroscientists across many subdisciplines have characterized the intrinsic and synaptic physiological properties of DLPN subpopulations, our increasing ability to selectively target and manipulate these output neuron subtypes advances our understanding of their distinct functional contributions. This Viewpoints article summarizes our current knowledge about DLPNs and highlights recent work elucidating the functional differences between DLPN subpopulations.</p>

Abstract<p>Classification and delineation of the motor-related nuclei in the human thalamus have been the focus of numerous discussions for a long time. Difficulties in finding consensus have for the most part been caused by paucity of direct experimental data on connections of individual nuclear entities. Kultas-Ilinsky et al. (2011, J Comp Neurol, 519:2811-2837) showed that distribution of the isoform 65 of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), the enzyme that synthesizes inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a reliable marker that allows to delineate connectionally distinct nuclei in the human motor thalamus, namely the territories innervated by nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents. We compared those immunocytochemical staining patterns with underlying cytoarchitecture and used the latter to outline the three afferent territories in a continuous series of sagittal Nissl-stained sections of the human thalamus. The 3D volume reconstructed from the outlines was placed in the Talairach stereotactic coordinate system relative to the intercommissural line and sectioned in three stereotactic planes to produce color-coded nuclear maps. This 3D coordinate-based atlas was co-registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. The current report proposes a simplified nomenclature of the motor-related thalamic nuclei, presents images of selected histological sections and stereotactic maps illustrating topographic relationships of these nuclei as well as their relationship with adjacent somatosensory afferent region. The data are useful in different applications such as functional MRI and diffusion tractography. The three-dimensional dataset is publicly available under an open license and can also be applicable in clinical interventions in the thalamus.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This is the first demonstration of revised maps of human motor thalamic nuclei that clearly identify subterritories based on their afferents in three stereotactic planes derived from a continuous series of histologic sections from a single brain. Consistent inter-slice distance and high resolution ensure a high reliability of target coordinates because the dataset is applicable in all planes. Nuclear outlines based on a specific marker and straightforward modified nomenclature reflect the functional and connectional properties of motor-related regions. 3D coordinate-based atlas space is co-registered with the most modern version of the widely used MNI space (multispectral MNI-152 2009b NLIN Asym template). The report introduces a unique tool for researchers and clinicians studying the human thalamus with experimental and imaging techniques.</p>

Abstract<p>Nodes of Ranvier are unique regions where voltage-gated sodium channels are highly enriched to drive saltatory conduction. Genetic ablations in adult mice with loss of specific nodal proteins causes slow but progressive nodal deterioration associated with decreased nerve conduction and axonopathy. What has remained unaddressed is whether loss of nodal proteins at different time points in postnatal life follows similar timelines of nodal disorganization. Here we utilized simultaneous ablation of Neurofascin (NF186) and Ankyrin G (AnkG) in mice of both sexes at three specific time points. We report that concurrent ablation of these core nodal components at postnatal day (P) 13 leads to accelerated nodal destabilization than at P23, and this disorganization is even slower when ablated at P93. Ablation of NF186 with AnkG at P13 reduced the half-life of NF186 to 15 days compared to 1 month at P23 which increased to 2 months at P93, indicating increasing nodal stability. The half-life of AnkG at the nodes also increased with age but showed enhanced disappearance from the node in the absence of NF186 with a half-life of 3 days at P13 ablation. The nodal disorganization occurred in a sequential manner with AnkG disappearing first from the nodal areas irrespective of the timing of ablation and led to decreased nerve conduction and affected axonal health. Together, our studies reveal that nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons continue to become more stable with age and suggest that nodal disorganization in adult human demyelinating disorders occurs slowly until neurological symptoms become evident.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The initial clustering, maturation, and life-long maintenance of nodes of Ranvier along myelinated axons are vital to the saltatory propagation of action potentials, allowing for rapid movements. to investigate if the kinetics for nodal destabilization are variable with age, we have used a novel mouse model where two essential nodal proteins, Neurofascin 186 (NF186) and Ankyrin G (AnkG), were simultaneous ablated from neurons at different time points. Our studies show that nodal stability after maturation is not only dependent on the synergistic functions of these core nodal components but also that nodes become more stable as animals age, which is relevant to human demyelination disorders.</p>

<p>We observe and study a self-organized phenomenon whereby the activity in a
network of spiking neurons spontaneously terminates. We consider different
types of populations, consisting of bistable model neurons connected
electrically by gap junctions, or by either excitatory or inhibitory synapses,
in a scale-free connection topology. We find that strongly synchronized
population spiking events lead to complete cessation of activity in excitatory
networks, but not in gap-junction or inhibitory networks. We identify the
underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon by examining the
particular shape of the excitatory post-synaptic currents that arise in the
neurons. We also examine the effects of the synaptic time constant, coupling
strength, and channel noise on the occurrence of the phenomenon.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The brain has a remarkable capacity to recover after lesions. However, little is known about compensatory neural adaptations at the systems level. We addressed this question by investigating behavioral and (correlated) functional changes throughout the cortex that are induced by focal, reversible inactivations. Specifically, monkeys performed a demanding covert spatial attention task while the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) was inactivated with muscimol and whole-brain fMRI activity was recorded. The inactivation caused LIP-specific decreases in task-related fMRI activity. In addition, these local effects triggered large-scale network changes. Unlike most studies in which animals were mainly passive relative to the stimuli, we observed heterogeneous effects with more profound muscimol-induced increases of task-related fMRI activity in areas connected to LIP, especially FEF. Furthermore, in areas such as FEF and V4, muscimol-induced changes in fMRI activity correlated with changes in behavioral performance. Notably, the activity changes in remote areas did not correlate with the decreased activity at the site of the inactivation, suggesting that such changes arise via neuronal mechanisms lying in the intact portion of the functional task network, with FEF a likely key player. The excitationâ€“inhibition dynamics unmasking existing excitatory connections across the functional network might initiate these rapid adaptive changes.</span>

The piriform cortex (PCx) receives direct input from the olfactory bulb (OB) and is the brain's main station for odor recognition and memory. The transformation of the odor code from OB to PCx is profound: mitral and tufted cells in olfactory glomeruli respond to individual odorant molecules, whereas pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the PCx responds to multiple, apparently random combinations of activated glomeruli. How these "discontinuous" receptive fields are formed from OB inputs remains unknown. Counter to the prevailing view that olfactory PNs sum their inputs passively, we show for the first time that NMDA spikes within individual dendrites can both amplify OB inputs and impose combination selectivity upon them, while their ability to compartmentalize voltage signals allows different dendrites to represent different odorant combinations. Thus, the 2-layer integrative behavior of olfactory PN dendrites provides a parsimonious account for the nonlinear remapping of the odor code from bulb to cortex.

Sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) enhances risk for several psychiatric disorders associated with the limbic system, including mood and autism spectrum disorders. These patients provide a powerful genetics-first model for understanding the biological basis of psychopathology. Additionally, these disorders are frequently sex-biased in prevalence, further suggesting an etiological role for sex chromosomes. Here, to clarify how limbic anatomy varies across sex and sex chromosome complement, we characterize amygdala and hippocampus structure in a uniquely large sample of patients carrying supernumerary sex chromosomes (n = 132) and typically developing controls (n=166). After correction for sex-differences in brain size, karyotypically normal males (XY) and females (XX) did not differ in volume or shape of either structure studied. In contrast, all SCAs were associated with lowered amygdala volume relative to gonadally-matched controls. This effect was robust to three different methods for total brain volume correction, including an allometric analysis that derived normative scaling rules for these structures in a separate, typically developing population (n = 79). Hippocampal volume was insensitive to SCA after correction for total brain volume. However, surface based analysis revealed that SCA, regardless of specific karyotype, was consistently associated with a spatially specific pattern of shape change in both amygdala and hippocampus. In particular, SCA was accompanied by contraction around the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala and an area within the hippocampal surface that cuts across hippocampal subfields. These results demonstrate the power of SCA as a model to understand how genetic insults precipitate changes in brain systems relevant to psychiatric disease.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/346759v1?rss=1">Sensitive periods for white matter plasticity in human</a></h4>

As a child matures, some brain circuits stabilize while others remain plastic. However, the literature on maturational changes in the brain's capacity for experience-dependent plasticity is primarily based on experiments in animals that mature over dramatically different time-scales than humans. Moreover, while principles of plasticity for sensory and motor systems might be conserved across species, the myriad of late-developing and uniquely human cognitive functions such as literacy cannot be studied with animal models. Here we use an intensive reading intervention program, in combination with longitudinal diffusion MRI measurements in school-aged children with dyslexia, to model the sensitive period for white matter plasticity and literacy learning.

Abstract
<p>Protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PSD-95/discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knock-out (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knock-down (KD) of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.</p>

Abstract
<p>Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However, while this broad mapping has been established, the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here, using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches, we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala [posteromedial cortical nucleus (PmCo)] feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb. Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feedforward mitral cell (MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells. In addition, LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus, through corticofugal pathways, the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.</p>

<p>The heterotrimeric G-protein transducin mediates visual signaling in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Many aspects of the function of transducin were learned from knock-out mice lacking its individual subunits. Of particular interest is the knockout of its rod-specific -subunit (G<sub>1</sub>). Two studies using independently generated mice documented that this knockout results in a considerable &gt;60-fold reduction in the light sensitivity of affected rods, but provided different interpretations of how the remaining α-subunit (Gα<sub>t</sub>) mediates phototransduction without its cognate Gβ<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub>-subunit partner. One study found that the light sensitivity reduction matched a corresponding reduction in Gα<sub>t</sub> content in the light-sensing rod outer segments and proposed that Gα<sub>t</sub> activation is supported by remaining Gβ<sub>1</sub> associating with other G subunits naturally expressed in photoreceptors. In contrast, the second study reported the same light sensitivity loss but a much lower, only approximately sixfold, reduction of Gα<sub>t</sub> and proposed that the light responses of these rods do not require Gβ at all. To resolve this controversy and elucidate the mechanism driving visual signaling in G<sub>1</sub> knock-out rods, we analyzed both mouse lines side by side. We first determined that the outer segments of both mice have identical Gα<sub>t</sub> content, which is reduced ~65-fold from the wild-type (WT) level. We further demonstrated that the remaining Gβ<sub>1</sub> is present in a complex with endogenous G<sub>2</sub> and G<sub>3</sub> subunits and that these complexes exist in wild-type rods as well. Together, these results argue against the idea that Gα<sub>t</sub> alone supports light responses of G<sub>1</sub> knock-out rods and suggest that Gβ<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub> is not unique in its ability to mediate vertebrate phototransduction.</p>

<p>Evidence accumulation models of simple decision-making have long assumed that
the brain estimates a scalar decision variable corresponding to the
log-likelihood ratio of the two alternatives. Typical neural implementations of
this algorithmic cognitive model assume that large numbers of neurons are each
noisy exemplars of the scalar decision variable. Here we propose a neural
implementation of the diffusion model in which many neurons construct and
maintain the Laplace transform of the distance to each of the decision bounds.
As in classic findings from brain regions including LIP, the firing rate of
neurons coding for the Laplace transform of net accumulated evidence grows to a
bound during random dot motion tasks. However, rather than noisy exemplars of a
single mean value, this approach makes the novel prediction that firing rates
grow to the bound exponentially, across neurons there should be a distribution
of different rates. A second set of neurons records an approximate inversion of
the Laplace transform, these neurons directly estimate net accumulated
evidence. In analogy to time cells and place cells observed in the hippocampus
and other brain regions, the neurons in this second set have receptive fields
along a "decision axis." This finding is consistent with recent findings from
rodent recordings. This theoretical approach places simple evidence
accumulation models in the same mathematical language as recent proposals for
representing time and space in cognitive models for memory.

<p>This paper proposes and implements an intuitive and pervasive solution for
neonatal EEG monitoring assisted by sonification and deep learning AI that
provides information about neonatal brain health to all neonatal healthcare
professionals, particularly those without EEG interpretation expertise. The
system aims to increase the demographic of clinicians capable of diagnosing
abnormalities in neonatal EEG. The proposed system uses a low-cost and
low-power EEG acquisition system. An Android app provides single-channel EEG
visualization, traffic-light indication of the presence of neonatal seizures
provided by a trained, deep convolutional neural network and an algorithm for
EEG sonification, designed to facilitate the perception of changes in EEG
morphology specific to neonatal seizures. The multifaceted EEG interpretation
framework is presented and the implemented mobile platform architecture is
analyzed with respect to its power consumption and accuracy.

<p>The brain is a system operating on multiple time scales, and characterisation
of dynamics across time scales remains a challenge. One framework to study such
dynamics is that of fractal geometry. However, currently there exists no
established method for the study of brain dynamics using fractal geometry, due
to the many challenges in the conceptual and technical understanding of the
methods. We aim to highlight some of the practical challenges of applying
fractal geometry to brain dynamics and propose solutions to enable its wider
use in neuroscience. Using intracranially recorded EEG and simulated data, we
compared monofractal and multifractal methods with regards to their sensitivity
to signal variance. We found that both correlate closely with signal variance,
thus not offering new information about the signal. However, after applying an
epoch-wise standardisation procedure to the signal, we found that multifractal
measures could offer non-redundant information compared to signal variance,
power and other established EEG signal measures. We also compared different
multifractal estimation methods and found that the Chhabra-Jensen algorithm
performed best. Finally, we investigated the impact of sampling frequency and
epoch length on multifractal properties. Using epileptic seizures as an example
event in the EEG, we show that there may be an optimal time scale for detecting
temporal changes in multifractal properties around seizures. The practical
issues we highlighted and our suggested solutions should help in developing a
robust method for the application of fractal geometry in EEG signals. Our
analyses and observations also aid the theoretical understanding of the
multifractal properties of the brain and might provide grounds for new
discoveries in the study of brain signals. These could be crucial for
understanding of neurological function and for the developments of new
treatments.

<p>We propose that homogeneous image regions may be used to quickly segment a
visual scene, when an object hypothesis is not yet available. In a cooperative
model of the konio-cellular and the parvo- or magno-cellular visual pathway of
primates, we demonstrate how homogeneity-selective responses can be gained from
LGN neurons using a spike-latency code, and how these responses can confine
edge detection to borders between mid-sized objects. We propose that
spike-latency-based homogeneity detection is a general neural principle that
may apply to any sensory feature and modality. The mechanism is sensitive to
exact spike timing, which makes it vulnerable to noise. Nevertheless we
demonstrate how the mechanism can be made robust against realistic levels of
neural cross talk in the brain. We show that biphasic synaptic events do yield
very sharp post synaptic currents that maintain good separation of homogeneity
responses in massively noisy environments. The same technique opens up a neural
method of tuning neurons to varying degrees of homogeneity. The simple neural
implementation, generality, robustness, and variable tuning make
homogeneity-detection an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neural
networks and in the brain.

<p>To make decisions organisms often accumulate information across multiple
timescales. However, most experimental and modeling studies of decision-making
focus on sequences of independent trials. On the other hand, natural
environments are characterized by long temporal correlations, and evidence used
to make a present choice is often relevant to future decisions. To understand
decision-making under these conditions we analyze how a model ideal observer
accumulates evidence to freely make choices across a sequence of correlated
trials. We use principles of probabilistic inference to show that an ideal
observer incorporates information obtained on one trial as an initial bias on
the next. This bias decreases the time, but not the accuracy of the next
decision. Furthermore, in finite sequences of trials the rate of reward is
maximized when the observer deliberates longer for early decisions, but
responds more quickly towards the end of the sequence. Our model also explains
experimentally observed patterns in decision times and choices, thus providing
a mathematically principled foundation for evidence-accumulation models of
sequential decisions.

<p>Random noise plays a beneficial role in cognitive processing and produces
measurable improvement in simulations and biological agents' task performance.
Stochastic facilitation, the phenomenon of additive noise improving signal
transmission in complex systems, has been shown to occur in a variety of neural
contexts. However, neuroscience analyses to date have not fully explored the
colours that neural noise could be. The literature shows a 1/f pink noise power
spectrum distribution at many levels, but many less rigourous studies assume
white noise, with little justification of why that assumption is made. In this
work, we briefly review the colours of noise and their useful applications in
other fields. If we consider that noise is not so black and white, we could
more colourfully regularize artificial neural networks and re-investigate some
surprising results about how the brain benefits from noise.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03504">Universality in human cortical folding across lobes of individual brains. (arXiv:1806.03504v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Background: We have previously demonstrated that cortical folding across
mammalian species follows a universal scaling law that can be derived from a
simple theoretical model. The same scaling law has also been shown to hold
across brains of our own species, irrespective of age or sex. These results,
however, only relate measures of complete cortical hemispheres. There are known
systematic variations in morphology between different brain regions, and
region-specific changes with age. It is therefore of interest to extend our
analyses to different cortical regions, and analyze the scaling law within an
individual brain.
</p>
<p>Methods: To directly compare the morphology of sub-divisions of the cortical
surface in a size-independent manner, we base our method on a topological
invariant of closed surfaces. We reconstruct variables of a complete hemisphere
from each lobe of the brain so that it has the same gyrification index, average
thickness and average Gaussian curvature.
</p>
<p>Results: We show that different lobes are morphologically diverse but obey
the same scaling law that was observed across human subjects and across
mammalian species. This is also the case for subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
The age-dependent offset changes at similar rates for all lobes in healthy
subjects, but differs most dramatically in the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's
disease.
</p>
<p>Significance: Our results further support the idea that while morphological
parameters can vary locally across the cortical surface/across subjects of the
same species/across species, the processes that drive cortical gyrification are
universal.

We hypothesized that when an item’s initial and subsequent neural representations overlap, this allows the initial item to become associated with novel contextual information, interfering with later retrieval of the initial context. Specifically, we predicted a negative relationship between representational similarity across repeated experiences of an item and subsequent source memory for the initial context. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI study, in which objects were presented multiple times during different tasks. We measured the similarity of the neural patterns in lateral occipital cortex that were elicited by the first and second presentations of objects, and related this neural overlap score to subsequent source memory. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater item-specific pattern similarity was linked to worse source memory for the initial task. In contrast, greater reactivation of the initial context was associated with better source memory. Our findings suggest that the influence of novel experiences on an existing context memory depends on how reliably a shared component (i.e., item) is represented across these episodes.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Event-related fluctuations of neural oscillatory amplitude are reported widely in the context of cognitive processing and are typically interpreted as a marker of brain “activity”. However, the precise nature of these effects remains unclear; in particular, whether such fluctuations reflect local dynamics, integration between regions, or both, is unknown. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we show that movement induced oscillatory modulation is associated with transient connectivity between sensorimotor regions. Further, in resting-state data, we demonstrate a significant association between oscillatory modulation and dynamic connectivity. A confound with such empirical measurements is that increased amplitude necessarily means increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): this means that the question of whether amplitude and connectivity are genuinely coupled, or whether increased connectivity is observed purely due to increased SNR is unanswered. Here, we counter this problem by analogy with computational models which show that, in the presence of global network coupling and local multistability, the link between oscillatory modulation and long-range connectivity is a natural consequence of neural networks. Our results provide evidence for the notion that connectivity is mediated by neural oscillations, and suggest that time–frequency spectrograms are not merely a description of local synchrony but also reflect fluctuations in long-range connectivity.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Considerable evidence has shown that prefrontal neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors (D1DRs) are critical for working memory, flexibility, and timing. This line of work predicts that frontal neurons expressing D1DRs mediate cognitive processing. During timing tasks, one form this cognitive processing might take is time-dependent ramping activity—monotonic changes in firing rate over time. Thus, we hypothesized the prefrontal D1DR+ neurons would strongly exhibit time-dependent ramping during interval timing. We tested this idea using an interval-timing task in which we used optogenetics to tag D1DR+ neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex (MFC). While 23% of MFC D1DR+ neurons exhibited ramping, this was significantly less than untagged MFC neurons. By contrast, MFC D1DR+ neurons had strong delta-frequency (1–4 Hz) coherence with other MFC ramping neurons. This coherence was phase-locked to cue onset and was strongest early in the interval. To test the significance of these interactions, we optogenetically stimulated MFC D1DR+ neurons early versus late in the interval. We found that 2-Hz stimulation early in the interval was particularly effective in rescuing timing-related behavioral performance deficits in dopamine-depleted animals. These findings provide insight into MFC networks and have relevance for disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia.</span>

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a widespread problem for the increasing population of cancer survivors. Our understanding of the nature, causes, and prevalence of CRCI is hampered by a reliance on clinical neuropsychological methods originally designed to detect focal lesions. Future progress will require collaboration between neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology.

<p>by Adrien Henry, Mathieu Hemery, Paul François</p>

Molecular networks are at the core of most cellular decisions, but are often difficult to comprehend. Reverse engineering of network architecture from their functions has proved fruitful to classify and predict the structure and function of molecular networks, suggesting new experimental tests and biological predictions. We present <i>φ</i>-evo, an open-source program to evolve <i>in silico</i> phenotypic networks performing a given biological function. We include implementations for evolution of biochemical adaptation, adaptive sorting for immune recognition, metazoan development (somitogenesis, hox patterning), as well as Pareto evolution. We detail the program architecture based on C, Python 3, and a Jupyter interface for project configuration and network analysis. We illustrate the predictive power of <i>φ</i>-evo by first recovering the asymmetrical structure of the <i>lac</i> operon regulation from an objective function with symmetrical constraints. Second, we use the problem of hox-like embryonic patterning to show how a single effective fitness can emerge from multi-objective (Pareto) evolution. <i>φ</i>-evo provides an efficient approach and user-friendly interface for the phenotypic prediction of networks and the numerical study of evolution itself.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8XzRpNVsmSQ" width="1" />

<p>by Michael Trogdon, Brian Drawert, Carlos Gomez, Samhita P. Banavar, Tau-Mu Yi, Otger Campàs, Linda R. Petzold</p>

The localization (or polarization) of proteins on the membrane during the mating of budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) is an important model system for understanding simple pattern formation within cells. While there are many existing mathematical models of polarization, for both budding and mating, there are still many aspects of this process that are not well understood. In this paper we set out to elucidate the effect that the geometry of the cell can have on the dynamics of certain models of polarization. Specifically, we look at several spatial stochastic models of Cdc42 polarization that have been adapted from published models, on a variety of tip-shaped geometries, to replicate the shape change that occurs during the growth of the mating projection. We show here that there is a complex interplay between the dynamics of polarization and the shape of the cell. Our results show that while models of polarization can generate a stable polarization cap, its localization at the tip of mating projections is unstable, with the polarization cap drifting away from the tip of the projection in a geometry dependent manner. We also compare predictions from our computational results to experiments that observe cells with projections of varying lengths, and track the stability of the polarization cap. Lastly, we examine one model of actin polarization and show that it is unlikely, at least for the models studied here, that actin dynamics and vesicle traffic are able to overcome this effect of geometry.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HB-3yftCf6M" width="1" />

<p>by Angelika Manhart, Stefanie Windner, Mary Baylies, Alex Mogilner</p>

Many types of large cells have multiple nuclei. In skeletal muscle fibers, the nuclei are distributed along the cell to maximize their internuclear distances. This myonuclear positioning is crucial for cell function. Although microtubules, microtubule associated proteins, and motors have been implicated, mechanisms responsible for myonuclear positioning remain unclear. We used a combination of rough interacting particle and detailed agent-based modeling to examine computationally the hypothesis that a force balance generated by microtubules positions the muscle nuclei. Rather than assuming the nature and identity of the forces, we simulated various types of forces between the pairs of nuclei and between the nuclei and cell boundary to position the myonuclei according to the laws of mechanics. We started with a large number of potential interacting particle models and computationally screened these models for their ability to fit biological data on nuclear positions in hundreds of <i>Drosophila</i> larval muscle cells. This reverse engineering approach resulted in a small number of feasible models, the one with the best fit suggests that the nuclei repel each other and the cell boundary with forces that decrease with distance. The model makes nontrivial predictions about the increased nuclear density near the cell poles, the zigzag patterns of the nuclear positions in wider cells, and about correlations between the cell width and elongated nuclear shapes, all of which we confirm by image analysis of the biological data. We support the predictions of the interacting particle model with simulations of an agent-based mechanical model. Taken together, our data suggest that microtubules growing from nuclear envelopes push on the neighboring nuclei and the cell boundaries, which is sufficient to establish the nearly-uniform nuclear spreading observed in muscle fibers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nOcrMsLp00k" width="1" />

<p>by Suma Ghosh, Matthew J. Ferrari, Ashutosh K. Pathak, Isabella M. Cattadori</p>

Understanding the mechanisms that generate complex host-parasite interactions, and how they contribute to variation between and within hosts, is important for predicting risk of infection and transmission, and for developing more effective interventions based on parasite properties. We used the <i>T. retortaeformis</i> (TR)-rabbit system and developed a state-space mathematical framework to capture the variation in intensity of infection and egg shedding in hosts infected weekly, then treated with an anthelminthic and subsequently re-challenged following the same infection regime. Experimental infections indicate that parasite intensity accumulates more slowly in the post-anthelminthic phase but reaches similar maximum numbers. By contrast, parasite EPG (eggs per gram of feces) shed from rabbits in the post-treatment phase is lower and less variable through time. Inference based on EPG alone suggests a decline in parasite intensity over time. Using a state-space model and incorporating all sources of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, we show that while parasite intensity remains relatively constant in both experimental phases, shedding of eggs into the environment is increasingly limited through changes in parasite growth. We suggest that host immunity directly modulates both the accumulation and the growth of the parasite, and indirectly affects transmission by limiting parasite length and thus fecundity. This study provides a better understanding of how within-host trophic interactions influence different components of a helminth population. It also suggests that heterogeneity in parasite traits should be addressed more carefully when examining and managing helminth infections in the absence of some critical data on parasite dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aq6_Ne53vz8" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Ethanol has robust effects on presynaptic activity in many neurons, however, it is not yet clear how this drug acts within this compartment to change neural activity, nor the significance of this change on behavior and physiology <i>in vivo</i>. One possible presynaptic effector for ethanol is the Munc13-1 protein. Herein, we show that ethanol binding to the rat Munc13-1 C1 domain, at concentrations consistent with binge exposure, reduces diacylglycerol (DAG) binding. The inhibition of DAG binding is predicted to reduce the activity of Munc13-1 and presynaptic release. In <i>Drosophila</i>, we show that sedating concentrations of ethanol significantly reduce synaptic vesicle release in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), while having no significant impact on membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the presynaptic compartment. These data indicate that ethanol targets the active zone in reducing synaptic vesicle exocytosis. <i>Drosophila</i>, haploinsufficent for the Munc13-1 ortholog <i>Dunc13</i>, are more resistant to the effect of ethanol on presynaptic inhibition. Genetically reducing the activity of <i>Dunc13</i> through mutation or expression of RNAi transgenes also leads to a significant resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The neuronal expression of <i>Munc13-1</i> in heterozygotes for a <i>Dunc13</i> loss-of-function mutation can largely rescue the ethanol sedation resistance phenotype, indicating a conservation of function between <i>Munc13-1</i> and <i>Dunc13</i> in ethanol sedation. Hence, reducing <i>Dunc13</i> activity leads to naïve physiological and behavioral resistance to sedating concentrations of ethanol. We propose that reducing <i>Dunc13</i> activity, genetically or pharmacologically by ethanol binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1/Dunc13, promotes a homeostatic response that leads to ethanol tolerance.</p>

Abstract<p>Grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC LII) generate multiple regular firing fields in response to the position and speed of an individual within the environment. They exhibit a protracted postnatal development and, in the adult, show activity differences along the dorsoventral axis (DVA). Evidence suggests parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, most of which are perisomatic-targeting cells, play a crucial role in generation of the hexagonal grid cell activity pattern. We therefore hypothesized that the development and organization of PV+ perisomatic terminals in MEC LII reflects the postnatal emergence of the hexagonal firing pattern and dorsoventral differences seen in grid cell activity. We used immuno-electron microscopy to examine the development of PV+ perisomatic terminals and their target somata within dorsal and ventral MEC LII in rats of postnatal days (P)10, 15 and 30. We demonstrate that in dorsal and ventral MEC LII, the cross-sectional area of somata and number and density of perisomatic PV+ terminals increase between P10 and P15. A simultaneous decrease was observed in cross-sectional area of PV+ terminals. Between P15 and P30, both MEC regions showed an increase in PV+ terminal size and percentage of PV+ terminals containing mitochondria, which may enable grid cell activity to emerge and stabilize. We also report that dorsal somata are larger and apposed by more PV+ terminals than ventral somata at all stages, suggesting a protracted maturation in the ventral portion and a possible gradient in soma size and PV+ basket innervation along the DVA in the adult.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Grid cells within layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex produce a regular firing pattern in response to the environment during exploration. This pattern emerges after eye-opening in rodents and exhibits a gradient along the dorsoventral axis. Input from parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons is crucial for maintaining the grid pattern; however, how the PV+ innervation develops is unclear. Here we examine the structural development of dorsal and ventral perisomatic PV+ terminals and target somata. We show that the size of grid-related somata and number of PV+ terminals increase before eye-opening whereas PV+ terminals increase in size during grid activity stabilization. We further demonstrate that maturation in the ventral part is delayed, and that there are dorsoventral differences in young adults.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0391-17.2018v1?rss=1">Early Abrogation of Gelatinase Activity Extends the Time Window for tPA Thrombolysis after Embolic Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Mice</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is caused by clotting in the cerebral arteries, leading to brain oxygen deprivation and cerebral infarction. Recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only FDA-approved drug for ischemic stroke. However, tPA has to be administered within 4.5 h from the disease onset and delayed treatment of tPA can increase the risk of neurovascular impairment, including neuronal cell death, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and hemorrhagic transformation. A key contributing factor for tPA-induced neurovascular impairment is activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). We used a clinically-relevant mouse embolic model of focal-cerebral ischemia by insertion of a single embolus of blood clot to block the right middle cerebral artery. We showed that administration of the potent and highly selective gelatinase inhibitor SB-3CT extends the time window for administration of tPA, attenuating infarct volume, mitigating BBB disruption, and antagonizing the increase in cerebral hemorrhage induced by tPA treatment. We demonstrated that SB-3CT attenuates tPA-induced expression of vascular MMP-9, prevents gelatinase-mediated cleavage of extracellular laminin, rescues endothelial cells, and reduces caveolae-mediated transcytosis of endothelial cells. These results suggest that abrogation of MMP-9 activity mitigates the detrimental effects of tPA treatment, thus the combination treatment holds great promise for extending the therapeutic window for tPA thrombolysis, which opens the opportunity for clinical recourse to a greater number of patients.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Endovascular thrombectomy benefited patients with disproportionately severe clinical deficit relative to infarct volume and provides a surgical option for treatment of ischemic stroke. Tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved clot-dissolving drug for treatment of ischemic stroke. However, its beneficial effect is seen only within 4.5 hours from the onset of stroke, with better outcomes observed the sooner treatment is given. Major risk is MMP-9–mediated neurovascular impairment. We document that early administration of the pharmacological agent SB<sub>3</sub>CT reduces MMP-9 levels and mitigates the side effects associated with tPA. Furthermore, it extends the time window for treatment with tPA after stroke holding great potential for both disease intervention and benefiting patients who might not otherwise be candidates for treatment with tPA.</p>

Abstract<p>The mushroom body (MB) in insects is known as a major center for associative learning and memory, though exact locations for the correlating memory traces remain to be elucidated. Here we asked whether presynaptic boutons of olfactory projection neurons in the main input site of the MB undergo neuronal plasticity during classical odor-reward conditioning and correlate with the conditioned behavior. We simultaneously measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the boutons and conditioned behavioral responses to learned odors in honeybees. We found that the absolute amount of the neural change for the rewarded but not for the unrewarded odor was correlated with the behavioral learning rate across individuals. The temporal profile of the induced changes matched with odor response dynamics of the MB-associated inhibitory neurons, suggestive of activity modulation of boutons by this neural class. We hypothesize the circuit-specific neural plasticity relates to the learned value of the stimulus and underlies the conditioned behavior of the bees.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In order to understand memory processing in the brain, it is important to identify the synaptic locations and activities where memory information is stored. This requires monitoring neuronal activity in behaving animals, a technically very demanding task especially in tiny insects. Here we succeeded to measure neuronal activity from restrained yet behaving honeybees. We recorded the activity of olfactory projection neurons from the mushroom body, an insect brain center for learning and memory, while bees are performing an olfactory reward learning task. We found that the amount of neural plasticity correlates with the quantitative expression of a learned behavior to the sugar rewarded odor. Our results contribute to the understanding of the physiologic basis of memory formation in an insect brain.</p>

<p>Significant training is required to visually interpret neonatal EEG signals.
This study explores alternative sound-based methods for EEG interpretation
which are designed to allow for intuitive and quick differentiation between
healthy background activity and abnormal activity such as seizures. A novel
method based on frequency and amplitude modulation (FM/AM) is presented. The
algorithm is tuned to facilitate the audio domain perception of rhythmic
activity which is specific to neonatal seizures. The method is compared with
the previously developed phase vocoder algorithm for different time compressing
factors. A survey is conducted amongst a cohort of non-EEG experts to
quantitatively and qualitatively examine the performance of sound-based methods
in comparison with the visual interpretation. It is shown that both
sonification methods perform similarly well, with a smaller inter-observer
variability in comparison with visual. A post-survey analysis of results is
performed by examining the sensitivity of the ear to frequency evolution in
audio.

<p>Despite the fact that the Kendall correlation is becoming recognized as an
important tool in neuroscience, most standard algorithms to compute the Kendall
correlation of large spike trains are computationally very slow. Here we
present a new, significantly faster method for calculating the Kendall
correlation of spike trains that takes advantage of their structure. We show
that our method is more than 300 times faster than traditional approaches for
particularly large, sparse spike trains, and still more than 10 times faster
for large, but considerably less sparse, spike trains. A MATLAB function
executing the method described here was made freely available on-line.

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on objects and scenes have
shown intriguing ability to predict some response properties of visual cortical
neurons. However, the factors and computations that give rise to such ability,
and the role of intermediate processing stages in explaining changes that
develop across areas of the cortical hierarchy, are poorly understood. We
focused on the sensitivity to textures as a paradigmatic example, since recent
neurophysiology experiments provide rich data pointing to texture sensitivity
in secondary but not primary visual cortex. We developed a quantitative
approach for selecting a subset of the neural unit population from the CNN that
best describes the brain neural recordings. We found that the first two layers
of the CNN showed qualitative and quantitative correspondence to the cortical
data across a number of metrics. This compatibility was reduced for the
architecture alone rather than the learned weights, for some other related
hierarchical models, and only mildly in the absence of a nonlinear computation
akin to local divisive normalization. Our results show that the CNN class of
model is effective for capturing changes that develop across early areas of
cortex, and has the potential to facilitate understanding of the computations
that give rise to hierarchical processing in the brain.

<p>Neural circuits in the retina divide the incoming visual scene into more than
a dozen distinct representations that are sent on to central brain areas, such
as the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus. The retina can
be viewed as a parallel image processor made of a multitude of small
computational devices. Neural circuits of the retina are constituted by various
cell types that separate the incoming visual information in different channels.
Visual information is processed by retinal neural circuits and several
computations are performed extracting distinct features from the visual scene.
The aim of this article is to understand the computational basis involved in
processing visual information which finally leads to several feature detectors.
Therefore, the elements that form the basis of retinal computations will be
explored by explaining how oscillators can lead to a final output with
computational meaning. Linear versus nonlinear systems will be presented and
the retina will be placed in the context of a nonlinear system. Finally,
simulations will be presented exploring the concept of the retina as a
nonlinear system which can perform understandable computations converting a
known input into a predictable output.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstarct</div>An ensemble of neurons can provide a dynamic representation of external stimuli, ongoing processes, or upcoming actions. This dynamic representation could be achieved by changes in the activity of individual neurons and/or their interactions. To investigate these possibilities, we simultaneously recorded from ensembles of prefrontal neurons in non-human primates during a memory-guided saccade task. Using both decoding and encoding methods, we examined changes in the information content of individual neurons and that of ensembles between visual encoding and saccadic target selection. We found that individual neurons maintained their limited spatial sensitivity between these cognitive states, whereas the ensemble selectively improved its encoding of spatial locations far from the neurons’ preferred locations. This population-level “encoding expansion” was not due to the ceiling effect at the preferred locations and was accompanied by selective changes in noise correlations for non-preferred locations. Moreover, the encoding expansion was observed for ensembles of different types of neurons and could not be explained by shifts in the preferred location of individual neurons. Our results demonstrate that the representation of space by neuronal ensembles is dynamically enhanced prior to saccades, and this enhancement occurs alongside changes in noise correlations more than changes in the activity of individual neurons.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Verbal fluency tasks are generally thought to be mediated by frontal brain regions for letter fluency and temporal regions for category fluency. This idea, however, is primarily based on lesion studies and adapted versions of the fluency tasks in functional neuroimaging, without fundamental evidence from structural neuroimaging in healthy individuals. We investigated the cortical structural correlates of letter and category fluency, including overlapping and different regions, in 505 individuals who participated in a community-based study of healthy aging. The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency, primarily in frontal regions, and category fluency, in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency, with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts, respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging. The evidence for the anatomical substrates of letter and category fluency, each recruiting slightly different language and cognitive processes, can serve both clinical applications as well as a deeper theoretical understanding of the organization of the cerebral cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Anatomo-clinical evidence from motor-awareness disorders after brain-damages suggests that the premotor cortex (PMC) is involved in motor-monitoring of voluntary actions. Indeed, PMC lesions prevent patients from detecting the mismatch between intended, but not executed, movements with the paralyzed limb. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared, in healthy subjects, free movements against blocked movements, precluded by a cast. Cast-related corticospinal excitability changes were investigated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Immediately after the immobilization, when the cast prevented the execution of left-hand movements, the contralateral right (ventral) vPMC showed both increased hemodynamic activity and increased functional connectivity with the hand area in the right somatosensory cortex, suggesting a vPMC involvement in detecting the mismatch between planned and executed movements. Crucially, after 1 week of immobilization, when the motor system had likely learned that no movement could be executed and, therefore, predictions about motor consequences were changed, vPMC did not show the enhanced activity as if no incongruence has to be detected. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the plastic changes induced by long-lasting immobilization, as also proved by the cast-related corticospinal excitability modulation in our subjects. The present findings highlight the crucial role of vPMC in the anatomo-functional network generating the human motor-awareness.</span>

<p>by Tobias S. Brett, Eamon B. O’Dea, Éric Marty, Paige B. Miller, Andrew W. Park, John M. Drake, Pejman Rohani</p>

Epidemic transitions are an important feature of infectious disease systems. As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases, the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the nature of epidemiological data, with are typically aggregated into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC statistic are compared across a range of different reporting scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than the serial interval and reporting error is not highly overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many potentially emerging diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IrC-01N73dA" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>In this paper, we investigate how subtle differences in hearing acuity affect the neural systems supporting speech processing in young adults. Auditory sentence comprehension requires perceiving a complex acoustic signal and performing linguistic operations to extract the correct meaning. We used functional MRI to monitor human brain activity while adults aged 18–41 years listened to spoken sentences. The sentences varied in their level of syntactic processing demands, containing either a subject-relative or object-relative center-embedded clause. All participants self-reported normal hearing, confirmed by audiometric testing, with some variation within a clinically normal range. We found that participants showed activity related to sentence processing in a left-lateralized frontotemporal network. Although accuracy was generally high, participants still made some errors, which were associated with increased activity in bilateral cingulo-opercular and frontoparietal attention networks. A whole-brain regression analysis revealed that activity in a right anterior middle frontal gyrus (aMFG) component of the frontoparietal attention network was related to individual differences in hearing acuity, such that listeners with poorer hearing showed greater recruitment of this region when successfully understanding a sentence. The activity in right aMFGs for listeners with poor hearing did not differ as a function of sentence type, suggesting a general mechanism that is independent of linguistic processing demands. Our results suggest that even modest variations in hearing ability impact the systems supporting auditory speech comprehension, and that auditory sentence comprehension entails the coordination of a left perisylvian network that is sensitive to linguistic variation with an executive attention network that responds to acoustic challenge.</p>

<p>The assumption that action and perception can be investigated independently
is entrenched in theories, models and experimental approaches across the brain
and mind sciences. In cognitive science, this has been a central point of
contention between computationalist and 4Es (enactive, embodied, extended and
embedded) theories of cognition, with the former embracing the "classical
sandwich", modular, architecture of the mind and the latter actively denying
this separation can be made. In this work we suggest that the modular
independence of action and perception strongly resonates with the separation
principle of control theory and furthermore that this principle provides formal
criteria within which to evaluate the implications of the modularity of action
and perception. We will also see that real-time feedback with the environment,
often considered necessary for the definition of 4Es ideas, is not however a
sufficient condition to avoid the "classical sandwich". Finally, we argue that
an emerging framework in the cognitive and brain sciences, active inference,
extends ideas derived from control theory to the study of biological systems
while disposing of the separation principle, describing non-modular models of
behaviour strongly aligned with 4Es theories of cognition.

<p>by Benjamin Werner, Andrea Sottoriva</p>

The immortal strand hypothesis poses that stem cells could produce differentiated progeny while conserving the original template strand, thus avoiding accumulating somatic mutations. However, quantitating the extent of non-random DNA strand segregation in human stem cells remains difficult <i>in vivo</i>. Here we show that the change of the mean and variance of the mutational burden with age in healthy human tissues allows estimating strand segregation probabilities and somatic mutation rates. We analysed deep sequencing data from healthy human colon, small intestine, liver, skin and brain. We found highly effective non-random DNA strand segregation in all adult tissues (mean strand segregation probability: 0.98, standard error bounds (0.97,0.99)). In contrast, non-random strand segregation efficiency is reduced to 0.87 (0.78,0.88) in neural tissue during early development, suggesting stem cell pool expansions due to symmetric self-renewal. Healthy somatic mutation rates differed across tissue types, ranging from 3.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>/bp/division in small intestine to 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup>/bp/division in skin.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JlwnjY5R61I" width="1" />

<p>by Ya-Zhou Shi, Lei Jin, Chen-Jie Feng, Ya-Lan Tan, Zhi-Jie Tan</p>

RNA pseudoknots are a kind of minimal RNA tertiary structural motifs, and their three-dimensional (3D) structures and stability play essential roles in a variety of biological functions. Therefore, to predict 3D structures and stability of RNA pseudoknots is essential for understanding their functions. In the work, we employed our previously developed coarse-grained model with implicit salt to make extensive predictions and comprehensive analyses on the 3D structures and stability for RNA pseudoknots in monovalent/divalent ion solutions. The comparisons with available experimental data show that our model can successfully predict the 3D structures of RNA pseudoknots from their sequences, and can also make reliable predictions for the stability of RNA pseudoknots with different lengths and sequences over a wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations. Furthermore, we made comprehensive analyses on the unfolding pathway for various RNA pseudoknots in ion solutions. Our analyses for extensive pseudokonts and the wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations verify that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots is mainly dependent on the relative stability of unfolded intermediate states, and show that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots can be significantly modulated by their sequences and solution ion conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VbDC_Iw4jyk" width="1" />

<p>by Shivam Gupta, Julien Varennes, Hendrik C. Korswagen, Andrew Mugler</p>

Important cellular processes such as migration, differentiation, and development often rely on precise timing. Yet, the molecular machinery that regulates timing is inherently noisy. How do cells achieve precise timing with noisy components? We investigate this question using a first-passage-time approach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance threshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a diminishing repressor. We find that either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated strategy. The optimal regulation corresponds to a nonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time, arises from a tradeoff between minimizing the timing noise of the regulator and that of the target molecule itself, and is robust to additional effects such as bursts and cell division. Our results are in quantitative agreement with the nonlinear increase and low noise of <i>mig-1</i> gene expression in migrating neuroblast cells during <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> development. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation may be a simple and powerful strategy for precise cellular timing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5cQl5NSCSNQ" width="1" />

The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a complex, multifactorial disorder that develops slowly over time presenting itself with large differences among MetS patients. We applied a systems biology approach to describe and predict the onset and progressive development of MetS, in a study that combined <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in silico</i> models. A new data-driven, physiological model (MINGLeD: Model INtegrating Glucose and Lipid Dynamics) was developed, describing glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Since classic kinetic models cannot describe slowly progressing disorders, a simulation method (ADAPT) was used to describe longitudinal dynamics and to predict metabolic concentrations and fluxes. This approach yielded a novel model that can describe long-term MetS development and progression. This model was integrated with longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> data that was obtained from male APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for three months and that developed MetS as reflected by classical symptoms including obesity and glucose intolerance. Two distinct subgroups were identified: those who developed dyslipidemia, and those who did not. The combination of MINGLeD with ADAPT could correctly predict both phenotypes, without making any prior assumptions about changes in kinetic rates or metabolic regulation. Modeling and flux trajectory analysis revealed that differences in liver fluxes and dietary cholesterol absorption could explain this occurrence of the two different phenotypes. In individual mice with dyslipidemia dietary cholesterol absorption and hepatic turnover of metabolites, including lipid fluxes, were higher compared to those without dyslipidemia. Predicted differences were also observed in gene expression data, and consistent with the emergence of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, two well-known MetS co-morbidities. Whereas MINGLeD specifically models the metabolic derangements underlying MetS, the simulation method ADAPT is generic and can be applied to other diseases where dynamic modeling and longitudinal data are available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MIj7qbH_8I8" width="1" />

Vijayraghavan et al. report that muscarinic M1 receptor blockade did not reproduce the effects of general muscarinic antagonism on maintenance of behavioral rules in prefrontal cortical neurons. M1 receptor stimulation consistently inhibited prefrontal neurons and overstimulation disrupted maintenance of rules.

Valadas et al. show that ER lipid imbalance causes sleep pattern defects in Parkinson’s disease by preventing the formation of secretory vesicles required for the release of the neuropeptides. Restoring the ER lipid balance by supplementation with phosphatidylserine rescues the cellular and behavioral defects.

Zhang et al. use direct human brain recordings to show that neural oscillations are spatially propagating waves that move across the cortex. The results show that oscillations coordinate activity between brain regions rather than being a local phenomenon.

The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) is located on presynaptic neurons, where it plays an essential role in limiting dopaminergic signaling by temporarily curtailing high neurotransmitter concentration through rapid re-uptake. Transport by hDAT is energized by transmembrane ionic gradients. Dysfunction of this transporter leads to disease states, such as Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder or depression. It has been shown that hDAT and other members of the monoamine transporter family exist in oligomeric forms at the plasma membrane. Several residues are known to be involved in oligomerization, but interaction interfaces, oligomer orientation and the quarternary arrangement in the plasma membrane remain poorly understood. Here we examine oligomeric forms of hDAT using a direct approach, by following dimerization of two randomly-oriented hDAT transporters in 512 independent simulations, each being 2 μs in length. We employed the DAFT (docking assay for transmembrane components) approach, which is an unbiased molecular dynamics simulation method to identify oligomers, their conformations and populations. The overall ensemble of a total of &gt;1 ms simulation time revealed a limited number of symmetric and asymmetric dimers. The identified dimer interfaces include all residues known to be involved in dimerization. Importantly, we find that the surface of the bundle domain is largely excluded from engaging in dimeric interfaces. Such an interaction would typically lead to inhibition by stabilization of one conformation, while substrate transport relies on a large scale rotation between the inward-facing and the outward-facing state.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EkmGr5vNPfk" width="1" />

<p>by Lucas Boczkowski, Emanuele Natale, Ofer Feinerman, Amos Korman</p>

Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. We study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task. We present an impossibility result which strongly restricts reliable rumor spreading in such groups. Namely, we prove that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources—a process which requires linear time in the population size. Our results imply that in order to achieve efficient rumor spread a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise. We then corroborate this claim by providing new analyses of experimental data regarding recruitment in <i>Cataglyphis niger</i> desert ants. Finally, in light of our theoretical results, we discuss strategies to overcome noise in other biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-ijtk1KgGA" width="1" />

<p>by Koichi Higashi, Shinya Suzuki, Shin Kurosawa, Hiroshi Mori, Ken Kurokawa</p>

As data for microbial community structures found in various environments has increased, studies have examined the relationship between environmental labels given to retrieved microbial samples and their community structures. However, because environments continuously change over time and space, mixed states of some environments and its effects on community formation should be considered, instead of evaluating effects of discrete environmental categories. Here we applied a hierarchical Bayesian model to paired datasets containing more than 30,000 samples of microbial community structures and sample description documents. From the training results, we extracted latent environmental topics that associate co-occurring microbes with co-occurring word sets among samples. Topics are the core elements of environmental mixtures and the visualization of topic-based samples clarifies the connections of various environments. Based on the model training results, we developed a web application, LEA (Latent Environment Allocation), which provides the way to evaluate typicality and heterogeneity of microbial communities in newly obtained samples without confining environmental categories to be compared. Because topics link words and microbes, LEA also enables to search samples semantically related to the query out of 30,000 microbiome samples.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o92_2kUTykI" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Presurgical planning for brain tumor resection aims at delineating eloquent tissue in the vicinity of the lesion to spare during surgery. To this end, noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging fiber tracking are currently employed. However, taking into account this information is often still insufficient, as the complex nonlinear dynamics of the brain impede straightforward prediction of functional outcome after surgical intervention. Large-scale brain network modeling carries the potential to bridge this gap by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to predict collective brain dynamics. As a first step in this direction, an appropriate computational model has to be selected, after which suitable model parameter values have to be determined. To this end, we simulated large-scale brain dynamics in 25 human brain tumor patients and 11 human control participants using The Virtual Brain, an open-source neuroinformatics platform. Local and global model parameters of the Reduced Wong–Wang model were individually optimized and compared between brain tumor patients and control subjects. In addition, the relationship between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed (1) significantly improved prediction accuracy of individual functional connectivity when using individually optimized model parameters; (2) local model parameters that can differentiate between regions directly affected by a tumor, regions distant from a tumor, and regions in a healthy brain; and (3) interesting associations between individually optimized model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/23/5429?rss=1">Reciprocal Negative Regulation Between Lmx1a and Lmo4 Is Required for Inner Ear Formation</a></h4>

<p>LIM-domain containing transcription factors (LIM-TFs) are conserved factors important for embryogenesis. The specificity of these factors in transcriptional regulation is conferred by the complexes that they form with other proteins such as LIM-domain-binding (Ldb) proteins and LIM-domain only (LMO) proteins. Unlike LIM-TFs, these proteins do not bind DNA directly. LMO proteins are negative regulators of LIM-TFs and function by competing with LIM-TFs for binding to Ldb's. Although the LIM-TF Lmx1a is expressed in the developing mouse hindbrain, which provides many of the extrinsic signals for inner ear formation, conditional knock-out embryos of both sexes show that the inner ear source of Lmx1a is the major contributor of ear patterning. In addition, we have found that the reciprocal interaction between Lmx1a and Lmo4 (a LMO protein within the inner ear) mediates the formation of both vestibular and auditory structures. Lmo4 negatively regulates Lmx1a to form the three sensory cristae, the anterior semicircular canal, and the shape of the utricle in the vestibule. Furthermore, this negative regulation blocks ectopic sensory formation in the cochlea. In contrast, Lmx1a negatively regulates Lmo4 in mediating epithelial resorption of the canal pouch, which gives rise to the anterior and posterior semicircular canals. We also found that Lmx1a is independently required for the formation of the endolymphatic duct and hair cells in the basal cochlear region.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian inner ear is a structurally complex organ responsible for detecting sound and maintaining balance. Failure to form the intricate 3D structure of this organ properly during development most likely will result in sensory deficits on some level. Here, we provide genetic evidence that a transcription factor, Lmx1a, interacts with its negative regulator, Lmo4, to pattern various vestibular and auditory components of the mammalian inner ear. Identifying these key molecules that mediate formation of this important sensory organ will be helpful for designing strategies and therapeutics to alleviate hearing loss and balance disorders.</p>

<p>BDNF is a growth factor with important roles in the nervous system in both physiological and pathological conditions, but the mechanisms controlling its secretion are not completely understood. Here, we show that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion in neurons from the CNS and PNS. Downregulation of the ARMS/Kidins220 protein in the adult mouse brain increases regulated BDNF secretion, leading to its accumulation in the striatum. Interestingly, two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) showed increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and regulated BDNF secretion deficits. Importantly, reduction of ARMS/Kidins220 in hippocampal slices from HD mice reversed the impaired regulated BDNF release. Moreover, there are increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and PFC of patients with HD. ARMS/Kidins220 regulates Synaptotagmin-IV levels, which has been previously observed to modulate BDNF secretion. These data indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 controls the regulated secretion of BDNF and might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> BDNF is an important growth factor that plays a fundamental role in the correct functioning of the CNS. The secretion of BDNF must be properly controlled to exert its functions, but the proteins regulating its release are not completely known. Using neuronal cultures and a new conditional mouse to modulate ARMS/Kidins220 protein, we report that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion. Moreover, ARMS/Kidins220 is overexpressed in two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD), causing an impaired regulation of BDNF secretion. Furthermore, ARMS/Kidins220 levels are increased in brain samples from HD patients. Future studies should address whether ARMS/Kidins220 has any function on the pathophysiology of HD.</p>

<p>Severed axon tips reform growth cones following spinal cord injury that fail to regenerate, in part, because they become embedded within an inhibitory extracellular matrix. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are the major axon inhibitory matrix component that is increased within the lesion scar and in perineuronal nets around deafferented neurons. We have recently developed a novel peptide modulator (intracellular sigma peptide) of the cognate receptor of CSPGs, protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP), which has been shown to markedly improve sensorimotor function, micturition, and coordinated locomotor behavior in spinal cord contused rats. However, the mechanism(s) underlying how modulation of RPTP mediates axon outgrowth through inhibitory CSPGs remain unclear. Here, we describe how intracellular sigma peptide modulation of RPTP induces enhanced protease Cathepsin B activity. Using DRG neurons from female Sprague Dawley rats cultured on an aggrecan/laminin spot assay and a combination of biochemical techniques, we provide evidence suggesting that modulation of RPTP regulates secretion of proteases that, in turn, relieves CSPG inhibition through its digestion to allow axon migration though proteoglycan barriers. Understanding the mechanisms underlying RPTP modulation elucidates how axon regeneration is impaired by proteoglycans but can then be facilitated following injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Following spinal cord injury, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) upregulate and potently inhibit axon regeneration and functional recovery. Protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP) has been identified as a critical cognate receptor of CSPGs. We have previously characterized a synthetic peptide (intracellular sigma peptide) that targets the regulatory intracellular domain of the receptor to allow axons to regenerate despite the presence of CSPGs. Here, we have found that one important mechanism by which peptide modulation of the receptor enhances axon outgrowth is through secretion of a protease, Cathepsin B, which enables digestion of CSPGs. This work links protease secretion to the CSPG receptor RPTP for the first time with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neural regeneration and plasticity.</p>

Abstract<p>Animals and humans rapidly detect specific features of sounds, but the time courses of the underlying neural response for different stimulus categories is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intricate functional organization of auditory information processing pathways is poorly understood. Here, we computed neuronal response latencies from simultaneously recorded spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) along the first two stages of cortical sound processing, primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt (LB), of awake, behaving macaques. Two types of response latencies were measured for spike trains as well as LFPs: 1) <i>Onset latency,</i> time-locked to onset of external auditory stimuli, and 2) <i>selection latency,</i> time taken from stimulus onset to a selective response to a specific stimulus category. Trial-by-trial LFP onset latencies predominantly reflecting synaptic input arrival typically preceded spike onset latencies, assumed to be representative of neuronal output indicating that both areas may receive input environmental signals and relay the information to the next stage. In A1, simple sounds, such as pure tones, yielded shorter spike onset latencies compared to complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations (‘coos’). This trend was reversed in LB, indicating a hierarchical functional organization of auditory cortex in the macaque. LFP selection latencies in A1 were always shorter than those in LB for both PT and Coo reflecting the serial arrival of stimulus-specific information in these areas. Thus, chronometry on spike-LFP signals revealed some of the effective neural circuitry underlying complex sound discrimination.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Auditory core (A1) and lateral belt (LB) areas are key subdivisions of auditory cortex. A1 plays crucial role in processing of simple stimuli such as pure tones whereas LB for processing of complex sounds. Both areas receive direct inputs from medial geniculate nucleus and have recurrent connections. Nonetheless, the functional connectivity patterns between these subdivisions while processing different sound categories are poorly understood. Using simultaneous spike-LFP recordings our study reveals that information about the presence of a stimuli in the environment arrive concurrently in core and LB, however the information related to neuronal discrimination may arrive at different times indicating both parallel and serial information transmission pathways exist and their presence is guided by the context of the task.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Learning to associate stressful events with specific environmental contexts depends on excitatory transmission in the hippocampus, but how this information is transmitted to the neocortex for lasting memory storage is unclear. We identified dorsal hippocampal (DH) projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), which arise mainly from the subiculum and contain either the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) or vGlut2. Both vGlut1<sup>+</sup> and vGlut2<sup>+</sup> axons strongly excite and disynaptically inhibit RSC pyramidal neurons in superficial layers, but vGlut2<sup>+</sup> axons trigger greater inhibition that spreads to deep layers, indicating that these pathways engage RSC circuits via partially redundant, partially differentiated cellular mechanisms. Using contextual fear conditioning in mice to model contextual associative memories, together with chemogenetic axonal silencing, we found that vGlut1<sup>+</sup> projections are principally involved in processing recent context memories whereas vGlut2<sup>+</sup> projections contribute to their long-lasting storage. Thus, within the DH→RSC pathway, engagement of vGlut1<sup>+</sup> and vGlut2<sup>+</sup> circuits differentially contribute to the formation and persistence of fear-inducing context memories.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The dentate gyrus, the entry gate to the hippocampus, comprises 3 types of glutamatergic cells, the granule, the mossy and the semilunar granule cells. Whereas accumulating evidence indicates that specification of subclasses of neocortical neurons starts at the time of their final mitotic divisions, when cellular diversity is specified in the Dentate Gyrus remains largely unknown. Here we show that semilunar cells, like mossy cells, originate from the earliest stages of developmental neurogenesis and that early born neurons form age-matched circuits with each other. Besides morphology, adult semilunar cells display characteristic electrophysiological features that differ from most neurons but are shared among early born granule cells. Therefore, an early birthdate specifies adult granule cell physiology and connectivity whereas additional factors may combine to produce morphological identity.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>An influential account of reading holds that words with exceptional spelling-to-sound correspondences (e.g., PINT) are read via activation of their lexical-semantic representations, supported by the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). This account has been inconclusive because it is based on neuropsychological evidence, in which lesion-deficit relationships are difficult to localize precisely, and functional neuroimaging data, which is spatially precise but cannot demonstrate whether the ATL activity is necessary for exception word reading. To address these issues, we used a technique with good spatial specificity—repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)—to demonstrate a necessary role of ATL in exception word reading. Following rTMS to left ventral ATL, healthy Japanese adults made more regularization errors in reading Japanese exception words. We successfully simulated these results in a computational model in which exception word reading was underpinned by semantic activations. The ATL is critically and selectively involved in reading exception words.</span>

Here, we propose a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating individual-specific cortical networks and investigate whether individual-specific network topography can predict human behavior. The multiple layers of the MS-HBM explicitly differentiate intra-subject (within-subject) from inter-subject (between-subject) network variability. By ignoring intra-subject variability, previous network mappings might confuse intra-subject variability for inter-subject differences. Compared with other approaches, MS-HBM parcellations generalized better to new rs-fMRI and task-fMRI data from the same subjects. More specifically, MS-HBM parcellations estimated from a single rs-fMRI session (10 min) showed comparable generalizability as parcellations estimated by 2 state-of-the-art methods using 5 sessions (50 min). We also showed that behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality, and emotion could be predicted by individual-specific network topography with modest accuracy, comparable to previous reports predicting phenotypes based on connectivity strength. Network topography estimated by MS-HBM was more effective for behavioral prediction than network size, as well as network topography estimated by other parcellation approaches. Thus, similar to connectivity <span style="font-style: italic;">strength</span>, individual-specific network <span style="font-style: italic;">topography</span> might also serve as a fingerprint of human behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hallmark pathology underlying Parkinson disease (PD) is progressive synucleinopathy, beginning in caudal brainstem that later spreads rostrally. However, the primarily subcortical pathology fails to account for the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in PD. To reconcile these observations, resting-state functional dysfunction across connectivity (FC) can be used to examine dysfunction across distributed brain networks. We measured FC in a large, single-site study of nondemented PD (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 107; OFF medications) and healthy controls (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 46) incorporating rigorous quality control measures and comprehensive sampling of cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions. We employed novel statistical approaches to determine group differences across the entire connectome, at the network-level, and for select brain regions. Group differences respected well-characterized network delineations producing a striking “block-wise” pattern of network-to-network effects. Surprisingly, these results demonstrate that the greatest FC differences involve sensorimotor, thalamic, and cerebellar networks, with notably smaller striatal effects. Split-half replication demonstrates the robustness of these results. Finally, block-wise FC correlations with behavior suggest that FC disruptions may contribute to clinical manifestations in PD. Overall, these results indicate a concerted breakdown of functional network interactions, remote from primary pathophysiology, and suggest that FC deficits in PD are related to emergent network-level phenomena rather than focal pathology.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Modifications of neuronal migration during development, including processes that control cortical lamination are associated with functional deficits at adult stage. Here, we report for the first time that the lack of the serine protease tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA), previously characterized as a neuromodulator and a gliotransmitter, leads to an altered cortical lamination in adult. This results in a neuronal migration defect of tPA deficient neurons which are stopped in the intermediate zone at E16. This phenotype is rescued by re-expressing a wild-type tPA in cortical neurons at E14 but not by a tPA that cannot interact with NMDAR. We thus hypothetized that the tPA produced by cortical neuronal progenitors can control their own radial migration through a mechanism dependent of NMDAR expressed at the surface of radial glial cells (RGC). Accordingly, conditional deletion of tPA in neuronal progenitors at E14 or overexpression of a dominant-negative NMDAR that cannot bind tPA in RGC also delayed neuronal migration. Moreover, the lack of tPA lead to an impaired maturation and orientation of RGC. These data provide the first demonstration that the neuronal serine protease tPA is an actor of a proper corticogenesis by its ability to control NMDAR signaling in RGC.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent studies of semantic memory have focused on dissociating the neural bases of two foundational components of human thought: taxonomic categories, which group similar objects like dogs and seals based on features, and thematic categories, which group dissimilar objects like dogs and leashes based on events. While there is emerging consensus that taxonomic concepts are represented in the anterior temporal lobe, there is disagreement over whether thematic concepts are represented in the angular gyrus (AG). We previously found AG sensitivity to both kinds of concepts; however, some accounts suggest that such activity reflects inhibition of irrelevant information rather than thematic activation. To test these possibilities, an fMRI experiment investigated both types of conceptual relations in the AG during two semantic judgment tasks. Each task trained participants to give negative responses (inhibition) or positive responses (activation) to word pairs based on taxonomic and thematic criteria of relatedness. Results showed AG engagement during both negative judgments and thematic judgments, but not during positive judgments about taxonomic pairs. Together, the results suggest that activity in the AG reflects functions that include both thematic (but not taxonomic) processing and inhibiting irrelevant semantic information.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>One critical feature of any well-engineered system is its resilience to perturbation and minor damage. The purpose of the current study was to investigate how resilience is achieved in higher cognitive systems, which we explored through the domain of semantic cognition. Convergent evidence implicates the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) as a conceptual knowledge hub. While bilateral damage to this region produces profound semantic impairment, unilateral atrophy/resection or transient perturbation has a limited effect. Two neural mechanisms might underpin this resilience to unilateral ATL damage: 1) the undamaged ATL upregulates its activation in order to compensate; and/or 2) prefrontal regions involved in control of semantic retrieval upregulate to compensate for the impoverished semantic representations that follow from ATL damage. To test these possibilities, 34 postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 20 age-matched controls were scanned whilst completing semantic tasks. Pictorial tasks, which produced bilateral frontal and temporal activation, showed few activation differences between patients and control participants. Written word tasks, however, produced a left-lateralized activation pattern and greater differences between the groups. Patients with right ATL resection increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Patients with left ATL resection upregulated both the right ATL and right IFG. Consistent with recent computational models, these results indicate that 1) written word semantic processing in patients with ATL resection is supported by upregulation of semantic knowledge and control regions, principally in the undamaged hemisphere, and 2) pictorial semantic processing is less affected, presumably because it draws on a more bilateral network.</span>

Mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modifications, are involved in multiple aspects of neuronal function and development. Recent discoveries have shed light on critical functions of chromatin in the aging brain, with an emerging realization that the maintenance of a healthy brain relies heavily on epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we present recent advances, with a focus on histone modifications and the implications for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Abstract
<p>Action potentials (APs) are electric phenomena that are recorded both intracellularly and extracellularly. APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at the onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature [the extracellular AP (EAP)] generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. The soma–dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic extracellular potentials recorded in the brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0046-18.2018v1?rss=1">Behavioral Phenotyping of an Improved Mouse Model of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome with a Complete Deletion of the Shank3 Gene</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a rare genetic disorder in which one copy of the <i>SHANK3</i> gene is missing or mutated, leading to a global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism. Multiple intragenic promoters and alternatively spliced exons are responsible for the formation of numerous isoforms. Many genetically-modified mouse models of PMS have been generated but most disrupt only some of the isoforms. In contrast, the vast majority of known <i>SHANK3</i> mutations found in patients involve deletions that disrupt all isoforms. Here, we report the production and thorough behavioral characterization of a new mouse model in which all <i>Shank3</i> isoforms are disrupted. Domains and tasks examined in adults included measures of general health, neurological reflexes, motor abilities, sensory reactivity, social behavior, repetitive behaviors, cognition and behavioral inflexibility and anxiety. Our mice are more severely affected than previously published models. While the deficits were typically more pronounced in homozygotes, an intermediate phenotype was observed for heterozygotes in many paradigms. As in other <i>Shank3</i> mouse models, stereotypies, including increased grooming, were observed. Additionally, sensory alterations were detected in both neonatal and adult mice and motor behavior was strongly altered, especially in the open field and rotarod locomotor tests. While social behaviors measured with the 3-chambered social approach and male-female interaction tests were not strongly impacted, Shank3-deficient mice displayed a strong escape behavior and avoidance of inanimate objects in novel object recognition, repetitive novel object contact, marble burying and nest building tasks, indicating increased novelty-induced anxiety. Similarly, increased freezing was observed during fear conditioning training and amygdala-dependent cued retrieval. Finally, deficits were observed in both initial training and reversal in the Barnes maze and in contextual fear memory that are memory tasks involving hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. In contrast, working memory in the Y-maze spontaneous alternation test was not altered. This new mouse model of PMS, engineered to most closely represent human mutations, recapitulates core symptoms of PMS providing improvements for both construct and face validity, compared to previous models.</p><p><b>Significant Statement</b> Phelan-McDermid syndrome, caused by happloinsufficiency of <i>Shank3</i>, is a severe and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This study investigates the behavioral consequences of a disruption of all <i>Shank3</i> isoforms in neonatal and adult mice using a detailed battery o<i>f</i> tests tailored to investigate core symptoms and usual comorbidities of PMS. We found that our new model is more severely affected than previously published mouse models with only partial deletions of <i>Shank3</i> and more closely recapitulates symptoms of PMS thus providing improvements for both construct and face validity. Our results highlight the significance of using a mouse model with a complete deletion of <i>Shank3</i> for studying mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder and PMS, carrying preclinical studies and testing test novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

Abstract
<p>Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are distinct from neighboring CA1 in that they resist synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 Schaffer collateral synapses. Regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin and CaMKII. Here, we investigated whether RGS14 regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We found that the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses caused by genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report that RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.</p>

Abstract
<p>Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation (e.g. surgery, infection, or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood, but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging (24-mo-old) F344xBN rats generally do not show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However, their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge (an intraperitoneal injection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> or laparotomy). Their hippocampal levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β are significantly elevated for at least 8 d, but generally less than 14 d, after infection or surgery. This IL-1β elevation is mirrored by prolonged deficits in a hippocampus-dependent long-term memory task. In contrast, young (3-mo-old) counterparts exhibit only transient elevations in IL-1β that drop to near baseline levels within 24 h. We previously demonstrated that theta burst–evoked late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP)—a BDNF-dependent form of synaptic plasticity—is impaired in hippocampal area CA1 of aged animals 4 d after infection. Also, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF)—the protein isoform required for stabilization of L-LTP—are reduced in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes of aged animals at the same time point. In this study, we investigated whether the deficits in L-LTP and mBDNF persist in parallel with the elevation in IL-1β and impairment in memory. This was the case, consistent with the idea that an exaggerated brain inflammatory response may compromise memory consolidation in part by altering availability of mBDNF to stabilize memory-related synaptic plasticity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0159-18.2018v1?rss=1">Neurodynamic Evidence Supports a Forced-Excursion Model of Decision-Making under Speed/Accuracy Instructions</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Evolutionary pressures suggest that choices should be optimised to maximise rewards, by appropriately trading speed for accuracy. This speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) is commonly explained by variation in just the baseline-to-boundary distance, i.e. excursion, of accumulation-to-bound models of perceptual decision making. However, neural evidence is not consistent with this explanation. A compelling account of speeded choice should explain both overt behaviour and the full range of associated brain signatures. Here, we reconcile seemingly contradictory behavioural and neural findings. In two variants of the same experiment, we triangulated upon the neural underpinnings of the SAT in the human brain using both EEG and TMS. We found that distinct neural signals, namely the ERP centroparietal positivity (CPP) and a smoothed motor-evoked potential (MEP) signal, which have both previously been shown to relate to decision-related accumulation, revealed qualitatively similar average neurodynamic profiles with only subtle differences between SAT conditions. These signals were then modelled from behaviour by either incorporating traditional boundary variation or utilising a forced excursion. These model variants are mathematically equivalent, in terms of their behavioural predictions, hence providing identical fits to correct and erroneous reaction time distributions. However, the forced-excursion version instantiates SAT via a more global change in parameters and implied neural activity, a process conceptually akin to, but mathematically distinct from, urgency. This variant better captured both ERP and MEP neural profiles, suggesting that the SAT may be implemented via neural gain modulation, and reconciling standard modelling approaches with human neural data.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Successful organisms need to make the right choice fast. To make such decisions, we are regularly forced to trade speed for accuracy. This trade-off has been explained in behavioural models using a single free parameter reflecting response caution. However, neural evidence suggests that more widespread changes are associated with quick versus accurate decisions. Here, we suggest a model which reconciles these seemingly contradictory findings. This ‘forced-excursion’ model is mathematically equivalent to standard models of response caution but implies a global modulation in activity akin to a change in neural gain or urgency. Re-expressed in this way, the model is able to account for both behavioural and neural data from two separate neural recording techniques.</p>

As in all biological systems, neurons and their networks must balance precision with variability. Phenotypic precision and phenotypic variability can both occur with remarkable robustness, where robustness is defined as the ability to tolerate perturbation. Variability in genotype–phenotype mapping produces phenotypic variability despite identical genetic information. The resulting variability among genetically identical neurons can contribute to the robustness of brain development. Similarly, variability of genetically identical individuals can contribute to evolutionary robustness.

In 2012, Schaefer et al. revealed that microglia regulate the emergence of functional connectivity by engulfing and selectively eliminating synapses in the retinogeniculate system. This synaptic pruning mechanism, which is activity dependent and relies on the complement cascade, has helped define microglia as a central contributor to normal wiring and to brain disorders.

By the early 2000s there was strong support for the idea that synaptic function and plasticity required AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking through constitutive and regulated internalization and exocytosis. In 2002, Borgdorff and Choquet demonstrated that AMPA receptors could also diffuse laterally in the membrane and become stabilized near synapses. Subsequent studies extended this work, establishing a fundamental role for lateral diffusion in synaptic function and plasticity.

Today, we understand peptide transmitters to be signaling molecules that modulate neural activity. However, in 1982 little was known about neuropeptides and their role in neural communication. The influential 1982 paper by Jan and Jan reported definitive evidence that a presynaptically released neuropeptide evokes postsynaptic responses in an identified cholinergic synapse, thereby fueling a new era in neuroscience.

In 1992, Brose et al. showed that the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein p65/synaptotagmin (syt) 1 binds – in a mutually dependent manner – Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids, prompting the idea that it functions as a Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis. These findings now define two key aspects of excitation–secretion coupling.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) are engaged in various cognitive and affective processes. An influential account posits that the AI and dACC’s ubiquitous engagements reflect their role in the transient capture of attention by salient stimuli. Using fMRI here we tested this claim and functionally dissociated these regions. In the first experiment, we compared these regions’ responses to emotion-laden and emotion-neutral salient “oddball” movie events. We found that while the AI only responded transiently to the onset and offset of neutral events, its response to affective events was sustained, challenging the transient attention capture account. By contrast, dACC remained transient regardless of event type. A second experiment distinguished the information encoded by these brain regions with the presentation of behaviorally salient events that require either maintaining the current task set or updating to a different one; the AI was found to signal the presence of the behaviorally relevant events, while the dACC was associated with switching of attention settings in response to the events. We conclude that AI and dACC are involved in signaling the presence of potentially or de facto behaviorally significant events and updating internal attention settings in response to these events, respectively.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP25) is an essential component of the SNARE complex regulating synaptic vesicle fusion. SNAP25 deficiency has been implicated in a variety of cognitive disorders. We ablated SNAP25 from selected neuronal populations by generating a transgenic mouse (B6-Snap25tm3mcw (Snap25-flox)) with LoxP sites flanking exon5a/5b. In the presence of Cre-recombinase, Snap25-flox is recombined to a truncated transcript. Evoked synaptic vesicle release is severely reduced in Snap25 conditional knockout (cKO) neurons as shown by live cell imaging of synaptic vesicle fusion and whole cell patch clamp recordings in cultured hippocampal neurons. We studied Snap25 cKO in subsets of cortical projection neurons in vivo (L5—Rbp4-Cre; L6—Ntsr1-Cre; L6b—Drd1a-Cre). cKO neurons develop normal axonal projections, but axons are not maintained appropriately, showing signs of swelling, fragmentation and eventually complete absence. Onset and progression of degeneration are dependent on the neuron type, with L5 cells showing the earliest and most severe axonal loss. Ultrastructural examination revealed that cKO neurites contain autophagosome/lysosome-like structures. Markers of inflammation such as Iba1 and lipofuscin are increased only in adult cKO cortex. Snap25 cKO can provide a model to study genetic interactions with environmental influences in several disorders.</span>

Recent years have seen a flourishing literature on detection of circulating autoantibodies against neurotransmitter receptors in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. These studies have generated hope for a better understanding of the underlying molecular dysfunctions and for appropriate therapeutic strategies. However, the detection of these autoantibodies in healthy subjects, and the lack of mechanistic insights have fostered debate about the pathogenic role of such autoantibodies. Here, we specifically discuss the biological evidence linking autoantibodies directed against the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR-Abs) and psychosis, emphasising recent single-molecule imaging investigations that unveiled the impaired surface trafficking of NMDAR in the presence of NMDAR-Abs from psychotic patients.
