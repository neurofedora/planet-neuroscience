              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microtubule retrograde flow retains neuronal polarization in a fluctuating state</a></h4>

              
                In developing vertebrate neurons, a neurite is formed by more than a hundred microtubules. While individual microtubules are dynamic, the microtubule array itself has been regarded as stationary. Using live cell imaging in combination with photoconversion techniques and pharmacological manipulations, we uncovered that the microtubule array flows retrogradely within neurites to the soma. This microtubule retrograde flow drives cycles of microtubule density, a hallmark of the fluctuating state before axon formation. Shortly after axon formation, microtubule retrograde flow slows down in the axon, which stabilizes microtubule density cycles and thereby functions as a molecular wedge to enable axon extension. We propose microtubule retrograde flow and its specific slowdown in the axon to be the long-sought mechanism to single one neurite out to drive neuronal polarization.

	<p>Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are considered common facilitating factors, along with other infections, in triggering febrile seizures (FS). The main purpose of our study was to identify specific inflammatory patterns of UTI cases from other infections in a specific cluster, using a combination of inflammatory biomarkers to differentiate UTIs from other bacterial diseases triggering FS. Method: This prospective study included a number of 136 patients with 197 distinct FS events, from patients hospitalized in the Pediatric Clinical Hospital Sibiu, among which 10.2% were diagnosed with UTIs. Results: In one-third of the patients with UTIs (20 cases), the symptoms were limited to fever and FS. Using two-step cluster analysis, a distinct UTI inflammatory pattern has emerged: highest platelet values (PLT), median value 331 × 103/mm3 and intermediate C-reactive protein (CRP), median value 15 mg/dL, platelet distribution width (PDW), median value 9.65%, platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR), median value 14.45%, mean platelet volume (MPV), median value 8.60 fL and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte values (NLR), median value 3.64. Furthermore, higher PDW (median value 12.25%), P-LCR (median value 28.55%), MPV (median value 10.40 fL), CRP (median value 74.00 mg/dL) and NLR values (median value 4.11) were associated mainly (85.7%) with bacterial lower respiratory infections. UTIs were highly unlikely in these patients with significantly increased CRP values and normal values of platelet indices. Conclusions: Considering the nonspecific clinical picture of UTIs at an early age, to optimize the management of FS, a fast diagnosis of UTI is mandatory. The analysis of the inflammatory biomarker clusters (rather than individual parameters) correlated with urine leukocyte and nitrite stick evaluation for specific age groups could help in identifying even oligosymptomatic UTIs patients. The study limitation (20 UTI cases) recommends future multicentric trials on larger datasets to validate the model.</p>

                In human neurodegenerative diseases, neurons can transfer toxic protein aggregates to surrounding cells, promoting pathology via poorly understood mechanisms.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obligate insect social parasites evolve traits to effectively locate and then exploit their hosts, whereas hosts have complex social behavioral repertoires, which include sensory recognition to reject potential conspecific intruders and heterospecific parasites. While social parasite and host behaviors have been studied extensively, less is known about how their sensory systems function to meet their specific selective pressures. Here, we compare investment in visual and olfactory brain regions in the paper wasp <i>Polistes dominula,</i> and its obligate social parasite <i>P. sulcifer,</i> to explore the link among sensory systems and brain, and behavior. Our results show relative significant volumetric differences between these two closely-related species, consistent with their very different life-histories. Social parasites show proportionally larger optic lobes and central complex to likely navigate long-distance migrations and unfamiliar landscapes to locate the specific species of hosts they usurp. Contrastingly, hosts have larger antennal lobes and calyces of the mushroom bodies compared with social parasites, as predicted by their sensory means to maintain social cohesion via olfactory signals, allocate colony tasks, forage, and recognize con- and heterospecific intruders. Our present work suggests how this tradeoff between visual and olfactory brain regions may facilitate different sensory adaptations needed to perform social and foraging tasks by the host, including recognition of parasites, or to fly long distances and successful host localizing by the social parasite.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Bilateral convergence of external stimuli is a common feature of vertebrate sensory systems. This convergence of inputs from the bilateral receptive fields allows higher order sensory perception, such as depth perception in the vertebrate visual system and stimulus localization in the auditory system. The functional role of such bilateral convergence in the olfactory system is unknown. To test whether each olfactory bulb (OB) contributes a separate piece of olfactory information, and whether information from the bilateral OB is integrated, we synchronized the activation of OBs with blue light in mice expressing ChIEF in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and behaviorally assessed the relevance of dual OBs in olfactory perception. Our findings suggest that each OB contributes separate components of olfactory information, and the mice integrate the bilaterally synchronized olfactory information for olfactory identity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Laser Capture Microdissection of Single Neurons with Morphological Visualization Using Fluorescent Proteins Fused to Transmembrane Proteins</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gene expression analysis in individual neuronal types helps in understanding brain function. Genetic methods expressing fluorescent proteins are widely used to label specific neuronal populations. However, because cell type specificity of genetic labeling is often limited, it is advantageous to combine genetic labeling with additional methods to select specific cell/neuronal types. Laser capture microdissection is one of such techniques with which one can select a specific cell/neuronal population based on morphological observation. However, a major issue is the disappearance of fluorescence signals during the tissue processing that is required for high-quality sample preparation. Here, we developed a simple, novel method in which fluorescence signals are preserved. We use genetic labeling with fluorescence proteins fused to transmembrane proteins, which shows highly stable fluorescence retention and allows for the selection of fluorescent neurons/cells based on morphology. Using this method in mice, we laser-captured neuronal somata and successfully isolated RNA. We determined that ~100 cells are sufficient to obtain a sample required for downstream applications such as quantitative PCR. Capability to specifically microdissect targeted neurons was demonstrated by an ~10-fold increase in mRNA for fluorescent proteins in visually identified neurons expressing the fluorescent proteins compared with neighboring cells not expressing it. We applied this method to validate virus-mediated single-cell knockout, which showed up to 92% reduction in knocked-out gene RNA compared with wild-type neurons. This method using fluorescent proteins fused to transmembrane proteins provides a new, simple solution to perform gene expression analysis in sparsely labeled neuronal/cellular populations, which is especially advantageous when genetic labeling has limited specificity.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Kisspeptin-expressing neurons in the anteroventral-periventricular nucleus (AVPV) are part of a neural circuit generating the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge. This process is estradiol-dependent and occurs on the afternoon of proestrus in female mice. On proestrus, AVPV kisspeptin neurons express more kisspeptin and exhibit higher frequency action potentials and burst firing compared with diestrus, which is characterized by a pulsatile rather than a prolonged surge of GnRH secretion. We hypothesized changes in voltage-gated potassium conductances shape activity profiles of these cells in a cycle-dependent manner. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of GFP-identified AVPV kisspeptin neurons in brain slices from diestrous and proestrous mice revealed three subcomponents of the voltage-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> current: fast-transient slow-transient, and residual. During proestrus, the V<SUB>50</SUB> of inactivation of the fast-transient current was depolarized and the amplitude of the slow-transient component was reduced compared with diestrus; the residual component was consistent across both stages. Computational models were fit to experimental data, including published estrous-cycle effects on other voltage-gated currents. Computer simulations suggest proestrus-typical K<sup>+</sup> currents are suppressive compared with diestrus. Interestingly, larger T-type, persistent-sodium, and hyperpolarization-activated currents during proestrus compensate for this suppressive effect while also enabling postinhibitory rebound bursting. These findings suggest modulation of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and multiple subthreshold depolarizing currents across the negative to positive feedback transition maintain AVPV kisspeptin neuron excitability in response to depolarizing stimuli. These changes also enable firing in response to hyperpolarization, providing a net increase in neuronal excitability, which may contribute to activation of this population leading up to the preovulatory GnRH surge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Using citation tracking for systematic literature searching - study protocol for a scoping review of methodological studies and a Delphi study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Up-to-date guidance on comprehensive study identification for systematic reviews is crucial. According to current recommendations, systematic searching should combine electronic database searching with supplementary search methods. One such supplementary search method is citation tracking. It aims at collecting directly and/or indirectly cited and citing references from "seed references". Tailored and evidence-guided recommendations concerning the use of citation tracking are strongly needed. Objective: We intend to develop recommendations for the use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics. Our study will be guided by the following research questions: What is the benefit of citation tracking for systematic literature searching for health-related topics? Which methods, citation indexes, and other tools are used for citation tracking? What terminology is used for citation tracking methods? Methods: Our study will have two parts: a scoping review and a Delphi study. The scoping review aims at identifying methodological studies on the benefit and use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics with no restrictions on study design, language, and publication date. We will perform database searching in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection, two information science databases, web searching, and contact experts in the field. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection. We will conduct direct backward and forward citation tracking on included articles. Data from included studies will be extracted using a prespecified extraction sheet and presented in both tabular and narrative form. The results of the scoping review will inform the subsequent Delphi study through which we aim to derive consensus recommendations for the future practice and research of citation tracking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hospital quality monitoring and evaluation system using linked spreadsheets on Microsoft SharePoint [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Establishment of a systematic way of measurement and utilization of indicators for improvement is one of the most challenging issues in monitoring and evaluation of indicators in healthcare settings. In realizing these fundamental challenges, we designed a monitoring and evaluation system incorporating a hospital-wide quality variance report (QVR) system using linked Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets on Microsoft SharePoint®. Methods Indicators were determined at the departmental/unit level in line with the institutional goals, departmental functions, quality expectations, inputs/outputs, clinical priorities, compliance to policies/procedures/protocols/guidelines/pathways as well as in response to gaps in service delivery picked during root cause analyses. The sample design was determined in accordance with the characteristics of the population. Drawing of sample units was done using a simple random sampling technique without replacement or systematic random sampling. The indicator’s monitoring was enhanced visually by allocating colour codes based on performance across the months and quarters. The action plan tab consisted of a platform that aids in documenting corrective actions arising from the performance reviews. Results and discussion The QVR reporting system ensured a standardized format of monitoring throughout the institution with a reduced turnaround time from data collection to analysis. Further, continuity of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was guaranteed even if an individual left the institution.  The analysis of the QVR allowed hospital-wide trending on cross-cutting indicators with consequent ease of communication to multiple stakeholders.  The automation has saved time and increased accuracy which has enhanced credible engagements during quality meetings. Conclusions Use of this system greatly enhanced quality performance monitoring in the hospital, identification of major bottlenecks that warranted hospital-wide projects or departmental-level projects. The QVR system enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of quality monitoring from data collection through to performance reviews. The QVR structure allows for customized development of an M&E database application software.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Differential contribution to gene expression prediction of histone modifications at enhancers or promoters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mar González-Ramírez, Cecilia Ballaré, Francesca Mugianesi, Malte Beringer, Alexandra Santanach, Enrique Blanco, Luciano Di Croce</p>

The ChIP-seq signal of histone modifications at promoters is a good predictor of gene expression in different cellular contexts, but whether this is also true at enhancers is not clear. To address this issue, we develop quantitative models to characterize the relationship of gene expression with histone modifications at enhancers or promoters. We use embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which contain a full spectrum of active and repressed (poised) enhancers, to train predictive models. As many poised enhancers in ESCs switch towards an active state during differentiation, predictive models can also be trained on poised enhancers throughout differentiation and in development. Remarkably, we determine that histone modifications at enhancers, as well as promoters, are predictive of gene expression in ESCs and throughout differentiation and development. Importantly, we demonstrate that their contribution to the predictive models varies depending on their location in enhancers or promoters. Moreover, we use a local regression (LOESS) to normalize sequencing data from different sources, which allows us to apply predictive models trained in a specific cellular context to a different one. We conclude that the relationship between gene expression and histone modifications at enhancers is universal and different from promoters. Our study provides new insight into how histone modifications relate to gene expression based on their location in enhancers or promoters.

Mathematical models are powerful tools in HIV epidemiology, producing quantitative projections of key indicators such as HIV incidence and prevalence. In order to improve the accuracy of predictions, such models need to incorporate a number of behavioural and biological heterogeneities, especially those related to the sexual network within which HIV transmission occurs. An individual-based model, which explicitly models sexual partnerships, is thus often the most natural type of model to choose. In this paper we present PopART-IBM, a computationally efficient individual-based model capable of simulating 50 years of an HIV epidemic in a large, high-prevalence community in under a minute. We show how the model calibrates within a Bayesian inference framework to detailed age- and sex-stratified data from multiple sources on HIV prevalence, awareness of HIV status, ART status, and viral suppression for an HPTN 071 (PopART) study community in Zambia, and present future projections of HIV prevalence and incidence for this community in the absence of trial intervention.

With the increasing ability to use high-throughput next-generation sequencing to quantify the diversity of the human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, the ability to use TCR sequences to infer antigen-specificity could greatly aid potential diagnostics and therapeutics. Here, we use a machine-learning approach known as Restricted Boltzmann Machine to develop a sequence-based inference approach to identify antigen-specific TCRs. Our approach combines probabilistic models of TCR sequences with clone abundance information to extract TCR sequence motifs central to an antigen-specific response. We use this model to identify patient personalized TCR motifs that respond to individual tumor and infectious disease antigens, and to accurately discriminate specific from non-specific responses. Furthermore, the hidden structure of the model results in an interpretable representation space where TCRs responding to the same antigen cluster, correctly discriminating the response of TCR to different viral epitopes. The model can be used to identify condition specific responding TCRs. We focus on the examples of TCRs reactive to candidate neoantigens and selected epitopes in experiments of stimulated TCR clone expansion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Relaxing restrictions at the pace of vaccination increases freedom and guards against further COVID-19 waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simon Bauer, Sebastian Contreras, Jonas Dehning, Matthias Linden, Emil Iftekhar, Sebastian B. Mohr, Alvaro Olivera-Nappa, Viola Priesemann</p>

Mass vaccination offers a promising exit strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as vaccination progresses, demands to lift restrictions increase, despite most of the population remaining susceptible. Using our age-stratified SEIRD-ICU compartmental model and curated epidemiological and vaccination data, we quantified the rate (relative to vaccination progress) at which countries can lift non-pharmaceutical interventions without overwhelming their healthcare systems. We analyzed scenarios ranging from immediately lifting restrictions (accepting high mortality and morbidity) to reducing case numbers to a level where test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) programs efficiently compensate for local spreading events. In general, the age-dependent vaccination roll-out implies a transient decrease of more than ten years in the average age of ICU patients and deceased. The pace of vaccination determines the speed of lifting restrictions; Taking the European Union (EU) as an example case, all considered scenarios allow for steadily increasing contacts starting in May 2021 and relaxing most restrictions by autumn 2021. Throughout summer 2021, only mild contact restrictions will remain necessary. However, only high vaccine uptake can prevent further severe waves. Across EU countries, seroprevalence impacts the long-term success of vaccination campaigns more strongly than age demographics. In addition, we highlight the need for preventive measures to reduce contagion in school settings throughout the year 2021, where children might be drivers of contagion because of them remaining susceptible. Strategies that maintain low case numbers, instead of high ones, reduce infections and deaths by factors of eleven and five, respectively. In general, policies with low case numbers significantly benefit from vaccination, as the overall reduction in susceptibility will further diminish viral spread. Keeping case numbers low is the safest long-term strategy because it considerably reduces mortality and morbidity and offers better preparedness against emerging escape or more contagious virus variants while still allowing for higher contact numbers (freedom) with progressing vaccinations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Basis profile curve identification to understand electrical stimulation effects in human brain networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kai J. Miller, Klaus-Robert Müller, Dora Hermes</p>

Brain networks can be explored by delivering brief pulses of electrical current in one area while measuring voltage responses in other areas. We propose a convergent paradigm to study brain dynamics, focusing on a single brain site to observe the average effect of stimulating each of many other brain sites. Viewed in this manner, visually-apparent motifs in the temporal response shape emerge from adjacent stimulation sites. This work constructs and illustrates a data-driven approach to determine characteristic spatiotemporal structure in these response shapes, summarized by a set of unique “basis profile curves” (BPCs). Each BPC may be mapped back to underlying anatomy in a natural way, quantifying projection strength from each stimulation site using simple metrics. Our technique is demonstrated for an array of implanted brain surface electrodes in a human patient. This framework enables straightforward interpretation of single-pulse brain stimulation data, and can be applied generically to explore the diverse milieu of interactions that comprise the connectome.

                Background: Synthetic engineering of bacteria to produce industrial products is a burgeoning field of research and application. In order to optimize genome design, designers need to understand which genes are essential, which are optimal for growth, and locations in the genome that will be tolerated by the organism when inserting engineered cassettes. Methods: We present a pan-genome based method for the identification of core regions in a genome that are strongly conserved at the species level. Results: We show that the core regions determined by our method contain all or almost all essential genes. This demonstrates the accuracy of our method as essential genes should be core genes. We show that we outperform previous methods by this measure. We also explain why there are exceptions to this rule for our method. Conclusions: We assert that synthetic engineers should avoid deleting or inserting into these core regions unless they understand and are manipulating the function of the genes in that region. Similarly, if the designer wishes to streamline the genome, non-core regions and in particular low penetrance genes would be good targets for deletion. Care should be taken to remove entire cassettes with similar penetrance of the genes within cassettes as they may harbor toxin/antitoxin genes which need to be removed in tandem. The bioinformatic approach introduced here saves considerable time and effort relative to knockout studies on single isolates of a given species and captures a broad understanding of the conservation of genes that are core to a species.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Challenges on diagnosis and therapy of malignant adrenal oncocytic neoplasm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adrenal masses are common incidental findings, most of which are benign and non-functional. Malignant adrenal tumors, however, differ from their benign counterpart and confer poor prognosis. In addition, the oncocytic variants of these tumors present challenges to clinicians owing to their unique biologic behavior and rarity. Case presentation: We present a case report of a 61-year-old male with a T2N0M0 adrenocortical oncocytic neoplasm of the right adrenal gland. The patient complained of worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with a right adrenal mass after an abdominal CT-scan examination two weeks before. Subsequently, the patient underwent open adrenalectomy due to a history of abdominal surgery. Due to unique oncocytic biologic behavior, we used the Lin–Weiss–Bisceglia criteria to predict a malignancy instead of the Weiss system. We only found one malignant criterion, which showed a small tumor invasion on the vascular bed on one histopathological section. Thus, we diagnosed it as malignant adrenocortical oncocytic neoplasm. Furthermore, the PET Scan showed no residual mass or pathological metabolic activity on the tumor bed and metastatic sign. Conclusions: The diagnosis of the malignant oncocytic adrenal case is based on the histopathological criteria. Based on this case, we suggest a thorough histopathological examination to determine malignant criteria in adrenal neoplasm cases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Resource Description Framework reification for trustworthiness in knowledge graphs [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge graph (KG) publishes machine-readable representation of knowledge on the Web. Structured data in the knowledge graph is published using Resource Description Framework (RDF) where knowledge is represented as a triple (subject, predicate, object). Due to the presence of erroneous, outdated or conflicting data in the knowledge graph, the quality of facts cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the provenance of knowledge can assist in building up the trust of these knowledge graphs. In this paper, we have provided an analysis of popular, general knowledge graphs Wikidata and YAGO4 with regard to the representation of provenance and context data. Since RDF does not support metadata for providing provenance and contextualization, an alternate method, RDF reification is employed by most of the knowledge graphs. Trustworthiness of facts in knowledge graph can be enhanced by the addition of metadata like the source of information, location and time of the fact occurrence. Wikidata employs qualifiers to include metadata to facts, while YAGO4 collects metadata from Wikidata qualifiers. RDF reification increases the magnitude of data as several statements are required to represent a single fact. However, facts in Wikidata and YAGO4 can be fetched without using reification. Another limitation for applications that uses provenance data is that not all facts in these knowledge graphs are annotated with provenance data. Structured data in the knowledge graph is noisy. Therefore, the reliability of data in knowledge graphs can be increased by provenance data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the method and the extent of the addition of metadata of two prominent KGs, Wikidata and YAGO4.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptualizing an inquiry-based lingua-cultural learning through telecollaborative exchanges [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, telecollaboration has been gaining popularity among scholars, teachers, and students engaged in foreign language education because it facilitates the use of Internet-mediated communication tools to connect language and culture learners in geographically distant locations. Telecollaboration, as currently viewed in academic and classroom settings, places greater emphasis on the development of learners’ intercultural communicative competence. The problem with this approach is that this process may not consider the possibility that learners engaged in online intercultural exchanges could have limited or no knowledge about certain aspects of their own lingua-culture. We argue that, for learners to effectively share lingua-cultural knowledge with their online peers abroad, there must be a framework that supports the construction of learners’ own intra-cultural knowledge to provide a solid foundation for intercultural learning and communication. In this paper, we develop an inquiry-based model of telecollaboration incorporating both inquiry and online exchange based on the inquiry cycle, which includes engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation. This paper builds a case for the application of inquiry-based telecollaboration in a real classroom environment, which could not only help learners obtain and eventually share more authentic, deeper knowledge about their lingua-culture, but also promote informed intercultural exchange.

                Background: Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) is a highly infectious disease which causes huge economic losses to the poultry industry due to the direct impact of the illness and indirect consequences such as decreasing the general immunity of the flock, leaving it naive to other diseases. In Iraq, IBD is highly prevalent despite vaccination programs, yet studies on sequence diversity of the causative virus are still rare.  Methods: A sample from Bursa of Fabricius from an IBD outbreak in a flock in the city of Najaf in Iraq was smeared on an FTA card. Amplicons of targeted regions in VP1 and VP2 genes were generated and sequenced. Sequences were then compared with other local and global sequences downloaded from GenBank repositories. Sequence alignment and DNA sequence analyses were achieved using MUSCLE, UGENE and MEGAx software. The molecular clock and sequence evolutionary analyses were applied using MEGAx tools.  Results: The strain sequenced in this study belongs to a very virulent Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (vvIBDV) as the DNA and phylogenetic analysis of VP1 and VP2 gene sequences showed a mutual clustering with similar sequences belonging to vvIBDV genogroup 3. Analyses of the hyper variable region of VP2 gene (hvVP2) of IBDV isolates from Iraq indicates a presence of sequence diversity. Interestingly, the two vaccine strains Ventri IBDV Plus and ABIC MB71 that showed the highest sequence similarity to the local isolates in the hvVP2 region are not used in vaccination routine against IBDV in Iraq.  Conclusion: Sequences of vvIBDV in Iraq are diverse. Remarkably, some of the available vaccine strains show high sequence similarity with local strains in Iraq; however, they are not included in the routine vaccination programs. Analysis of more samples involving more geographical regions is needed to draw a detailed map of antigenic diversity of IBDV in Iraq.

                Human accelerated regions (HARs) are the fastest-evolving regions of the human genome. By interrogating the in vitro enhancer activity and in vivo epigenetic landscapes of more than 3,100 HARs during human neurodevelopment, we demonstrate that nearly half of all HARs act as neurodevelopmental enhancers. Further, we demonstrate PPP1R17 to be a putative HAR-regulated gene likely involved in human-specific cortical neurodevelopment.

                Videos of animal behavior are used to quantify researcher-defined behaviors-of-interest to study neural function, gene mutations, and pharmacological therapies. Behaviors-of-interest are often scored manually, which is time-consuming, limited to few behaviors, and variable across researchers. We created DeepEthogram: software that uses supervised machine learning to convert raw video pixels into an ethogram, the behaviors-of-interest present in each video frame. DeepEthogram is designed to be general-purpose and applicable across species, behaviors, and video-recording hardware. It uses convolutional neural networks to compute motion, extract features from motion and images, and classify features into behaviors. Behaviors are classified with above 90% accuracy on single frames in videos of mice and flies, matching expert-level human performance. DeepEthogram accurately predicts rare behaviors, requires little training data, and generalizes across subjects. A graphical interface allows beginning-to-end analysis without end-user programming. DeepEthogram's rapid, automatic, and reproducible labeling of researcher-defined behaviors-of-interest may accelerate and enhance supervised behavior analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ascorbic acid supports ex vivo generation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells from circulating hematopoietic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) constitute a rare type of immune cell with multifaceted functions, but their potential use as a cell-based immunotherapy is challenged by the scarce cell numbers that can be extracted from blood. Here, we systematically investigate culture parameters for generating pDCs from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using optimized conditions combined with implementation of HSPC pre-expansion, we generate an average of 465 million HSPC-derived pDCs (HSPC-pDCs) starting from 100,000 cord blood-derived HSPCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such protocol allows HSPC-pDC generation from whole blood HSPCs, and these cells display a pDC phenotype and function. Using GMP compliant medium, we observe a remarkable loss of TLR7/9 responses, which is rescued by ascorbic acid supplementation. Ascorbic acid induces transcriptional signatures associated with pDC-specific innate immune pathways suggesting an undescribed role of ascorbic acid for pDC functionality. This constitutes the first protocol for generating pDCs from whole blood, and lay the foundation for investigating HSPC-pDCs for cell-based immunotherapy.

                Although different animal species often exhibit extensive variation in many behaviors, typically scientists examine one or a small number of behaviors in any single study. Here, we propose a new framework to simultaneously study the evolution of many behaviors. We measured the behavioral repertoire of individuals from six species of fruit flies using unsupervised techniques and identified all stereotyped movements exhibited by each species. We then fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to estimate the intra- and inter-species behavioral covariances, and, by using the known phylogenetic relationships among species, we estimated the (unobserved) behaviors exhibited by ancestral species. We found that much of intra-specific behavioral variation has a similar covariance structure to previously described long-time scale variation in an individual’s behavior, suggesting that much of the measured variation between individuals of a single species in our assay reflects differences in the status of neural networks, rather than genetic or developmental differences between individuals. We then propose a method to identify groups of behaviors that appear to have evolved in a correlated manner, illustrating how sets of behaviors, rather than individual behaviors, likely evolved. Our approach provides a new framework for identifying co-evolving behaviors and may provide new opportunities to study the mechanistic basis of behavioral evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq uncovers shared and distinct axes of variation in dorsal LGN neurons in mice, non-human primates, and humans</a></h4>

              
                Abundant evidence supports the presence of at least three distinct types of thalamocortical (TC) neurons in the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, the brain region that conveys visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). Different types of TC neurons in mice, humans, and macaques have distinct morphologies, distinct connectivity patterns, and convey different aspects of visual information to the cortex. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these cell types, and how these relate to differences in dLGN between human, macaque, and mice, we profiled gene expression in single nuclei and cells using RNA-sequencing. These efforts identified four distinct types of TC neurons in the primate dLGN: magnocellular (M) neurons, parvocellular (P) neurons, and two types of koniocellular (K) neurons. Despite extensively documented morphological and physiological differences between M and P neurons, we identified few genes with significant differential expression between transcriptomic cell types corresponding to these two neuronal populations. Likewise, the dominant feature of TC neurons of the adult mouse dLGN is high transcriptomic similarity, with an axis of heterogeneity that aligns with core vs. shell portions of mouse dLGN. Together, these data show that transcriptomic differences between principal cell types in the mature mammalian dLGN are subtle relative to the observed differences in morphology and cortical projection targets. Finally, alignment of transcriptome profiles across species highlights expanded diversity of GABAergic neurons in primate versus mouse dLGN and homologous types of TC neurons in primates that are distinct from TC neurons in mouse.

                Many spinal circuits dedicated to locomotor control have been identified in the developing zebrafish. How these circuits operate together to generate the various swimming movements during development remains to be clarified. In this study, we iteratively built models of developing zebrafish spinal circuits coupled to simplified musculoskeletal models that reproduce coiling and swimming movements. The neurons of the models were based upon morphologically or genetically identified populations in the developing zebrafish spinal cord. We simulated intact spinal circuits as well as circuits with silenced neurons or altered synaptic transmission to better understand the role of specific spinal neurons. Analysis of firing patterns and phase relationships helped identify possible mechanisms underlying the locomotor movements of developing zebrafish. Notably, our simulations demonstrated how the site and the operation of rhythm generation could transition between coiling and swimming. The simulations also underlined the importance of contralateral excitation to multiple tail beats. They allowed us to estimate the sensitivity of spinal locomotor networks to motor command amplitude, synaptic weights, length of ascending and descending axons, and firing behaviour. These models will serve as valuable tools to test and further understand the operation of spinal circuits for locomotion.

                Neural circuits carry out complex computations that allow animals to evaluate food, select mates, move toward attractive stimuli, and move away from threats. In insects, the subesophageal zone (SEZ) is a brain region that receives gustatory, pheromonal, and mechanosensory inputs and contributes to the control of diverse behaviors, including feeding, grooming, and locomotion. Despite its importance in sensorimotor transformations, the study of SEZ circuits has been hindered by limited knowledge of the underlying diversity of SEZ neurons. Here, we generate a collection of split-GAL4 lines that provides precise genetic targeting of 138 different SEZ cell types in adult <i>D. melanogaster</i>, comprising approximately one third of all SEZ neurons. We characterize the single cell anatomy of these neurons and find that they cluster by morphology into six supergroups that organize the SEZ into discrete anatomical domains. We find that the majority of local SEZ interneurons are not classically polarized, suggesting rich local processing, whereas SEZ projection neurons tend to be classically polarized, conveying information to a limited number of higher brain regions. This study provides insight into the anatomical organization of the SEZ and generates resources that will facilitate further study of SEZ neurons and their contributions to sensory processing and behavior.

                The histone modification H3K27me3 plays a central role in Polycomb-mediated epigenetic silencing. H3K27me3 recruits and allosterically activates Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which adds this modification to nearby histones, providing a read/write mechanism for inheritance through DNA replication. However, for some PRC2 targets, a purely histone-based system for epigenetic inheritance may be insufficient. We address this issue at the Polycomb target <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, as a narrow nucleation region of only ~three nucleosomes within <i>FLC</i> mediates epigenetic state switching and subsequent memory over many cell cycles. To explain the memory’s unexpected persistence, we introduce a mathematical model incorporating extra protein memory storage elements with positive feedback that persist at the locus through DNA replication, in addition to histone modifications. Our hybrid model explains many features of epigenetic switching/memory at <i>FLC</i> and encapsulates generic mechanisms that may be widely applicable.

                The chloroplast proteome contains thousands of different proteins that are encoded by the nuclear genome. These proteins are imported into the chloroplast via the action of the TOC translocase and associated downstream systems. Our recent work has revealed that the stability of the TOC complex is dynamically regulated by the ubiquitin-dependent chloroplast-associated protein degradation (CHLORAD) pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the TOC complex is also regulated by the SUMO system. <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutants representing almost the entire SUMO conjugation pathway can partially suppress the phenotype of <i>ppi1</i>, a pale-yellow mutant lacking the Toc33 protein. This suppression is linked to increased abundance of TOC proteins and improvements in chloroplast development. Moreover, data from molecular and biochemical experiments support a model in which the SUMO system directly regulates TOC protein stability. Thus, we have identified a regulatory link between the SUMO system and the chloroplast protein import machinery.

                Human running features a spring-like interaction of body and ground, enabled by elastic tendons that store mechanical energy and facilitate muscle operating conditions to minimize the metabolic cost. By experimentally assessing the operating conditions of two important muscles for running, the soleus and vastus lateralis, we investigated physiological mechanisms of muscle work production and muscle force generation. We found that the soleus continuously shortened throughout the stance phase, operating as work generator under conditions that are considered optimal for work production: high force-length potential and high enthalpy efficiency. The vastus lateralis promoted tendon energy storage and contracted nearly isometrically close to optimal length, resulting in a high force-length-velocity potential beneficial for economical force generation. The favorable operating conditions of both muscles were a result of an effective length and velocity-decoupling of fascicles and muscle-tendon unit, mostly due to tendon compliance and, in the soleus, marginally by fascicle rotation.

                Triple-drug therapies have transformed HIV from a fatal condition to a chronic one. These therapies should prevent HIV drug resistance evolution, because one or more drugs suppress any partially resistant viruses. In practice, such therapies drastically reduced, but did not eliminate, resistance evolution. In this article, we reanalyze published data from an evolutionary perspective and demonstrate several intriguing patterns about HIV resistance evolution - resistance evolves (1) even after years on successful therapy, (2) sequentially, often via one mutation at a time and (3) in a partially predictable order. We describe how these observations might emerge under two models of HIV drugs varying in space or time. Despite decades of work in this area, much opportunity remains to create models with realistic parameters for three drugs, and to match model outcomes to resistance rates and genetic patterns from individuals on triple-drug therapy. Further, lessons from HIV may inform other systems.

                Learning to be safe is central for adaptive behaviour when threats are no longer present. Detecting the absence of an expected threat is key for threat extinction learning and an essential process for the behavioural treatment of anxiety related disorders. One possible mechanism underlying extinction learning is a dopaminergic mismatch signal that encodes the absence of an expected threat. Here we show that such a dopamine-related pathway underlies extinction learning in humans. Dopaminergic enhancement via administration of L-DOPA (vs. Placebo) was associated with reduced retention of differential psychophysiological threat responses at later test, which was mediated by activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that was specific to extinction learning. L-DOPA administration enhanced signals at the time-point of an expected, but omitted threat in extinction learning within the nucleus accumbens, which were functionally coupled with the ventral tegmental area and the amygdala. Computational modelling of threat expectancies further revealed prediction error encoding in nucleus accumbens that was reduced when L-DOPA was administered. Our results thereby provide evidence that extinction learning is influenced by L-DOPA and provide a mechanistic perspective to augment extinction learning by dopaminergic enhancement in humans.

                Concussion is associated with a myriad of deleterious immediate and long-term consequences. Yet the molecular mechanisms and genetic targets promoting the selective vulnerability of different neural subtypes to dysfunction and degeneration remain unclear. Translating experimental models of blunt force trauma in <i>C. elegans</i> to concussion in mice, we identify a conserved neuroprotective mechanism in which reduction of mitochondrial electron flux through complex IV suppresses trauma-induced degeneration of the highly vulnerable dopaminergic neurons. Reducing cytochrome C oxidase function elevates mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, which signal through the cytosolic hypoxia inducing transcription factor, <i>Hif1a</i>, to promote hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDHE1α. This critical enzyme initiates the Warburg shunt, which drives energetic reallocation from mitochondrial respiration to astrocyte-mediated glycolysis in a neuroprotective manner. These studies demonstrate a conserved process in which glycolytic preconditioning suppresses Parkinson-like hypersensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to trauma-induced degeneration via redox signaling and the Warburg effect.

                Tissue-resident intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes (T-IEL) patrol the gut and have important roles in regulating intestinal homeostasis. T-IEL include both induced T-IEL, derived from systemic antigen-experienced lymphocytes, and natural IEL, which are developmentally targeted to the intestine. While the processes driving T-IEL development have been elucidated, the precise roles of the different subsets and the processes driving activation and regulation of these cells remain unclear. To gain functional insights into these enigmatic cells, we used high-resolution, quantitative mass spectrometry to compare the proteomes of induced T-IEL and natural T-IEL subsets, with naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from lymph nodes. This data exposes the dominant effect of the gut environment over ontogeny on T-IEL phenotypes. Analyses of protein copy numbers of &gt;7000 proteins in T-IEL reveal skewing of the cell surface repertoire towards epithelial interactions and checkpoint receptors; strong suppression of the metabolic machinery indicating a high energy barrier to functional activation; upregulated cholesterol and lipid metabolic pathways, leading to high cholesterol levels in T-IEL; suppression of T cell antigen receptor signalling and expression of the transcription factor TOX, reminiscent of chronically activated T cells. These novel findings illustrate how T-IEL integrate multiple tissue-specific signals to maintain their homeostasis and potentially function.

                    structural and functional connectivity, serving as the model input, from MRI
                    data influence modeling results. Here, we study the influence from one major
                    element: the brain parcellation scheme that reduces the dimensionality of brain
                    networks by grouping thousands of voxels into a few hundred brain regions. We
                    show graph-theoretical statistics derived from the empirical data and modeling
                    results exhibiting a high heterogeneity across parcellations. Furthermore, the
                    network properties of empirical brain connectomes explain the lion’s
                    share of the variance in the modeling results with respect to the parcellation
                    variation. Such a clear-cut relationship is not observed at the subject-resolved
                    level per parcellation. Finally, the graph-theoretical statistics of the
                    simulated connectome correlate with those of the empirical functional
                    connectivity across parcellations. However, this relation is not one-to-one, and
                    its precision can vary between models. Our results imply that network properties
                    of both empirical connectomes can explain the goodness-of-fit of whole-brain
                    models to empirical data at a global group level but not at a single-subject
                    level, which provides further insights into the personalization of whole-brain
                    models.</span>

                    transcranial neurostimulation predict metamemory sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Metamemory involves the ability to correctly judge the accuracy of our memories.
                    The retrieval of memories can be improved using transcranial electrical
                    stimulation (tES) during sleep, but evidence for improvements to metamemory
                    sensitivity is limited. Applying tES can enhance sleep-dependent memory
                    consolidation, which along with metamemory requires the coordination of activity
                    across distributed neural systems, suggesting that examining functional
                    connectivity is important for understanding these processes. Nevertheless,
                    little research has examined how functional connectivity modulations relate to
                    overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. Here, we developed a closed-loop
                    short-duration tES method, time-locked to up-states of ongoing slow-wave
                    oscillations, to cue specific memory replays in humans. We measured
                    electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence changes following stimulation pulses,
                    and characterized network alterations with graph theoretic metrics. Using
                    machine learning techniques, we show that pulsed tES elicited network changes in
                    multiple frequency bands, including increased connectivity in the theta band and
                    increased efficiency in the spindle band. Additionally, stimulation-induced
                    changes in beta-band path length were predictive of overnight changes in
                    metamemory sensitivity. These findings add new insights into the growing
                    literature investigating increases in memory performance through brain
                    stimulation during sleep, and highlight the importance of examining functional
                    connectivity to explain its effects.</span>

                    called connectome, whose nodes correspond to parcels from a predefined brain
                    atlas. The edges of the graph encode the strength of the axonal connectivity
                    between regions of the atlas that can be estimated via diffusion magnetic
                    resonance imaging (MRI) tractography. Herein, we aim to provide a novel
                    perspective on the problem of choosing a suitable atlas for structural
                    connectivity studies by assessing how robustly an atlas captures the network
                    topology across different subjects in a homogeneous cohort. We measure this
                    robustness by assessing the alignability of the connectomes, namely the
                    possibility to retrieve graph matchings that provide highly similar graphs. We
                    introduce two novel concepts. First, the graph Jaccard index (GJI), a graph
                    similarity measure based on the well-established Jaccard index between sets; the
                    GJI exhibits natural mathematical properties that are not satisfied by previous
                    approaches. Second, we devise WL-align, a new technique for aligning connectomes
                    obtained by adapting the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph-isomorphism test. We
                    validated the GJI and WL-align on data from the Human Connectome Project
                    database, inferring a strategy for choosing a suitable parcellation for
                    structural connectivity studies. Code and data are publicly available.</span>

                    magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) studies. However, most SCNs have been
                    constructed by a unitary marker that is insensitive for discriminating different
                    disease phases. The aim of this study was to devise a novel regional radiomics
                    similarity network (R2SN) that could provide more comprehensive information in
                    morphological network analysis. R2SNs were constructed by computing the Pearson
                    correlations between the radiomics features extracted from any pair of regions
                    for each subject (AAL atlas). We further assessed the small-world property of
                    R2SNs, and we evaluated the reproducibility in different datasets and through
                    test-retest analysis. The relationships between the R2SNs and general

                    (intraclass correlation coefficient &gt; 0.7). In addition, the small-word

                    activity with local excitatory–inhibitory balance in neuronal
                    populations. However, how underlying neurotransmitter kinetics associated with
                    E–I balance govern resting-state spontaneous brain dynamics remains
                    unknown. Understanding the mechanisms by virtue of which fluctuations in
                    neurotransmitter concentrations, a hallmark of a variety of clinical conditions,
                    relate to functional brain activity is of critical importance. We propose a
                    multiscale dynamic mean field (MDMF) model—a system of coupled
                    differential equations for capturing the synaptic gating dynamics in excitatory
                    and inhibitory neural populations as a function of neurotransmitter kinetics.
                    Individual brain regions are modeled as population of MDMF and are connected by
                    realistic connection topologies estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data.
                    First, MDMF successfully predicts resting-state functional connectivity. Second,
                    our results show that optimal range of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter
                    concentrations subserve as the dynamic working point of the brain, that is, the

                    blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals. Third, for predictive validity the network

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We propose that the application of network theory to established psychological
                    personality conceptions has great potential to advance a biologically plausible
                    model of human personality. Stable behavioral tendencies are conceived as
                    personality “traits.” Such traits demonstrate considerable
                    variability between individuals, and extreme expressions represent risk factors
                    for psychological disorders. Although the psychometric assessment of personality
                    has more than hundred years tradition, it is not yet clear whether traits indeed
                    represent “biophysical entities” with specific and dissociable
                    neural substrates. For instance, it is an open question whether there exists a

                    personality factors and the organizational properties of traitlike brain

                    this article will point out how network neuroscience can enhance our
                    understanding about human personality. We will examine the importance of

                    from each discipline itself and their combination are discussed and potential
                    solutions are developed. We close by outlining future trends and by discussing

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This work presents a novel strategy for classifying neurons, represented by nodes
                    of a directed graph, based on their circuitry (edge connectivity). We assume a
                    stochastic block model (SBM) in which neurons belong together if they connect to
                    neurons of other groups according to the same probability distributions.
                    Following adjacency spectral embedding of the SBM graph, we derive the number of
                    classes and assign each neuron to a class with a Gaussian mixture model-based
                    expectation maximization (EM) clustering algorithm. To improve accuracy, we
                    introduce a simple variation using random hierarchical agglomerative clustering
                    to initialize the EM algorithm and picking the best solution over multiple EM
                    restarts. We test this procedure on a large
                        (≈2<sup>12</sup>–2<sup>15</sup> neurons), sparse, biologically
                    inspired connectome with eight neuron classes. The simulation results
                    demonstrate that the proposed approach is broadly stable to the choice of
                    embedding dimension, and scales extremely well as the number of neurons in the
                    network increases. Clustering accuracy is robust to variations in model
                    parameters and highly tolerant to simulated experimental noise, achieving
                    perfect classifications with up to 40% of swapped edges. Thus, this
                    approach may be useful to analyze and interpret large-scale brain connectomics
                    data in terms of underlying cellular components.</span>

                    breadth based on brain functional networks</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The quantification of human brain functional (re)configurations across varying
                    cognitive demands remains an unresolved topic. We propose that such functional
                    configurations may be categorized into three different types: (a) network
                    configural breadth, (b) task-to task transitional reconfiguration, and (c)
                    within-task reconfiguration. Such functional reconfigurations are rather subtle
                    at the whole-brain level. Hence, we propose a mesoscopic framework focused on
                    functional networks (FNs) or communities to quantify functional
                    (re)configurations. To do so, we introduce a 2D network morphospace that relies
                    on two novel mesoscopic metrics, trapping efficiency (TE) and exit entropy (EE),
                    which capture topology and integration of information within and between a
                    reference set of FNs. We use this framework to quantify the network configural
                    breadth across different tasks. We show that the metrics defining this
                    morphospace can differentiate FNs, cognitive tasks, and subjects. We also show
                    that network configural breadth significantly predicts behavioral measures, such
                    as episodic memory, verbal episodic memory, fluid intelligence, and general
                    intelligence. In essence, we put forth a framework to explore the cognitive
                    space in a comprehensive manner, for each individual separately, and at
                    different levels of granularity. This tool that can also quantify the FN

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elucidating the neural mechanisms of Learning-to-Learn</a></h4>

              
                Learning-to-learn, a progressive acceleration of learning while solving a series of similar problems, represents a core process of knowledge acquisition that draws attention in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. To investigate its underlying brain mechanism, we trained a recurrent neural network model on arbitrary sensorimotor mappings. The network displayed an exponential speedup in learning. The neural substrate of a schema emerges within a low-dimensional subspace of population activity. Its reuse in new problems facilitates learning by limiting connection weight changes. Since the population trajectory of a recurrent network produces behavior, learning is determined by the vector field changes. We propose a novel analysis of weight-driven vector field changes, which showed that novel stimuli in new problems can distort the schema representation. Weight changes eliminate such distortions and improve the invariance of the reused representations in future learning. The accumulation of such weight changes across problems underlies the learning-to-learn dynamics.

                APOE variants present the strongest association with sporadic Alzheimers Disease. APOE is also highly expressed during neurodevelopment in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and has been shown to be neuroprotective in infancy and gestation. We explored other lipid metabolism genes to determine whether they show a similar neurodevelopmental expression trajectory and are associated with neurodegeneration. APOE was by far the most highly expressed of the lipid metabolism genes in the CNS. Two other genes, Apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1) Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase (GLUL, also known as glutamine synthetase), co-clustered with Apolipoprotein E (APOE) in its developmental trajectory in late gestation through early childhood. These three genes highlight brain structures and developmental time-windows distinct from other lipid metabolism genes. In the CNS they are primarily expressed in astrocytes and are implicated in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration.

                Since speech is a continuous stream with no systematic boundaries between words, how do pre-verbal infants manage to discover words? A proposed solution is that they might use the transitional probability between adjacent syllables, which drops at word boundaries. Here, we tested the limits of this mechanism by increasing the size of the word-unit to 4 syllables, and its automaticity by testing asleep neonates. Using markers of statistical learning in neonates' EEG, compared to adult' behavioral performances in the same task, we confirmed that statistical learning is automatic enough to be efficient even in sleeping neonates. But we also revealed that : 1) Successfully tracking transition probabilities in a sequence is not sufficient to segment it 2) Prosodic cues, as subtle as subliminal pauses, enable to recover segmenting capacities 3) Adults' and neonates' capacities are remarkably similar despite the difference of maturation and expertise. Finally, we observed that learning increased the similarity of neural responses across infants, providing a new neural marker to monitor learning. Thus, from birth, infants are equipped with adult-like tools, allowing to extract small coherent word-like units within auditory streams, based on the combination of statistical analyses and prosodic cues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diffusion MRI Anisotropy in the Cerebral Cortex is Determined by Unmyelinated Tissue Features</a></h4>

              
                The diffusion of water molecules through the brain is constrained by tissue and cellular substructure, which imposes an anisotropy that can be measured through diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). In the white matter, myelinated axons strongly shape diffusion anisotropy; however, in gray matter the determinants of dMRI signals remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the histological tissue properties underlying dMRI anisotropy and diffusivity in the cerebral cortex of the marmoset monkey. We acquired whole brain ex vivo dMRI data designed for high signal-to-noise at ultra-high (150m) resolution. We compared the MRI to myelin- and Nissl-stained histological sections obtained from the scanned brain. We found that dMRI anisotropy corresponds most strongly not with cortical myelin content, but rather with the microscale anisotropy of tissue features, most notably those unmyelinated features highlighted by Nissl staining. The results suggest that dMRI anisotropy in gray matter derives from the organization of unmyelinated neurites, which are known to be affected by neurodegenerative diseases.

                Model-based data analysis of whole-brain dynamics links the observed data to model parameters in a network of neural masses. In recent years a special focus was placed on the role of regional variance of model parameters for the emergent activity. Such analyses however depend on the properties of the employed neural mass model, which is often obtained through a series of major simplifications or analogies. Here we propose a data-driven approach where the neural mass model needs not to be specified. Building on the recent progresses in identification of dynamical systems with neural networks, we propose a method to infer from the functional data both the neural mass model representing the regional dynamics as well as the region- and subject-specific parameters, while respecting the known network structure. We demonstrate on two synthetic data sets that our method is able to recover the original model parameters, and that the trained generative model produces dynamics resembling the training data both on the regional level and on the whole-brain level. The present approach opens a novel way to the analysis of resting-state fMRI with possible applications in understanding the changes of whole-brain dynamics during aging or in neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signal neutrality, scalar property, and collapsing boundaries as consequences of a learned multi-time scale strategy</a></h4>

              
                Experiments and models in perceptual decision-making point to a key role of an integration process that accumulates sensory evidence over time. We endow a probabilistic agent comprising several such integrators with widely spread time scales and let it learn, by trial-and-error, to weight the different filtered versions of a noisy signal. The agent discovers a strategy markedly different from the literature "standard", according to which a decision made when the accumulated evidence hits a predetermined threshold. The agent instead decides during fleeting windows corresponding to the alignment of many integrators, akin to a majority vote. This strategy presents three distinguishing signatures. 1) Signal neutrality: a marked insensitivity to the signal coherence in the interval preceding the decision, as also observed in experiments. 2) Scalar property: the mean of the response times varies glaringly for different signal coherences, yet the shape of the distribution stays largely unchanged. 3) Collapsing boundaries: the agent learns to behave as if subject to a non-monotonic urgency signal, reminiscent in shape of the theoretically optimal. These three characteristics, which emerge from the interaction of a multi-scale learning agent with a highly volatile environment, are hallmarks, we argue, of an optimal decision strategy in challenging situations. As such, the present results may shed light on general information-processing principles leveraged by the brain itself.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glass Half Full: Preserved Anatomical Bypasses Predict Variance in Language Functions After Stroke</a></h4>

              
                The severity of post-stroke aphasia is related to damage to white matter connections. However, neural signaling can route not only through direct connections, but also along multi-step network paths. When brain networks are damaged by stroke, paths can bypass around the damage to restore communication. The shortest network paths between regions could be the most efficient routes for mediating bypasses. We examined how shortest-path bypasses after left hemisphere strokes were related to language performance. Regions within and outside of the canonical language network could be important in aphasia recovery. Therefore, we innovated methods to measure the influence of bypasses in the whole brain. Distinguishing bypasses from all residual shortest paths is difficult without pre-stroke imaging. We identified bypasses by finding shortest paths in subjects with stroke that were longer than those observed in the average network of the most reliably observed connections in age-matched controls. We tested whether features of those bypasses predicted scores in four orthogonal dimensions of language performance derived from a factor analysis of a battery of language tasks. The features were the length of each bypass in steps, and how many bypasses overlapped on each individual direct connection. We related these bypass features to language factors using grid-search cross-validated Support Vector Regression, a technique that extracts robust relationships in high-dimensional data analysis. We discovered that the length of bypasses reliably predicted variance in lexical production (R2 = .576) and auditory comprehension scores (R2 = .164). Bypass overlaps reliably predicted variance in Lexical Production scores (R2 = .247). The predictive elongation features revealed that bypass efficiency along the dorsal stream and ventral stream were most related to Lexical Production and Auditory Comprehension, respectively. Among the predictive bypass overlaps, increased bypass routing through the right hemisphere putamen was negatively related to lexical production ability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Real-time visualization of mRNA synthesis during memory formation in live animals</a></h4>

              
                Memories are thought to be encoded in populations of neurons called memory trace or engram cells. However, little is known about the dynamics of these cells because of the difficulty in real-time monitoring of them over long periods of time in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we present a genetically-encoded RNA indicator (GERI) mouse for intravital chronic imaging of endogenous Arc mRNA - a popular marker for memory trace cells. We used our GERI to identify Arc-positive neurons in real time without the delay associated with reporter protein expression in conventional approaches. We found that the Arc-positive neuronal populations rapidly turned over within two days in the hippocampal CA1 region, whereas ~4% of neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) consistently expressed Arc following contextual fear conditioning and repeated memory retrievals. Dual imaging of GERI and a calcium indicator in CA1 of mice navigating a virtual reality environment revealed that only the population of neurons expressing Arc during both encoding and retrieval exhibited relatively high calcium activity in a context-specific manner. This in vivo RNA imaging approach opens the possibility of unraveling the dynamics of the neuronal population underlying various learning and memory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prolonged tonic pain in healthy humans enhances functional connectivity of descending pain modulation networks involving the amygdala, periaqueductal gray and parabrachial nucleus to cortical sensory-discriminative areas</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Resting state functional connectivity (FC) is widely used to assess functional brain alterations in patients with chronic pain. However, reports of FC changes accompanying tonic pain in pain-free persons is rare. A brain network disrupted during chronic pain is a network we term the Descending Pain Modulatory Network (DPMN). Here, we evaluate the effect of tonic pain on FC of this network: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala (AMYG), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and parabrachial nuclei (PBN). Methods: In 50 pain-free participants (30F), we induced tonic pain using a capsaicin-heat pain model. We used functional MRI to measure resting BOLD signal during pain-free rest where participants experienced warmth and tonic pain where participants experienced the same temperature thermode combined with capsaicin. We evaluated FC from ACC, AMYG, PAG, and PBN with correlation of self-report pain intensity with FC during both states. We hypothesized tonic pain would disrupt FC dyads within the DPMN. We used partial correlation to determine FC correlated with pain intensity and BOLD signal. Results: Of hypothesized FC dyads, PAG and subgenual ACC was weakly disrupted during tonic pain (F=3.34; p=0.074; pain-free>pain d=0.25). sgACC-PAG FC became positively related to pain intensity (R=0.38; t=2.81; p=0.007). Right PBN-PAG FC during pain-free rest positively correlated with subsequently experienced pain (R=0.44; t=3.43; p=0.001). During tonic pain, FC of this connection was abolished (paired t=-3.17; p=0.0026). During pain-free rest, FC between left AMYG and right superior parietal lobule and caudate nucleus were positively correlated with subsequent pain. During tonic pain, FC between left AMYG and right inferior temporal and superior frontal gyri negatively correlated with pain. Subsequent pain positively correlated with right AMYG FC and right claustrum; left and right primary visual cortex; right middle temporal gyrus and right temporo-occipitoparietal junction. Finally, subsequent pain positively correlated with PAG FC and left cerebellum, left dorsolateral prefrontal, right posterior cingulate cortex and paracentral lobule, inferior parietal lobule, medial precuneus and PBN. Conclusion: We demonstrate 1) tonic pain weakly disrupts of sgACC-PAG FC; 2) sgACC-PAG tonic pain FC positively correlates with pain; 3) right PBN-PAG FC predicts subsequent pain and is abolished during tonic pain. Finally, we reveal PAG- and right AMYG-anchored networks which predict intensity of tonic pain. Our findings suggest specific connectivity patterns within the DPMN at rest predict experienced pain and are modulated by tonic pain. These nodes and their functional modulation may reveal new therapeutic targets for neuromodulation and biomarkers to guide interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optical and computational dissection of emergent prefrontal rewiring to encode fear memory</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex regulates various emotional behaviors and memories, and prefrontal dysfunction can trigger psychiatric disorders. While untangling the internal network may provide clues to the neural architecture underlying such disorders, it is technically difficult due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the network. Here we propose an optical and computational dissection of the internal prefrontal network based on chronic two-photon imaging and a sparse modeling algorithm, which enabled the discrimination of newly emerged neuronal ensembles specifically encoding conditioned fear responses. Further graphical modeling revealed that neurons responding to the unconditioned stimulus during fear conditioning became a core of the ensembles with an enhanced capability for pattern completion, demonstrating the activity dependent rewiring upon the associative learning.

     alt="A schizophrenia risk factor induces marked anatomical deficits at GABAergic-dopaminergic synapses in the rat ventral tegmental area: Essential evidence for new targeted therapies"/>
<p><i>Hypothesis</i>: Synaptic changes occur within a midbrain GABA-dopamine circuit of male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. <i>Outcomes</i>: In the offspring of MIA dams, markedly smaller inhibitory synapses were observed for non-triadic (classic) and newly discovered triadic synapses. These changes could contribute to well-documented striatal hyperdopaminergia. The findings provide a new therapeutic target.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To develop new therapies for schizophrenia, evidence accumulated over decades highlights the essential need to investigate the GABAergic synapses that presynaptically influence midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Since current technology restricts these studies to animals, and evidence accumulated in recent decades indicates a developmental origin of schizophrenia, we investigated synaptic changes in male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. Using a novel combination of lentiviruses, peroxidase-immunogold double labeling, three-dimensional serial section transmission electron microscopy and stereology, we observed clear anatomical alterations in synaptic inputs on dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA). These changes relate directly to a characteristic feature of schizophrenia: increased dopamine release. In 3-month-old and 14-month-old MIA rats, we found a marked decrease in the volume of presynaptic GABAergic terminals from the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and in the length of the synapses they made, when innervating pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In MIA rats in the long-term, we also discovered a decrease in the volume of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and in the maximum thickness of the PSD at the same synapses. These marked deficits were evident in conventional GABA-dopamine synapses and in synaptic triads that we discovered involving asymmetric synapses that innervated RMTg GABAergic presynaptic terminals, which in turn innervated pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In triads, the PSD thickness of asymmetric synapses was significantly decreased in MIA rats in the long-term cohort. The extensive anatomical deficits provide a potential basis for new therapies targeted at synaptic inputs on midbrain pVTA dopaminergic neurons, in contrast to current striatum-targeted antipsychotic drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presynaptic Short-Term Plasticity Persists in the Absence of PKC Phosphorylation of Munc18-1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) is a form of short-term plasticity that lasts for tens of seconds following a burst of presynaptic activity. It has been proposed that PTP arises from protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of Munc18-1, an SM (Sec1/Munc-18 like) family protein that is essential for release. To test this model, we made a knock-in mouse in which all Munc18-1 PKC phosphorylation sites were eliminated through serine-to-alanine point mutations (Munc18-1SA mice), and we studied mice of either sex. The expression of Munc18-1 was not altered in Munc18-1SA mice, and there were no obvious behavioral phenotypes. At the hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapse and the granule cell parallel fiber (PF)-to-Purkinje cell (PC) synapse, basal transmission was largely normal except for small decreases in paired-pulse facilitation that are consistent with a slight elevation in release probability. Phorbol esters that mimic the activation of PKC by diacylglycerol still increased synaptic transmission in Munc18-1SA mice. In Munc18-1SA mice, 70% of PTP remained at CA3-to-CA1 synapses, and the amplitude of PTP was not reduced at PF-to-PC synapses. These findings indicate that at both CA3-to-CA1 and PF-to-PC synapses, phorbol esters and PTP enhance synaptic transmission primarily by mechanisms that are independent of PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A leading mechanism for a prevalent form of short-term plasticity, post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), involves protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of Munc18-1. This study tests this mechanism by creating a knock-in mouse in which Munc18-1 is replaced by a mutated form of Munc18-1 that cannot be phosphorylated. The main finding is that most PTP at hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses or at cerebellar granule cell-to-Purkinje cell synapses does not rely on PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1. Thus, mechanisms independent of PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1 are important mediators of PTP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reelin Regulates Neuronal Excitability through Striatal-Enriched Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP61) and Calcium Permeable AMPARs in an NMDAR-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease marked by the accumulation of amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A&beta; oligomers cause synaptic dysfunction early in AD by enhancing long-term depression (LTD; a paradigm for forgetfulness) via metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent regulation of striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase (STEP<SUB>61</SUB>). Reelin is a neuromodulator that signals through ApoE (apolipoprotein E) receptors to protect the synapse against A&beta; toxicity (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B12">Durakoglugil et al., 2009</cross-ref>) Reelin signaling is impaired by ApoE4, the most important genetic risk factor for AD, and A&beta;-oligomers activate metabotropic glutamate receptors (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Renner et al., 2010</cross-ref>). We therefore asked whether Reelin might also affect mGluR-LTD. To this end, we induced chemical mGluR-LTD using DHPG (Dihydroxyphenylglycine), a selective mGluR5 agonist. We found that exogenous Reelin reduces the DHPG-induced increase in STEP<SUB>61</SUB>, prevents the dephosphorylation of GluA2, and concomitantly blocks mGluR-mediated LTD. By contrast, Reelin deficiency increased expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors along with higher STEP<SUB>61</SUB> levels, resulting in occlusion of DHPG-induced LTD in hippocampal CA1 neurons. We propose a model in which Reelin modulates local protein synthesis as well as AMPA receptor subunit composition through modulation of mGluR-mediated signaling with implications for memory consolidation or neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reelin is an important neuromodulator, which in the adult brain controls synaptic plasticity and protects against neurodegeneration. Amyloid-&beta; has been shown to use mGluRs to induce synaptic depression through endocytosis of NMDA and AMPA receptors, a mechanism referred to as LTD, a paradigm of forgetfulness. Our results show that Reelin regulates the phosphatase STEP, which plays an important role in neurodegeneration, as well as the expression of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which play a role in memory formation. These data suggest that Reelin uses mGluR LTD pathways to regulate memory formation as well as neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">FLRT2 and FLRT3 Cooperate in Maintaining the Tangential Migratory Streams of Cortical Interneurons during Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuron migration is a hallmark of nervous system development that allows gathering of neurons from different origins for assembling of functional neuronal circuits. Cortical inhibitory interneurons arise in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially forming three transient migratory streams in the cortex before reaching the final laminar destination. Although migration defects lead to the disruption of inhibitory circuits and are linked to aspects of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the molecular mechanisms controlling cortical interneuron development and final layer positioning are incompletely understood. Here, we show that mouse embryos with a double deletion of <I>FLRT2</I> and <I>FLRT3</I> genes encoding cell adhesion molecules exhibit an abnormal distribution of interneurons within the streams during development, which in turn, affect the layering of somatostatin+ interneurons postnatally. Mechanistically, FLRT2 and FLRT3 proteins act in a noncell-autonomous manner, possibly through a repulsive mechanism. In support of such a conclusion, double knockouts deficient in the repulsive receptors for FLRTs, Unc5B and Unc5D, also display interneuron defects during development, similar to the <I>FLRT2</I>/<I>FLRT3</I> mutants. Moreover, FLRT proteins are chemorepellent ligands for developing interneurons <I>in vitro</I>, an effect that is in part dependent on FLRT-Unc5 interaction. Together, we propose that FLRTs act through Unc5 receptors to control cortical interneuron distribution in a mechanism that involves cell repulsion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Disruption of inhibitory cortical circuits is responsible for some aspects of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. These defects include interneuron migration during development. A crucial step during this process is the formation of three transient migratory streams within the developing cortex that determine the timing of interneuron final positioning and the formation of functional cortical circuits in the adult. We report that FLRT proteins are required for the proper distribution of interneurons within the cortical migratory streams and for the final laminar allocation in the postnatal cortex. These results expand the multifunctional role of FLRTs during nervous system development in addition to the role of FLRTs in axon guidance and the migration of excitatory cortical neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Visual Mapping following Ocular Gene Augmentation Therapy for Achromatopsia</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability of the adult human brain to develop function following correction of congenital deafferentation is controversial. Specifically, cases of recovery from congenital visual deficits are rare. <I>CNGA3</I>-achromatopsia is a congenital hereditary disease caused by cone-photoreceptor dysfunction, leading to impaired acuity, photoaversion, and complete color blindness. Essentially, these patients have rod-driven vision only, seeing the world in blurry shades of gray. We use the uniqueness of this rare disease, in which the cone-photoreceptors and afferent fibers are preserved but do not function, as a model to study cortical visual plasticity. We had the opportunity to study two <I>CNGA3</I>-achromatopsia adults (one female) before and after ocular gene augmentation therapy. Alongside behavioral visual tests, we used novel fMRI-based measurements to assess participants' early visual population receptive-field sizes and color regions. Behaviorally, minor improvements were observed, including reduction in photoaversion, marginal improvement in acuity, and a new ability to detect red color. No improvement was observed in color arrangement tests. Cortically, pretreatment, patients' population-receptive field sizes of early visual areas were untypically large, but were decreased following treatment specifically in the treated eye. We suggest that this demonstrates cortical ability to encode new input, even at adulthood. On the other hand, no activation of color-specific cortical regions was demonstrated in these patients either before or up to 1 year post-treatment. The source of this deficiency might be attributed either to insufficient recovery of cone function at the retinal level or to challenges that the adult cortex faces when computing new cone-derived input to achieve color perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The possibility that the adult human brain may regain or develop function following correction of congenital deafferentation has fired the imagination of scientists over the years. In the visual domain, cases of recovery from congenital deficits are rare. Gene therapy visual restoration for congenital <I>CNGA3</I>-achromatopsia, a disease caused by cone photoreceptor dysfunction, gave us the opportunity to examine cortical function, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, both before and after restorative treatment. While behaviorally only minor improvements were observed post-treatment, fMRI analysis, including size algorithms of population-receptive fields, revealed cortical changes, specifically receptive field size decrease in the treated eyes. This suggests that, at least to some degree, the adult cortex is able to encode new input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Fingerprints Underlying Individual Language Learning Profiles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human language learning differs significantly across individuals in the process and ultimate attainment. Although decades of research exploring the neural substrates of language learning have identified distinct and overlapping neural networks subserving learning of different components, the neural mechanisms that drive the large interindividual differences are still far from being understood. Here we examine to what extent the neural dynamics of multiple brain networks in men and women across sessions of training contribute to explaining individual differences in learning multiple linguistic components (i.e., vocabulary, morphology, and phrase and sentence structures) of an artificial language in a 7 d training and imaging paradigm with functional MRI. With machine-learning and predictive modeling, neural activation patterns across training sessions were highly predictive of individual learning success profiles derived from the four components. We identified four neural learning networks (i.e., the Perisylvian, frontoparietal, salience, and default-mode networks) and examined their dynamic contributions to the learning success prediction. Moreover, the robustness of the predictions systematically changes across networks depending on specific training phases and the learning components. We further demonstrate that a subset of network nodes in the inferior frontal, insular, and frontoparietal regions increasingly represent newly acquired language knowledge, while the multivariate connectivity between these representation regions is enhanced during learning for more successful learners. These findings allow us to understand why learners differ and are the first to attribute not only the degree of success but also patterns of language learning across components, to neural fingerprints summarized from multiple neural network dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Individual differences in learning a language are widely observed not only within the same component of language but also across components. This study demonstrates that the dynamics of multiple brain networks across four imaging sessions of a 7 d artificial language training contribute to individual differences in learning-outcome profiles derived from four language components. With machine-learning predictive modeling, we identified four neural learning networks, including the Perisylvian, frontoparietal, salience, and default-mode networks, that contribute to predicting individual learning-outcome profiles and revealed language-component-general and component-specific prediction patterns across training sessions. These findings provide significant insights in understanding training-dependent neural dynamics underlying individual differences in learning success across language components.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Representational Similarity Analysis of Cognitive Control during Color-Word Stroop</a></h4>

              
                <p>Progress in understanding the neural bases of cognitive control has been supported by the paradigmatic color-word Stroop task, in which a target response (color name) must be selected over a more automatic, yet potentially incongruent, distractor response (word). For this paradigm, models have postulated complementary coding schemes: dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) is proposed to evaluate the demand for control via incongruency-related coding, whereas dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) is proposed to implement control via goal and target-related coding. Yet, mapping these theorized schemes to measured neural activity within this task has been challenging. Here, we tested for these coding schemes relatively directly, by decomposing an event-related color-word Stroop task via representational similarity analysis. Three neural coding models were fit to the similarity structure of multivoxel patterns of human fMRI activity, acquired from 65 healthy, young-adult males and females. Incongruency coding was predominant in DMFC, whereas both target and incongruency coding were present with indistinguishable strength in DLPFC. In contrast, distractor information was strongly encoded within early visual cortex. Further, these coding schemes were differentially related to behavior: individuals with stronger DLPFC (and lateral posterior parietal cortex) target coding, but weaker DMFC incongruency coding, exhibited less behavioral Stroop interference. These results highlight the utility of the representational similarity analysis framework for investigating neural mechanisms of cognitive control and point to several promising directions to extend the Stroop paradigm.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How the human brain enables cognitive control &mdash; the ability to override behavioral habits to pursue internal goals &mdash; has been a major focus of neuroscience research. This ability has been frequently investigated by using the Stroop color-word naming task. With the Stroop as a test-bed, many theories have proposed specific neuroanatomical dissociations, in which medial and lateral frontal brain regions underlie cognitive control by encoding distinct types of information. Yet providing a direct confirmation of these claims has been challenging. Here, we demonstrate that representational similarity analysis, which estimates and models the similarity structure of brain activity patterns, can successfully establish the hypothesized functional dissociations within the Stroop task. Representational similarity analysis may provide a useful approach for investigating cognitive control mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predicting Identity-Preserving Object Transformations across the Human Ventral Visual Stream</a></h4>

              
                <p>In everyday life, we have no trouble categorizing objects varying in position, size, and orientation. Previous fMRI research shows that higher-level object processing regions in the human lateral occipital cortex may link object responses from different affine states (i.e., size and viewpoint) through a general linear mapping function capable of predicting responses to novel objects. In this study, we extended this approach to examine the mapping for both Euclidean (e.g., position and size) and non-Euclidean (e.g., image statistics and spatial frequency) transformations across the human ventral visual processing hierarchy, including areas V1, V2, V3, V4, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and lateral occipitotemporal cortex. The predicted pattern generated from a linear mapping function could capture a significant amount of the changes associated with the transformations throughout the ventral visual stream. The derived linear mapping functions were not category independent as performance was better for the categories included than those not included in training and better between two similar versus two dissimilar categories in both lower and higher visual regions. Consistent with object representations being stronger in higher than in lower visual regions, pattern selectivity and object category representational structure were somewhat better preserved in the predicted patterns in higher than in lower visual regions. There were no notable differences between Euclidean and non-Euclidean transformations. These findings demonstrate a near-orthogonal representation of object identity and these nonidentity features throughout the human ventral visual processing pathway with these nonidentity features largely untangled from the identity features early in visual processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Presently we still do not fully understand how object identity and nonidentity (e.g., position, size) information are simultaneously represented in the primate ventral visual system to form invariant representations. Previous work suggests that the human lateral occipital cortex may be linking different affine states of object representations through general linear mapping functions. Here, we show that across the entire human ventral processing pathway, we could link object responses in different states of nonidentity transformations through linear mapping functions for both Euclidean and non-Euclidean transformations. These mapping functions are not identity independent, suggesting that object identity and nonidentity features are represented in a near rather than a completely orthogonal manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emergence of Nonlinear Mixed Selectivity in Prefrontal Cortex after Training</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in the PFC are typically activated by different cognitive tasks, and also by different stimuli and abstract variables within these tasks. A single neuron's selectivity for a given stimulus dimension often changes depending on its context, a phenomenon known as nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS). It has previously been hypothesized that NMS emerges as a result of training to perform tasks in different contexts. We tested this hypothesis directly by examining the neuronal responses of different PFC areas before and after male monkeys were trained to perform different working memory tasks involving visual stimulus locations and/or shapes. We found that training induces a modest increase in the proportion of PFC neurons with NMS exclusively for spatial working memory, but not for shape working memory tasks, with area 9/46 undergoing the most significant increase in NMS cell proportion. We also found that increased working memory task complexity, in the form of simultaneously storing location and shape combinations, does not increase the degree of NMS for stimulus shape with other task variables. Lastly, in contrast to the previous studies, we did not find evidence that NMS is predictive of task performance. Our results thus provide critical insights on the representation of stimuli and task information in neuronal populations, in working memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How multiple types of information are represented in working memory remains a complex computational problem. It has been hypothesized that nonlinear mixed selectivity allows neurons to efficiently encode multiple stimuli in different contexts, after subjects have been trained in complex tasks. Our analysis of prefrontal recordings obtained before and after training monkeys to perform working memory tasks only partially agreed with this prediction, in that nonlinear mixed selectivity emerged for spatial but not shape information, and mostly in mid-dorsal PFC. Nonlinear mixed selectivity also displayed little modulation across either task complexity or correct performance. These results point to other mechanisms, in addition to nonlinear mixed selectivity, representing complex information about stimulus and task context in neuronal activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Music of Silence: Part I: Responses to Musical Imagery Encode Melodic Expectations and Acoustics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Musical imagery is the voluntary internal hearing of music in the mind without the need for physical action or external stimulation. Numerous studies have already revealed brain areas activated during imagery. However, it remains unclear to what extent imagined music responses preserve the detailed temporal dynamics of the acoustic stimulus envelope and, crucially, whether melodic expectations play any role in modulating responses to imagined music, as they prominently do during listening. These modulations are important as they reflect aspects of the human musical experience, such as its acquisition, engagement, and enjoyment. This study explored the nature of these modulations in imagined music based on EEG recordings from 21 professional musicians (6 females and 15 males). Regression analyses were conducted to demonstrate that imagined neural signals can be predicted accurately, similarly to the listening task, and were sufficiently robust to allow for accurate identification of the imagined musical piece from the EEG. In doing so, our results indicate that imagery and listening tasks elicited an overlapping but distinctive topography of neural responses to sound acoustics, which is in line with previous fMRI literature. Melodic expectation, however, evoked very similar frontal spatial activation in both conditions, suggesting that they are supported by the same underlying mechanisms. Finally, neural responses induced by imagery exhibited a specific transformation from the listening condition, which primarily included a relative delay and a polarity inversion of the response. This transformation demonstrates the top-down predictive nature of the expectation mechanisms arising during both listening and imagery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that the human brain is activated during musical imagery: the act of voluntarily hearing music in our mind without external stimulation. It is unclear, however, what the temporal dynamics of this activation are, as well as what musical features are precisely encoded in the neural signals. This study uses an experimental paradigm with high temporal precision to record and analyze the cortical activity during musical imagery. This study reveals that neural signals encode music acoustics and melodic expectations during both listening and imagery. Crucially, it is also found that a simple mapping based on a time-shift and a polarity inversion could robustly describe the relationship between listening and imagery signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Music of Silence: Part II: Music Listening Induces Imagery Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>During music listening, humans routinely acquire the regularities of the acoustic sequences and use them to anticipate and interpret the ongoing melody. Specifically, in line with this predictive framework, it is thought that brain responses during such listening reflect a comparison between the bottom-up sensory responses and top-down prediction signals generated by an internal model that embodies the music exposure and expectations of the listener. To attain a clear view of these predictive responses, previous work has eliminated the sensory inputs by inserting artificial silences (or sound omissions) that leave behind only the corresponding predictions of the thwarted expectations. Here, we demonstrate a new alternate approach in which we decode the predictive electroencephalography (EEG) responses to the silent intervals that are naturally interspersed within the music. We did this as participants (experiment 1, 20 participants, 10 female; experiment 2, 21 participants, 6 female) listened or imagined Bach piano melodies. Prediction signals were quantified and assessed via a computational model of the melodic structure of the music and were shown to exhibit the same response characteristics when measured during listening or imagining. These include an inverted polarity for both silence and imagined responses relative to listening, as well as response magnitude modulations that precisely reflect the expectations of notes and silences in both listening and imagery conditions. These findings therefore provide a unifying view that links results from many previous paradigms, including omission reactions and the expectation modulation of sensory responses, all in the context of naturalistic music listening.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Music perception depends on our ability to learn and detect melodic structures. It has been suggested that our brain does so by actively predicting upcoming music notes, a process inducing instantaneous neural responses as the music confronts these expectations. Here, we studied this prediction process using EEGs recorded while participants listen to and imagine Bach melodies. Specifically, we examined neural signals during the ubiquitous musical pauses (or silent intervals) in a music stream and analyzed them in contrast to the imagery responses. We find that imagined predictive responses are routinely co-opted during ongoing music listening. These conclusions are revealed by a new paradigm using listening and imagery of naturalistic melodies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Delays to Reward Delivery Enhance the Preference for an Initially Less Desirable Option: Role for the Basolateral Amygdala and Retrosplenial Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal costs influence reward-based decisions. This is commonly studied in temporal discounting tasks that involve choosing between cues signaling an imminent reward option or a delayed reward option. However, it is unclear whether the temporal delay before a reward can alter the value of that option. To address this, we identified the relative preference between different flavored rewards during a free-feeding test using male and female rats. Animals underwent training where either the initial preferred or the initial less preferred reward was delivered noncontingently. By manipulating the intertrial interval during training sessions, we could determine whether temporal delays impact reward preference in a subsequent free-feeding test. Rats maintained their initial preference if the same delays were used across all training sessions. When the initial less preferred option was delivered after short delays (high reward rate) and the initial preferred option was delivered after long delays (low reward rate), rats expectedly increased their preference for the initial less desirable option. However, rats also increased their preference for the initial less desirable option under the opposite training contingencies: delivering the initial less preferred reward after long delays and the initial preferred reward after short delays. These data suggest that sunk temporal costs enhance the preference for a less desirable reward option. Pharmacological and lesion experiments were performed to identify the neural systems responsible for this behavioral phenomenon. Our findings demonstrate the basolateral amygdala and retrosplenial cortex are required for temporal delays to enhance the preference for an initially less desirable reward.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The goal of this study was to determine how temporal delays influence reward preference. We demonstrate that delivering an initially less desirable reward after long delays subsequently increases the consumption and preference for that reward. Furthermore, we identified the basolateral amygdala and the retrosplenial cortex as essential nuclei for mediating the change in reward preference elicited by sunk temporal costs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Monoamine Oxidase-B Inhibition Facilitates {alpha}-Synuclein Secretion In Vitro and Delays Its Aggregation in rAAV-Based Rat Models of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cell-to-cell transmission of &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) pathology is considered to underlie the spread of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have demonstrated that &alpha;-syn is secreted under physiological conditions in neuronal cell lines and primary neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate extracellular &alpha;-syn secretion remain unclear. In this study, we found that inhibition of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) enzymatic activity facilitated &alpha;-syn secretion in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Both inhibition of MAO-B by selegiline or rasagiline and siRNA-mediated knock-down of MAO-B facilitated &alpha;-syn secretion. However, TVP-1022, the S-isomer of rasagiline that is 1000 times less active, failed to facilitate &alpha;-syn secretion. Additionally, the MAO-B inhibition-induced increase in &alpha;-syn secretion was unaffected by brefeldin A, which inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi transport, but was blocked by probenecid and glyburide, which inhibit ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter function. MAO-B inhibition preferentially facilitated the secretion of detergent-insoluble &alpha;-syn protein and decreased its intracellular accumulation under chloroquine-induced lysosomal dysfunction. Moreover, in a rat model (male Sprague Dawley rats) generated by injecting recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-A53T &alpha;-syn, subcutaneous administration of selegiline delayed the striatal formation of Ser129-phosphorylated &alpha;-syn aggregates, and mitigated loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Selegiline also delayed &alpha;-syn aggregation and dopaminergic neuronal loss in a cell-to-cell transmission rat model (male Sprague Dawley rats) generated by injecting rAAV-wild-type &alpha;-syn and externally inoculating &alpha;-syn fibrils into the striatum. These findings suggest that MAO-B inhibition modulates the intracellular clearance of detergent-insoluble &alpha;-syn via the ABC transporter-mediated non-classical secretion pathway, and temporarily suppresses the formation and transmission of &alpha;-syn aggregates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The identification of a neuroprotective agent that slows or stops the progression of motor impairments is required to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). The process of &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) aggregation is thought to underlie neurodegeneration in PD. Here, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition or knock-down of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) in SH-SY5Y cells facilitated &alpha;-syn secretion via a non-classical pathway involving an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. MAO-B inhibition preferentially facilitated secretion of detergent-insoluble &alpha;-syn protein and reduced its intracellular accumulation under chloroquine-induced lysosomal dysfunction. Additionally, MAO-B inhibition by selegiline protected A53T &alpha;-syn-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal loss and suppressed the formation and cell-to-cell transmission of &alpha;-syn aggregates in rat models. We therefore propose a new function of MAO-B inhibition that modulates &alpha;-syn secretion and aggregation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Change of Endocannabinoid Signaling in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Controls the Development of Depression After Neuropathic Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many patients with chronic pain conditions suffer from depression. The mechanisms underlying pain-induced depression are still unclear. There are critical links of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) synaptic function to depression, with signaling through the endocannabinoid (eCB) system as an important contributor. We hypothesized that afferent noxious inputs after injury compromise activity-dependent eCB signaling in the mPFC, resulting in depression. Depression-like behaviors were tested in male and female rats with traumatic neuropathy [spared nerve injury (SNI)], and neuronal activity in the mPFC was monitored using the immediate early gene c-<I>fos</I> and <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiological recordings. mPFC eCB Concentrations were determined using mass spectrometry, and behavioral and electrophysiological experiments were used to evaluate the role of alterations in eCB signaling in depression after pain. SNI-induced pain induced the development of depression phenotypes in both male and female rats. Pyramidal neurons in mPFC showed increased excitability followed by reduced excitability in the onset and prolonged phases of pain, respectively. Concentrations of the eCBs, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the mPFC, were elevated initially after SNI, and our results indicate that this resulted in a loss of CB1R function on GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC. These data suggest that excessive release of 2-AG as a result of noxious stimuli triggers use-dependent loss of function of eCB signaling leading to excessive GABA release in the mPFC, with the final result being behavioral depression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pain has both somatosensory and affective components, so the complexity of mechanisms underlying chronic pain is best represented by a biopsychosocial model that includes widespread CNS dysfunction. Many patients with chronic pain conditions develop depression. The mechanism by which pain causes depression is unclear. Although manipulation of the eCB signaling system as an avenue for providing analgesia per se has not shown much promise in previous studies. An important limitation of past research has been inadequate consideration of the dynamic nature of the connection between pain and depression as they develop. Here, we show that activity-dependent synthesis of eCBs during the initial onset of persistent pain is the critical link leading to depression when pain is persistent.</p>

                Background: Surface roughness is one of the most important characteristics of endodontic instruments, correlating to instrument fracture. The purpose of this study was to measure the surface roughness values of these instruments before and after resin root canal preparation without previous glide path preparation, with the new method. Data was obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopes (FE-SEM) combined with independent ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Methods: A total of 20 simulated J-shape resin blocks with a radius of 4.5 mm, length of 16 mm, and angle of inflection of 600 were chosen and distributed into two equal groups. Each group was prepared by the WaveOne Gold Primary (Dentsply Sirona, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) or the Reciproc Blue R25 (VDW, Munich, Germany) instruments, without glide path preparation. Special molds were used to confirm the same areas on the cutting blade at 3 mm and the instruments’ tips were scanned by FE-SEM, at different observed times. The parameters of Ra, Rq, and Rz in each sample were collected using the ImageJ software for analyses. The data was processed using the paired t-test with a significance level of 0.05. Results: Right after the first resin canal instrumentation, the surface roughness parameters of the two reciprocating investigated instruments were decreased. Conclusions: The FE-SEM images processed using the ImageJ software offered a trustworthy and suitable method for assessment of the NiTi endodontic file surface roughness.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutamate is packaged in vesicles via two main vesicular transporter (VGLUT) proteins, VGLUT1 and VGLUT 2 which regulate its storage and release from synapses of excitatory neurons. Studies in rodents, primates, <b>ferrets</b> and tree shrews suggest that these transporters may identify distinct subsets of excitatory projections in visual structures, particularly in thalamocortical pathways where they tend to correlate with modulatory and driver projections respectively. Despite being a well-studied model of thalamocortical connectivity, little is known about their expression pattern in the cat visual system. To expand current knowledge on their distribution and how they correlated with known driver and modulator projecting sites, we examined the protein expression patterns of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the visual thalamus of the cat (lateral geniculate nucleus and the pulvinar complex). We also studied their expression pattern in relevant visual structures projecting to or receiving significant thalamic projections such <b>as</b> the primary visual cortex and the superior colliculus. Our results indicate that both VGLUTs are consistently present throughout the cat visual system and show laminar or nuclei specificity in their distribution which suggests, as in other species, that <b>VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 represent distinct populations of glutamatergic projections.</b></p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The acceptability and side effects of COVID-19 vaccine among health care workers in Nigeria: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is global public health crisis. Mass vaccination, until herd immunity is achieved, is one of the most effective ways of combating the deadly infectious virus. The disposition of health workers towards the AstraZeneca vaccine will most likely determine if other members of the community will be willing to get vaccinated or not. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes of healthcare workers to the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as determine the various side effects experienced by those who have already been vaccinated. Method: Frequency tables were created, and Chi-square was used to determine the relationship between respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, as well as their acceptance or rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine and attitude towards it. Using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0, multinominal logistic regression was used to determine the key factors which influenced respondents’ decision to have the vaccine. Result: There was a statistically significant relationship between the cadre of health care workers, their tribe, and their involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients and their attitude towards the vaccine. Conclusion: Previous involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients is one of the most important determinants of health care workers' acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Most respondents were positive about the vaccine; however, the fear of side effects was the primary reason why those who were yet to be vaccinated, do not plan to do so. The most common side effect reported by those who had already been vaccinated, was pain at the injection site. Public awareness of the vaccine and its benefits should be increased, and the vaccine should be made available in all health care facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Accuracy of digital dental models and three-dimensional printed dental models in linear measurements and Bolton analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to advances in digital technology, it is possible to obtain digital dental models through intraoral scanning. The stereolithographic data collected from the scanner can subsequently be printed into a three-dimensional dental model in resinic material. However, the accuracy between digital dental models and printed dental models needs to be evaluated since it might affect diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontic treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of digital models scanned by a Trios intraoral scanner and three-dimensional dental models printed using a Formlabs 2 3D printer in linear measurements and Bolton analysis. Methods: A total of 35 subjects were included in this study. All subjects were scanned using a Trios intraoral scanner to obtain digital study models. Stereolithographic data from previous scanning was printed using a Formlabs 2 3D printer to obtain printed study models. Mesiodistal, intercanine, intermolar, and Bolton analysis from all types of study models were measured. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess intraobserver and interobserver reliability. All data were then statistically analyzed. Results: The reliability tests were high for both intraobserver and interobserver reliability, which demonstrates high reproducibility for all measurements on all model types. Most of the data compared between study models showed no statistically significant differences, though some data differed significantly. However, the differences are considered clinically insignificant. Conclusion: Digital dental models and three-dimensional printed dental models may be used interchangeably with plaster dental models for diagnostic and treatment planning purposes. Keywords: Accuracy, 3D printing, digital dental model, printed dental model.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Co‐localisation of nociceptive markers in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord of dromedary camel</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nociceptive markers in mice have been identified in two distinct peptidergic and nonpeptidergic neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and distributed in different laminae of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Recently, however, a study in humans showed a significant overlapping in these two populations. In this study, we investigated the distribution of various nociceptive markers in the lumbar DRG and spinal cord of the dromedary camel. Immunohistochemical data showed a remarkable percentage of total neurons in the DRG expressed IB4 binding (54.5%), CGRP (49.5%), TRPV1 (48.2%), and NOS (30.6%). The co-localisation data showed that 89.6% of CGRP- and 74.0% of TRPV1-labelled neurons were IB4-positive. In addition, 61.6% of TRPV1- and 84.2% of NOS-immunoreactive neurons were also co-localised with CGRP. The distribution of IB4-, CGRP-, TRPV1-, SP-, and NOS-immunoreactivities in the spinal cord were observed in laminae I-IIo. Quantitative data showed that 82.4% of IB4 positive nerve terminals in laminae I-IIo were co-localised with CGRP, and 86.0% of CGRP labelled terminals were co-localised with IB4. Similarly, 85.1% of NOS labelled nerve terminals were co-localised with CGRP. No NPY- or CCK- immunoreactivities were detected in the DRG, and no co-localisation between IB4, NPY, and CCK were observed in the spinal cord. Our results demonstrate marked convergence of nociceptive markers in the primary afferent neurons in camels, which is similar to humans rather than the mouse. The data also emphasises the importance of interspecies differences when selecting ideal animal models for studying nociception and treating chronic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Expression and distribution of synaptotagmin family members in the zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptotagmins belong to a large family of proteins. While various synaptotagmins have been implicated as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for vesicle replenishment and release at conventional synapses, their roles at retinal ribbon synapses remain incompletely understood. Zebrafish is a widely used experimental model for retinal research. We therefore investigated the homology between human, rat, mouse, and zebrafish synaptotagmins 1 to 10 using a bioinformatics approach. We also characterized the expression and distribution of various synaptotagmin (<i>syt</i>) genes in the zebrafish retina using RT-PCR, qPCR and <i>in situ</i> hybridization, focusing on the family members whose products likely underlie Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis in the central nervous system (synaptotagmins 1, 2, 5 and 7). Most zebrafish synaptotagmins are well conserved and can be grouped in the same classes as mammalian synaptotagmins, based on crucial amino acid residues needed for coordinating Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and determining phospholipid binding affinity. The only exception is synaptotagmin 1b, which lacks 34 amino acid residues in the C2B domain and is therefore unlikely to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> there. Additionally, the products of zebrafish <i>syt5a</i> and <i>syt5b</i> genes share identity with mammalian class 1 and 5 synaptotagmins. Zebrafish <i>syt1</i>, <i>syt2</i>, <i>syt5</i> and <i>syt7</i> paralogues are found in the zebrafish brain, eye, and retina, excepting <i>syt1b</i>, which is only present in the brain. The complementary expression pattern of the remaining paralogues in the retina suggests that <i>syt1a</i> and <i>syt5a</i> may underlie synchronous release and <i>syt7a</i> and <i>syt7b</i> may mediate asynchronous release or other Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent processes in different retinal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Learning offline: memory replay in biological and artificial reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning to act in an environment to maximise rewards is among the brain’s key functions. This process has often been conceptualised within the framework of reinforcement learning, which has also gained prominence in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) as a way to optimise decision making. A common aspect of both biological and machine reinforcement learning is the reactivation of previously experienced episodes, referred to as replay. Replay is important for memory consolidation in biological neural networks and is key to stabilising learning in deep neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Ripples for recall: The hippocampus constructing the context?</a></h4>

              
                In this issue of Neuron, Norman et al. (2021) show that contrary to classical systems consolidation theories, hippocampal ripples orchestrate recall of both autobiographical and semantic memories. Similarity of ripple patterns furthermore suggests a semantization process as autobiographical memories age.

                Yu et al. characterized the structures of a principal neurotransmitter receptor in adult humans, the heteromeric glycine receptor, in multiple functional states. They discovered an unexpected architecture and revealed how it gives rise to native physiological function, which suggests how higher-order assemblies form to allow neurotransmission.

                In this study, Lagomarsino et al. describe the generation of an iPSC collection from 53 deeply phenotyped individuals. These lines are coupled to RNA-seq and proteomic profiling of both iPSC neurons and brain of the same individuals. Using this system, biological insights are uncovered regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s disease.

                Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays an important role in innate immunity by controlling type I interferon response against invaded pathogens. In this work we describe a previously unknown role of STING in lipid metabolism in <i>Drosophila</i>. Flies with <i>STING</i> deletion are sensitive to starvation and oxidative stress, have reduced lipid storage and downregulated expression of lipid metabolism genes. We found that <i>Drosophila</i> STING interacts with lipid synthesizing enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). ACC and FASN also interact with each other, indicating that all three proteins may be components of a large multi-enzyme complex. The deletion of <i>Drosophila</i><i> STING </i>leads to disturbed ACC localization and decreased FASN enzyme activity. Together, our results demonstrate a previously undescribed role of STING in lipid metabolism in <i>Drosophila</i>.

Cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing cells in the hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) are necessary for initiating escape from innate threats via a projection to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). We now show that in mice PMd-cck cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Intriguingly, PMd-cck and dlPAG activity in mice showed higher mutual information during exposure to innate and conditioned threats. In parallel, human fMRI data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increased activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd-dlPAG circuit as a central node, controlling escape vigor elicited by both innate and conditioned threats.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The dual role of amyloid β-sheet interaction sequences in the cell surface properties of FLO11-encoded flocculins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Fungal adhesins (Als) or flocculins are family of cell surface proteins that mediate adhesion to diverse biotic and abiotic surfaces. A striking characteristic of Als proteins originally identified in the pathogenic <i>Candida albicans</i> is to form functional amyloids that mediate <i>cis-</i>interaction leading to the formation of adhesin nanodomains and <i>trans</i>- interaction between amyloid sequences of opposing cells. In this report, we show that flocculins encoded by <i>FLO11</i> in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> behave like adhesins in <i>C. albicans</i>. To do so, we show that the formation of nanodomains under an external physical force requires a threshold number of amyloid-forming sequences in the Flo11 protein. Then, using a genome editing approach, we constructed strains expressing variants of the Flo11 protein under the endogenous<i> FLO11</i> promoter, leading to the demonstration that the loss of amyloid-forming sequences strongly reduces cell-cell interaction but has no effect on either plastic adherence or invasive growth in agar, both phenotypes being dependent on the N- and C-terminal ends of Flo11p. Finally, we show that the location of Flo11 is not altered either by the absence of amyloid-forming sequences or by the removal of the N- or C-terminus of the protein.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endoplasmic reticulum tubules limit the size of misfolded protein condensates</a></h4>

              
                The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is composed of sheets and tubules. Here we report that the COPII coat subunit, SEC24C, works with the long form of the tubular ER-phagy receptor, RTN3, to target dominant-interfering mutant proinsulin<i> Akita</i> puncta to lysosomes. When the delivery of <i>Akita</i> puncta to lysosomes was disrupted, large puncta accumulated in the ER. Unexpectedly, photobleach analysis indicated that <i>Akita</i> puncta behaved as condensates and not aggregates, as previously suggested. <i>Akita</i> puncta enlarged when either RTN3 or SEC24C were depleted, or when ER sheets were proliferated by either knocking out Lunapark or overexpressing CLIMP63. Other ER-phagy substrates that are segregated into tubules behaved like <i>Akita</i>, while a substrate (type I procollagen) that is degraded by the ER-phagy sheets receptor, FAM134B, did not. Conversely, when ER tubules were augmented in Lunapark knock-out cells by overexpressing reticulons, ER-phagy increased and the number of large <i>Akita</i> puncta were reduced. Our findings imply that segregating cargos into tubules has two beneficial roles. First, it localizes mutant misfolded proteins, the receptor and SEC24C to the same ER domain. Second, physically restraining condensates within tubules, before they undergo ER-phagy, prevents them from enlarging and impacting cell health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mitochondrial permeability transition pore activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and promotes aging</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial activity determines aging rate and the onset of chronic diseases. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a pathological pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane thought to be composed of the F-ATP synthase (complex V). OSCP, a subunit of F-ATP synthase, helps protect against mPTP formation. How the destabilization of OSCP may contribute to aging, however, is unclear. We have found that loss OSCP in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> initiates the mPTP and shortens lifespan specifically during adulthood, in part via initiation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>). Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the mPTP inhibits the UPR<sup>mt</sup> and restores normal lifespan. Loss of the putative pore-forming component of F-ATP synthase extends adult lifespan, suggesting that the mPTP normally promotes aging. Our findings reveal how an mPTP/UPR<sup>mt</sup> nexus may contribute to aging and age-related diseases and how inhibition of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> may be protective under certain conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human genetic analyses of organelles highlight the nucleus in age-related trait heritability</a></h4>

              
                Most age-related human diseases are accompanied by a decline in cellular organelle integrity, including impaired lysosomal proteostasis and defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. An open question, however, is the degree to which inherited variation in or near genes encoding each organelle contributes to age-related disease pathogenesis. Here, we evaluate if genetic loci encoding organelle proteomes confer greater-than-expected age-related disease risk. As mitochondrial dysfunction is a 'hallmark' of aging, we begin by assessing nuclear and mitochondrial DNA loci near genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome and surprisingly observe a lack of enrichment across 24 age-related traits. Within nine other organelles, we find no enrichment with one exception: the nucleus, where enrichment emanates from nuclear transcription factors. In agreement, we find that genes encoding several organelles tend to be 'haplosufficient', while we observe strong purifying selection against heterozygous protein-truncating variants impacting the nucleus. Our work identifies common variation near transcription factors as having outsize influence on age-related trait risk, motivating future efforts to determine if and how this inherited variation then contributes to observed age-related organelle deterioration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural insights into the activation of human calcium-sensing receptor</a></h4>

              
                Human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that maintains Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in serum. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the CaSR in the inactive and agonist+PAM bound states. Complemented with previously reported structures of CaSR, we show that in addition to the full inactive and active states, there are multiple intermediate states during the activation of CaSR. We used a negative allosteric nanobody to stabilize the CaSR in the fully inactive state and found a new binding site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion that acts as a composite agonist with L-amino acid to stabilize the closure of active Venus flytraps. Our data show that agonist binding leads to compaction of the dimer, proximity of the cysteine-rich domains, large-scale transitions of 7-transmembrane domains, and inter- and intrasubunit conformational changes of 7-transmembrane domains to accommodate downstream transducers. Our results reveal the structural basis for activation mechanisms of CaSR and clarify the mode of action of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and L-amino acid leading to the activation of the receptor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In situ imaging of bacterial outer membrane projections and associated protein complexes using electron cryo-tomography</a></h4>

              
                The ability to produce outer membrane projections in the form of tubular membrane extensions (MEs) and membrane vesicles (MVs) is a widespread phenomenon among diderm bacteria. Despite this, our knowledge of the ultrastructure of these extensions and their associated protein complexes remains limited. Here, we surveyed the ultrastructure and formation of MEs and MVs, and their associated protein complexes, in tens of thousands of electron cryo-tomograms of ~ 90 bacterial species that we have collected for various projects over the past 15 years (Jensen lab database), in addition to data generated in the Briegel lab. We identified outer MEs and MVs in 13 diderm bacterial species and classified several major ultrastructures: 1) tubes with a uniform diameter (with or without an internal scaffold), 2) tubes with irregular diameter, 3) tubes with a vesicular dilation at their tip, 4) pearling tubes, 5) connected chains of vesicles (with or without neck-like connectors), 6) budding vesicles and nanopods. We also identified several protein complexes associated with these MEs and MVs which were distributed either randomly or exclusively at the tip. These complexes include a secretin-like structure and a novel crown-shaped structure observed primarily in vesicles from lysed cells. In total, this work helps to characterize the diversity of bacterial membrane projections and lays the groundwork for future research in this field.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Skeleton interoception regulates bone and fat metabolism through hypothalamic neuroendocrine NPY</a></h4>

              
                The central nervous system regulates activity of peripheral organs through interoception. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that PGE2/EP4 skeleton interception regulate bone homeostasis. Here we show that ascending skeleton interoceptive signaling downregulates expression of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and induce lipolysis of adipose tissue for osteoblastic bone formation. Specifically, the ascending skeleton interoceptive signaling induces expression of small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE) in the hypothalamus. SMILE binds to pCREB as a transcriptional heterodimer on Npy promoters to inhibit NPY expression. Knockout of EP4 in sensory nerve increases expression of NPY causing bone catabolism and fat anabolism. Importantly, inhibition of NPY Y1 receptor (Y1R) accelerated oxidation of free fatty acids in osteoblasts and rescued bone loss in Avil<sup>Cre</sup>:Ptger<sup>4fl/fl</sup> mice. Thus, downregulation of hypothalamic NPY expression lipolyzes free fatty acids for anabolic bone formation through a neuroendocrine descending interoceptive regulation.

                Exposure to enriched environments (EE) throughout a lifetime, providing so called reserve, protects against cognitive decline in later years. It has been hypothesised that high levels of alertness necessitated by EE might strengthen the right fronto-parietal networks (FPN) to facilitate this neurocognitive resilience. We have previously shown that EE offset age-related deficits in selective attention by preserving grey matter within right fronto-parietal regions. Here, using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), we examined the relationship between EE, microstructural properties of fronto-parietal white matter association pathways (three branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, SLF), structural brain health (atrophy), and attention (alertness, orienting and executive control) in a group of older adults. We show that EE is associated with a lower orientation dispersion index (ODI) within the right SLF1 which in turn mediates the relationship between EE and alertness, as well as grey- and white-matter atrophy. This suggests that EE may induce white matter plasticity (and prevent age-related dispersion of axons) within the right FPN to facilitate the preservation of neurocognitive health in later years.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity gradients as a common neural architecture for predictive processing in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Predictive processing is emerging as a common neurocomputational hypothesis to account for diverse psychological functions subserved by a brain, enabling characterization of computational capacities of its distinct substructures. However, the literature is currently lacking a systems-level framework for understanding brain structure-function relationships based on the unified computational principles. Here, we contribute to this framework by examining gradients of functional connectivity as a low dimensional spatial representation of functional variation within a given structure. Specifically, we investigated functional connectivity gradients in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus using resting-state functional MRI data collected from large samples of healthy young adults. We then evaluated the degree to which these structures share common principles of functional organization by assessing the correspondence of their gradients. We show that the organizing principles of these structures primarily follow two functional gradients consistent with the existing accounts of predictive processing: A model-error gradient that describes the flow of prediction and prediction error signals, and a model-precision gradient that differentiates regions involved in the representation and attentional modulation of such signals in the cerebral cortex. Using these gradients, we also demonstrate triangulation of functional connectivity involving distinct subregions of the three structures, suggesting the existence of parallel functional circuits that may subserve different aspects of predictive processing in the brain. These findings allow formulation of novel computational hypotheses about the functional relationships between the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus that may be instrumental for understanding the brain's dynamics within its large-scale predictive architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamic bursts modulate cortical synchrony locally to switch between states of global functional connectivity in a cognitive task</a></h4>

              
                Performing a cognitive task requires going through a sequence of functionally diverse stages. Although it is typically assumed that these stages are characterized by distinct states of cortical synchrony that are triggered by sub-cortical events, little reported evidence supports this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis, we first identified cognitive stages in single-trial MEG data of an associative recognition task, showing with a novel method that each stage begins with local modulations of synchrony followed by a state of directed functional connectivity. Second, we developed the first whole-brain model that can simulate cortical synchrony throughout a task. The model suggests that the observed synchrony is caused by thalamocortical bursts at the onset of each stage, targeted at cortical synapses and interacting with the structural anatomical connectivity. These findings confirm that cognitive stages are defined by distinct states of cortical synchrony and explains the network-level mechanisms necessary for reaching stage-dependent synchrony states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and the orthoreovirus p15 cause neuronal and glial fusion</a></h4>

              
                Numerous enveloped viruses use specialized surface molecules called fusogens to enter host cells. During virus replication, these fusogens decorate the host cells membrane enabling them the ability to fuse with neighboring cells, forming syncytia that the viruses use to propagate while evading the immune system. Many of these viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infect the brain and may cause serious neurological symptoms through mechanisms which remain poorly understood. Here we show that expression of either the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or p15 protein from the baboon orthoreovirus is sufficient to induce fusion between interconnected neurons, as well as between neurons and glial cells. This phenomenon is observed across species, from nematodes to mammals, including human embryonic stem cells-derived neurons and brain organoids. We show that fusion events are progressive, can occur between distant neurites, and lead to the formation of multicellular syncytia. Finally, we reveal that in addition to intracellular molecules, fusion events allow diffusion and movement of large organelles such as mitochondria between fused neurons. Our results provide important mechanistic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses could affect the nervous system circuitries causing neurological symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Refining epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations using deep learning: a reverse engineering approach</a></h4>

              
                Intracranially-recorded interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been proposed as a promising spatial biomarker of the epileptogenic zone. However, visual verification of HFOs is time-consuming and exhibits poor inter-rater reliability. Furthermore, no method is currently available to distinguish HFOs generated from the epileptogenic zone (epileptogenic HFOs: eHFOs) from those generated from other areas (non-epileptogenic HFOs: non-eHFOs). To address these issues, we constructed a deep learning (DL)-based algorithm using HFO events from chronic intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data via subdural grids from 19 children with medication-resistant neocortical epilepsy to: 1) replicate human expert annotation of artifacts and HFOs with or without spikes, and 2) discover eHFOs by designing a novel weakly supervised model (HFOs from the resected brain regions are initially labeled as eHFOs, and those from the preserved brain regions as non-eHFOs). The "purification power" of DL is then used to automatically relabel the HFOs to distill eHFOs. Using 12,958 annotated HFO events from 19 patients, the model achieved 96.3% accuracy on artifact detection (F1 score = 96.8%) and 86.5% accuracy on classifying HFOs with or without spikes (F1 score = 80.8%) using patient-wise cross-validation. Based on the DL-based algorithm trained from 84,602 HFO events from nine patients who achieved seizure-freedom after resection, the majority of such DL-discovered eHFOs were found to be HFOs with spikes (78.6%, p < 0.001). While the resection ratio of detected HFOs (number of resected HFOs/number of detected HFOs) did not correlate significantly with post-operative seizure freedom (the area under the curve [AUC]=0.76, p=0.06), the resection ratio of eHFOs positively correlated with post-operative seizure freedom (AUC=0.87, p=0.01). We discovered that the eHFOs had a higher signal intensity associated with ripple (80-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-500 Hz) bands at the HFO onset and with a lower frequency band throughout the event time window (the inverted T-shaped), compared to non-eHFOs. We then designed perturbations on the input of the trained model for non-eHFOs to determine the model's decision-making logic. The model probability significantly increased towards eHFOs by the artificial introduction of signals in the inverted T-shaped frequency bands (mean probability increase: 0.285, p < 0.001), and by the artificial insertion of spike-like signals into the time domain (mean probability increase: 0.452, p < 0.001). With this DL-based framework, we reliably replicated HFO classification tasks by human experts. Using a reverse engineering technique, we distinguished eHFOs from others and identified salient features of eHFOs that aligned with current knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scale Invariance in fNIRS as a Measurement of Cognitive Load</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive load is an important psychological construct, closely related to performance and fatigue in daily cognitive tasks. Scale invariant neural dynamics are a relatively new but effective means of measuring changes in brain states as a result of varied cognitive load and task difficulty. This study is the first to test whether scale invariance (as measured by the Hurst exponent, H) can be used with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to quantify cognitive load. We analyzed H extracted from the fNIRS time series while participants completed an N-back working memory task. Consistent with what has been demonstrated in fMRI, the current results showed that scale-invariance analysis significantly differentiated between task and rest periods as calculated from both oxy- (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) concentration changes. Results from both channel-averaged Hurst and a multivariate partial least squares approach (Task PLS) demonstrated higher H during the 1-back task than the 2-back task. These results were stronger for Hurst derived from HbR than from HbO. As fNIRS is relatively portable and robust to motion-related artifacts, these preliminary results shed light on the promising future of measuring cognitive load in real life settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell types and clonal relations in the mouse brain revealed by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain contains a large number of specialized cells that develop from a thin sheet of neuroepithelial progenitor cells. Recently, high throughput single-cell technologies have been used to define the molecular diversity of hundreds of cell types in the nervous system. However, the lineage relationships between mature brain cells and progenitor cells are not well understood, because transcriptomic studies do not allow insights into clonal relationships and classical fate-mapping techniques are not scalable. Here we show in vivo barcoding of early progenitor cells that enables simultaneous profiling of cell phenotypes and clonal relations in the mouse brain using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We reconstructed thousands of clones to uncover the existence of fate-restricted progenitor cells in the mouse hippocampal neuroepithelium and show that microglia are derived from few primitive myeloid precursors that massively expand to generate widely dispersed progeny. By coupling spatial transcriptomics with clonal barcoding, we disentangle migration patterns of clonally related cells in densely labelled tissue sections. Compared to classical fate mapping, our approach enables high-throughput dense reconstruction of cell phenotypes and clonal relations at the single-cell and tissue level in individual animals and provides an integrated approach for understanding tissue architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age differences in aperiodic neural activity measured with resting EEG</a></h4>

              
                Previous research using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) has shown that neural oscillatory activity within the alpha band (8 to 12 Hz) becomes slower and lower in amplitude with advanced age. However, most studies have focused on quantifying age-related differences in periodic oscillatory activity with little consideration of the influence of aperiodic activity on these measures. The aim of this study was to investigate age differences in aperiodic activity inherent in the resting EEG signal. We assessed aperiodic activity in 85 healthy younger adults (mean age: 22.2 years, SD: 3.9, age range: 18 to 35, 37 male) and 92 healthy older adults (mean age: 66.1 years, SD: 8.2, age range 50 to 86, 53 male) by fitting the 1/f-like background activity evident in EEG power spectra using the fitting oscillations & one over f (FOOOF) toolbox. Across the scalp, the aperiodic exponent and offset were smaller in older compared to younger participants, reflecting a flatter 1/f-like slope and a downward broadband shift in the power spectra with age. Before correcting for aperiodic activity, older adults showed slower peak alpha frequency and reduced peak alpha power relative to younger adults. After correcting for aperiodic activity, peak alpha frequency remained slower in older adults; however, peak alpha power no longer differed statistically between age groups. The large sample size utilized in this study, as well as the depth of analysis, provides further evidence that the aperiodic component of the resting EEG signal is altered with aging and should be considered when investigating neural oscillatory activity.
