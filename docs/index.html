	<p>Musculoskeletal conditions often involve pain related to specific movements. However, most studies on the impact of experimental pain on motor performance and learning have used tonic pain models. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of experimental phasic pain during the preparation or execution of a reaching task on the acquisition and retention of sensorimotor adaptation. Participants were divided into three groups: no pain, pain during motor preparation, and pain during motor execution. Pain was induced over the scapula with a laser while participants performed a force field adaptation task over two days. To assess the effect of pain on motor performance, two baseline conditions (with or without pain) involving unperturbed pointing movements were also conducted. The results indicated that the timing of the nociceptive stimulus differently affected baseline movement performance. Pain during motor preparation shortened reaction time, while pain during movement execution decreased task performance. However, when these baseline effects were accounted for, no impact of pain on motor adaptation or retention was observed. All groups showed significant improvements in all motor variables for both adaptation and retention. In conclusion, while acute phasic pain during motor preparation or execution can affect the movement itself, it does not interfere with motor acquisition or retention during a motor adaptation task.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with inflammation and a high level of comorbidities. Atypical depression (AD) is a MDD subtype based on DSM criteria, that could have specific underlying biological mechanisms. AD is associated with elevated cardiovascular (CVD) comorbidities, higher risk of suicide attempts, hypersomnia, and anxiety disorder. In this study, we aim to investigate if AD and polysomnographic parameters could be associated with low-grade inflammation (LGI). LGI is defined by a range from 3 to 10 mg/L of C-reactive protein levels. We carried out a retrospective cohort study in which 765 individuals with MDD were split into two groups: with and without LGI. Our results exhibit differences between the groups for the polysomnographic parameters, with the LGI group showing parameters already associated with inflammation such as reduced rapid eye movement sleep and elevated hypoxemia markers (identified as CVD risk factor). We found that AD is associated with LGI (OR 1.48; p = 0.047) after adjustment. Likewise, we found an LGI prevalence in AD higher (34.8%) than in MDD without atypical features (26.8%). Overall, these results confirm the low-grade inflammation feature of AD and highlight polysomnographic parameters associated with LGI that could also act as risk factors in this context.</p>

	<p>Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a severe complication following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), linked to poor functional outcomes and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Timely DCI diagnosis is crucial but remains challenging. Dysregulated blood glucose, commonly observed after aSAH, may impair the constant glucose supply that is vital for brain function, potentially contributing to DCI. This study aimed to assess whether glucose indices could help identify at-risk patients and improve DCI detection. This retrospective, single-center observational study examined 151 aSAH patients between 2016 and 2019. Additionally, 70 of these (46.4%) developed DCI and 81 did not (no-DCI). To determine the value of glycemic indices for DCI, they were analyzed separately in patients in the period before (pre-DCI) and after DCI (post-DCI). The time-weighted average glucose (TWAG, p = 0.024), mean blood glucose (p = 0.033), and novel time-unified dysglycemic rate (TUDR140, calculated as the ratio of dysglycemic to total periods within a glucose target range of 70&amp;amp;ndash;140 mg/dL, p = 0.042), showed significantly higher values in the pre-DCI period of the DCI group than in the no-DCI group. In the time-series analysis, significant increases in TWAG and TUDR140 were observed at the DCI onset. In conclusion, DCI patients showed elevated blood glucose levels before and a further increase at the DCI onset. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings, as this retrospective, single-center study cannot completely exclude confounders and limitations. In the future blood glucose indices might become valuable parameters in multiparametric models to identify patients at risk and detect DCI onset earlier.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-858/v5?src=rss">Factors associated with inadequate urinary iodine concentration among pregnant women in Mbeya region Tanzania. [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Insufficient and above WHO-recommended levels of iodine intake during pregnancy can lead to serious health outcomes. This study aimed to assess median urine iodine concentration and its associated risk factors among pregnant women in the Mbeya region, Tanzania. Method A cross sectional survey involving 420 pregnant women (n=420) aged 15-49, registered in Reproductive and Child Health Clinics was conducted. Socio-demographic and dietary factors were assessed by structured questionnaire and the urine samples were analyzed using the ammonium persulfate digestion method. Results Median urinary iodine concentration (mUIC) was 279.4μg/L and it ranged from 26.1 to 1915μg/L. Insufficient mUIC (below 150μg/L) was observed in 17.14% of participants, sufficient mUIC was 24.29% and 58.57% had mUIC above the recommended level (>250μg/L). Sample women who reported consuming fish in the last 24 hours had an increased risk of insufficient mUIC [Adjusted OR= 2.60 (95%CI 1.31-5.15)] while the risk was lower for those who attended at least primary education [AOR= 0.29 (CI 0.08-0.99)]. Further, sample women resident in Mbarali district, in the oldest age group (35-49) and having a higher socio-economic status were associated with an increased risk of having MUIC above recommended level [AOR=4.09 (CI 1.85-9.010], [AOR=2.51 (CI 0.99-6.330] and, [AOR=2.08 (CI 0.91-4.71) respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrated a significant association between geographical, age and socio-economic factors and median urine iodine concentration above the WHO-recommended level. Further, this study found association between inadequate iodine in diet and insufficient median urine iodine concentration. Therefore, educational programs on iodine intake should be strengthened.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-350/v2?src=rss">In-depth assessment of Iraqi physicians' adherence to treatment guidelines for different diseases: a qualitative study [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In healthcare settings, specialists from different fields may follow the most well-known, reliable, and easy-to-understand medical guidelines. This study aimed to determine Iraqi physicians’ adherence to treatment guidelines, to specify which treatment guidelines are utilized for each disease and identify their barriers to follow the guidelines. Methods: This was qualitative study including face-to-face and virtual semi-structured interviews with specialist physicians from different disciplines. The interviews were conducted between December 2021 and May 2022 in Kirkuk province, Iraq. The qualitative data generated through interviews was analyzed using thematic analysis. Result: The study recruited 48 specialists (27 male and 21 female) from seven medical specialties at two large government hospitals. Most physicians (38 /44) revealed that healthcare settings implement treatment guidelines in more than half of cases. American guideline was the most used among the participating physicians. European and British guidelines and textbooks were also used by some specialties. Unfortunately, most (43 out of 47) physicians were unaware of Iraqi treatment guideline. Most senior physicians often followed the same guidelines for one branch, with little variation in approach based on their experience and flexibility. Almost all participating physicians believed that shortages in treatment (46/47) and investigation/lab materials (45/47) and low patient adherence (44/47) are major barriers to implement the guideline(s). Six out of seven specialties experienced shortage in the essential medications that recommended by the guidelines Conclusions: Most physicians followed well-known international guidelines. Each specialty follows different guidelines relying on the disease. Medication shortage in the public hospitals was the main barrier facing physicians to implement treatment guidelines. Enhancing physician awareness of the Iraqi guidelines should be encouraged. Finally, securing essential medicines in public hospitals is pivotal to adopt evidence-based guidelines effectively.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in transcription and translation. Identification of circRNA-RBP (RNA-binding protein) interaction sites has become a fundamental step in molecular and cell biology. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to predict circRNA-RBP interaction sites and achieved impressive identification performance. However, those methods cannot effectively capture long-distance dependencies, and cannot effectively utilize the interaction information of multiple features. To overcome those limitations, we propose a DL-based model iCRBP-LKHA using deep hybrid networks for identifying circRNA-RBP interaction sites. iCRBP-LKHA adopts five encoding schemes. Meanwhile, the neural network architecture, which consists of large kernel convolutional neural network (LKCNN), convolutional block attention module with one-dimensional convolution (CBAM-1D) and bidirectional gating recurrent unit (BiGRU), can explore local information, global context information and multiple features interaction information automatically. To verify the effectiveness of iCRBP-LKHA, we compared its performance with shallow learning algorithms on 37 circRNAs datasets and 37 circRNAs stringent datasets. And we compared its performance with state-of-the-art DL-based methods on 37 circRNAs datasets, 37 circRNAs stringent datasets and 31 linear RNAs datasets. The experimental results not only show that iCRBP-LKHA outperforms other competing methods, but also demonstrate the potential of this model in identifying other RNA-RBP interaction sites.

                <p>by Lucas Rudelt, Daniel González Marx, F. Paul Spitzner, Benjamin Cramer, Johannes Zierenberg, Viola Priesemann</p>

A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales. This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., recurrent coupling or adaptation), but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this hypothesis. Here, we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Moreover, intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.

                <p>by Zonglai Liang, Daniel Christiaan Dondorp, Marios Chatzigeorgiou</p>

During embryonic development, tissues and organs are gradually shaped into their functional morphologies through a series of spatiotemporally tightly orchestrated cell behaviors. A highly conserved organ shape across metazoans is the epithelial tube. Tube morphogenesis is a complex multistep process of carefully choreographed cell behaviors such as convergent extension, cell elongation, and lumen formation. The identity of the signaling molecules that coordinate these intricate morphogenetic steps remains elusive. The notochord is an essential tubular organ present in the embryonic midline region of all members of the chordate phylum. Here, using genome editing, pharmacology and quantitative imaging in the early chordate <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> we show that Ano10/Tmem16k, a member of the evolutionarily ancient family of transmembrane proteins called Anoctamin/TMEM16 is essential for convergent extension, lumen expansion, and connection during notochord morphogenesis. We find that Ano10/Tmem16k works in concert with the plasma membrane (PM) localized Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) residing SERCA, RyR, and IP3R proteins to establish developmental stage specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling molecular modules that regulate notochord morphogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. In addition, we find that the highly conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors calmodulin (CaM) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) show an Ano10/Tmem16k-dependent subcellular localization. Their pharmacological inhibition leads to convergent extension, tubulogenesis defects, and deranged Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, suggesting that Ano10/Tmem16k is involved in both the “encoding” and “decoding” of developmental Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Furthermore, Ano10/Tmem16k mediates cytoskeletal reorganization during notochord morphogenesis, likely by altering the localization of 2 important cytoskeletal regulators, the small GTPase Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and the actin binding protein Cofilin. Finally, we use electrophysiological recordings and a scramblase assay in tissue culture to demonstrate that Ano10/Tmem16k likely acts as an ion channel but not as a phospholipid scramblase. Our results establish Ano10/Tmem16k as a novel player in the prevertebrate molecular toolkit that controls organ morphogenesis across scales.

                <p>by Weichen Zhou, Kalpita R. Karan, Wenjin Gu, Hans-Ulrich Klein, Gabriel Sturm, Philip L. De Jager, David A. Bennett, Michio Hirano, Martin Picard, Ryan E. Mills</p>

The transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes (Numts) has been linked to lifespan in nonhuman species and recently demonstrated to occur in rare instances from one human generation to the next. Here, we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in 2 ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 postmortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (<i>n</i> = 389), postmitotic brain tissue (<i>n</i> = 798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples, we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, an increase in the number of brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI) who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures whole-genome sequencing design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of 1 Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven by cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived <i>SURF1</i>-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan. These findings open the possibility that mito-nuclear horizontal gene transfer among human postmitotic tissues produces functionally relevant human Numts over timescales shorter than previously assumed.

Research articles published by the journal eLife are accompanied by short evaluation statements that use phrases from a prescribed vocabulary to evaluate research on 2 dimensions: importance and strength of support. Intuitively, the prescribed phrases appear to be highly synonymous (e.g., important/valuable, compelling/convincing) and the vocabulary’s ordinal structure may not be obvious to readers. We conducted an online repeated-measures experiment to gauge whether the phrases were interpreted as intended. We also tested an alternative vocabulary with (in our view) a less ambiguous structure. A total of 301 participants with a doctoral or graduate degree used a 0% to 100% scale to rate the importance and strength of support of hypothetical studies described using phrases from both vocabularies. For the eLife vocabulary, most participants’ implied ranking did not match the intended ranking on both the importance (<i>n</i> = 59, 20% matched, 95% confidence interval [15% to 24%]) and strength of support dimensions (<i>n</i> = 45, 15% matched [11% to 20%]). By contrast, for the alternative vocabulary, most participants’ implied ranking did match the intended ranking on both the importance (<i>n</i> = 188, 62% matched [57% to 68%]) and strength of support dimensions (<i>n</i> = 201, 67% matched [62% to 72%]). eLife’s vocabulary tended to produce less consistent between-person interpretations, though the alternative vocabulary still elicited some overlapping interpretations away from the middle of the scale. We speculate that explicit presentation of a vocabulary’s intended ordinal structure could improve interpretation. Overall, these findings suggest that more structured and less ambiguous language can improve communication of research evaluations.

                Background Melasma is a common dyschromia, mainly found in women with darker skin types. Although asymptomatic, melasma significantly impacts patients’ quality of life. Due to this complex pathogenesis, melasma is difficult to treat. Plant and plant-derived products have been explored as alternatives for the treatment of melasma. Methods This study utilized network pharmacology coupled with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanisms of three selected Cassipourea metabolites in the treatment of melasma. Results Of the 202 genes obtained from the 14 profiled metabolites, only PTGS2, TYR, ESR2, and ESR1 were common among metabolites and targets implicated in melasma. From this, The gene ontology highlighted the intracellular steroid hormone receptor, signalling pathway, macromolecular complex, and estrogen receptor activity as the top enriched functional annotations, while the KEGG pathway analysis identified five signalling pathways, from which the prolactin signalling pathway, endocrine resistance, and estrogen signalling pathway were implicated in the pathogenesis of melasma. These pathways were further connected by their linkage to ESR2 and ESR1., Of all Cassipourea metabolites and standards, with afzelechin having the highest docking score for both gens. Further binding interaction analysis showed that ESR2-bound tamoxifen had the highest binding free energy of -47.68 kcal/mol, however, among the interacting Cassipourea metabolites, sitosterol-glycoside exhibited the highest negative binding affinity for both ESR2 (-40.50 kcal/mol) and ESR1 (-78.97 kcal/mol) over 150 ns simulation, suggesting its potential as a dual modulator. Altogether, the metabolites presented remarkable binding stability and thermodynamic compactness with the apo-genes. Conclusion The finding that the selected Cassipourea metabolites are associated with the genes and enzymes implicated in melasma pathogenesis, together with their significant binding effects on the enriched genes, suggests their regulatory potential on the profiled targets and, consequently, in the treatment of melasma.

                Abstract* Background Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely used in the biomedical field due to its outstanding biological and mechanical properties. Originally employed as a temporary abutment in implantology, recent research has expanded its indications for more definitive applications, such as frameworks and dental post and core. This shift requires a thorough assessment of PEEK’s adhesion and mechanical characteristics. However, PEEK’s inert properties and intricate chemistry create difficulties in surface treatment, resulting in reduced surface energy and inadequate adhesion. Inducing specific physical and chemical changes aims to overcome these challenges and enhance adhesion for PEEK. Despite its numerous clinical trials, standardized protocols remain lacking. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of surface treatments on the bonding performance of PEEK posts. Methods A detailed search of the literature will be conducted across several databases including PubMed, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Additional databases such as Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Web of Science and EBSCO will also be included. The search strategy will target controlled randomized studies and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of surface treatments on PEEK post adhesion strength. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used to assess bias in non-randomized studies, while the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB II) tool will be employed for evaluating randomized controlled trials. Data extraction will focus on study design, treatment methods, outcomes and results. This systematic review protocol will adhere to the guidelines for systematic reviews outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion The discussion will explore the implications of findings on clinical practice, highlighting the importance of enhancing PEEK’s bioactivity and surface energy to improve bonding efficacy in dental procedures. Moreover, it will suggest areas for future research to advance dental materials science, aiming to optimize the utilization of PEEK in dental applications Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42024529783 (Registered on 08/04/2024).

                We discuss how epidemiology has been and can continue to be used to advance understanding of the links between urban areas and health informed by an existing urban-health conceptual framework. This framework considers urban areas as contexts for health, determinants of health and modifiers of health pathways, and part of a complex system that affects health. We highlight opportunities for descriptive epidemiology to inform the context of urban health, for example, by characterizing the social and physical environments that give rise to health and the actions that change those conditions. We then describe inferential tools for evaluating the impact of group-level actions (e.g., interventions, policies) on urban health, providing some examples, and describing assumptions and challenges. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges of applying systems thinking and methods to advance urban health. While different conceptual frames lead to different insights, each perspective demonstrates that urban health is a major and growing challenge. The effectiveness of urban health knowledge, action, and policy as the world continues to urbanize can be informed by applying and expanding upon research and surveillance methods described here.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94931">A ‘double-edged’ role for type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptors in pain disclosed by light-sensitive drugs</a></h4>

              
                We used light-sensitive drugs to identify the brain region-specific role of mGlu5 metabotropic glutamate receptors in the control of pain. Optical activation of systemic JF-NP-26, a caged, normally inactive, negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of mGlu5 receptors, in cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices and thalamus inhibited neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. Systemic treatment of alloswitch-1, an intrinsically active mGlu5 receptor NAM, caused analgesia, and the effect was reversed by light-induced drug inactivation in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and thalamus. This demonstrates that mGlu5 receptor blockade in the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus is both sufficient and necessary for the analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. Surprisingly, when the light was delivered in the basolateral amygdala, local activation of systemic JF-NP-26 reduced pain thresholds, whereas inactivation of alloswitch-1 enhanced analgesia. Electrophysiological analysis showed that alloswitch-1 increased excitatory synaptic responses in prelimbic pyramidal neurons evoked by stimulation of presumed BLA input, and decreased BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of amygdala output neurons. Both effects were reversed by optical silencing and reinstated by optical reactivation of alloswitch-1. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the action of mGlu5 receptors in the pain neuraxis is not homogenous, and suggest that blockade of mGlu5 receptors in the BLA may limit the overall analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. This could explain the suboptimal effect of mGlu5 NAMs on pain in human studies and validate photopharmacology as an important tool to determine ideal target sites for systemic drugs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89936">Task-specific invariant representation in auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Categorical sensory representations are critical for many behaviors, including speech perception. In the auditory system, categorical information is thought to arise hierarchically, becoming increasingly prominent in higher-order cortical regions. The neural mechanisms that support this robust and flexible computation remain poorly understood. Here, we studied sound representations in the ferret primary and non-primary auditory cortex while animals engaged in a challenging sound discrimination task. Population-level decoding of simultaneously recorded single neurons revealed that task engagement caused categorical sound representations to emerge in non-primary auditory cortex. In primary auditory cortex, task engagement caused a general enhancement of sound decoding that was not specific to task-relevant categories. These findings are consistent with mixed selectivity models of neural disentanglement, in which early sensory regions build an overcomplete representation of the world and allow neurons in downstream brain regions to flexibly and selectively read out behaviorally relevant, categorical information.

">The neural mechanisms of fast versus slow decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Not all decisions are created equal; factors such as the difficulties or associated costs affect the time spent to make decisions. This is variously interpreted as speed/accuracy, fast/slow, or impulsivity/deliberateness tradeoffs according to different models of behaviour. Regardless, it is generally assumed that decision latency reflects the neural mechanisms underlying behavioural strategy and cognitive investment. However, such investigations have been difficult in mice which are consistently impulsive. Here, we show that manipulating cost, using a novel floating-platform paradigm, overcomes the natural impulsivity of mice, more closely matching human behaviour. Furthermore, this approach allowed us simultaneously to measure the flow of activity from medial to lateral frontal cortex (MFC to LFC) and record sequences of single neuron activity with 2-photon imaging. Surprisingly, MFC display a different mode of operation, with high vulnerability to optical inhibition compared to LFC. Furthermore, the balance in choice coding at the beginning of sequences in MFC correlated with trial history and behavioural strategy. We found that for optimal performance, slow sequences in MFC showed declining numbers of active neurons whereas the opposite was true in LFC. Our results suggest that while LFC acts as an integrative motor threshold, MFC plays a larger cognitive role in the selection and timing of decisions than previously thought. Our study offers a methodological and mechanistic framework in mouse frontal cortex to understand the neural basis of voluntary decision making.

">Generation of humanized mouse models to support therapeutic development for SYNGAP1 and STXBP1 disorders</a></h4>

              
                Heterozygous variants in SYNGAP1 and STXBP1 lead to distinct neurodevelopmental disorders caused by haploinsufficient levels of post-synaptic SYNGAP1 and pre-synaptic STXBP1, which are critical for normal synaptic function. While several gene-targeted therapeutic approaches have proven efficacious in vitro, these often target regions of the human gene that are not conserved in rodents, hindering the pre-clinical development of these compounds and their transition to the clinic. To overcome this limitation, here we generate and characterize Syngap1 and Stxbp1 humanized mouse models in which we replaced the mouse Syngap1 and Stxbp1 gene, respectively, with the human counterpart, including regulatory and non-coding regions. Fully humanized Syngap1 mice present normal viability and can be successfully crossed with currently available Syngap1 haploinsufficiency mouse models to generate Syngap1 humanized haploinsufficient mice. Stxbp1 mice were successfully humanized, yet exhibit impaired viability (particularly males) and reduced STXBP1 protein abundance. Mouse viability could be improved by outcrossing this model to other mouse strains, while Stxbp1 humanized females and hybrid mice can be used to evaluate target engagement of human-specific therapeutics. Overall, these humanized mouse models represent a broadly available tool to further pre-clinical therapeutic development for SYNGAP1 and STXBP1 disorders.

">Sex and APOE4-specific links between cardiometabolic risk factors and white matter alterations in individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: White matter (WM) alterations are among the earliest changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet limited work has comprehensively characterized the effects of AD risk factors on WM. METHODS: In older adults with a family history of AD, we investigated the sex-specific and APOE genotype-related relationships between WM microstructure and risk factors. Multiple MRI-derived metrics were integrated using a multivariate approach based on the Mahalanobis distance (D2). The links between WM D2 and cognition were also explored. RESULTS: WM D2 in several regions was associated with high systolic blood pressure, BMI, and glycated hemoglobin, and low cholesterol, in both males and females. APOE4+ displayed a distinct risk pattern, with LDL-cholesterol having a detrimental effect only in carriers, and this pattern was linked to immediate memory performance. Myelination was the main mechanism underlying WM alterations. DISCUSSION: Our findings reveal that combined exposure to multiple cardiometabolic risk factors negatively impacts microstructural health, which may subsequently affect cognition. Notably, APOE4 carriers exhibited a different risk pattern, especially in the role of LDL, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms in this group.

                This study describes speech synthesis from an Electrocorticogram (ECoG) during imagined speech. We aim to generate high-quality audio despite the limitations of available training data by employing a Transformer-based decoder and a pretrained vocoder. Specifically, we used a pre-trained neural vocoder, Parallel WaveGAN, to convert the log-mel spectrograms output by the Transformer decoder, which was trained on ECoG signals, into high-quality audio signals. In our experiments, using ECoG signals recorded from 13 participants, the synthesized speech from imagined speech achieved a dynamic time-warping (DTW) Pearson correlation ranging from 0.85 to 0.95. This high-quality speech synthesis can be attributed to the Transformer decoder's ability to accurately reconstruct high-fidelity log-mel spectrograms, demonstrating its effectiveness in dealing with limited training data.

">Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors prevent presymptomatic capillary flow disturbances in a model of cerebral amyloidosis</a></h4>

              
                To enhance early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer{middle dot}s disease (AD), understanding the pathological changes before symptoms arise is crucial. The continuum model of AD suggest that A{beta} beta (A{beta}) accumulation precedes symptoms by at least 15 years, with vascular changes detectable around this time. Disturbances in capillary flow dynamics have been linked to reduced oxygen delivery to brain tissue, but evidence in presymptomatic AD remains elusive. We examined capillary flow dynamics in presymptomatic Tg-SwDI mice and the capacity of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) to prevent capillary flow disturbances. Our study revealed capillary flow disturbances associated with alterations in capillary morphology, adhesion molecule expression, and A{beta} load in cognitively normal 9-10-month-old Tg-SwDI mice. Treated mice showed ameliorated capillary flow disturbances, enhanced oxygen availability, and reduced A{beta} load. These findings underscore the importance of capillary flow disturbances in presymptomatic AD and highlight CAIs{middle dot} potential for preserving vascular integrity in early AD.

">Counting on AR: EEG responses to incongruent information with real-world context</a></h4>

              
                Augmented Reality (AR) technologies enhance the real world by integrating contextual digital information about physical entities. However, inconsistencies between physical reality and digital augmentations, which may arise from errors in the visualized information or the user's mental context, can considerably impact user experience. This study characterizes the brain dynamics associated with processing incongruent information within an AR environment. We designed an interactive paradigm featuring the manipulation of a Rubik's cube serving as a physical referent. Congruent and incongruent information regarding the cube's current status was presented via symbolic (digits) and non-symbolic (graphs) stimuli, thus examining the impact of different means of data representation. The analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 19 participants revealed the presence of centro-parietal N400 and P600 components following the processing of incongruent information, with significantly increased latencies for non-symbolic stimuli. Additionally, we explored the feasibility of exploiting incongruency effects for brain-computer interfaces. Hence, we implemented decoders using linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and EEGNet, achieving comparable performances with all methods. The successful decoding of incongruency-induced modulations can inform systems about the current mental state of users without making it explicit, aiming for more coherent and contextually appropriate AR interactions.

">Indiv-Brain: Individualized Brain Network Partition Learned from Individual fMRI Data using Deep Clustering with Vertex-level Attention</a></h4>

              
                Individualized functional network partitioning is increasingly critical in elucidating individual differences in cognition, development, and behavior. The previous studies grouped brain regions that were pre-defined by common brain parcellations into individualized brain networks. The employment of common brain region parcellations ignores the individual variations in brain structure and reduces the spatial resolution of the results. Moreover, some studies trained models on a group of subjects to guide individual network partitioning. These methods largely depend on the sample size and encounter challenges in the case of limited subject data. In this paper, we propose Indiv-Brain which automatically partition brain vertices into different brain networks based on individual fMRI data without any prior brain parcellation. The Indiv-Brain consists of three sequential modules: stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) for mapping the raw fMRI data to a latent embedding space, masked vertex modeling (MVM) for learning attention-enhanced representations of brain vertices, and deep embedding clustering with spatial attention (DEC-A) for unsupervised clustering on the learned vertex representations. The experiments on Human Connectome Project (HCP) demonstrate that the accuracy of Indiv-Brain outperforms existing methods. We compared the model with methods like SDAE, DEC, IDEC, and k-means. For the results of 8 subjects, the accuracy of Indiv-Brain was consistently the highest, averaging 6.65 percentage points higher than the IDEC method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to obtain individualized brain network partition based on individual fMRI data with deep learning models. Our study provides a novel insight into understanding individualized brain networks, especially suitable for special patients.

">chrna3 modulates biphasic response to alcohol</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are complex phenomena governed by genetics, neurophysiology, environment, and societal structures. New methods to understand the underlying neurogenetics are valuable for designing better prevention and interventional strategies. Here, we used a novel, two-choice self-administration zebrafish assay (SAZA) to isolate the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit alpha3 ( chrna3 ) in alcohol response. Juvenile zebrafish exhibited a biphasic response when self-administering alcohol that transitioned from attraction to aversion within minutes, suggesting they can regulate exposure to alcohol. This inverted U-shaped self-administration mirrored the effect alcohol has on shoaling behaviour. Exposure to low concentration of alcohol reduced anxiety-like behaviours characterised by decrease in shoal cohesion, while sedative effects became prominent at higher concentrations resulting in reduced locomotion and uncoordinated swimming. In contrast, chrna3 mutants displayed blunted responses, exhibiting prolonged alcohol self-administration, and increased gregariousness when compared to wild-type fish. These findings suggest that chrna3 dysfunction increased tolerance to alcohol. In humans, genetic variants that decrease CHRNA3 function may increase the likelihood of developing alcohol dependence. Thus, our results provide new insights into chrna3 function, as a potential target for pharmacological manipulation, and highlight the use of non-rodent alternatives to study the neurogenetics of development of AUD.

">A cup of coffee can boost your motor performance: Enhanced motor sequence learning with caffeine</a></h4>

              
                Caffeine is consumed in various beverages, such as coffee, energy drinks, soda, and tea. The effects of caffeine have been shown to manifest in various ways across different studies. Some studies suggest that caffeine can enhance motor performance. Despite this, numerous motor learning studies do not control for participants' caffeine intake or do not record whether participants consumed caffeine. The purpose of this study was to compare the motor learning performance (i.e., online improvement) of individuals who consumed caffeine and those who did not before practice with a novel motor sequence task. Sixty-five right-handed healthy undergraduate students participated in this study. Individuals reported their caffeine consumption through a pre-experiment questionnaire prior to performing an eight-item serial reaction time task. The participants who consumed caffeine reported drinking one cup of coffee on average 158.8 minutes before performing the sequential task. The motor performance of individuals who consumed caffeine was compared to those who did not, with the caffeine-consuming group (n = 13) exhibiting faster response times during online learning than the non-caffeine group (n = 52). The findings of this study suggest that caffeine should be controlled for in future motor learning research.

">Sustained activity in a descending neuron is associated with flight saccades in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Flies perform rapid turns termed saccades to change direction during flight. Evasive turns can be elicited by looming stimuli mimicking an approaching object such as a potential predator. Whereas projection neurons of the optic lobes responsive to looming stimuli have been well described, how this information is transmitted to the motor system to elicit a saccade, is not well understood. Here we describe activity of the descending neuron DNp03 in Drosophila, which receives direct input from looming-sensitive visual interneurons and projects to wing motor areas within the ventral nerve cord. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from this neuron during head-fixed flight confirm that DNp03 is responsive to looming stimuli on the side ipsilateral to its dendrites. In addition, activity of this neuron is state-dependent as looming stimuli only elicit spikes during flight and not rest. The behavior in response to the looming stimulus is variable, which allowed us to study how activity of DNp03 relates to the execution of a saccade. Our analysis revealed that sustained activity in DNp03, persisting even after the visual stimulus ended, was the strongest predictor of saccade execution, therefore reflecting the behavioral decision of the fly to respond to the stimulus.

">Retrosplenial cortex encodes both local and global space in connected environments</a></h4>

              
                In everyday life, mammals have to find their way between interconnected spaces. How the brain processes spatial information in these complex environments is a crucial question for understanding how we navigate. Theoretical frameworks have proposed that the brain presents simultaneous activities that are either maintained in connected spaces (global reference frame) or distinguished in each space (local reference frames). The different head direction signals discovered in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) suggest that this brain area supports both local and global spatial activity. We tested this hypothesis by recording RSC neurons in environments consisting of 2 or 4 connected rooms that are either identical or different. We observed two types of head direction activity simultaneously: one showing opposite or orthogonal directional activity in the 2 and 4 connected spaces and thus anchored to local reference frames, and one maintaining a stable head direction activity across connected spaces and thus anchored to the global reference frame. We also found that other RSC neurons show a spatial pattern that repeats oppositely or orthogonally in the 2 and 4 connected spaces respectively. In contrast, hippocampal place cells activity never shows opposite or orthogonal patterns, but rather a spatial remapping or a translational repeated activity. Overall, the results show that only the RSC has the simultaneous neuronal activity necessary to form a spatial representation in connected environments.

">Terminal nucleotidyltransferase Tent2 microRNA tailing regulates excitatory/inhibitory balance in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                One of the post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating the stability of RNA molecules involves the addition of non-templated nucleotides to their 3' ends, a process known as RNA tailing. To systematically investigate the physiological consequences of terminal nucleotidyltransferase TENT2 absence on RNA 3' end modifications in the mouse hippocampus we developed a new Tent2 knockout mouse. Electrophysiological measurements revealed increased excitability in Tent2 KO hippocampal neurons, and behavioral analyses showed decreased anxiety and improved fear extinction in these mice. At the molecular level, we observed a significant contribution of TENT2 to the monoadenylation of various classes of miRNAs, but found no effect of the enzyme's loss on the total poly(A) tail length of mRNAs, as measured by Direct Nanopore RNA sequencing. Alterations in the monoadenylation of a large population of microRNAs affected the overall mRNA abundance, particularly transcripts related synaptic transmission, which were downregulated in the hippocampus of Tent2 knockout mice. These changes explain the observed behavioral and electrophysiological alterations. Our data thus establish a link between TENT2-dependent microRNA tailing and the balance of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission.

">Reinforcement learning of state representation and value: the power of random feedback and biological constraints</a></h4>

              
                How external/internal 'state' is represented in the brain is crucial, since appropriate representation enables goal-directed behavior. Recent studies suggest that state representation and state value can be simultaneously learnt through reinforcement learning (RL) using reward-prediction-error in recurrent-neural-network (RNN) and its downstream weights. However, how such learning can be neurally implemented remains unclear because training of RNN through the 'backpropagation' method requires downstream weights, which are biologically unavailable at the upstream RNN. Here we show that training of RNN using random feedback instead of the downstream weights still works because of the 'feedback alignment', which was originally demonstrated for supervised learning. We further show that if the downstream weights and the random feedback are biologically constrained to be non-negative, learning still occurs without feedback alignment because the non-negative constraint ensures loose alignment. These results suggest neural mechanisms for RL of state representation/value and the power of random feedback and biological constraints.

">Keratinocyte-derived exosomes in painful diabetic neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a challenging complication of diabetes with patients experiencing a painful and burning sensation in their extremities. Existing treatments provide limited relief without addressing the underlying mechanisms of the disease. PDN involves the gradual degeneration of nerve fibers in the skin. Keratinocytes, the most abundant epidermal cell type, are closely positioned to cutaneous nerve terminals, suggesting the possibility of bi-directional communication. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released from many cell types that mediate cell to cell communication. The role of keratinocyte-derived exosomes (KDEs) in influencing signaling between the skin and cutaneous nerve terminals and their contribution to the genesis of PDN has not been explored. In this study, we characterized KDEs in a well-established high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of PDN using primary adult mouse keratinocyte cultures. We obtained highly enriched KDEs through size exclusion chromatography and then analyzed their molecular cargo using proteomic analysis and small RNA sequencing. We found significant differences in the protein and microRNA content of HFD KDEs compared to KDEs obtained from control mice on a regular diet (RD), including pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic transmission. Additionally, using an in vivo conditional extracellular vesicle (EV) reporter mouse model, we demonstrated that epidermal-originating GFP-tagged KDEs are retrogradely trafficked into the DRG neuron cell body. Overall, our study presents a potential novel mode of communication between keratinocytes and DRG neurons in the skin, revealing a possible role for KDEs in contributing to the axonal degeneration that underlies neuropathic pain in PDN. Moreover, this study presents potential therapeutic targets in the skin for developing more effective, disease-modifying, and better-tolerated topical interventions for patients suffering from PDN, one of the most common and untreatable peripheral neuropathies.

">Graph models of brain state in deep anaesthesia reveal sink state dynamics of reduced spatiotemporal complexity and integration</a></h4>

              
                Deep anaesthetisation is an important surgical and explorative tool in the study of consciousness. Much work has been done to connect the deeply anaesthetised condition with decreased functional complexity. However, anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness is also a dynamic condition in which functional activity and complexity may fluctuate, being perturbed by internal or external (e.g. noxious) stimuli. We use fMRI data from a cohort undergoing ultra-slow propofol induction and a dynamic graph modelling framework which characterises changes in functional activity and connectivity as changes in brain state. We examine the group-level dynamics of brain state activity, complexity, integration and modularization in deep anaesthesia and wakefulness and propose novel measures for temporal complexity of brain state dynamics. We find that deep anaesthesia states are less temporally complex and less functionally-related to one another than wakeful states. Anaesthesia dynamics are dominated by a handful of sink states that act as low-complexity attractors to which subjects repeatedly return. Our analysis suggests that dynamic functional organisation in anaesthesia can be characterised by temporally stable, modular communities that change little in time, stratifying regional activity and functionally isolating cortical from both subcortical, and in particular, thalamic brain areas. Using data from a large human structural tractography atlas, we show that functional modularisation in deep anaesthesia more closely resembles normative structural organisation than does functional organisation in wakefulness. We find evidence suggesting that brain state trajectories and in particular, the dominance of low complexity attractor-like sink states in anaesthesia, appear to depend on subject-specific age and anaesthesia susceptibility factors.

">Coordinated cross-brain activity during accumulation of sensory evidence and decision commitment</a></h4>

              
                Cognition is produced by the continuous interactions between many regions across the brain, but has typically been studied one brain region at a time. How signals in different regions coordinate to achieve a single coherent action remains unclear. Here, we address this question by characterizing the simultaneous interactions between up to 20 brain regions across the brain (10 targeted regions per hemisphere), of rats performing the "Poisson Clicks" task, a decision-making task that demands the gradual accumulation of momentary evidence. Using 8 Neuropixels probes in each animal, we recorded simultaneously in prefrontal cortex, striatum, motor cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. To assess decision-related interactions between regions, we quantified correlations of each region's "decision variable": moment-to-moment co-fluctuations along the axis in neural state space that best predicts the upcoming choice. This revealed a network of strongly correlated brain regions that include the dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC), anterior dorsal striatum (ADS), and primary motor cortex (M1), whose decision variables also led the rest of the brain. If coordinated activity within this subnetwork reflects an ongoing evidence accumulation process, these correlations should cease at the time of decision commitment. We therefore compared correlations before versus after "nTc", a recently reported estimator of the time of internal decision commitment. We found that correlations in the decision variables between different brain regions decayed to near-zero after nTc. Additionally, we found that choice-predictive activity grew over time before nTc, but abruptly plateaued at nTc, consistent with an evidence accumulation process that has stopped evolving at that time. Assessing nTc from the activity of individual regions revealed that nTc could be reliably detected earlier in M1 than other regions. These results show that evidence accumulation involves coordination within a network of frontal cortical and striatal regions, and suggests that termination of this process may initiate in M1.

">Histone deacetylase inhibition expands cellular proteostasis repertoires to enhance neuronal stress resilience</a></h4>

              
                Neurons are long-lived, terminally differentiated cells with limited regenerative capacity. Cellular stressors such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding stress and membrane trafficking stress accumulate as neurons age and accompany age-dependent neurodegeneration. Current strategies to improve neuronal resilience are focused on using factors to reprogram neurons or targeting specific proteostasis pathways. We discovered a different approach. In an unbiased screen for modifiers of neuronal membrane trafficking defects, we unexpectedly identified a role for histone deacetylases (HDACs) in limiting cellular flexibility in choosing cellular pathways to respond to diverse types of stress. We show that genetic or pharmacological inactivation of HDACs results in improved neuronal health in response to ER protein folding stress and endosomal membrane trafficking stress in C. elegans and mammalian neurons. Surprisingly, HDAC inhibition enabled neurons to activate latent proteostasis pathways tailored to the nature of the individual stress, instead of generalized transcriptional upregulation. These findings shape our understanding of neuronal stress responses and suggest new therapeutic strategies to enhance neuronal resilience.

">ActSort: An active-learning accelerated cell sorting algorithm for large-scale calcium imaging datasets</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in calcium imaging enable simultaneous recordings of up to a million neurons in behaving animals, producing datasets of unprecedented scales. Although individual neurons and their activity traces can be extracted from these videos with automated algorithms, the results often require human curation to remove false positives, a laborious process called 'cell sorting'. To address this challenge, we introduce ActSort, an active-learning algorithm for sorting large-scale datasets that integrates features engineered by domain experts together with data formats with minimal memory requirements. By strategically bringing outlier cell candidates near the decision boundary up for annotation, ActSort reduces human labor to about 1-3% of cell candidates and improves curation accuracy by mitigating annotator bias. To facilitate the algorithm's widespread adoption among experimental neuroscientists, we created a user-friendly software and conducted a first-of-its-kind benchmarking study involving about 160,000 annotations. Our tests validated ActSort's performance across different experimental conditions and datasets from multiple animals. Overall, ActSort addresses a crucial bottleneck in processing large-scale calcium videos of neural activity and thereby facilitates systems neuroscience experiments at previously inaccessible scale

">An autonomous robotic system for high-throughput phenotyping and behavioral studies of individual fruit flies</a></h4>

              
                The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a widely used model species in biomedical research. Despite its importance, conducting manual experiments with individual fruit flies can be challenging and time-consuming, especially for studies of individual fly behaviors. Such studies often involve cumbersome preparatory steps, such as manually tethering a fly and then positioning it within an experimental setup1,2. These procedures commonly require the fly to be anesthetized, and, before behavioral assessments begin, the fly must recover from anesthesia. Hence, the introduction of automated phenotyping and behavioral assays would expedite important aspects of fly research, by minimizing manual handling of flies and decreasing the net time needed for experiments. Here, we introduce FlyMAX (Fly Manipulation and Autonomous eXperimentation), an autonomous robotic system for manipulating adult flies without use of anesthesia. FlyMAX collects individual flies from a standard vial, analyzes them with computer vision, and achieves a throughput of >1,000 flies per day for high-throughput inspection and characterization assays. Robotic handling had no detectable adverse effects on fly longevity or our assessments of fly health. Moreover, the behavioral performance of flies, especially of males, was better and less variable than of flies handled manually. Our system employs deep learning-based machine vision for real-time assessments of picking quality and fly phenotypes. This enables fully pipelined, autonomous experimentation for behavioral assays with individual flies in controlled environments, which was previously infeasible. Overall, FlyMAX constitutes a promising technology to enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of research with flies and other insects in fields such as genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening.

">Deep inverse modeling reveals dynamic-dependent invariances in neural circuit mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Neural population dynamics are shaped by many cellular, synaptic, and network properties. Not only is it important to understand how coordinated changes in circuit parameters alter neural activity, but also when dynamics are unaffected by--or invariant to--such changes. Computational modeling has revealed invariances in single neurons and small circuits that are thought to reflect their robustness against variability and perturbations. However, generalizing these insights to larger circuits in cortex and other brain areas remains challenging. A key bottleneck lies in inverse modeling of neural circuits with spiking network models, i.e., identifying parameter configurations that quantitatively match dynamics observed in neural recordings. Here, we present Automated Model Inference from Neural Dynamics (AutoMIND) for efficient discovery of invariant circuit model configurations. AutoMIND leverages a mechanistic model with adaptive spiking neurons and clustered connectivity, which displays a rich variety of spatiotemporal dynamics. Probabilistic deep generative models--trained on network simulations only--then returns many parameter configurations consistent with a given target observation of neural activity. Applied to several datasets, AutoMIND discovers circuit models of synchronous network bursting in human brain organoids across early development, as well as models capturing complex frequency profiles of Neuropixels recordings in mouse hippocampus and cortex. In each case, we obtain hundreds of configurations that compose a (nonlinear) parameter subspace in which population dynamics remain unchanged. Surprisingly, global and local geometries of the invariant subspace are not fixed, but differ for different dynamics. Together, our results shed light on dynamic-dependent invariances of circuit parameters underlying diverse population dynamics, while demonstrating the flexibility of AutoMIND for inverse modeling of neural circuits.

">Olfactory receptor coexpression and co-option in the dengue mosquito</a></h4>

              
                The olfactory sensory neurons of vinegar flies and mice tend to express a single ligand-specific receptor. While this 'one neuron-one receptor' motif has long been expected to apply broadly across insects, recent evidence suggests it may not extend to mosquitoes. We sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of 46,000 neurons from antennae of the dengue mosquito Aedes aegypti to resolve all olfactory, thermosensory, and hygrosensory neuron subtypes and identify the receptors expressed therein. We find that half of all olfactory subtypes coexpress multiple receptors. However, coexpression occurs almost exclusively among genes from the same family--among odorant receptors (ORs) or among ionotropic receptors (IRs). Coexpression of ORs with IRs is exceedingly rare. Many coexpressed receptors are recent duplicates. In other cases, the recruitment or co-option of single receptors by multiple neuron subtypes has placed these genes together in the same cells with distant paralogs. Close examination of data from Drosophila reveal rare cases of both phenomena, indicating that the olfactory systems of these two species are not fundamentally different, but instead fall at different locations along a continuum likely to encompass diverse insects.

                Ischemic stroke triggers a cascade of pathological events that affect multiple cell types and often lead to incomplete functional recovery. Despite advances in single-cell technologies, the molecular and cellular responses that contribute to long-term post-stroke impairment remain poorly understood. To gain better insight into the underlying mechanisms, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from distinct brain regions using a mouse model of permanent focal ischemia at one month post-injury. Our findings reveal cell- and region-specific changes within the stroke-injured and peri-infarct brain tissue. For instance, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exhibited upregulated genes in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, and downregulated pathways associated with aerobic metabolism. Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions. Common molecular features were linked to inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix organization, and angiogenesis. Our findings provide a detailed resource for advancing our molecular understanding of stroke pathology and for discovering therapeutic targets in the repair phase of stroke recovery.

">Reverse-breaking CFS (rev-bCFS): Disentangling conscious and unconscious effects by measuring suppression and dominance times during continuous flash suppression</a></h4>

              
                Breaking continuous flash suppression (bCFS) is a widely used experimental paradigm that exploits detection tasks to measure the time an initially invisible stimulus requires to escape interocular suppression and access awareness. One pretty contentious and unresolved issue is whether differences in detection times reflect unconscious or conscious processing. To answer this question, here we introduce a novel approach (i.e., reverse-bCFS [rev-bCFS]) that measures the time an initially visible stimulus requires to be suppressed from awareness. Results from two experiments using face stimuli indicate that rev-bCFS can capture conscious effects, which indicates that contrasting standard bCFS with rev-bCFS can isolate unconscious processing occurring specifically during bCFS. For example, while face inversion impacted both bCFS and rev-bCFS, effects were larger in bCFS, suggesting a distinct contribution of unconscious processing to the advantage of upright over inverted faces in accessing awareness. Combining standard bCFS and rev-bCFS may offer a fruitful approach able to disentangle conscious and unconscious effects occurring during interocular suppression.

">Cortical Excitability is Affected by Light Exposure- Distinct Effects in Adolescents and Young Adults</a></h4>

              
                Light, particularly blue-wavelength light, exerts a broad range of non-image forming (NIF) effects including the stimulation of cognition and alertness and the regulation of mood, sleep and circadian rhythms. However, its underlying brain mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Likewise, whether adolescents show a different NIF sensitivity to light compared to adults is not established. Here, we investigated whether cortical excitability, a basic aspect of brain function that depends on sleep wake regulation, is affected by blue light and whether the effect is similar in young adults and adolescents. To do so, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation coupled to high-density electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) in healthy young adults (N=13, 24.2y+/-3.4) and in adolescents (N=15, 16.9y+/-1.1). Our results showed that, in young adults, blue light affected cortical excitability following an apparent inverted-U relationship, while adolescents' cortical excitability was not significantly impacted by blue light. In addition, although light did not affect performance on a visuomotor vigilance task completed during the TMS-EEG recordings, cortical excitability was positively correlated to task performance in both age groups. This study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between light, cortical excitability, and behavior. Our findings highlight the role of age in NIF effects of light, suggesting that brain responses to light differ during developmental periods.

">Neural Adaptation to the Eye's Optics Through Phase Compensation</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain achieve a seemingly veridical and  in-focus perception of the world, knowing how severely corrupted visual information is by the eyes optics? Optical blur degrades retinal image quality by reducing the contrast and disrupting the phase of transmitted signals. Neural adaptation can attenuate the impact of blur on image contrast, yet vision rather relies on perceptually-relevant information contained within the phase structure of natural images. Here we show that neural adaptation can compensate for the impact of optical aberrations on phase congruency. We used adaptive optics to fully control optical factors and test the impact of specific optical aberrations on the perceived phase of compound gratings. We assessed blur-induced changes in perceived phase over three distinct exposure spans. Under brief blur exposure, perceived phase shifts matched optical theory predictions. During short-term (~1h) exposure, we found a reduction in blur-induced phase shifts over time, followed by after-effects in the opposite direction-a hallmark of adaptation. Finally, patients with chronic exposure to poor optical quality showed altered phase perception when tested under fully-corrected optical quality, suggesting long-term neural compensatory adjustments to phase spectra. These findings reveal that neural adaptation to optical aberrations compensates for alterations in phase congruency, helping restore perceptual quality over time.

">Social 'envirotyping' the ABCD study contextualizes dissociable brain organization and diverging outcomes</a></h4>

              
                The environment, especially social features, plays a key role in shaping the development of the brain, notably during adolescence. To better understand variation in brain-environment coupling and its associated outcomes, we identified ''envirotypes,'' or different patterns of social environment experience, in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study by hierarchically clustering subjects. Two focal clusters, which accounted for 89.3% of all participants, differed significantly on eight out of nine youth-report social environment quality measures, representing almost perfect complements. We then applied tools from network neuroscience to show different envirotypes are associated with different patterns of whole brain functional connectivity. Differences were distributed across the brain but were especially prominent in Default and Somatomotor Hand systems for these focal clusters. Finally, we examined how social envirotypes change over development and how these patterns of change are associated with a suite of outcomes. The resulting dynamic envirotypes differed along dimensions of stability and quality, but outcomes diverged based on stability. Specifically, the stable, high quality envirotype was most easily distinguished from the improving envirotype, while the unstable envirotype was associated with the worst outcomes. Altogether, our findings represent significant contributions to both social developmental neuroscience and network neuroscience, emphasizing the variability and dynamicity of brain-environment coupling and its consequences.

                The subcellular localizations of neurotransmitter receptors are strictly regulated in neurons. Changes in the trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play an essential role in synaptic plasticity, which is the cellular basis of learning and memory. To explore receptor trafficking, genetically encoded approaches (e.g., the fusion of fluorescent proteins to receptors) are often used. However, concerns remain that genetic approaches cannot fully reproduce the receptor function that is inherent to neurons. Herein, we report a chemical probe, PFQX1(AF488), for the visualization of cell-surface AMPARs without any genetic manipulation to neurons. The rapid and reversible staining features of this probe allowed the visualization of AMPAR accumulation in dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity in living hippocampal neurons. Moreover, the mechanisms of this synaptic accumulation, for which genetically encoded approaches have given controversial results, were revealed by integrating two chemical methods: PFQX1(AF488) and covalent chemical labeling.

">Inflammatory Signatures of Microglia in the Mouse Model of Corticosterone-Induced Depression</a></h4>

              
                Microglia-mediated inflammation has been recognized as a key feature of major depressive disorder. Although hypercortisolemia commonly occurs in depressed patients and can be predictive of treatment response, how chronic exposure to this stress hormone influences microglia is incompletely characterized. Here, we exploited a standard mouse model of depressive-like behaviors induced by peripheral administration of corticosterone. Microglia in the prefrontal cortex of mice were profiled by bulk RNA sequencing, which exhibited the up-regulation of inflammatory markers. In addition, single-cell RNA sequencing identified distinct molecular patterns of microglial responses. Moreover, we revealed the elevation of Pu.1 and Irf8, the two central transcription factors governing microglia-mediated inflammation, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of corticosterone-treated mice, which was similarly observed in the single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset of depressed patients' microglia. These results have established inflammatory signatures of microglia in the mouse model recapitulating hypercortisolemia-related depression, providing new insights into diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

">Evoked resonant neural activity outperforms spectral markers in decoding sleep from the subthalamic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deep brain stimulation is a treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease and currently tuned to target motor symptoms during daytime. Parkinson's disease is associated with multiple nocturnal symptoms such as akinesia, insomnia and sleep fragmentation which may require adjustments of stimulation during sleep for best treatment outcome. Objectives: There is a need for a robust biomarker to guide stimulation titration across sleep stages. This study aimed to investigate whether evoked resonant neural activity (ERNA) is modulated during sleep. Methods: We recorded local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus of four Parkinson's patients with externalised electrodes while applying single stimulation pulses to investigate the effect of sleep on ERNA. Results: We found that ERNA features change with wakefulness and sleep stages, and are correlated with canonical frequency bands and heart rate. We further evaluated the performance of machine learning models in classifying non-REM sleep versus wakefulness and found that ERNA amplitude outperforms all spectral markers. Conclusions: Given the heterogeneity of spectral features during sleep, their susceptibility to movement artefacts and superior classification accuracy of models using ERNA features, this study paves the way for ERNA as a marker for automatic stimulation titration during sleep and improved patient care.

">The long-range gene regulatory landscape of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal specification, expansion and differentiation are tightly regulated by the concerted actions of transcription and chromatin modifying factors that are recruited to regulatory elements in the genome. Tissue-specific distal regulatory elements are typically located tens to hundreds of kilobases from the gene they regulate. To identify the distal enhancers that directly regulate a gene, information on the localisation of enhancers relative to the gene promoter in the nucleus is crucial. Cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GCps) are important transit amplifying neuronal progenitors, giving rise to the most abundant neuronal cell type in the brain. Many of the key factors that regulate fundamental developmental processes in GCps have been identified. For instance, the proneural transcription factor Atoh1 is essential for GCp specification, proliferation and differentiation and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller CHD7 is necessary for normal GCp proliferation and differentiation. However, both these factors are recruited to distal regulatory elements and the direct regulatory relationships between these factors, the enhancers they are recruited to, and the genes they regulate in GCps remain uncharacterised. To identify active, long-range gene regulatory interactions in GCps, we used promoter capture Hi-C (pcHi-C), together with ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data. We present a rich dataset consisting of 46,428 interactions between 22,797 putative distal regulatory regions and 12,905 protein coding gene promoters in primary mouse GCps. Using VISTA-designated hindbrain enhancers as an example, we show that 80% of these enhancers are incorrectly annotated at present and identify the genes most likely regulated directly by these enhancers. Motif enrichment analyses showed a significant enrichment of proneural transcription factor motifs in CHD7-regulated enhancers. Further analyses revealed co-localisation of Atoh1 and CHD7 at gene enhancers, suggesting a novel regulatory relationship between Atoh1 and CHD7 in controlling the expression of key genes in the GCp lineage. We used our data to identify >1,500 Atoh-regulated enhancers, controlling the expression of 577 genes in GCps, and 197 enhancers of 22 genes that appear to be co-regulated by Atoh1 and CHD7. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Atoh1 and CHD7 interacted with each other. These findings support the emerging picture of CHD7 as an important gene regulatory co-factor for lineage-specific transcription factors. The pcHi-C data is presented as a useful resource to the community for investigating the function of long-range enhancers in the cerebellar GCp lineage.

	<p>In humans, epilepsy is diagnosed through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Epileptic seizures (ESs) arise due to anxiety. The detection of anxiety-based seizures is challenging for radiologists, and there is a limited availability of anxiety-based EEG signals. Data augmentation methods are required to increase the number of novel samples. An epileptic seizure arises due to anxiety, which manifests as variations in EEG signal patterns consisting of changes in the size and shape of the signal. In this study, anxiety EEG signals were synthesized by applying data augmentation methods such as random data augmentation (RDA) to existing epileptic seizure signals from the Bonn EEG dataset. The data-augmented anxiety seizure signals were processed using three algorithms&amp;amp;mdash;(i) fuzzy C-means&amp;amp;ndash;particle swarm optimization&amp;amp;ndash;long short-term memory (FCM-PS-LSTM), (ii) particle swarm optimization&amp;amp;ndash;long short-term memory (PS-LSTM), and (iii) parrot optimization LSTM (PO-LSTM)&amp;amp;mdash;for the detection of anxiety ESs via EEG signals. The predicted accuracies of detecting ESs through EEG signals using the proposed algorithms&amp;amp;mdash;namely, (i) FCM-PS-LSTM, (ii) PS-LSTM, and (iii) PO-LSTM&amp;amp;mdash;were about 98%, 98.5%, and 96%, respectively.</p>

	<p>Background: Flow diversion has significantly improved the management of cerebral aneurysms. Technological advancements and increased clinical experience over the past decade have led to better outcomes and fewer complications. This study provides updated results and examines the factors that influence the success of flow diversion. Methods: We reviewed records of 115 patients with 121 intracranial aneurysms treated from July 2014 to August 2023. All patients had unruptured aneurysms in the anterior and posterior circulation. Results: Complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 72.7% of cases, with a complication rate of 9.1%. Significant predictors of complete occlusion included aneurysm diameter (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.82&amp;amp;ndash;0.97, p = 0.009) and the presence of incorporated branches (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.08&amp;amp;ndash;0.59, p = 0.003). Cox analysis identified neck diameter (HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.87&amp;amp;ndash;0.98, p = 0.009) and incorporated branch (HR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.24&amp;amp;ndash;0.69, p = 0.001) as significant for occlusion. Multivariable analysis identified aneurysm diameter (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;1.37, p = 0.001) as significant for safety outcomes. Improved outcomes were observed in recent treatments, with higher occlusion rates (79.7% vs. 61.7%, p = 0.050) and lower complication rates (4.1% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.011). Conclusions: Enhanced technical proficiency, better devices, and refined patient selection have significantly improved the efficacy and safety of flow diversion for cerebral aneurysms. Identifying significant predictors for treatment success and safety outcomes can inform clinical practice, aiding in patient selection.</p>

	<p>Brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. BCIs based on code-modulated visual evoked potentials (cVEPs) are based on visual stimuli, thus appropriate visual feedback on the interface is crucial for an effective BCI system. Many previous studies have demonstrated that implementing visual feedback can improve information transfer rate (ITR) and reduce fatigue. This research compares a dynamic interface, where target boxes change their sizes based on detection certainty, with a threshold bar interface in a three-step cVEP speller. In this study, we found that both interfaces perform well, with slight variations in accuracy, ITR, and output characters per minute (OCM). Notably, some participants showed significant performance improvements with the dynamic interface and found it less distracting compared to the threshold bars. These results suggest that while average performance metrics are similar, the dynamic interface can provide significant benefits for certain users. This study underscores the potential for personalized interface choices to enhance BCI user experience and performance. By improving user friendliness, performance, and reducing distraction, dynamic visual feedback could optimize BCI technology for a broader range of users.</p>

	<p>Psychological resilience (PR) is known to be inversely associated with depression. While there is a growing body of research examining how depression alters activity across multiple functional neural networks, how differences in PR affect these networks is largely unexplored. This study examines the relationship between PR and functional connectivity in the alpha and beta bands within (and between) eighteen established cortical nodes in the default mode network, the central executive network, and the salience network. Resting-state EEG data from 99 adult participants (32 depressed, 67 non-depressed) were used to measure the correlation between the five factors of PR sourced from the Connor&amp;amp;ndash;Davidson Resilience Scale and eLORETA-based measures of coherence and phase synchronisation. Distinct functional connectivity patterns were seen across each resilience factor, with a notable absence of overlapping positive results across the depressed and non-depressed samples. These results indicate that depression may modulate how resilience is expressed in terms of fundamental neural activity.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study is to identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit&amp;amp;ndash;hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits in adolescents who experience psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), often ignored in clinical practice but widely prevalent in the general population. A total of 57 adolescents and young adults (aged between 16 and 24 years old) were recruited consecutively in the outpatient services. A total of 37 were females (64.9%), 18 were males (31.6%), and two participants (3.5%) were non-binary or gender non-conforming, with a mean age at referral of 18.26 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.06. To investigate these symptoms, three sets of standardized questionnaires were used, as follows: the Autism Spectrum Quotient&amp;amp;ndash;short form (AQ-10), the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-42), and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). We found significant associations between the ASRS and AQ-10 total scores and all CAPE scales. The model which explained the highest variance was CAPE Score&amp;amp;rsquo;s Total Frequency score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Our findings underline the importance of investigating the presence of subthreshold ASD and ADHD symptoms in clinical populations, particularly in the period of adolescence and young adulthood, to promptly identify the presence of PLEs and, thus, prevent the onset of a frank psychotic disorder, particularly in the presence of a comorbid psychopathological condition, leading to better diagnosis and treatment for individuals with two or more of these conditions.</p>

	<p>The human organism is affected by multiple stressors every single day, especially during extremely demanding activities. It needs a method to regulate itself better. One of the stressors that is affecting humans is social isolation. The state of prolonged isolation happens during space missions. In this study, 40 analog astronauts attended a two-week-long mission. The experimental group had EEG neurofeedback training intervention performed on a daily basis, while the control group remained isolated without neurofeedback. The results let us take this non-invasive intervention under consideration, while debating the methods to lower the physiological stress reaction in humans that are exposed to extremely hard circumstances. Although not statistically significant, the trends observed give us direction towards other research to confirm EEG neurofeedback as a method to lower cell stress response levels.</p>

	<p>Background: The use of music in cognitive interventions represents a possibility with potential worthy of further investigation in the field of aging, both in terms of prevention from dementia, in the phase of mild cognitive impairment, and in the treatment of overt dementia. Objectives: Currently, the types of music-based interventions proposed in the literature are characterized by wide heterogeneity, which is why it is necessary to clarify which interventions present more evidence of effectiveness in stimulating different cognitive domains. Method: The study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews. By searching two different databases, PubMed and the Web of Science, all studies evaluating the cognitive effects of music-based interventions on people at early stages of cognitive decline (MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia) were selected. Results: The study selection included a total of 28 studies involving n = 1612 participants (mean age ranged from 69.45 to 85.3 years old). Most of the studies analyzed agree with the observation of an improvement, or at least maintenance, of global cognitive conditions (mainly represented by the results of the MMSE test) following music-based interventions, together with a series of other positive effects on verbal fluency, memory, and executive processes. Conclusions: The results of this review suggest the introduction of music-based interventions as complementary approaches to usual cognitive treatments. Also, the use of standardized and well-defined protocols, in addition to strong methodological research approaches, is suggested. Music-based interventions are recommended in the early stages of dementia, in MCI, and in a preventive sense in healthy older adults.</p>

                <p>Stress impairs fertility, at least in part, via inhibition of gonadotropin secretion. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is an important gonadotropin that is released in a pulsatile pattern in males and in females throughout the majority of the ovarian cycle. Several models of stress, including acute metabolic stress, suppress LH pulses via inhibition of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that coexpress kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (termed KNDy cells) which form the pulse generator. The mechanism for inhibition of KNDy neurons during stress, however, remains a significant outstanding question. Here, we investigated a population of catecholamine neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), marked by expression of the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), in female mice. First, we found that a subpopulation of DBH neurons in the NTS is activated (express c-Fos) during metabolic stress. Then, using chemogenetics, we determined that activation of these cells is sufficient to suppress LH pulses, augment corticosterone secretion, and induce sickness-like behavior. In subsequent studies, we identified evidence for suppression of KNDy cells (rather than downstream signaling pathways) and determined that the suppression of LH pulses was not dependent on the acute rise in glucocorticoids. Together these data support the hypothesis that DBH cells in the NTS are important for regulation of neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/34/e0125242024?rss=1">Amygdala and Cortex Relationships during Learning of a Sensory Discrimination Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>During learning of a sensory discrimination task, the cortical and subcortical regions display complex spatiotemporal dynamics. During learning, both the amygdala and cortex link stimulus information to its appropriate association, for example, a reward. In addition, both structures are also related to nonsensory parameters such as body movements and licking during the reward period. However, the emergence of the cortico-amygdala relationships during learning is largely unknown. To study this, we combined wide-field cortical imaging with fiber photometry to simultaneously record cortico-amygdala population dynamics as male mice learn a whisker-dependent go/no-go task. We were able to simultaneously record neuronal populations from the posterior cortex and either the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or central/medial amygdala (CEM). Prior to learning, the somatosensory and associative cortex responded during sensation, while amygdala areas did not show significant responses. As mice became experts, amygdala responses emerged early during the sensation period, increasing in the CEM, while decreasing in the BLA. Interestingly, amygdala and cortical responses were associated with task-related body movement, displaying significant responses ~200&nbsp;ms before movement initiation which led to licking for the reward. A correlation analysis between the cortex and amygdala revealed negative and positive correlation with the BLA and CEM, respectively, only in the expert case. These results imply that learning induces an involvement of the cortex and amygdala which may aid to link sensory stimuli with appropriate associations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/34/e0228242024?rss=1">Activation of NPY Receptors in the BLA Inhibits Projections to the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis and Buffers Stress-Induced Decreases in Social Interaction in Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) increases resilience and buffers behavioral stress responses in male rats in part through decreasing the excitability of principal output neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Intra-BLA administration of NPY acutely increases social interaction (SI) through activation of either Y<SUB>1</SUB> or Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptors, whereas repeated NPY (rpNPY) injections (once daily for 5&nbsp;d) produce persistent increases in SI through Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptor-mediated neuroplasticity in the BLA. In this series of studies, we characterized the neural circuits from the BLA that underlie these behavioral responses to NPY. Using neuronal tract tracing, NPY Y<SUB>1</SUB> and Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptor immunoreactivity was identified on subpopulations of BLA neurons projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Inhibition of BLA-&gt;BNST, but not BLA-&gt;CeA, neurons using projection-restricted, cre-driven designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug-G<SUB>i</SUB> expression increased SI and prevented stress-induced decreases in SI produced by a 30&nbsp;min restraint stress. This behavioral profile was similar to that seen after both acute and rpNPY injections into the BLA. Intracellular recordings of BLA-&gt;BNST neurons demonstrated NPY-mediated inhibition via suppression of H currents, as seen previously. Repeated intra-BLA injections of NPY, which are associated with the induction of BLA neuroplasticity, decreased the activity of BLA-&gt;BNST neurons and decreased their dendritic complexity. These results demonstrate that NPY modulates the activity of BNST-projecting BLA neurons, suggesting that this pathway contributes to the stress-buffering actions of NPY and provides a novel substrate for the proresilient effects of NPY.</p>

                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a major contributor to relapse to cocaine in humans and to reinstatement in rodent models of cocaine use disorder. The output from the mPFC is potently modulated by parvalbumin (PV)-containing fast&ndash;spiking interneurons, the majority of which are surrounded by perineuronal nets. We previously showed that treatment with chondroitinase ABC (ABC) reduced the consolidation and reconsolidation of a cocaine conditioned place preference memory. However, self-administration memories are more difficult to disrupt. Here we report in male rats that ABC treatment in the mPFC attenuated the consolidation and blocked the reconsolidation of a cocaine self-administration memory. However, reconsolidation was blocked when rats were given a novel, but not familiar, type of retrieval session. Furthermore, ABC treatment prior to, but not after, memory retrieval blocked reconsolidation. This same treatment did not alter a sucrose memory, indicating specificity for cocaine-induced memory. In naive rats, ABC treatment in the mPFC altered levels of PV intensity and cell firing properties. In vivo recordings from the mPFC and dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) during the novel retrieval session revealed that ABC prevented reward-associated increases in high-frequency oscillations and synchrony of these oscillations between the dHIP and mPFC. Together, this is the first study to show that ABC treatment disrupts reconsolidation of the original memory when combined with a novel retrieval session that elicits coupling between the dHIP and mPFC. This coupling after ABC treatment may serve as a fundamental signature for how to disrupt reconsolidation of cocaine memories and reduce relapse.</p>

                <p>The implementation of low-dimensional movement control by the central nervous system has been debated for decades. In this study, we investigated the dimensionality of the control signals received by spinal motor neurons when controlling either the ankle or knee joint torque. We first identified the low-dimensional latent factors underlying motor unit activity during torque-matched isometric contractions in male participants. Subsequently, we evaluated the extent to which motor units could be independently controlled. To this aim, we used an online control paradigm in which participants received the corresponding motor unit firing rates as visual feedback. We identified two main latent factors, regardless of the muscle group (vastus lateralis-medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis-medialis). The motor units of the gastrocnemius lateralis could be controlled largely independently from those of the gastrocnemius medialis during ankle plantarflexion. This dissociation of motor unit activity imposed similar behavior to the motor units that were not displayed in the feedback. Conversely, it was not possible to dissociate the activity of the motor units between the vastus lateralis and medialis muscles during the knee extension tasks. These results demonstrate that the number of latent factors estimated from linear dimensionality reduction algorithms does not necessarily reflect the dimensionality of volitional control of motor units. Overall, individual motor units were never controlled independently of all others but rather belonged to synergistic groups. Together, these findings provide evidence for a low-dimensional control of motor units constrained by common inputs, with notable differences between muscle groups.</p>

                <p>Although anesthesia provides favorable conditions for surgical procedures, recent studies have revealed that the brain remains active in processing noxious signals even during anesthesia. However, whether and how these responses affect the anesthesia effect remains unclear. The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a crucial hub for pain regulation, also plays an essential role in controlling general anesthesia. Hence, it was hypothesized that the vlPAG may be involved in the regulation of general anesthesia by noxious stimuli. Here, we found that acute noxious stimuli, including capsaicin-induced inflammatory pain, acetic acid-induced visceral pain, and incision-induced surgical pain, significantly delayed recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia in male mice, whereas this effect was absent in the spared nerve injury-induced chronic pain. Pretreatment with peripheral analgesics could prevent the delayed recovery induced by acute nociception. Furthermore, we found that acute noxious stimuli, induced by the injection of capsaicin under sevoflurane anesthesia, increased c-Fos expression and activity in the GABAergic neurons of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Specific reactivation of capsaicin-activated vlPAG<sup>GABA</sup> neurons mimicked the effect of capsaicin and its chemogenetic inhibition prevented the delayed recovery from anesthesia induced by capsaicin. Finally, we revealed that the vlPAG<sup>GABA</sup> neurons regulated the recovery from anesthesia through the inhibition of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neuronal activity, thus decreasing dopamine (DA) release and activation of DA D<SUB>1</SUB>-like receptors in the brain. These findings reveal a novel, cell- and circuit-based mechanism for regulating anesthesia recovery by nociception, and it is important to provide new insights for guiding the management of the anesthesia recovery period.</p>

                <p>Naturalistic observations show that animals pre-empt danger by moving to locations that increase their success in avoiding future threats. To test this in humans, we created a spatial margin of safety (MOS) decision task that quantifies pre-emptive avoidance by measuring the distance subjects place themselves to safety when facing different threats whose attack locations vary in predictability. Behavioral results show that human participants place themselves closer to safe locations when facing threats that attack in spatial locations with more outliers. Using both univariate and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on fMRI data collected during a 2&nbsp;h session on participants of both sexes, we demonstrate a dissociable role for the vmPFC in MOS-related decision-making. MVPA results revealed that the posterior vmPFC encoded for more unpredictable threats with univariate analyses showing a functional coupling with the amygdala and hippocampus. Conversely, the anterior vmPFC was more active for the more predictable attacks and showed coupling with the striatum. Our findings converge in showing that during pre-emptive danger, the anterior vmPFC may provide a safety signal, possibly via foreseeable outcomes, while the posterior vmPFC drives unpredictable danger signals.</p>

                <p>Current anesthetic theory is mostly based on neurons and/or neuronal circuits. A role for astrocytes also has been shown in promoting recovery from volatile anesthesia, while the exact modulatory mechanism and/or the molecular target in astrocytes is still unknown. In this study by animal models in male mice and electrophysiological recordings in vivo and in vitro, we found that activating astrocytes of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) and/or knocking down PVT astrocytic Kir4.1 promoted the consciousness recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the PVT reveals two distinct cellular subtypes of glutamatergic neurons: PVT<I><sup>GRM</sup></I> and PVT<I><sup>ChAT</sup></I> neurons. Patch-clamp recording results proved astrocytic Kir4.1-mediated modulation of sevoflurane on the PVT mainly worked on PVT<I><sup>ChAT</sup></I> neurons, which projected mainly to the mPFC. In summary, our findings support the novel conception that there is a specific PVT-&gt;prefrontal cortex projection involved in consciousness recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia, which is mediated by the inhibition of sevoflurane on PVT astrocytic Kir4.1 conductance.</p>

                <p>Recent studies suggest that time estimation relies on bodily rhythms and interoceptive signals. We provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence suggesting an association between the brain's processing of heartbeat and duration judgment. We examined heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) and contingent negative variation (CNV) during an auditory duration-reproduction task and a control reaction-time task spanning 4, 8, and 12&nbsp;s intervals, in both male and female participants. Interoceptive awareness was assessed with the Self-Awareness Questionnaire (SAQ) and interoceptive accuracy through the heartbeat-counting task (HCT). Results revealed that SAQ scores, but not the HCT, correlated with mean reproduced durations with higher SAQ scores associating with longer and more accurate duration reproductions. Notably, the HEP amplitude changes during the encoding phase of the timing task, particularly within 130&ndash;270&nbsp;ms (HEP1) and 470&ndash;520&nbsp;ms (HEP2) after the <I>R</I>-peak, demonstrated interval-specific modulations that did not emerge in the control task. A significant ramp-like increase in HEP2 amplitudes occurred during the duration-encoding phase of the timing but not during the control task. This increase within the reproduction phase of the timing task correlated significantly with the reproduced durations for the 8&nbsp;s and the 4&nbsp;s intervals. The larger the increase in HEP2, the greater the under-reproduction of the estimated duration. CNV components during the encoding phase of the timing task were more negative than those in the reaction-time task, suggesting greater executive resources orientation toward time. We conclude that interoceptive awareness (SAQ) and cortical responses to heartbeats (HEP) predict duration reproductions, emphasizing the embodied nature of time.</p>

                <p>Models of human categorization predict the prefrontal cortex (PFC) serves a central role in category learning. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) have been implicated in categorization; however, it is unclear whether both are critical for categorization and whether they support unique functions. We administered three categorization tasks to patients with PFC lesions (mean age, 69.6&nbsp;years; 5 men, 5 women) to examine how the prefrontal subregions contribute to categorization. These included a rule-based (RB) task that was solved via a unidimensional rule, an information integration (II) task that was solved by combining information from two stimulus dimensions, and a deterministic/probabilistic (DP) task with stimulus features that had varying amounts of category-predictive information. Compared with healthy comparison participants, both patient groups had impaired performance. Impairments in the dlPFC patients were largest during the RB task, whereas impairments in the vmPFC patients were largest during the DP task. A hierarchical model was fit to the participants&rsquo; data to assess learning deficits in the patient groups. PFC damage was correlated with a regularization term that limited updates to attention after each trial. Our results suggest that the PFC, as a whole, is important for learning to orient attention to relevant stimulus information. The dlPFC may be especially important for rule-based learning, whereas the vmPFC may be important for focusing attention on deterministic (highly diagnostic) features and ignoring less predictive features. These results support overarching functions of the dlPFC in executive functioning and the vmPFC in value-based decision-making.</p>

Knowledge integration based on the relationship between structure and function of the neural substrate is one of the main targets of neuroinformatics and data-driven computational modeling. However, the multiplicity of data sources, the diversity of benchmarks, the mixing of observables of different natures, and the necessity of a long-term, systematic approach make such a task challenging. Here we present a first snapshot of a long-term integrative modeling program designed to address this issue in the domain of the visual system: a comprehensive spiking model of cat primary visual cortex. The presented model satisfies an extensive range of anatomical, statistical and functional constraints under a wide range of visual input statistics. In the presence of physiological levels of tonic stochastic bombardment by spontaneous thalamic activity, the modeled cortical reverberations self-generate a sparse asynchronous ongoing activity that quantitatively matches a range of experimentally measured statistics. When integrating feed-forward drive elicited by a high diversity of visual contexts, the simulated network produces a realistic, quantitatively accurate interplay between visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances; contrast-invariant orientation-tuning width; center surround interactions; and stimulus-dependent changes in the precision of the neural code. This integrative model offers insights into how the studied properties interact, contributing to a better understanding of visual cortical dynamics. It provides a basis for future development towards a comprehensive model of low-level perception.

The band 3 transporter is a critical integral membrane protein of the red blood cell (RBC), as it is responsible for catalyzing the exchange of bicarbonate and chloride anions across the plasma membrane. To elucidate the structural mechanism of the band 3 transporter, detergent solubilized human ghost membrane reconstituted in nanodiscs was applied to a cryo-EM holey carbon grid to define its composition. With this approach, we identified and determined structural information of the human band 3 transporter. Here, we present 5 different cryo-EM structures of the transmembrane domain of dimeric band 3, either alone or bound with chloride or bicarbonate. Interestingly, we observed that human band 3 can form both symmetric and asymmetric dimers with a different combination of outward-facing (OF) and inward-facing (IF) states. These structures also allow us to obtain the first model of a human band 3 molecule at the IF conformation. Based on the structural data of these dimers, we propose a model of ion transport that is in favor of the elevator-type mechanism.

                Optic neuropathy is very rare and exceptionally inaugural in systemic erythematous lupus erythematosus (SLE), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a novel clinical disorder. What makes this observation unique is the combination of these two pathologies. We Hereby present the case of a severe presentation of PRES in a 15-year-old girl who was transferred to the intensive care unit for worsening hypertension and abdominal pain. The patient was first admitted to the adult medical department for sudden onset of binocular blindness. Therefore, antihypertensive drugs were prescribed and mechanical ventilation was required. A head computed tomography and MRI supported the diagnosis of PRES. The course was marked by a progressive improvement in blood pressure and recovery of normal vision after 2 days. The patient was transferred to the nephrology department for renal biopsy. The diagnosis of SLE was based on four ACR criteria: positive ANA, positive anti-DNA, proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/l and lymphopenia. In the presence of PRES, there should be no hesitation in requesting an immunological workup to look for a systemic disease. Despite a worrying clinical and radiological presentation, the prognosis of PRES remains favorable.

                This paper critically evaluates the UK’s policy responses to forced marriage through a postmodernist lens. Utilising data from the UK Forced Marriage Unit (FMU), which supported 302 cases in 2022 involving possible forced marriage or female genital mutilation, this paper highlights the complexity of addressing forced marriage as a human rights violation. To begin, the paper discusses three primary policy approaches employed by the UK in combatting forced marriages, which are regulation, exit, and community engagement. Through a postmodernist analysis, this paper critiques the essentialist view of forced marriage as a cultural problem and argues for a more nuanced understanding that incorporates diverse experiences and intersecting sociological, political, and economic factors. Due to this, this paper recommends removing forced marriage from the ‘honour-based abuse’ category and advocates for the implementation of reliable data-collecting methods to better address this issue.

[version 4; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Administration of local anesthesia via injection is the main reason for inducing anxiety in children and if not intervened it aggravates the anxiety in subsequent appointments. There are many approaches, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods that can be used to reduce children’s perception of pain and anxiety. A frequently used non-pharmacological behaviour management method to reduce anxiety and procedure pain is distraction. The rationale of distraction is to shift the attention to avert the brain from receiving unwanted stimulus which induce anxiousness. Many approaches including music, television, portable video games, virtual reality (VR) helmet, and virtual reality audio-visual eyewear, have been implemented so far. Kaleidoscope and virtual reality goggles may help as distraction techniques in reducing the levels of anxiety caused during administration of local anesthesia. By the aid of which the operator may be able to make the dental experience child friendly and ultimately provide quality dental care to anxious children. Non pharmacological measures of reducing pain are cost effective and best means that can be used while performing dental procedures. This is a research protocol for a study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of kaleidoscope and virtual reality goggles to reduce dental anxiety in young children.

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether arterial spin labeling perfusion images of healthy controls can enhance ictal single-photon emission computed tomography analysis and whether the acquisition of the interictal image can be omitted.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed 2 pipelines: The first uses ictal and interictal images and compares these to single-photon emission computed tomography and arterial spin labeling of healthy controls. The second pipeline uses only the ictal image and the analogous healthy controls. Both pipelines were compared to the gold standard analysis and evaluated on data of individuals with epilepsy who underwent ictal single-photon emission computed tomography imaging during presurgical evaluation between 2010 and 2022. Fifty healthy controls prospectively underwent arterial spin labeling imaging. The correspondence between the detected hyperperfusion and the postoperative resection cavity or the presumably affected lobe was assessed using Dice score and mean Euclidean distance. Additionally, the outcomes of the pipelines were automatically assigned to 1 of 5 concordance categories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria were met by 43 individuals who underwent epilepsy surgery and by 73 non-surgical individuals with epilepsy. Compared to the gold standard analysis, both pipelines resulted in significantly higher Dice scores and lower mean distances (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The combination of both provided localizing results in 85/116 cases, compared to 54/116 generated by the current gold standard analysis and the ictal image alone produced localizing results in 60/116 (52%) cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose a new ictal single-photon emission computed tomography protocol; it finds relevantly more ictal hyperperfusion, and halves the radiation dose in about half of the individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Increased population growth and imbalance between the need for rice are driving the conversion of numerous rice fields into non-agricultural zones and posing a significant threat to national food security. Therefore, this research is carried out to effectively address Indonesian government’s policy in preventing conversion of rice fields due to the lack of harmonization between cross-sectoral policies. Method A juridical-normative research method is used to analyze policy problems through legal theory and reality. The method is studying regulations against social phenomenon in food security sourced from the unconformity between the policies and the reality. It started by elaborating a way of thought, synthesizing conclusions, stating errors, and advising the re-formulation of policies to change the appropriation of land that in turn will affect national food security. Results The results show that there is proposed concept for reformulating rice field policies to integrate policies across sectors, ensure coherence in policy planning, and enhance the efficiency policies. The addition and harmonization of the components will strengthen the protection of the rice fields while preventing inconsistency and overlapping of authority from different sectors. The realization of this re-formulation will in time manifest national food security. Conclusions Indonesian government stipulates various policies to prevent the conversion of rice fields and to manifest national food security. However, of inconsistency and overlapping authority persist in its practice. Further close examination and reviews show the need reformation of policy for a transfer of land appropriation.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition. How they influence the maturation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, however, is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on the maturation timeline of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized (a model of surgical menopause) young adult Sprague–Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17β-estradiol, estrone or vehicle. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BrdU injection and daily hormone treatment. Brains were sectioned and processed for various markers including: sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), antigen kiel 67 (Ki67), doublecortin (DCX), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Immunofluorescent labeling or co-labelling of BrdU with Sox2 (progenitor cells), Sox2/GFAP (neural progenitor cells), Ki67 (cell proliferation), DCX (immature neurons), NeuN (mature neurons) was used to examine the trajectory and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estrogens had early (1 week of exposure) effects on different stages of neurogenesis (neural progenitor cells, cell proliferation and early maturation of new cells into neurons) but these effects were less pronounced after prolonged treatment. Estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced cell proliferation after 1 week but not after longer exposure to either estrogen. Both estrogens increased the density of immature neurons (BrdU/DCX-ir) after 1 week of exposure compared to vehicle treatment but this increased density was not sustained over longer durations of treatments to estrogens, suggesting that the enhancing effects of estrogens on neurogenesis were short-lived. Longer duration post-ovariectomy, without treatments with either of the estrogens, was associated with reduced neural progenitor cells in the DG. These results demonstrate that estrogens modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis differently in the short term, but may lose their ability to influence neurogenesis after long-term exposure. These findings have potential implications for treatments involving estrogens after surgical menopause.</p>

                In this issue of Neuron, Chadarevian et al. and Munro et al. demonstrate how the absence of homeostatic microglia leads to severe neuropathologies, including axonal spheroids, calcifications, myelination abnormalities, and gliosis, associated with leukoencephalopathy and age-related neurodegeneration. Transplantation of healthy microglia can reverse these conditions, opening new avenues for therapeutic research.

                Precisely tracking time over second-long timescales is important for accurate anticipation and consequential actions, yet the neurobiological underpinnings remain unknown. In this issue of Neuron, Garcia-Garcia and colleagues show that computations in the cerebellum resulting from interactions between the mossy fiber and climbing fiber pathways contribute to long-interval learning during operant conditioning.

                Mentoring the next generation of neuroscientists from historically excluded backgrounds brings several challenges. Successful mentor-mentee relationships are critical for addressing these challenges. Rodriguez-Romaguera and Quirk reflect on lessons learned from their cross-racial mentor-mentee relationship that could apply to many mentors.

                The formation of large endolysosomal structures in unfertilized eggs ensures that lysosomes remain dormant before fertilization, and then shift into clean-up mode after the egg-to-embryo transition.

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity have a complex bidirectional relationship. However, most studies do not assess increased appetite or weight as a depressive symptom due to limitations in rating scales. Here we aimed to analyze frequently employed depressive-symptom scales and discuss the relevance of weight and appetite assessment items. To elaborate this perspective, we searched for validated questionnaires and scales evaluating depressive symptoms in English. We analyzed appetite and weight items from 20 depressive-symptoms rating scales. Only 8 of 20 rating scales assessed for increased weight or appetite. The scales reported in the literature as the most employed in antidepressants efficacy trials do not assess increased appetite or weight. The current use of rating scales limits our understanding of the relationship between MDD, antidepressants, and obesity. It is necessary to improve our weight and appetite measurements in MDD to clarify the respective impact of depressive symptoms and antidepressants on weight change.</p>

	<p>Sensory integration is an essential human function whose decline impacts quality of life, particularly in older adults. Herein, we propose an arm-reaching task based on a virtual reality head-mounted display system to assess sensory integration in daily life, and we examined whether reaching task performance was associated with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the brain regions involved in sensory integration. We hypothesized that declining sensory integration would affect performance during a reaching task with multiple cognitive loads. Using a task in which a young/middle-aged group showed only small individual differences, older adults showed large individual differences in the gap angle between the reaching hand and the target position, which was used to assess sensory integration function. Additionally, rsfMRI data were used to identify correlations between rsFC and performance in older adults, showing that performance was correlated with connectivity between the primary motor area and the left inferior temporal gyrus and temporo-occipital region. Connectivity between areas is related to visuomotor integration; thus, the results suggest the involvement of visuomotor integration in the decline of sensory integration function and the validity of the gap angle during this VR reaching task as an index of functional decline.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy seizure prediction is vital for enhancing the quality of life for individuals with epilepsy. In this study, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning architecture, merging DenseNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) with an attention fusion layer for seizure prediction. DenseNet captures hierarchical features and ensures efficient parameter usage, while ViT offers self-attention mechanisms and global feature representation. The attention fusion layer effectively amalgamates features from both networks, guaranteeing the most relevant information is harnessed for seizure prediction. The raw EEG signals were preprocessed using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to implement time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency analysis and convert EEG signals into time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency matrices. Then, they were fed into the proposed hybrid DenseNet&amp;amp;ndash;ViT network model to achieve end-to-end seizure prediction. The CHB-MIT dataset, including data from 24 patients, was used for evaluation and the leave-one-out cross-validation method was utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Our results demonstrate superior performance in seizure prediction, exhibiting high accuracy and low redundancy, which suggests that combining DenseNet, ViT, and the attention mechanism can significantly enhance prediction capabilities and facilitate more precise therapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to analyze the effects of systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) in a model of permanent ischemic stroke (focal ischemia due to thermocoagulation of pial vessels) on sensorimotor function (cylinder test and patch removal test), behavioral tasks (novelty habituation memory open field task) and cerebral infarct size in adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) for 42 days after the occurrence of a stroke. We observed that the stroke caused asymmetry in the front paws and delayed adhesive removal. These effects were spontaneously reduced in WKY rats, but not in SHR. Short- and long-term novelty habituation memories were abolished by stroke in WYK and SHR. On the 3rd day after stroke, the size of the focal cerebral infarct was the same in WKY and SHR. However, on the 7th day, the infarct size decreased in WKY rats, but not SHR. These results suggested that SAH impairment of sensorimotor recovery in rats subjected to cerebral ischemia could be related to augmented focal cerebral infarct size. Moreover, the behavioral tasks used in this study were unaffected by Systemic Arterial Hypertension. Our results highlight the need for animal models of comorbidities in stroke research.</p>

                <p>Reverberation, a ubiquitous feature of real-world acoustic environments, exhibits statistical regularities that human listeners leverage to self-orient, facilitate auditory perception, and understand their environment. Despite the extensive research on sound source representation in the auditory system, it remains unclear how the brain represents real-world reverberant environments. Here, we characterized the neural response to reverberation of varying realism by applying multivariate pattern analysis to electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals. Human listeners (12 males and 8 females) heard speech samples convolved with real-world and synthetic reverberant impulse responses and judged whether the speech samples were in a "real" or "fake" environment, focusing on the reverberant background rather than the properties of speech itself. Participants distinguished real from synthetic reverberation with ~75% accuracy; EEG decoding reveals a multistage decoding time course, with dissociable components early in the stimulus presentation and later in the perioffset stage. The early component predominantly occurred in temporal electrode clusters, while the later component was prominent in centroparietal clusters. These findings suggest distinct neural stages in perceiving natural acoustic environments, likely reflecting sensory encoding and higher-level perceptual decision-making processes. Overall, our findings provide evidence that reverberation, rather than being largely suppressed as a noise-like signal, carries relevant environmental information and gains representation along the auditory system. This understanding also offers various applications; it provides insights for including reverberation as a cue to aid navigation for blind and visually impaired people. It also helps to enhance realism perception in immersive virtual reality settings, gaming, music, and film production.</p>

                <p>Adults heard recordings of two spatially separated speakers reading newspaper and magazine articles. They were asked to listen to one of them and ignore the other, and EEG was recorded to assess their neural processing. Machine learning extracted neural sources that tracked the target and distractor speakers at three levels: the acoustic envelope of speech (delta- and theta-band modulations), lexical frequency for individual words, and the contextual predictability of individual words estimated by GPT-4 and earlier lexical models. To provide a broader view of speech perception, half of the subjects completed a simultaneous visual task, and the listeners included both native and non-native English speakers. Distinct neural components were extracted for these levels of auditory and lexical processing, demonstrating that native English speakers had greater target&ndash;distractor separation compared with non-native English speakers on most measures, and that lexical processing was reduced by the visual task. Moreover, there was a novel interaction of lexical predictability and frequency with auditory processing; acoustic tracking was stronger for lexically harder words, suggesting that people listened harder to the acoustics when needed for lexical selection. This demonstrates that speech perception is not simply a feedforward process from acoustic processing to the lexicon. Rather, the adaptable context-sensitive processing long known to occur at a lexical level has broader consequences for perception, coupling with the acoustic tracking of individual speakers in noise.</p>

                Background: Antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy for the treatment of periodontitis is being increasingly gaining attention but at present, very limited data are available on the clinical and microbiological outcomes obtained following Indocyanine Green as the photosensitizer in Maintenance patients. The objective was to evaluate the efficiency of Indocyanine(ICG)-green based photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in patients enrolled in maintenance therapy. Methodology: Using a split mouth study design, 24 participants enrolled in the maintenance therapy, having diagnosed as Periodontitis, were randomly subjected to scaling and root planing(SRP). The test group additionally received ICG-based (Aurogreen®, Aurolabs, Madurai, India,1mg/ml) aPDT with an 810nm diode laser. Clinical assessment of Plaque index, modified Sulcus bleeding index, Probing pocket depth, Clinical loss of attachment and microbiological analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and F.nucleatum were performed at baseline and 3 months after treatment. Results: It was observed that although there was no significant difference between the test and control group at baseline and 3 months, there was a statistically significant reduction in the mean values in both the groups at 3 months. Microbiological analysis showed substantial reduction in detection frequency of the bacteria assessed at 3 months in both the groups. Conclusion: Within the limits of the study, ICG-based aPDT did not show additional advantage over SRP alone at 3 months, though it could be a promising treatment modality in maintenance patients in terms of patient comfort and the treatment time taken. More randomised clinical trials should be employed to understand the exact mode of action of ICG based aPDT and its role in treatment of periodontal disease.

                Background Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare neuroinflammatory disease that affects the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure, resulting in symptoms of neuropathy. Case presentation We report a case of a 35-year-old male patient with no past medical history who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of a four-day history of progressively increasing headaches associated with right eye pain and double vision. A physical examination showed findings suggestive of abducens nerve palsy. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed subtle asymmetric thickening of the right cavernous sinus, which prompted further investigation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scan showed intensely enhanced soft tissue thickening in the right cavernous sinus region, slightly extending to the right orbital apex, which caused enlargement of the cavernous sinus and appeared isointense to the adjacent muscles on T1 and T2. The diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome was made after the exclusion of all other possible pathologies. The patient received prednisolone therapy; his symptoms improved, and he was discharged after three days. Two weeks later, the patient presented again to the ED with the same symptoms and was treated symptomatically. Conclusions This case highlights a very rare etiology for painful ophthalmoplegia, which is Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Thickening of the cavernous sinus on MRI images with a background history of painful ophthalmoplegia and headache should raise clinician’s suspicion towards the disease. In addition, exclusion of other possible causes is very important, as Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion.

However, its implementation in Tunisia and other developing countries has achieved little success with low utilization and can be challenging for several reasons. In this study, our aim was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practice of Tunisian medical doctors regarding telemedicine. Methods: This was a cross-sectional web survey, administered to medical doctors in Tunisia in October 2022. Respondents’ level of knowledge of telemedicine was assessed by calculating a knowledge score (0 to 12). Attitude subsections were about perceived telemedicine attributes of relative advantage, compatibility, trial ability and complexity. Results: A total of 243 participants were included. The mean age was 45 ± 9.6 years old, and 57.2% were female, with a mean of 14.3 ± 10.3 years of professional experience. The majority (95.9%) had an average or high level of computer skills. More than half (59.3%) had a poor level of telemedicine knowledge. A good level of knowledge was significantly associated with age category over 50 years (p = 0.02) and with years of experience over 10 (p = 0.03). The majority (89.3%) had a moderate or high score about perceived advantages. The majority (88.5%) accepted use of telemedicine in their future practice. Almost half (46.9%) had practiced telemedicine activities before using a mobile phone (91%) or social media (64%). The principal limitations of applying telemedicine were challenges of organization and implementation, and incomplete patient examination. Conclusions: Although Tunisian doctors’ knowledge and practice of telemedicine were unsatisfactory, their positive attitude and willingness to try it in their future practice were encouraging. There is an urgent need for implementing telemedicine in Tunisia to improve health care coverage in some unprivileged areas.

Protocol for a Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The present protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO under de ID code CRD42023476313, and adheres the PRISMA-P 2015 statement. The complete checklist can be consulted in the extended data section. Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is the most common chronic disease in children worldwide. According to many guidelines topical nasal steroids (TNS) are the first-line treatment for moderate/severe AR in children, nevertheless there is no conclusive evidence about which of them is superior in terms of efficacy and safety, including their impact on child’s growth. Methods We will conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating TNS in the treatment of children with moderate/severe AR. The primary outcome is the efficacy measured with the Total Nasal Symptom Severity Score (TNSS). Secondary outcomes are quality of life, adverse events (AE), and growth velocity. We will search Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO trials database and grey literature resources. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias and the confidence in the estimate (with the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation [GRADE] approach). We will conduct a random-effects NMA to combine the pooled direct and indirect treatment effect estimates for each outcome if adequate data is available and transitivity and coherence assumptions are considered justifiable. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses are planned to evaluate the impact of some potential effect modifiers such as doses, co-intervention with oral antihistamines, the type of AR (intermittent or persistent), sponsorship of the study, the time of outcomes measurement and the risk of bias. We will use GRADE approach to draw conclusions from NMA. Discussion This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to determine the relative efficacy and safety of the TNS for treatment of children with moderate/severe AR. The results will provide valuable information to assist clinicians, guideline developers, patients, and policy makers about the management of these patients, based on the best available evidence. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO number: CRD42023476313.

                Objectives new-onset relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has rarely been communicated as a side effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (SC2V). Here we report a patient with new-onset RRMS shortly after the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose, which was diagnosed only after a relapse after the third vaccine dose. Case report the patient is a 31 year-old male who developed eye problems 48 days after the second dose of BNT162b2. The symptoms were attributed to eye strain and gradually disappeared without treatment. Further workup was negative. Three months after the third BNT162b2 dose, urinary urgency developed. Eleven months after the third BNT162b2 dose, he developed sensory and visual disturbances that were noticeable post-exercise and progressed and worsened with alcohol and heat. MRI showed typical lesions that met the Barkhof/Tintore criteria for RRMS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies revealed elevated kappa free light chains and positive oligoclonal bands. Because the revised McDonalds criteria were met, RRMS was diagnosed and ocrelizumab was started. Conclusions this case shows that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can trigger new-onset RRMS, the clinical presentation of SC2V-induced multiple sclerosis is similar to multiple sclerosis due to other triggers, and the severity of the relapses may increase with the number of boosters given. Although, rare, a neurologist should be aware of the presumably rare event in which SC2V triggers new-onset multiple sclerosis.

                Introduction This research is a systematic review aimed at synthesizing scientific evidence on the causes of university dropout, focusing on the subcategories of vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects between 2020 and June 2024. Methods Only articles addressing university dropout were considered, analyzing dimensions such as vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects. Articles published in indexed scientific journals with double-blind, double-blind peer, or open reviews between 2020 and June 2024 were included. The main databases used were Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. To assess the risk of bias in qualitative studies, the criteria from the article “Validity criteria for qualitative research: three epistemological strands for the same purpose” were used. For quantitative studies, the criteria from the article “Evaluating survey research in articles published in Library Science journals” were followed. For mixed-method studies, both sets of criteria were combined. Results A total of 23 studies were included: 15 quantitative (65.22%), 3 qualitative (13.04%), and 5 mixed-method (21.74%). All studies (100%) addressed the subcategories of socioeconomic status and institutional aspects. Regarding the academic performance subcategory, 86% of the studies addressed it, while the vocational guidance subcategory was covered by 73.91% of the studies. Conclusions Vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects are crucial for reducing university dropout. Providing adequate professional guidance, academic support, financial assistance, and strong institutional support is fundamental to improving student retention and academic success.

                Abstract* Background Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a novel treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) that is considered to be a cost-effective option. It has demonstrated positive outcomes and minimal adverse effects. By injecting PRP into the intracavernous tissue, it has the potential to promote angiogenesis and neuroregeneration, leading to a potential permanent improvement in erectile performance. The potency and safety as well as the variety of PRP administration protocols in the treatment of ED are the objectives of this paper. Method Using certain terms, a systematic search was done on three different databases: Science Directs, Scielo, and PubMed. Papers about PRP therapy for EDs within the last decade, be randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and be original studies with freely available full-text content were included in this study. This article omitted letters to the editor, reviews, and editorials regarding PRP and ED. Results Three RCT were included in this studies. The improvement is observed at one month, three months, and six months after the treatment, compared to the baseline. PRP group participants met the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) in the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) at a higher percentage than those in the placebo group at both one month and six months. Injection of PRP leads to a superior enhancement in the IIEF-EF score, compared to a placebo, in patients suffering from ED at one month, three months, six months. Conclusion PRP is a proven therapeutic technique that has been shown to greatly enhance ED. Yet, to establish uniform guidelines for PRP in treating erectile dysfunction, further investigation into PRP, particularly in protocol development, is imperative.

                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Tropical sprue (TS) is a post-infective disease of the small bowel characterized by a malabsorption syndrome affecting tropics inhabitants and visitors. Diagnosis of TS remains challenging since it can be confused with common diarrheal diseases, especially in non-endemic areas. We report a Tunisian case of latent TS. A 58-year-old male with a history of chronic watery diarrhea, was admitted to the intensive care unit for confusion which was related to a severe metabolic acidosis. Despite the neurological improvement after hydro-electrolytic resuscitation and acid-base disorders correction, the patient continued to have three to five loose stools daily. A nutritional assessment showed a malabsorption syndrome: iron, Vitamin B12and folate deficiencies; normochromic normocytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed duodenal villous atrophy and biopsy confirmed subtotal villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis and a thickened hyalonalized sub-epithelial basal lamina. Celiac disease was evoked, however the patient did not improve on a gluten-free diet and the celiac serology was negative. On re-interviewing, we discovered that the patient had spent two months in India three years prior. Given the travel history, clinico-biological and histological data TS was highly considered and a good response to a five-month antibiotic course combined to nutritional supplementation supported this diagnosis. Clinico-biological, endoscopic and histological findings were overlapping between TS and other malabsorption diseases, explaining diagnosis difficulties. TS should be systematically discussed in tropics visitors presenting with chronic diarrhea. Improvement after micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies replacement combined to a prolonged antibiotic course supports the diagnosis of TS.

                Background Maternal health care (MHC) is critical for safe motherhood and preventing maternal deaths in Myanmar, but the institutional delivery rates are not yet optimal, increasing preventable maternal deaths. To address this issue, involving men in supporting MHC has been recognized as a strategy to improve MHC outcomes. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of men in maternity health (MiM) intervention on male involvement in MHC and its influence on knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to maternal health and institutional delivery rates in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. Methods This study employed a mixed-methods approach with quantitative surveying of the male partners and qualitative interviewing of both male and female partners and health stakeholders. A 6-month MiM education program on pregnancy complications, antenatal care, delivery care, and birth preparedness was provided to the intervention group. Before and after the intervention, comparisons between intervention and control groups were made. Results The socio-demographic characteristics of male partners were comparable between the intervention and control groups during the pre-intervention assessment. Before MiM intervention, notable differences in male partners’ knowledge, attitudes, birth preparedness and complication readiness practices regarding MHC were not evident between these two groups. After completing the MiM, significant score improvement, including higher ID rates compared to the control group (p<0.001), was observed. The acceptability and feasibility of the MiM program were contributed by positive responses from qualitative findings, highlighting remarkable changes in the perspectives of male partners in supporting MHC. However, challenges, including financial limitations, cultural influences and a shortage of trained personnel, were encountered. Conclusion The MiM program effectively promotes male involvement in MHC, leading to improved MHC outcomes. The MiM intervention offers a promising, evidence-based model to enhance ID rates in Myanmar, requiring tailored approaches to address cultural and financial factors.

                Background There are a variety of published standard methods and water chemistry recommendations for zebrafish (Danio rerio) husbandry, but empirical evidence for their justification is often lacking, as is information on some variables that have important biological effects on fish. Importantly, these different recommendations could contribute to variability in results and fish welfare between or within institutions. Methods Here we document the current range of water chemistry used by various research institutions around the world and report initial findings on their effects on the development and growth of zebrafish. Over 40 institutes responded to a survey that revealed a large variation in water chemistry used for zebrafish husbandry including differences in the set-points and acceptable ranges for temperature, pH and conductivity. In subsequent experiments, zebrafish (D. rerio, WIK) embryos/larvae exposed to a large range of salt concentrations (50μM to 10mM Na+ or 30 – 2500 μS/cm) and CO2 levels (400 – 8,000 μatm). Results Larvae exposed to the lowest salt concentration (5 μM Na+ or < 30μS/cm) had a slower response to touch and their swim bladders were not inflated. Larvae exposed to 5-100 μM Na+ were 5 % shorter in total body length than those exposed to higher salt concentrations (>100 μM Na+). Zebrafish embryo/larvae exposed to intermediate pCO2 values (~2000 μatm) were 1 to 3.5% longer than those exposed to either ambient (400 μatm) or higher (4000 μatm) pCO2, but pCO2 did not affect developmental endpoints up to 4 dpf. Conclusions Overall, we highlight the magnitude of variation in water chemistry used within zebrafish research and provide some empirical evidence to show that not all of these water conditions might be optimal for developing zebrafish and reproducibility of research, although further research is necessary to determine longer-term effects of water chemistry on older larvae, juveniles and adults.

                Purpose This study examines the key factors affecting consumers’ purchases of environmentally friendly products in Malaysia. Originality Although the Malaysian government has put in effort and assistance to promote the use of environmentally friendly products, the purchase of environmentally friendly products remains low, as the costs of environmentally friendly products are still more expensive than those of non-energy efficient products. This study is one of the pioneering studies in developing countries that examined the purchase of environmentally friendly products after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology Three hundred participants from four developed states in Malaysia with the highest awareness of environmental protection and environmentally friendly products were approached. The survey was administered to the respondents in public places. Findings Malaysians’ purchase intentions towards environmentally friendly products are affected by confidence, family income, and attitude. In contrast, this study found no significant positive effect of financial subsidies on purchase intention towards environmentally friendly products.

                Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are substantial contributors to the global disease burden and mortality. The ANRIL gene polymorphism rs1333040 has been implicated in susceptibility to cardiovascular disease; however, its role in the Vietnamese population remains unclear. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 185 Vietnamese patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and clinical data, medical history, and biochemical parameters were recorded. ANRIL SNP rs1333040 was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. Genotype frequencies were assessed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and their association with cardiovascular risk factors. Results The ‘Normal’ BMI (Body Mass Index) category was the largest segment, comprising 77.84% of the sample. Key cardiovascular risk factors identified among patients with AMI included hypertension (83.8%), dyslipidemia (80.0%), smoking (50.0%), and diabetes mellitus (33.8%). Clinical presentation showed that 55.0% of patients had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and 45.0% had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Lipid profile abnormalities were significant; 60.0% had decreased High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C), 53.8% had elevated triglycerides, 37.5% had elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C), and 36.3% had elevated total cholesterol levels. Genetic analysis focused on the rs1333040 polymorphism of the ANRIL gene, with the most common genotype being TT (58.8%), followed by CT (33.7%) and CC (7.5%). Allele frequencies were 75.6% for T and 24.4% for C. This study is the clinical implications of ANRIL polymorphisms in Vietnamese patients with CAD and AMI. Significant genotype-phenotype associations were observed, underscoring the importance of incorporating genetic screening for enhanced prognostic capabilities and personalized therapeutic decisions. Further research focused on delineating the precise genetic underpinnings of complex cardiovascular diseases in diverse populations is warranted.

                Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60–90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001). Conclusions The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.

                Background The influenza virus is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes seasonal outbreaks and occasionally, unpredictable pandemics with high morbidity and mortality rates. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of drugs with potential antiviral activity against all types of influenza strains, including resistant strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral agents. Methods The synthesis of new oseltamivir carboxamides with amino acids and the subsequent synthesis of hybrid molecules with hydroxamic acid were considered. Two series are presented as series one; oseltamivir carboxamides with L-serine, L-isoleucine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine and series two included hydroxamates of series one. This approach may provide promising candidates with potential anti-influenza activity. The in vitro cytotoxic activity against Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), type (NBL-2) - CCL-34 cells using the MTT ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the investigated compounds. The percent inhibition of neuraminidase was plotted against concentrations and the IC50 values were calculated by non-linear logistic curve fitting. Results The compounds were subjected to molecular docking using the GOLD suite (version 5.7.1) to predict the binding affinities for neuraminidase (3CL0). The docking scores are presented as PLP fitness and are comparable to those of oseltamivir. Oseltamivir-Phenylalanine recorded the highest docking score (72.23 kcal/mol), while, oseltamivir acid was recorded (56.24 kcal/mol). The ADMET parameters were generated using the Swiss ADME server to predict successful candidates with reasonable oral absorption and safety margins. All compounds are safer than oseltamivir and their IC50 values for neuraminidase inhibition were variable. The hybrids showed a lower percentage of viable cells. Oseltamivir-phenylalanine had the highest inhibitory activity against neuraminidase (3.03 μM), when compared with oseltamivir (67.22 μM). Conclusion Oseltamivir-phenylalanine showed remarkable and very significant activity, and the hybrid molecules were surprisingly less effective on neuraminidase than oseltamivir carboxamides.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-544/v3?src=rss">Exploring the acceptance of robotic assisted surgery among the Indian population: An empirical investigation [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-935/v1?src=rss">Data on selfـــefficacy  and its sources during the COVID-19 crisis:  A Saudi auditor’s perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Auditors during COVID-19 experienced an unprecedented situation where normal audit activities became difficult to conduct. Moreover, COVID-19 forced auditors to introduce a new audit approach, “remote auditing,” which was not common in most audit firms and required the adoption of more advanced technologies. Overall, auditors during COVID-19 needed both cognitive and technical factors to deliver high-quality audits. Despite the challenges, research into how auditors dealt with these issues is limited, presenting an intriguing area of study. Methods This dataset provides insights into the Saudi auditor’s experience and beliefs regarding audit activities during COVID-19. Through an online survey, researchers collected data from 193 out of 417 registered auditors with the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). The survey assessed the auditors’ self-efficacy in conducting audits during the pandemic, exploring its sources and potential moderating factors. Specifically, the dataset includes responses on eight items related to self-efficacy, 19 items covering the four common sources of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological/emotional states), and six items assessing virtual audit competency. Additionally, the dataset contains demographic information valuable for researchers analysing the relationship between auditor self-efficacy, its sources, and other influencing factors. Conclusions Overall, the dataset included in this article may serve a broader audience and be useful in improving several stakeholders’ understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on auditors and how auditors assess their ability to adapt to the COVID-19 consequences. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the need for auditors to adapt to new circumstances and adopt innovative approaches during challenging times, thereby ensuring the delivery of high-quality audits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-934/v1?src=rss">Assessment of early neonatal practices to prevent hypothermia ; A comparative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                This research explores the application of quadratic polynomials in Python for advanced data analysis. The study demonstrates how quadratic models can effectively capture nonlinear relationships in complex datasets by leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Pandas. The methodology involves fitting quadratic polynomials to the data using least-squares regression and evaluating the model fit using the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The results highlight the strong performance of the quadratic polynomial fit, as evidenced by high R-squared values, indicating the model’s ability to explain a substantial proportion of the data variability. Comparisons with linear and cubic models further underscore the quadratic model’s balance between simplicity and precision for many practical applications. The study also acknowledges the limitations of quadratic polynomials and proposes future research directions to enhance their accuracy and efficiency for diverse data analysis tasks. This research bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation, providing an accessible Python-based tool for leveraging quadratic polynomials in data analysis.

                Background Heat polymerized acrylic (HPA) resins are known to have high porosity that contributes to increased surface roughness and microcrack formation in stress areas. This facilitates the attachment and growth of polymicrobial biofilms contributing to increased antimicrobial resistance. Many research had been carried out on avocado seeds, but no research that studies the effect of avocado seeds on denture-plaque microorganism biofilm on HPA resin has been found. Methods This study used 144 samples (n=144), namely HPA resin discs covered with mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms consisting of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Staphylococcus aureus. The discs were soaked for 8 hours in the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% avocado seed extract, positive control (alkaline peroxide), and negative control (aquadest). Each disc was shaken with a vortex mixer for 1 minute, and 100 μL was added into 96-well microplates with three times repetition and incubated for 24 hours. The inhibition values were determined from the percentage inhibition value formula which required absorption values from a microplate reader (595 nm). Results In this research, it was found that the MBIC50 of avocado seed extract against the mono-species of C. albicans (5%), C. glabrata (5%), A. odontolyticus (15%), S. gordonii (15%), S. aureus (10%), while against the biofilm was 20%. There was a significant effect of soaking HPA resin in avocado seed extract of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% on the inhibition of mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms of denture-plaque microorganisms with a value of p<0.001 (p<0.05). Conclusion The MBIC50 of avocado seed extract in polymicrobial biofilm group was higher than that in the mono-species biofilm groups. Although alkaline peroxide showed higher inhibition value than that of the MBIC50 in polymicrobial biofilm group, 20% avocado seed extract was effective in inhibiting polymicrobial biofilm because it was able to inhibit more than 50% polymicrobial biofilm.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Sui's hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

The ultraviolet (UV) radiation triggers a pigmentation response in human skin, wherein, melanocytes rapidly activate divergent maturation and proliferation programs. Using single-cell sequencing, we demonstrate that these 2 programs are segregated in distinct subpopulations in melanocytes of human and zebrafish skin. The coexistence of these 2 cell states in cultured melanocytes suggests possible cell autonomy. Luria–Delbrück fluctuation test reveals that the initial establishment of these states is stochastic. Tracking of pigmenting cells ascertains that the stochastically acquired state is faithfully propagated in the progeny. A systemic approach combining single-cell multi-omics (RNA+ATAC) coupled to enhancer mapping with H3K27 acetylation successfully identified state-specific transcriptional networks. This comprehensive analysis led to the construction of a gene regulatory network (GRN) that under the influence of noise, establishes a bistable system of pigmentation and proliferation at the population level. This GRN recapitulates melanocyte behaviour in response to external cues that reinforce either of the states. Our work highlights that inherent stochasticity within melanocytes establishes dedicated states, and the mature state is sustained by selective enhancers mark through histone acetylation. While the initial cue triggers a proliferation response, the continued signal activates and maintains the pigmenting subpopulation via epigenetic imprinting. Thereby our study provides the basis of coexistence of distinct populations which ensures effective pigmentation response while preserving the self-renewal capacity.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002768">Slow-wave sleep drives sleep-dependent renormalization of synaptic AMPA receptor levels in the hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jianfeng Liu, Niels Niethard, Yu Lun, Stoyan Dimitrov, Ingrid Ehrlich, Jan Born, Manfred Hallschmid</p>

According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), sleep serves to renormalize synaptic connections that have been potentiated during the prior wake phase due to ongoing encoding of information. SHY focuses on glutamatergic synaptic strength and has been supported by numerous studies examining synaptic structure and function in neocortical and hippocampal networks. However, it is unknown whether synaptic down-regulation during sleep occurs in the hypothalamus, i.e., a pivotal center of homeostatic regulation of bodily functions including sleep itself. We show that sleep, in parallel with the synaptic down-regulation in neocortical networks, down-regulates the levels of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the hypothalamus of rats. Most robust decreases after sleep were observed at both sites for AMPARs containing the GluA1 subunit. Comparing the effects of selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and total sleep deprivation, we moreover provide experimental evidence that slow-wave sleep (SWS) is the driving force of the down-regulation of AMPARs in hypothalamus and neocortex, with no additional contributions of REM sleep or the circadian rhythm. SWS-dependent synaptic down-regulation was not linked to EEG slow-wave activity. However, spindle density during SWS predicted relatively increased GluA1 subunit levels in hypothalamic synapses, which is consistent with the role of spindles in the consolidation of memory. Our findings identify SWS as the main driver of the renormalization of synaptic strength during sleep and suggest that SWS-dependent synaptic renormalization is also implicated in homeostatic control processes in the hypothalamus.

Cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer has recently been shown to play a role in maintaining physiological functions of cell. We previously illustrated that mitochondrial transfer within osteocyte dendritic network regulates bone tissue homeostasis. However, the mechanism of triggering this process has not been explored. Here, we showed that stressed osteocytes in mice release adenosine diphosphate (ADP), resulting in triggering mitochondrial transfer from healthy osteocytes to restore the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and to alleviate reactive oxygen species accumulation. Furthermore, we identified that P2Y2 and P2Y6 transduced the ADP signal to regulate osteocyte mitochondrial transfer. We showed that mitochondrial metabolism is impaired in aged osteocytes, and there were more extracellular nucleotides release into the matrix in aged cortical bone due to compromised membrane integrity. Conditioned medium from aged osteocytes triggered mitochondrial transfer between osteocytes to enhance the energy metabolism. Together, using osteocyte as an example, this study showed new insights into how extracellular ADP triggers healthy cells to rescue energy metabolism crisis in stressed cells via mitochondrial transfer in tissue homeostasis.

                Background- Cervical spondylosis is a disease that is caused by the vitiation of only one bodily humor (dosha) (Vataja nanatmaja). The vata bodily humor (dosa) becomes vitiated and settles in the cervical (manya), creating neck pain and stiffness, which ultimately led to cervical spondylosis. Cervical spondylosis can be examined primarily under the generalization of cervical spondylosis because both conditions have many of the same symptoms. A disorder known as cervical spondylosis, which affects the cervical vertebra, is a degenerative condition of the cervical spine. In addition to having negative effects on a person's health, the disease also significantly lowers the quality of life and daily activities. Ayurveda suggested a treatment for cervical spondylosis to avoid and control the condition. There are numerous therapies in Ayurveda, and Oil administration through the nostrils has been given a significant role in upper clavicular disease (Uurdhvajatrugata roga). Oil administration through nostril therapy has been specifically recommended by Acharya Charka for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. The purpose of certain ayurvedic approaches in the management of cervical spondylosis. Methods: - 60 patients will be split into two groups for this investigation. A tinospora cardifolia and a group of drugs (Mashadi oil) will be given to the group through the nostrils for seven days at a dose of eight drops. The same will be used for the other 30 patients, i.e., group B with Ricinus Communis and a group of drugs (Erandadi oil) administered through the nostrils. Expected result: The result will be assessed on the baseline of objective parameters, and data will be compared after the treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92794">FBXO24 deletion causes abnormal accumulation of membraneless electron-dense granules in sperm flagella and male infertility</a></h4>

              
                Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless electron-dense structures rich in RNAs and proteins, and involved in various cellular processes. Two RNP granules in male germ cells, intermitochondrial cement and the chromatoid body (CB), are associated with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and are required for transposon silencing and spermatogenesis. Other RNP granules in male germ cells, the reticulated body and CB remnants, are also essential for spermiogenesis. In this study, we disrupted FBXO24, a testis-enriched F-box protein, in mice and found numerous membraneless electron-dense granules accumulated in sperm flagella. <i>Fbxo24</i> knockout (KO) mice exhibited malformed flagellar structures, impaired sperm motility, and male infertility, likely due to the accumulation of abnormal granules. The amount and localization of known RNP granule-related proteins were not disrupted in <i>Fbxo24</i> KO mice, suggesting that the accumulated granules were distinct from known RNP granules. Further studies revealed that RNAs and two importins, IPO5 and KPNB1, abnormally accumulated in <i>Fbxo24</i> KO spermatozoa and that FBXO24 could ubiquitinate IPO5. In addition, IPO5 and KPNB1 were recruited to stress granules, RNP complexes, when cells were treated with oxidative stress or a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggest that FBXO24 is involved in the degradation of IPO5, disruption of which may lead to the accumulation of abnormal RNP granules in sperm flagella.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96678">Released bacterial ATP shapes local and systemic inflammation during abdominal sepsis</a></h4>

              
                Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed <i>E. coli</i> bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84955">Neural population dynamics underlying evidence accumulation in multiple rat brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence to make decisions is a core cognitive function. Previous studies have tended to estimate accumulation using either neural or behavioral data alone. Here we develop a unified framework for modeling stimulus-driven behavior and multi-neuron activity simultaneously. We applied our method to choices and neural recordings from three rat brain regions - the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the frontal orienting fields (FOF), and the anterior-dorsal striatum (ADS) - while subjects performed a pulse-based accumulation task. Each region was best described by a distinct accumulation model, which all differed from the model that best described the animal's choices. FOF activity was consistent with an accumulator where early evidence was favored while the ADS reflected near perfect accumulation. Neural responses within an accumulation framework unveiled a distinct association between each brain region and choice. Choices were better predicted from all regions using a comprehensive, accumulation-based framework and different brain regions were found to differentially reflect choice-related accumulation signals: FOF and ADS both reflected choice but ADS showed more instances of decision vacillation. Previous studies relating neural data to behaviorally-inferred accumulation dynamics have implicitly assumed that individual brain regions reflect the whole-animal level accumulator. Our results suggest that different brain regions represent accumulated evidence in dramatically different ways and that accumulation at the whole-animal level may be constructed from a variety of neural-level accumulators.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95555">Discovery of the 1-naphthylamine biodegradation pathway reveals a broad-substrate-spectrum enzyme catalyzing 1-naphthylamine glutamylation</a></h4>

              
                1-Naphthylamine (1NA), which is harmful to human and aquatic animals, has been used widely in the manufacturing of dyes, pesticides, and rubber antioxidants. Nevertheless, little is known about its environmental behavior and no bacteria have been reported to use it as the growth substrate. Herein, we describe a pathway for 1NA degradation in the isolate <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. strain JS3066, determine the structure and mechanism of the enzyme NpaA1 that catalyzes the initial reaction, and reveal how the pathway evolved. From genetic and enzymatic analysis, a five gene-cluster encoding a dioxygenase system was determined to be responsible for the initial steps in 1NA degradation through glutamylation of 1NA. The γ-glutamylated 1NA was subsequently oxidized to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene which was further degraded by the well-established pathway of naphthalene degradation via catechol. A glutamine synthetase-like (GS-like) enzyme (NpaA1) initiates 1NA glutamylation, and this enzyme exhibits a broad substrate selectivity toward a variety of anilines and naphthylamine derivatives. Structural analysis revealed that the aromatic residues in the 1NA entry tunnel and the V201 site in the large substrate-binding pocket significantly influence NpaA1’s substrate preferences. The findings enhance understanding of degrading polycyclic aromatic amines, and will also enable the application of bioremediation at naphthylamine contaminated sites.
