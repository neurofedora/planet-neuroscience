              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-894/v2?src=rss">Identification of heart rate dynamics during treadmill and cycle ergometer exercise: the role of model zeros and dead time [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The response of heart rate to changes in exercise intensity is comprised of several dynamic modes with differing magnitudes and temporal characteristics. Investigations of empirical identification of dynamic models of heart rate showed that second-order models gave substantially and significantly better model fidelity compared to the first order case. In the present work, we aimed to reanalyse data from previous studies to more closely consider the effect of including a zero and a pure delay in the model. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 22 treadmill (TM) and 54 cycle ergometer (CE) data sets from a total of 38 healthy participants. A linear, time-invariant plant model structure with up to two poles, a zero and a dead time is considered. Empirical estimation of the free parameters was performed using least-squares optimisation. The primary outcome measure is model fit, which is a normalised root-mean-square model error. Results A model comprising parallel connection of two first-order transfer functions, one with a dead time and one without, was found to give the highest fit (56.7 % for TM, 54.3 % for CE), whereby the non-delayed component appeared to merely capture initial transients in the data and the part with dead time likely represented the true dynamic response of heart rate to the excitation. In comparison, a simple first-order model without dead time gave substantially lower fit than the parallel model (50.2 % for TM, 47.9 % for CE). Conclusions This preliminary analysis points to a linear first-order system with dead time as being an appropriate model for heart rate response to exercise using treadmill and cycle ergometer modalities. In order to avoid biased estimates, it is vitally important that, prior to parameter estimation and validation, careful attention is paid to data preprocessing in order to eliminate transients and trends.

                Background We analysed the prevalence of depression under among pregnant women both in the immigrant and native populations in a Health Region of Spain, and evaluated the maternal factors associated with it. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study in pregnant women in the Health Region of Lleida between 2012 and 2018. We analysed the following variables: age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, country of origin, and antidepressant drug prescribed. We performed a multivariate analysis and obtained the linear regression coefficients and their 95% confidence interval (CI). Results In a sample of 17177 pregnant women, 2.5% had a diagnosis of depression. The patients with depression had an average age of 32 years (SD 5.56) compared to the rest of the women who had an average age of 30 (SD 5.85) years of age. Obesity was present in 17.7% of patients with depression compared to 14.3% in the rest. A high percentage of women from Western Europe presented depression (2.9%); followed by women from Latin America (2.6%) and Eastern Europe (2.3%). The values for Africa, (0.8%) and Asia and the Middle East (0.5%) were significantly lower. We did not observe any relationship between depression and hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Conclusions In our study, we found a prevalence of depression similar to the one found in other publications. As main risk factors, we identified age, weight, and geographical origin.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1312/v1?src=rss">The emergence of green finance a conceptual framework for environmental sustainability: innovation viewpoint [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study This study intends to contribute to the continuing discussion about green economic growth by objectively investigating the consequences of clean energy generation, cutting-edge green practices, and ethical business on global sustainability. This study also examines how green finance laws effectively handle the financial limitations that companies face when pursuing green innovation. Green finance enables the development and implementation of sustainable business models, investments, trade, economic, environmental, and social projects through the effective utilization of financial resources. Methods This article offers a complete evaluation of the current state and advancements in green finance research using a mixed-methods approach, which includes bibliometric and qualitative analysis. We analysed a big dataset of research papers after entering the keywords into the Scopus database. Results This study found that green bank products include green securities, investments, climate financing, carbon finance, insurance, credit, and infrastructure bonds. Sustainability, sustainable development, investments, environmental economics, sustainable finance, green bonds, and the green economy dominate as a most prevalent theme. China has the strongest bibliometric linkages to other nations, followed by the US and UK. This study also examines whether green finance policies address firm financial restrictions while pursuing green innovation. VOS-viewer generates co-authorship-based keyword occurrence links and network maps. Conclusion Green finance strives to increase funding flows to sustainable development goals while mitigating environmental and social hazards. “Going green,” pricing, forecasting, modelling, picking the most efficient tool, and influencing investor behaviour toward environmentally friendly operations are all challenges. Environmental policies, interest rates, religion, risks, social inclusion, and banking laws all have an impact on bank green financing initiatives. The study’s main contribution is an overview of green finance breakthroughs for sustainability, which may help scholars and practitioners understand the trend and future research directions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1311/v1?src=rss">Global trends in research of Work-related musculoskeletal disorders among surgeons: Bibliometric analysis and visualization from 1991 to 2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Surgeons are highly exposed to Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Assessing the prevalence of these disorders, both overall and by body area, has become a focus of interest, and numerous articles have been published on the subject. Methods Journal articles and reviews focused on WMSDs published until today and referenced in PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, Science.gov, Mendeley and Google Scholar were analysed. VOSviewer version 1.6.20 and Microsoft Excel were used to perform a bibliometric and visualization analyses. Overall distribution of publications by year, sources with country and related indicators, research areas, authors with their affiliations, references and keywords were studied. Results Of the total 2338 items identified, 184 articles (174 articles and 10 reviews) published between 1991 and 2024 were included. Results showed an increase in the number of publications over the years, with a significant increase from 2016 onwards (R2 = 0.8693). The United States is the leader in the field, with 89 publications (37.6%) and 2,631 citations. Hallbeck MS (USA) is the most prolific author (11 publications and 601 citations). World Neurosurgery and Work were the journals with the highest number of publications (n=7). Applied ergonomics has the highest number of citations. Medicine is the research area most present. Epstein’s work has the most citations worldwide, while Park et al’s work is the most cited of the 184 studies considered. “Ergonomics”, “musculoskeletal disorders”, “surgeons”, and “work-related musculoskeletal disorders” are the keywords most used by authors. Their use increased significantly since 2016, with an average year of publication around 2020. Conclusions The study of WMSDs in surgeons is a young research topic that is evolving significantly. North America, Europe and Asia have been the main contributors, with the USA in the lead. Subjective prevalence analysis based on questionnaires and ergonomic assessment using quantitative tools are the two main lines of research.

                Cortical activity is constantly fluctuating between distinct spatiotemporal activity patterns denoted by changes in brain state. States of cortical desynchronization arise during motor generation, increased attention, and high cognitive load. Synchronized brain states comprise spatially widespread, coordinated low-frequency neural activity during rest and sleep when disengaged from the external environment or ‘offline’. The claustrum is a small subcortical structure with dense reciprocal connections with the cortex suggesting modulation by, or participation in, brain state regulation. Here, we highlight recent work suggesting that neural activity in the claustrum supports cognitive processes associated with synchronized brain states characterized by increased low-frequency network activity. As an example, we outline how claustrum activity could support episodic memory consolidation during sleep.

                piRNAs protect germline genomes by repressing transposons. Daedalus and Gasz bind to each other and form a mitochondrial scaffold for Armitage, a factor required for endonuclease Zucchini-dependent piRNA maturation. Their roles are distinct: Daedalus interacts with Armitage, while Gasz supports Daedalus. Daedalus binds to Armitage through an extended coiled-coil domain, which tethers it to mitochondria, and a SAM domain, which controls piRNA length. Without the Daedalus SAM domain, piRNAs cannot fully silence transposons. Daedalus is Dipteran specific, unlike other species, where exonucleases regulate piRNA length.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98096">FGF8-mediated gene regulation affects regional identity in human cerebral organoids</a></h4>

              
                The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses <i>via</i> modulation of early target genes. The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development. We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an <i>in vitro </i>platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic domains, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92914">A scenario for an evolutionary selection of ageing</a></h4>

              
                Signs of ageing become apparent only late in life, after organismal development is finalized. Ageing, most notably, decreases an individual’s fitness. As such, it is most commonly perceived as a non-adaptive force of evolution and considered a by-product of natural selection. Building upon the evolutionarily conserved age-related Smurf phenotype, we propose a simple mathematical life-history trait model in which an organism is characterized by two core abilities: reproduction and homeostasis. Through the simulation of this model, we observe (1) the convergence of fertility’s end with the onset of senescence, (2) the relative success of ageing populations, as compared to non-ageing populations, and (3) the enhanced evolvability (i.e. the generation of genetic variability) of ageing populations. In addition, we formally demonstrate the mathematical convergence observed in (1). We thus theorize that mechanisms that link the timing of fertility and ageing have been selected and fixed over evolutionary history, which, in turn, explains why ageing populations are more evolvable and therefore more successful. Broadly speaking, our work suggests that ageing is an adaptive force of evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99643">Conservation of the cooling agent binding pocket within the TRPM subfamily</a></h4>

              
                Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a large and diverse family of tetrameric cation-selective channels that are activated by many different types of stimuli, including noxious heat or cold, organic ligands such as vanilloids or cooling agents, or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Structures available for all subtypes of TRP channels reveal that the transmembrane domains are closely related despite their unique sensitivity to activating stimuli. Here, we use computational and electrophysiological approaches to explore the conservation of the cooling agent binding pocket identified within the S1–S4 domain of the Melastatin subfamily member TRPM8, the mammalian sensor of noxious cold, with other TRPM channel subtypes. We find that a subset of TRPM channels, including TRPM2, TRPM4, and TRPM5, contain pockets very similar to the cooling agent binding pocket in TRPM8. We then show how the cooling agent icilin modulates activation of mouse TRPM4 to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, enhancing the sensitivity of the channel to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diminishing outward-rectification to promote opening at negative voltages. Mutations known to promote or diminish activation of TRPM8 by cooling agents similarly alter activation of TRPM4 by icilin, suggesting that icilin binds to the cooling agent binding pocket to promote opening of the channel. These findings demonstrate that TRPM4 and TRPM8 channels share related ligand binding pockets that are allosterically coupled to opening of the pore.

                Interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons are critical to computations in cortical circuits but their organization is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological approaches. Within the medial entorhinal cortex, representation of location by grid and other spatial cells involves circuits in layer 2 in which excitatory stellate cells interact with each other via inhibitory parvalbumin expressing interneurons. Whether this connectivity is structured to support local circuit computations is unclear. Here, we introduce strategies to address the functional organization of excitatory-inhibitory interactions using crossed Cre- and Flp-driver mouse lines to direct targeted presynaptic optogenetic activation and postsynaptic cell identification. We then use simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from postsynaptic neurons to assess their shared input from optically activated presynaptic populations. We find that extensive axonal projections support spatially organized connectivity between stellate cells and parvalbumin interneurons, such that direct connections are often, but not always, shared by nearby neurons, whereas multisynaptic interactions coordinate inputs to neurons with greater spatial separation. We suggest that direct excitatory-inhibitory synaptic interactions may operate at the scale of grid cell clusters, with local modules defined by excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, while indirect interactions may coordinate activity at the scale of grid cell modules.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103035">Distinct functions of three Wnt proteins control mirror-symmetric organogenesis in the C. elegans gonad</a></h4>

              
                Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs; Z1 and Z4). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins (CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1(RNAi) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94811">Human DCP1 is crucial for mRNA decapping and possesses paralog-specific gene regulating functions</a></h4>

              
                The mRNA 5'-cap structure removal by the decapping enzyme DCP2 is a critical step in gene regulation. While DCP2 is the catalytic subunit in the decapping complex, its activity is strongly enhanced by multiple factors, particularly DCP1, which is the major activator in yeast. However, the precise role of DCP1 in metazoans has yet to be fully elucidated. Moreover, in humans, the specific biological functions of the two DCP1 paralogs, DCP1a and DCP1b, remain largely unknown. To investigate the role of human DCP1, we generated cell lines that were deficient in DCP1a, DCP1b, or both to evaluate the importance of DCP1 in the decapping machinery. Our results highlight the importance of human DCP1 in decapping process and show that the EVH1 domain of DCP1 enhances the mRNA-binding affinity of DCP2. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses outline the distinct functions of DCP1a and DCP1b in human cells, regulating specific endogenous mRNA targets and biological processes. Overall, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of human DCP1 in mRNA decapping and shed light on the distinct functions of its paralogs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89572">Calcineurin inhibition enhances Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan by defecation defects-mediated calorie restriction and nuclear hormone signaling</a></h4>

              
                Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> through multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in <i>C. elegans</i>. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the <i>C. elegans</i> DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88322">Evidence for a role of human blood-borne factors in mediating age-associated changes in molecular circadian rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with a number of physiologic changes including perturbed circadian rhythms; however, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain unknown. To test the idea that circulating factors mediate age-dependent changes in peripheral rhythms, we compared the ability of human serum from young and old individuals to synchronize circadian rhythms in culture. We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25–30) and old (age 70–76) individuals at 14:00 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts. We found that young and old sera are equally competent at initiating robust ~24 hr oscillations of a luciferase reporter driven by clock gene promoter. However, cyclic gene expression is affected, such that young and old sera promote cycling of different sets of genes. Genes that lose rhythmicity with old serum entrainment are associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer’s Disease as identified by STRING and IPA analyses. Conversely, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increased in the cells entrained with old serum. Genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions. We did not observe a global difference in the distribution of phase between groups, but found that peak expression of several clock-controlled genes (<i>PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2,</i> and <i>TEF</i>) lagged in the cells synchronized ex vivo with old serum. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that age-dependent blood-borne factors affect circadian rhythms in peripheral cells and have the potential to impact health and disease via maintaining or disrupting rhythms respectively.

                Addiction is commonly characterized by escalation of drug intake, compulsive drug seeking, and continued use despite harmful consequences. However, the factors contributing to the transition from moderate drug use to these problematic patterns remain unclear, particularly regarding the role of sex. Many preclinical studies have been limited by small sample sizes, low genetic diversity, and restricted drug access, making it challenging to model significant levels of intoxication or dependence and translate findings to humans. To address these limitations, we characterized addiction-like behaviors in a large sample of &gt;500 outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats using an extended cocaine self-administration paradigm (6 hr/daily). We analyzed individual differences in escalation of intake, progressive ratio (PR) responding, continued use despite adverse consequences (contingent foot shocks), and irritability-like behavior during withdrawal. Principal component analysis showed that escalation of intake, progressive ratio responding, and continued use despite adverse consequences loaded onto a single factor that was distinct from irritability-like behaviors. Categorizing rats into resilient, mild, moderate, and severe addiction-like phenotypes showed that females exhibited higher addiction-like behaviors, with a lower proportion of resilient individuals compared to males. These findings suggest that, in genetically diverse rats with extended drug access, escalation of intake, continued use despite adverse consequences, and PR responding are highly correlated measures of a shared underlying construct. Furthermore, our results highlight sex differences in resilience to addiction-like behaviors.

                Intractable epilepsy and cognitive deficits arise from missense variants in GRIN genes encoding subunits of the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Here, we go beyond typical assessments of isolated receptors to explore the impact of a human GluN1 variant across multiple scales of native NMDAR signaling. We show that isolated and integrated NMDAR signaling are differentially affected in brain slices of transgenic mice with the heterozygous GluN1 Y647S patient variant. Loss-of-function NMDARs paradoxically prolong NMDAR-dependent dendritic integration, extending cortical network activity and increasing vulnerability for seizure-like events. We identify that loss-of-function NMDARs fail to engage canonical negative feedback via calcium-activated potassium channels that prevent NMDAR overdrive. Therefore, we test an unorthodox treatment to increase NMDAR Mg2+ block and show that oral treatment with magnesium-L-threonate significantly reduces seizure occurrence and severity in the mice. We reveal a case where higher-order functional context predicts effective treatment for seizures arising from NMDAR disruption.

">Neural synchrony is "good enough" for speech comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidence indicates that neural populations exhibit synchronous firing at phrase boundaries to facilitate the encoding of syntactic units during speech comprehension. However, good-enough processing accounts of speech comprehension suggest that detailed syntactic analysis may not always be necessary for successful interpretation, especially when listeners can deduce meaning from lexical-semantic contexts. In this brief report, we evaluate this notion and assess whether neural synchrony to syntactic boundaries is modulated by local lexical-semantic content. To this end, we reanalyzed an open-source EEG dataset, consisting of brain recordings obtained while participants passively listened to an audiobook. To determine neural synchrony to phrase boundaries, we computed mutual information (MI) between delta band EEG activity (< 3Hz) and hierarchically derived syntactic structures for each sentence in the audiobook. We then quantified local-lexical semantic contexts using semantic dissimilarity values that were derived from high-dimensional vectors of co-occurrence. We then regressed MI values for each sentence against the sentence's semantic dissimilarity values, using linear mixed-effects models. Results indicated that neural synchrony to phrase boundaries showed a positive linear relationship with semantic dissimilarity. We interpret this finding as evidence that listeners' reliance on syntactic information during speech comprehension is modulated by local lexical-semantic contexts, consistent with good-enough processing accounts.

                Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in permanent loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, with limited therapeutic options to recover the loss. Low-frequency electric fields with changing polarity have shown promise in promoting axon regeneration and improving outcomes. However, the metal electrodes used previously were prone to corrosion, and their epidural placement limited the penetration of the electric field into the spinal cord. Here, we demonstrate that a thin-film implant with supercapacitive electrodes placed under the dura mater can safely and effectively deliver electric field treatment in rats with thoracic SCI. Subdural stimulation enhanced hind limb function and touch sensitivity compared to controls, without inducing a neuroinflammatory response in the spinal cord. While axon density around the lesion site remained unchanged after 12 weeks, in vivo monitoring and electrochemical testing of electrodes indicated that treatment was administered throughout the study. These results highlight the promise of electric field treatment as a viable therapeutic strategy for achieving long-term functional recovery in SCI.

">Tcf4 Deficiency Causes Recurrent Seizures in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factor 4 (TCF4) is a transcription factor that is critical for the normal development and function of the central nervous system. Haploinsufficiency of TCF4 causes Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS), a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by seizures and intellectual disability. To expand our currently limited understanding of TCF4 function and PTHS pathophysiology, we created a mouse model of PTHS with largely astrocyte-specific heterozygous knockout of Tcf4. These mice developed severe recurrent seizures and had decreased lifespans. In addition, we found that these mice had astrogliosis as well as increased neuronal activity in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Furthermore, single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis revealed global changes in the gene expression profiles of excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes of PTHS compared to wild-type mice. Overall, this is the first report of a PTHS mouse model with seizures, providing the field with a tool to investigate the mechanisms of PTHS development and progression and develop therapeutics for PTHS and its associated epilepsy.

">The presynaptic vesicle cluster transitions from a compact to loose organization during long-term potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Functional and structural elements of synaptic plasticity are tightly coupled, as has been extensively shown for dendritic spines. Here, we interrogated structural features of presynaptic terminals in 3DEM reconstructions from CA1 hippocampal axons that had undergone control stimulation or theta-burst stimulation (TBS) to produce long-term potentiation (LTP). We reveal that after LTP induction, the synaptic vesicle (SV) cluster is less dense, and SVs are more dispersed. The distances between neighboring SVs are greater in less dense terminals and have more SV-associated volume. We characterized the changes to the SV cluster by measuring distances between neighboring SVs, distances to the active zone, and the dispersion of the SV cluster. Furthermore, we compared the distribution of SVs with randomized ones and provided evidence that SVs gained mobility after LTP induction. With a computational model, we can predict the increment of the diffusion coefficient of the SVs in the cluster. Moreover, using a machine learning approach, we identify presynaptic terminals that were potentiated after LTP induction. Lastly, we show that the local SV density is a volume-independent property under strong regulation. Altogether, these results provide evidence that the SV cluster is undergoing a transition during LTP.

">Lateralized nodose ganglia gene expression implicates cholecystokinin receptors in interoceptive reward signaling</a></h4>

              
                The vagus nerves are important carriers of sensory information from the viscera to the central nervous system. Emerging evidence suggests that sensory signaling through the right, but not the left, vagus nerve evokes striatal dopamine release and reinforces appetitive behaviors. However, the extent to which differential gene expression within vagal sensory neurons contributes to this asymmetric reward-related signaling remains unknown. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the left and right nodose ganglia (NG) to identify candidate genes likely to contribute to vagus-mediated reward signaling. We find that a group of neurons expressing Chrna3 (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit 3) and Cckar (cholecystokinin A receptor) is preferentially expressed in the right NG of both rats and mice. This result suggests that differential expression of gut-innervating nutrient sensors in NG neurons may contribute to asymmetric encoding of interoceptive rewards by the vagus nerves.

">Bias-accounting meta-analyses overcome cerebellar neglect to refine the cerebellar behavioral topography</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum plays important roles in motor, cognitive, and emotional behaviors. Previous cerebellar coordinate-based meta-analyses and mappings have attributed different behaviors to cerebellar subareas, but an accurate behavioral topography is lacking. Here, we show overrepresentation of superior activation foci, which may be exacerbated by historical cerebellar neglect. Unequal foci distributions render the null hypothesis of standard activation likelihood estimation unsuitable. Our new method, cerebellum-specific activation-likelihood estimation (C-SALE), finds behavioral convergence beyond baseline activation rates. It does this by testing experimental foci versus null models sampled from a data-driven, biased probability distribution of finding foci at any cerebellar location. Cerebellar mappings were made across five BrainMap task domains and thirty-five subdomains, illustrating improved specificity of the new method. Twelve of forty (sub)domains reached convergence in specific cerebellar subregions, supporting dual motor representations and placing cognition in posterior-lateral regions. Repeated subsampling revealed that whereas action, language and working memory were relatively stable, other behaviors produced unstable meta-analytic maps. Lastly, meta-analytic connectivity modeling in the same debiased framework was used to reveal coactivation networks of cerebellar behavioral clusters. In sum, we created a new method for cerebellar meta-analysis that accounts for data biases and can be flexibly adapted to any part of the brain. Our findings provide a refined understanding of cerebellar involvement in human behaviors, highlighting regions for future investigation in both basic and clinical applications.

">Electroconvulsive therapy generates a hidden wave after seizure</a></h4>

              
                Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a fast-acting, highly effective, and safe treatment for medication-resistant depression. Historically, the clinical benefits of ECT have been attributed to generating a controlled seizure; however, the underlying neurobiology is understudied and remains largely unresolved. Using optical neuroimaging to probe neural activity and hemodynamics in a mouse model of ECT, we demonstrated that a second brain event follows seizure: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). We further found that ECT stimulation pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD. To translate these findings to human patients, we tested for the presence of hemodynamic signatures of post-ictal CSD using non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments. We found evidence that humans generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD. These results challenge a long-held assumption that seizure is the primary outcome of ECT and point to new opportunities for optimizing ECT stimulation parameters to precisely modulate brain activity and treatment outcomes.

">Speech in noise performance in adults with cochlear implants using a combined channel deactivation strategy with a variable number of dynamic focused channels</a></h4>

              
                Objectives and Methods: Cochlear implant listeners show difficulties in understanding speech in noise. Channel interactions from activating overlapping neural populations reduce the signal accuracy necessary to interpret complex signals. Optimizing programming strategies based on focused detection thresholds to reduce channel interactions has led to improved performance. In the current study, two previously suggested methods, channel deactivation and focused dynamic tripolar stimulation, were combined to create three cochlear implant programs. Utilizing an automatic channel selection algorithm from focused detection threshold profiles, three programs were created with the same deactivated channels but varying proportions of channels employing focused stimulation, monopolar, dynamic focused and a mixed program. Thirteen ears in eleven adult cochlear implant listeners with Advanced Bionics HiRes90k devices were tested. Vowel identification and sentence perception in quiet and noise served as outcome measures, and the influences of listening experience, age, clinical consonant-nucleus-consonant performance, and perceptual thresholds on speech performance were assessed. Results: Across subjects, different degrees of focusing showed individual performance improvements for vowels and sentences over the monopolar program. However, only slight trends and no significant group improvements were observed. Focused listening benefits were shown for individuals with less cochlear implant experience, and clinically poor performers seem to benefit more from focusing than good performers. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that deactivating and focusing subsets of channels improves speech performance for some individuals, especially poor performers, a possible effect of reduced channel interactions. The findings also show that individual performance is largely variable, possibly due to listening experience, age, or the underlying detection threshold.

                Background: The goals of this study were to 1) validate the MISSING (Mapping Intrinsic Sex Similarities as an Integral quality of Normalized Groups) model for psychostimulant self-administration (SA), and 2) utilize it to explain the inconsistencies in the observation of sex differences in psychostimulant SA. Methods: We allowed male and female Long Evans rats (n = 40) to self-administer methamphetamine METH dose 0.1 mg/kg (male n = 9, female n = 18) and saline (male n = 3, female n = 10) via the intravenous route, FR1 schedule, 6 h per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks. For the MISSING model, we identified behavioral clusters of males and females using normal mixtures clustering analysis of baseline intake, total intake and total intake normalized-to-baseline intake (NBI), followed by unpaired t-tests to compare clusters and Two-way ANOVA to determine if there were any SEX by cluster interactions. For the current model, we grouped our subjects according to biological sex and compared the above variables using unpaired t-tests. For both models, we employed Two-way repeated measures ANOVA and linear regression analysis to analyze SA time course. Results: For saline and METH SA, there were no sex differences when we compared males and females generally, with sex differences evident only when we compared sexes from distinct clusters. The current model could not explain the inconsistencies in the observability of sex differences in METH SA. Conclusions: We validated the MISSING model -it can explain the inconsistencies around sex differences in METH SA.

">From the fly connectome to exact ring attractor dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A cognitive compass enabling spatial navigation requires neural representation of heading direction (HD), yet the neural circuit architecture enabling this representation remains unclear. While various network models have been proposed to explain HD systems, these models rely on simplified circuit architectures that are incompatible with empirical observations from connectomes. Here we construct a novel network model for the fruit fly HD system that satisfies both connectome-derived architectural constraints and the functional requirement of continuous heading representation. We characterize an ensemble of continuous attractor networks where compass neurons providing local mutual excitation are coupled to inhibitory neurons. We discover a new mechanism where continuous heading representation emerges from combining symmetric and anti-symmetric activity patterns. Our analysis reveals three distinct realizations of these networks that all match observed compass neuron activity but differ in their predictions for inhibitory neuron activation patterns. Further, we found that deviations from these realizations can be compensated by cell-type-specific rescaling of synaptic weights, which could be potentially achieved through neuromodulation. This framework can be extended to incorporate the complete fly central complex connectome and could reveal principles of neural circuits representing other continuous quantities, such as spatial location, across insects and vertebrates.

">Mitochondrial Stress Disassembles Nuclear Architecture through Proteolytic Activation of PKCδ and Lamin B1 Phosphorylation in Neuronal Cells: Implications for Pathogenesis of Age-related Neurodegenerative Diseases</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are hallmarks of pathophysiological processes in age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. Neuronal cells are highly vulnerable to mitochondrial stress, however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced vulnerability are not well understood. Previously, we demonstrated that the novel PKC isoform PKC{delta} is highly expressed in dopamin(DA)ergic neurons and plays a key role in inducing apoptotic cell death during neurotoxic stress via caspase-3-mediated proteolytic activation. Herein, we further uncovered a key downstream molecular event of PKC{delta} signaling following mitochondrial dysfunction that governs neuronal cell death by dissembling nuclear architecture. Exposing N27 DAergic cell line to the mitochondrial complex-1 inhibitor tebufenpyrad induced PKC{delta}phosphorylation at the T505 activation loop accompanied by caspase-3-dependent proteolytic activation of the kinase. Subcellular analysis using high-resolution 3D confocal microscopy revealed that proteolytically activated cleaved PKC{delta} translocates to the nuclear compartment, colocalizing with Lamin B1. Electron microscopy also enabled the visualization of nuclear membrane damage triggered by subjecting the DAergic neuronal cells by Tebufenpyrad (Tebu) toxicity. In silico analyses identified that the threonine site on Lamin B1 (T575) is likely phosphorylated by PKC{delta} suggesting that Lamin B1 serves as a key downstream target of the kinase. Interestingly, N27 DAergic cells stably expressing the PKC{delta} proteolytic cleavage site-resistant mutant failed to induce nuclear damage, PKC{delta} activation, and Lamin B1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-based stable knockdown of PKC{delta} greatly attenuated Tebu-induced Lamin B1 phosphorylation. Also, studies using Lamin B1T575G mutated at phosphorylation and PKC{delta}-{Delta}NLS-overexpressing N27 cells showed that PKC{delta} activation and translocation to the nuclear membrane are critically required for phosphorylating Lamin B1 at T575 to induce nuclear membrane damage during Tebu insult. Additionally, Tebu failed to induce Lamin B1 damage and Lamin B1 phosphorylation in organotypic midbrain slices cultured from PKC{delta}-/- mouse pups. More importantly, we observed higher PKC{delta} activation, Lamin B1 phosphorylation and Lamin B1 loss in nigral DAergic neurons from the postmortem brains of PD patients as compared to age-matched healthy control brains, thus providing translational relevance of our finding. Collectively, our data reveal that PKC{delta} functions as a Lamin B1 kinase to disassemble the nuclear membrane during the neuronal cell death process triggered by mitochondrial stress. This mechanistic insight may have important implications for the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction as well as for the development of novel treatment strategies.

">Astrocytes control UP state and slow oscillation periodicity in human cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are well known for homeostatic roles in energy maintenance, neurotransmitter recovery and immunoreactivity, however their contributing role in active modulation of neuronal activity remains controversial. Recent evidence highlights astrocytes as a potential signalling partner in ongoing high-order neuronal activity, and a modulator of baseline activity. Here we utilise an iPSC-derived in vitro cortical network model to describe a slow-wave oscillation and examine the contributions of astrocytes to development of this oscillatory activity, dependant upon generation of UP/DOWN state phenomena. To examine the role of astrocytes we invoke an acetylcholinergic oscillation in the neuronal population by addition of carbachol, which proved to be a robust mechanism for eliciting prolonged and synchronised network bursting. Pharmalogical interrogation determined oscillatory maintenance was dependent on both glutamatergic and purinergic signalling pathways. Upon further interrogation, we determined that astrocytic calcium signalling was essential to timing of the oscillatory signal. By utilising chemogenetic actuators we showed that whilst neurons are essential and sufficient for instigating the oscillatory signal, astrocytes played a key role in timing. This previously unreported mechanism may contribute to initial development of brain activity, and may underlie a basal activity present later during adulthood. In collaboration with recent results highlighting the role of active gliotransmission, this highlights astrocytes as an important research target for understanding brain activity alterations during development and disease.

">Functional diversity in the output of the primate retina</a></h4>

              
                The visual image transmitted by the retina to the brain has long been understood in terms of spatial filtering by the center-surround receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Recently, this textbook view has been challenged by the stunning functional diversity and specificity observed in ~40 distinct RGC types in the mouse retina. However, it is unclear whether the ~20 morphologically and molecularly identified RGC types in primates exhibit similar functional diversity, or instead exhibit center-surround organization at different spatial scales. Here, we reveal striking and surprising functional diversity in macaque and human RGC types using large-scale multi-electrode recordings from isolated macaque and human retinas. In addition to the five well-known primate RGC types, 18-27 types were distinguished by their functional properties, likely revealing several previously unknown types. Surprisingly, many of these cell types exhibited striking non-classical receptive field structure, including irregular spatial and chromatic properties not previously reported in any species. Qualitatively similar results were observed in recordings from the human retina. The receptive fields of less-understood RGC types formed uniform mosaics covering visual space, confirming their classification, and the morphological counterparts of two types were established using single-cell recording. The striking receptive field diversity was paralleled by distinctive responses to natural movies and complexity of visual computation. These findings suggest that diverse RGC types, rather than merely filtering the scene at different spatial scales, instead play specialized roles in human vision.

">Habenula-ventral tegmental area functional coupling and risk-aversion in humans</a></h4>

              
                Maladaptive responses to uncertainty, including excessive risk avoidance, are linked to a range of mental disorders. One expression of these is a pro-variance bias (PVB), wherein risk-seeking manifests in a preference for choosing options with higher variances/uncertainty. Here, using a magnitude learning task, we provide a behavioural and neural account of PVB in humans. We show that individual differences in PVB are captured by a computational model that includes asymmetric learning rates, allowing differential learning from positive prediction errors (PPEs) and negative prediction errors (NPEs). Using high-resolution 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identify distinct neural responses to PPEs and NPEs in value-sensitive regions including habenula (Hb), ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Prediction error signals in NAcc and vmPFC were boosted for high variance options. NPEs responses in NAcc were associated with a negative bias in learning rates linked to a stronger negative Hb-VTA functional coupling during NPE encoding. A mediation analysis revealed this coupling influenced NAcc responses to NPEs via an impact on learning rates. These findings implicate Hb-VTA coupling in the emergence of risk preferences during learning, with implications for psychopathology.

">Acute and early stress axis modulation in joint disease permanently reduces pain and emotional comorbidities</a></h4>

              
                Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain affects 20-30% of the population and includes sensory disturbances and emotional comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression, which reduce quality of life. We monitored a pre-clinical model of persistent joint pain for 6 months and found that sensory and functional changes were immediate while anxio-depressive comorbidities appeared from 3 months onwards. Modulating the stress axis via genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of the stress driver FKBP51 reduced both sensory and emotional symptoms, including injury-induced disruptions in sleep and activity patterns, and did not worsen joint damage. FKBP51 pharmacological blockade after the establishment of the hypersensitive state provided temporary relief while acute inhibition at disease onset, when sensory and affective responses were most severe, provided at least 6 months of pain relief and reduced or prevented late anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. RNA sequencing suggested that FKBP51 inhibition at disease onset downregulated the Naaa gene in the superficial dorsal horn, a key regulator of the transition to chronic pain, and reorganized spinal cilia. Our findings suggest that acute and early, but not late, FKBP51 targeting can offer permanent relief from chronic pain and its emotional effects, highlighting the importance for fast therapeutic intervention.

">DJ-1 mediates regulation of metabolism and immune response in Parkinsons disease astrocytes and Glioblastoma cells</a></h4>

              
                An inverse correlation for the expression of Parkinsons disease (PD)- and cancer-associated genes has been previously reported. Genes that are upregulated in cancer are frequently downregulated in PD and vice versa. PARK7, encoding DJ-1, was initially identified as an oncogene, but loss of DJ-1 causes early-onset PD. However, it remains elusive how differential DJ-1 levels contribute to opposite cell fates in cancer and PD. Here, we demonstrate specific effects of differential DJ-1 protein levels on the energy metabolism and cell growth in patient-derived cellular models of PD and glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines. Impaired energy metabolism was associated with an increased immune response upon IL-1{beta} stimulation and increased apoptosis and decreased cell growth in models of PD, whereas in GBM cells increased metabolic activity translated into a reduced immune response and increased cell growth. Furthermore, we found decreased glutathione (GSH) synthesis and therefore increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in models of DJ-1 deficiency and decreased ROS levels in GBM cell lines. Thus, the mechanism by which DJ-1 modulates these phenotypes is the same in both diseases.

">London taxi drivers leverage regional boundaries to optimise route choices and improve their navigation skill across three decades</a></h4>

              
                The world is defined by boundaries. They segment our experience of time and space, and in virtual environments have been shown to impact navigational choices. Here, we test the impact of boundaries on route choices in a real-world environment (London, UK) with a group of expert navigators: licensed London taxi drivers who are required to memorise the layout of over 26,000 streets to obtain their licence. After presenting photographs of a start location and a goal location, taxi drivers were asked to either accept or reject a third target street as forming part of the direct route or not. Performance increased across the adult life-span period in this group (age: 34 to 67). Taxi drivers were faster and more accurate when the target location formed part of a street network boundary (e.g. streets on the edge of the London neighbourhood Soho). Our results are consistent with taxi drivers exploiting the graph structure of the street network to plan routes, as well as consistent with the formation of hierarchical state representations to reduce the dimensionality of the planning problem. Taken together, we show that navigational skill can improve over decades of exposure and that experts exploit regional boundaries for optimal choices, providing a scaffolding over which to form action plans.

                Alterations in NADH and NADPH metabolism are associated with aging, cancer, and Alzheimer's Disease. Using 2P-FLIM imaging of the mitochondrial NAD(P)H in live human neurons and PS19 mouse brains, we show that tau oligomers (TauO) upregulate the mitochondrial de novo NADPH synthesis through NADK2. This process controls LRP1-mediated internalization of TauO, setting a vicious cycle for further TauO internalization. Thus, mitochondrial NADK2-dependent NADPH controls a key step in TauO toxicity.

">DJ-1 deficiency in SH-SY5Y cells reveals dysregulated networks of genes and pathways involved in neuronal function and disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting between 2 - 3% of the population aged 65 and older. Although the etiology of idiopathic PD is still to be elucidated, the study of heritable forms of the disease can provide new understanding into disease mechanisms. Recessively inherited loss of function mutations in the PARK7/DJ-1 gene has been found to be causative for familial, early-onset PD. Importantly, PARK7/DJ-1 related forms of familial PD replicate common disease phenotypes seen in idiopathic PD, including degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, and Parkinsonism. In this study, we evaluate the loss of function of PARK7/DJ-1 on a human neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y. Following ablation of the PARK7/DJ-1 gene via CRISPR-Cas9, RNA sequencing and the DESEQ2 tool kit were utilized to filter differentially expressed genes between PARK7/DJ-1 knockouts and control SH-SY5Y cells. 5684 genes were identified to be significantly differentially expressed. 3 genes from each of the top 10 upregulated (ATOH8, LAYN, TLX2) and downregulated (CACNA1B, CPLX2, SV2C) gene lists were selected and confirmed via RT-PCR. Differentially expressed gene lists were run through the WebGestalt functional enrichment analysis toolkit to identify enriched gene ontology (GO) terms for biological processes, cellular components, molecular function, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways respectively. Among the top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways for upregulated genes were those related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease (p-adj [&le;] 0.05). Differentially expressed genes were run through the STRING database to predict protein-protein interactions (PPI). A highly significant PPI enrichment was observed (p < 1.0e-16). Our results indicate that loss of DJ-1 function in human neuronal cells leads to dysregulation of networks of connected genes and pathways that are implicated in neurodegenerative disease as well as neuronal function.

">Consolidation of Sequential Planning</a></h4>

              
                Thriving in changing environments requires the capacity to evaluate novel courses of action. This ability is hypothesized to depend on sequential planning via step-by-step simulations of the future, using cognitive maps or schemas of task contingencies. However, it is still unclear if, how and where in the brain such flexible planning is enacted. In parallel, it is thought that consolidation transforms memory representations over time to promote adaptive behaviour. Here, we hypothesize that consolidation strengthens cognitive maps of task contingencies used for simulation during sequential planning. To test this, we developed a novel behavioural task and a new multivariate method for analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Using choice and reaction time data we dissociated flexible sequential planning from alternative non-sequential strategies, and identified this behaviour with robust neural markers of step-by-step simulation, localized to the anterior medial temporal lobe. Retesting a week later we showed that consolidation enhanced sequential planning and strengthened markers of sequential simulation in the prefrontal cortex, consistent with systems consolidation theory. By revealing that consolidation improves future simulations for flexible planning we open up a new frontier for the investigation of the functional interactions between memory and decision-making.

">Simultaneous mesoscopic measurement and manipulation of mouse cortical activity</a></h4>

              
                Dynamics of activity across the cerebral cortex at the mesoscopic scale - coordinated fluctuations of local populations of neurons - are essential to perception and cognition and relevant to computations like sensorimotor integration and goal-directed task engagement. However, understanding direct causal links between population dynamics and behavior requires the ability to manipulate mesoscale activity and observe the effect of manipulation across multiple brain regions simultaneously. Here, we develop a novel system enabling simultaneous recording and manipulation of activity across the dorsal cortex of awake mice, compatible with large-scale electrophysiology from any region across the brain. Transgenic mice expressing the GCaMP calcium sensor are injected systemically with an adeno-associated virus driving expression of the ChrimsonR excitatory opsin. This strategy drives expression of the blue-excited calcium indicator, GCaMP, in excitatory neurons and red-excited Chrimson opsin in inhibitory neurons. We demonstrate widefield single-photon calcium imaging and simultaneous galvo-targeted laser stimulation over the entire dorsal cortical surface. The light channels of the imaging and the opsin do not interfere. We characterize the spatial and temporal resolution of the method, which is suitable for targeting specific cortical regions and specific time windows in behavioral tasks. The preparation is stable over many months and thus well-suited for long-term behavioral experiments. This technique allows for studying the effect of cortical perturbations on cortex-wide activity, on subcortical spiking activity, and on behavior, and for designing systems to control cortical activity in closed-loop.

">Brain functional connectivity, but not neuroanatomy, captures the interrelationship between sex and gender in preadolescents</a></h4>

              
                Understanding sex differences in the adolescent brain is crucial, as these differences are linked to neurological and psychiatric conditions that vary between males and females. Predicting sex from adolescent brain data may offer valuable insights into how these variations shape neurodevelopment. Recently, attention has shifted toward exploring socially-identified gender, distinct from sex assigned at birth, recognizing its additional explanatory power. This study evaluates whether resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) or cortical thickness more effectively predicts sex and sex/gender alignment (the congruence between sex and gender) and investigates their interrelationship in preadolescents. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we employed machine learning to predict both sex (assigned at birth) and sex/gender alignment from rsFC and cortical thickness. rsFC predicted sex with significantly higher accuracy (86%) than cortical thickness (75%) and combining both did not improve the rsFC model's accuracy. Brain regions most effective in predicting sex belonged to association (default mode, dorsal attention, and parietal memory) and visual (visual and medial visual) networks. The rsFC sex classifier trained on sex/gender aligned youth was significantly more effective in classifying unseen youth with sex/gender alignment than in classifying unseen youth with sex/gender unalignment. In females, the degree to which their brains' rsFC matched a sex profile (female or male), was positively associated with the degree of sex/gender alignment. Lastly, neither rsFC nor cortical thickness predicted sex/gender alignment. These findings highlight rsFC's predictive power in capturing the relationship between sex and gender and the complexity of the interplay between sex, gender, and the brain's functional connectivity and neuroanatomy.

Mutations to the SLC9A6 gene are responsible for CS, and we recently demonstrated that a mutation to the rat Slc9a6 gene causes a similar phenotype in the spontaneous shaker rat model, which exhibits cerebellar degeneration with motor dysfunction. In previous work, we used the PhP.eB-L7-Slc9a6-GFP adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to demonstrate that gene replacement in Purkinje cells reduced the shaker motor and molecular phenotype. Here, we carried out a 20-week longitudinal study evaluating the impact of Purkinje cell-specific gene replacement on ataxia and tremor. Taking advantage of the high homology between human SLC9A6 and rat Slc9a6, we tested a more clinically relevant construct, AAV9-CAG-hSLC9A6 AAV vector in the shaker rat. Administration of either of PhP.eB-L7-Slc9a6-GFP or AAV9-CAG-hSLC9A6 AAV vectors led to significant improvement in the molecular and motor phenotypes. The abundance of several disease-relevant cerebellar proteins was significantly correlated to motor performance. Finally, we found evidence that tremor and ataxia phenotypes in may arise from dissociable cerebellar mechanisms in the context of CS. These findings impact future SLC9A6-targeted gene therapy efforts for CS and strongly support gene replacement as a viable therapeutic strategy.

">Cognitive networks interactions through communication subspaces in large-scale models of the neocortex</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex-wide neural activity is organized into distinct networks of areas engaged in different cognitive processes. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of flexible network reconfiguration, we developed connectivity-constrained macaque and human whole-cortex models. In our model, within-area connectivity consists of a mixture of symmetric, asymmetric, and random motifs that give rise to stable (attractor) or transient (sequential) heterogeneous dynamics. Assuming sparse low-rank plus random inter-areal connectivity, we show that our model captures key aspects of the cognitive networks' dynamics and interactions observed experimentally. In particular, the anti-correlation between the default mode network and the dorsal attention network. Communication between networks is shaped by the alignment of long-range communication subspaces with local connectivity motifs and is switchable in a bottom-up salience-dependent routing mechanism. Furthermore, the frontoparietal multiple-demand network displays a coexistence of stable and dynamic coding, suitable for top-down cognitive control. Our work provides a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamic routing in the cortical networks during cognition.

">Differential destinations, dynamics, and functions of high- and low-order features in the feedback signal during object processing</a></h4>

              
                Brain is a hierarchical information processing system, in which the feedback signals from high-level to low-level regions are critical. The feedback signals may convey complex high-order features (e.g., category, identity) and simple low-order features (e.g., orientation, spatial frequency) to sensory cortex to interact with the feedforward information, but how these types of feedback information are represented and how they differ in facilitating visual processing is unclear. The current study used the peripheral object discrimination task, 7T fMRI, and MEG to isolate feedback from feedforward signals in human early visual cortex. The results showed that feedback signals conveyed both low-order features natively encoded in early visual cortex and high-order features generated in high-level regions, but with different spatial and temporal properties. The high-order feedback information targeted both superficial and deep layers, whereas the low-order feedback information reached only deep layers in V1. In addition, MEG results revealed that the feedback information from occipito-temporal to early visual cortex emerged around 200 ms after stimulus onset, and only the representational strength of high-order feedback information was significantly correlated with behavioral performance. These results indicate that the complex and simple components of feedback information play different roles in predictive processing mechanisms to facilitate sensory processing.

">Notch signaling blockade links transcriptome heterogeneity in quiescent neural stem cells with their reactivation routes and potential</a></h4>

              
                In the vertebrate brain, neural stem cell (NSC) quiescence is necessary for stemness maintenance. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in the zebrafish adult telencephalon, we identified different molecular clusters of quiescent NSCs, interpreted to sign different quiescence depths(1). Here, we show that these clusters, when challenged in vivo with an inhibitor of Notch signaling -a major quiescence promoting pathway-, unfold different behaviors. Notably, deeply quiescent NSCs with astrocytic features display a unique activation phenotype that combines the maintenance of astrocytic markers with the rapid upregulation of activation and neuronal commitment genes, reminiscent to murine periventricular astrocytes activating upon lesion. In contrast, an NSC cluster predicted to be in the deepest quiescence state resists Notch blockade, and we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nr2f1b mediates this resistance to activation in vivo. These results together link the molecular heterogeneity of quiescent NSCs with bona fide biological properties and their molecular regulators.

">Nanophysiology Approach Revealed Diversity in Calcium Microdomains in Zebrafish Retinal Bipolar Ribbon Synapses</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and high local calcium (Ca2+) signals are essential for triggering neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. In specialized bipolar ribbon synapses in the retina, these local Ca2+ signals control multiple processes, including the priming, docking, and translocation of vesicles on the ribbon before exocytosis and the replenishment of release-ready vesicles to the fusion sites to sustain neurotransmission. However, our knowledge about Ca2+ signals along the axis of the ribbon active zone is limited. Here, we used fast confocal quantitative dual-color ratiometric line-scan imaging of a fluorescently labeled ribbon binding peptide and Ca2+ indicators to monitor the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca2+ transients of individual ribbon active zones in zebrafish retinal rod bipolar cells. We observed that a Ca2+ transient elicited a much greater fluorescence amplitude when the Ca2+ indicator was conjugated to a ribeye-binding peptide than when using a soluble Ca2+ indicator, and the estimated Ca2+ levels at the ribbon active zone exceeded 26 M in response to a 10-millisecond stimulus, as measured by a ribbon-bound low-affinity Ca2+ indicator. Our quantitative modeling of Ca2+ diffusion and buffering is consistent with this estimate and provides a detailed view of the spatiotemporal [Ca2+] dynamics near the ribbon. Importantly, our data demonstrates that the local Ca2+ levels may vary between ribbons of different rod bipolar cells and within the same cells. The variation in local Ca2+ signals is likely due to heterogeneity in local Ca2+ channels clustered at the ribbon active zone, as serial electron microscopy provides new information about the heterogeneity in ribbon size, shape, and area of the ribbon in contact with the plasma membrane.

">Subregional activity in the dentate gyrus is amplified during elevated cognitive demands</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) is required for the detection and discrimination of novelty, context and patterns, amongst other cognitive processes. Prior work has demonstrated that there are differences in the activation of granule neurons in the supra and infrapyramidal blades of the DG during a range of hippocampal dependent tasks. Here we used an automated touch screen pattern separation task combined to temporally controlled tagging of active neurons to determine how performance in a cognitively demanding task affected patterns of neural activity in the DG. We found an increase in the blade-biased activity of suprapyramidal mature granule cells (mGCs) during the performance of a high cognitive demand segment of the task, with a further characteristic distribution of active neurons along the apex to blade, and hilar to molecular layer axes. Chemogenetic inhibition of adult-born granule cells (abDGCs) beyond a critical window of their maturation significantly impaired performance of mice when cognitive demand was high, but not when it was low. abDGC inhibition also elevated the total activity of mGCs and disturbed the patterned distribution of active mGCs even in mice that eventually succeeded in the task. Conversely chemogenetic inhibition of mGCs reduced success in the high cognitive demand portion of this task and decreased the global number of active GCs without affecting the patterned distribution of active cells. These findings demonstrate how a high cognitive demand pattern separation task preferentially activates mGCs in subregions of the DG and are consistent with an inhibitory role for abDGCs on the dentate circuit which in part governs the spatially organized patterns of activity of mGCs.

">Novel environment exposure drives temporally defined and region-specific chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Curiosity-driven interactions with novel cues in our environment represent a common behavioral trait across the animal kingdom. Exposure to a novel environment (NE) reshapes the brain by promoting structural and functional changes in multiple brain areas, including the hippocampus. This experience-dependent circuit reorganization is thought to be driven in part by changes in gene expression. While NE exposure has been shown to rapidly induce the expression of FOS and other immediate-early gene transcription factors (IEG TFs), the downstream IEG-driven genes (e.g. late response genes) that serve to mediate NE-dependent circuit remodeling, as well as the DNA regulatory elements that drive the expression of these genes, remain largely unexplored. We employed a combination of hippocampal single-nucleus multiomics and bulk RNA sequencing of the DG, CA3, and CA1 regions to characterize over time the NE-driven gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes downstream of IEG induction. We observe strong hippocampal region-specificity in excitatory neuron late-response gene programs as well as diversity in the inhibitory neuron and non-neuronal gene responses. In addition, compared to a short exposure, prolonged exposure to NE caused more robust induction of late-response genes, suggesting that sustained environmental stimulation is more effective at triggering the long-lasting molecular changes that support memory formation. Notably, chromatin-level analyses revealed thousands of cell-type-specific changes in chromatin accessibility in response to NE exposure. Coordinated analysis of both chromatin accessibility and gene expression within individual cells revealed the Fos binding site referred to as the AP-1 motif as a major predictor of neuronal cell-type-specific late-response gene expression. Together, these data provide a rich resource of hippocampal chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes in response to novel experience, a physiological stimulus that affects learning and memory.

	<p>Background: In this systematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we aimed to assess differences in the cognitive processes associated with social cognition&amp;amp;mdash;namely language, theory of mind (ToM), and executive functions (EFs)&amp;amp;mdash;between ADHD and control groups. Methods: The review included studies indexed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO up until May 2024. Eligible original peer-reviewed articles met the following criteria: they were written in English, included a clinical group with a current primary ADHD diagnosis, were empirical, included quantitative data, and utilized standardized and validated measures with adequate psychometric properties to assess social cognitive processes. Results and Discussion: A total of 1215 individuals with ADHD participated in the selected studies. Out of the 22 articles reviewed, 17 reported significant differences between ADHD and the controls across several cognitive processes related to language and EF rather than ToM. These processes included pragmatic skills, verbal and nonverbal communication, emotional prosody, interaction skills, sarcasm, paradoxical sarcasm recognition, ambiguous situations, emotion recognition, false belief, social problem solving, social behaviors, and gesture codification. We also discuss the limitations of the research and the implications of our findings. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42023474681.</p>

	<p>Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) impacts not only diagnosed individuals, but also significantly affects the quality of life of both primary and secondary caregivers. These effects are particularly pronounced when compared to caregivers of individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders. The emotional and physical demands of caring for someone with ASD can profoundly alter family dynamics and interpersonal relationships, creating challenges that require a comprehensive approach to be understood and addressed. Methods: The methodological design is a narrative review study, based on a search conducted during May, June, July, and August 2024 in the Scopus, Dialnet, and WoS databases concerning the object of study. As a result, a total of 197 articles were qualitatively analyzed. Of these, 36 articles were selected for a more detailed qualitative analysis, leading to a final sample of 14 documents. The selected studies were examined through qualitative content analysis. The inclusion criteria for this selection were as follows: empirical studies or research published in English or Spanish; open access via the Internet; categories limited to &amp;amp;ldquo;education/educational research&amp;amp;rdquo; relevant to the proposed objectives; and specific documents related to students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Results: The care of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has a significant and multifaceted impact on family life, deeply affecting the mental health of caregivers. These effects manifest in the form of chronic stress, anxiety, and interpersonal difficulties, altering family dynamics. The quality of life of caregivers varies depending on the coping strategies they employ, which are crucial for their emotional well-being. Conclusions: Understanding and optimizing these strategies is essential to mitigate the negative effects of caregiving and improving the overall well-being of families living with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research is lacking about the development of personality disorders (PDs) from adolescence to early adulthood. This study aimed to characterize the profile of high-risk adolescents compared to adolescents with full-blown PDs and adolescents with other psychiatric disorders and to identify clinical markers that constitute a risk profile. Methods: We evaluated 99 adolescents (12&amp;amp;ndash;17 years old) through DSM-5-based semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, cognitive tasks, and scales regarding functioning and disorder severity. We divided patients into three groups: 22 adolescents with full-blown personality disorder (FBPD), 57 adolescents at high risk for personality disorders (HPD), and 20 adolescents with other DSM-5 psychiatric disorders (OTH). At follow-up, 56 patients completed the assessment. Possible developmental trajectories of FBPD and HPD patients were remission (total or partial) of PD-related symptoms, stability of symptoms, or transition from HPD to FBPD. Results: FBPD adolescents had more impaired family backgrounds. At baseline, the HPD group was mainly composed of female patients, younger than the FBPD ones. Externalizing symptoms may represent prodromal symptoms of FBPD. High-risk patients who made the transition were younger than those who did not, and their mothers reported higher internalizing symptoms at baseline. None of the FBPD patients remitted. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of a PD &amp;amp;ldquo;at-risk mental state&amp;amp;rdquo; and the importance of the implementation of PD early detection and treatment in adolescents, regardless of patient age.</p>

	<p>Background: LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy is a social development protocol that uses LEGO&amp;amp;reg; activities to support the development of a wide range of interaction skills, enhancing prosocial behaviors and mitigating the challenges associated with mental health difficulties and behavioral issues commonly observed in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives: This study aimed to explore the effects of LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy on the social behavior and mental health of children with ASD, comparing stimulation mediated by expert and stimulation mediated by non-autistic peers. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Mackenzie Presbyterian University, ensuring adherence to ethical standards throughout the research process. Methods: This study involved 18 children with ASD, levels 1 or 2, with an intelligence quotient (IQ) above 70, and three typically developing peers, intelligence quotient (IQ) above 80, aged between 5 and 8 years old, of both sexes. Participants were randomized into three groups for stimulation (stimulation mediated by expert, by a non-autistic peer and control group). The measures were the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (parent and teacher versions), the Inventory of Difficulties in Executive Functions, Regulation, and Aversion to Delay&amp;amp;mdash;Child Version, the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Autistic Behavior Inventory. Results: After 14 sessions of 45 min in school settings, the participants of both groups (mediated by experts and non-autistic children) showed significant gains on social behavior. A statistically significant difference was observed between baseline sessions and probes (&amp;amp;chi;2 (5) = 25.905, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These gains were maintained in both follow-up points, 30 and 90 days after the completion of the stimulation sessions. Additionally, maladaptive behavior showed a significant decline when compared pre- and post-intervention. These improvements were sustained during follow-up assessments at 30 and 90 days. Conclusions: The results suggest that a structured intervention combined with peer-mediated stimulation may be an effective method for promoting adaptive and prosocial behaviors in children with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Elder abuse, and more specifically financial exploitation, is expected to be a major problem in modern societies as the worldwide population is getting older. Neuropsychological protocols regarding financial capacity assessment are the only available window allowing us to view the cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;emotional&amp;amp;ndash;behavioral strengths/deficits and vulnerabilities of individuals. Given the paucity of relevant research in Greece in the most vulnerable individuals such as older adults suffering from neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), this systematic review attempts to investigate whether NCDs impair financial capacity and to highlight the most important factors that can predict financial incapacity in Greek older patients and the likelihood of financial abuse. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Results: The search identified n = 21 relevant research articles. The synthesis of available evidence supports that financial incapacity is clearly demonstrated in the group of Greek older adults suffering from NCDs of different severity and etiology; thus, such changes can assist diagnosis, treatment, and care of these individuals, but the implications for elder abuse in the Greek cultural context have not been examined in detail so far. Conclusions: Given the unique source of information that neuropsychological assessments represent by revealing the importance of factors such as arithmetic cognition and relevant brain volume changes in the left angular gyrus, depressive mood, apathy, frailty, vascular risk factors, and financial illiteracy, forensic neuropsychology can play a vital role in protecting older individuals from financial abuse.</p>

	<p>Background: Our understanding of the relationship between neural activity and psychological states has advanced greatly in recent decades. But we are still unable to explain conscious experience in terms of physical processes occurring in our brains. Methods: This paper introduces a conceptual framework that may contribute to an explanation. All physical processes entail the transfer, transduction, and transformation of energy between portions of matter as work is performed in material systems. If the production of consciousness in nervous systems is a physical process, then it must entail the same. Here the nervous system, and the brain in particular, is considered as a material system that transfers, transduces, and transforms energy as it performs biophysical work. Conclusions: Evidence from neuroscience suggests that conscious experience is produced in the organic matter of nervous systems when they perform biophysical work at classical and quantum scales with a certain level of dynamic complexity or organization. An empirically grounded, falsifiable, and testable hypothesis is offered to explain how energy processing in nervous systems may produce conscious experience at a fundamental physical level.</p>

                Background This study examined the effect of thermocycling on the flexural strength properties of four CAD/CAM ceramic materials at different thicknesses. Methods Four CAD/CAM ceramics of different types: advanced lithium disilicate (ALD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) lithium disilicate (LD), and leucite reinforced (LE), and at three varying thicknesses 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were examined. After subjecting all specimens to 5000 thermomechanical cycles, flexural strength was determined using a universal testing apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for analysis. Two factorial ANOVA models assessed the association of different factors (ceramic type and thickness) with flexural strength and elastic modulus. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted means were computed. A p-value < 0.05 was designated significant. Results ZLS exhibited the highest flexural strength at 1.5 mm thickness, while LD showed the highest Young’s modulus of elasticity. The lowest flexural strength was observed in the 0.5 mm thickness group. There were notable variations in flexural strength across all ceramic materials, with the highest adjusted mean strength in the ZLS group, ALD, LD, and LE, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were noted in ceramic thickness, with 1.5 mm thickness showing the highest strength and 0.5 mm thickness the lowest. Conclusions Ceramic material thickness significantly impacts flexural strength, with 1.5 mm thickness deemed suitable for posterior restorations. Ceramic materials with zirconia fillers or matrix demonstrated higher flexural strength than other ceramics.

                Background Different usage scenarios and design guidelines were considered when planning a factory building and its ventilation system. Accordingly, it often makes sense to analyze the actual operating conditions again during subsequent operations in order to optimally adapt the air supply to the respective conditions in terms of demand-responsive ventilation. The aim is to ensure good indoor air quality and thermal comfort while significantly reducing energy consumption. Methods For this purpose, in addition to the sensors in the building management system, approximately 120 wireless sensors were installed in the occupied areas to measure the air temperature, operating temperature, humidity, and CO2. In this way the spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, humidity, and CO2 in the hall were visualized and evaluated to reduce the volume flows of the ventilation systems. The recorded data and findings were used to optimize ventilation systems by gaining a deeper understanding of indoor air flow. Results As part of the investigation, a considerable reduction in the air volume flows and thus the required energy consumption of the air handling units was achieved while maintaining the same thermal comfort. It was shown that the temperature field and indoor air quality were not negatively affected by the change in the air volume flow over a wide range. Conclusions This was made possible by the well-designed ventilation system, which achieves a low-pulse, slightly stratified indoor airflow, and a structural envelope with very good thermal insulation.

                Background Global environmental degradation is increasingly driving poor health outcomes worldwide. Healthcare systems and services are often not environmentally sustainable and compound the problem, while healthcare professionals are also recognised as key leaders in advancing sustainable healthcare. To adopt this leadership position, healthcare professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding environmental sustainability in healthcare must be established. This article reports the development and validation of a new instrument for this purpose that corresponds to the specificities of the Southern African context. Methods Questionnaire development followed a seven-stage process. Information was obtained from a 2021 study titled ‘South African Healthcare Professionals’ Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare: A Mixed-Methods Study’ to develop the instrument. Information was also sourced from the literature regarding environmental sustainability and healthcare to generate the first questionnaire with 29 items. The following stages included two rounds of expert input, separated by a pilot study with the target population to receive feedback regarding the instrument’s structure, relevance, and length. Content validity was determined through statistical analysis. Results Feedback was received from nine experts in stage two and 13 pilot-study participants in stage four and incorporated to improve the questionnaire. In stage six, the questionnaire was rated by seven experts. The content validity index of the questionnaire was calculated at two different stages, after which the indices were compared. Following a final edit, the questionnaire has 24 questionnaire items. The closing analysis calculated the scale content validity index average (S-CVI/Ave) of 0,922; this indicates that the final questionnaire has excellent content validity. Conclusion A questionnaire that assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals regarding environmental sustainability in Southern Africa has been developed and validated. This questionnaire can now be used for further studies in Southern Africa.

                Background Concerns regarding academic efficiency at the postgraduate level in university programs require attention from those responsible for making university administrative decisions. This study aimed to determine the terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students enrolled in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years. Methods This cross-sectional study considered all records of documents submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty in the programs offered by a dental school, published in its institutional repository between 2017 and 2023. The study variable was terminal efficiency (TE), considered both as a quantitative and qualitative variable. Additionally, some covariates were included, such as the year of formal document submission, the mode of document preparation, the second professional specialty in dentistry, and sex. Descriptive analysis was conducted to obtain absolute and relative frequencies. Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results From the evaluation of TE between 2017 and 2023, it was observed that 72.09% (n=186) of students with a document submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty and published in the repository had a TE categorized of “Up to 1 year”. Likewise, the mean TE was 0.95 years (SD=1.25), with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) between medians when evaluated based on the year of formal document submission and the dental specialty program. Conclusion The mean terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years was 0.95 years.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                Background The discoveries of Mulatu’s numbers, better known as Mulatu’s sequence, represent revolutionary contributions to the mathematical world. His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, beautiful and incredible patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. GNU Octave (version 9, (1)) software was applied to verify the existence, classify, and conduct computational investigations of findings prior to formal proofs. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these fascinating numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers also give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties. Furthermore, these findings play a vital role in the boarder context of mathematical sequences, contributing significantly to the field.

Wild populations are increasingly threatened by human-mediated climate change and land use changes. As populations decline, the probability of inbreeding increases, along with the potential for negative effects on individual fitness. Detecting and characterizing runs of homozygosity (ROHs) is a popular strategy for assessing the extent of individual inbreeding present in a population and can also shed light on the genetic mechanisms contributing to inbreeding depression. Here, we analyze simulated and empirical datasets to demonstrate the downstream effects of program selection and long-term demographic history on ROH inference, leading to context-dependent biases in the results. Through a sensitivity analysis we evaluate how various parameter values impact on ROH-calling results, highlighting its utility as a tool for parameter exploration. Our results indicate that ROH inferences are sensitive to factors such as sequencing depth and ROH length distribution, and with bias direction and magnitude varying with demographic history and the programs used. Estimation biases are particularly pronounced at lower sequencing depths, potentially leading to either underestimation or overestimation of inbreeding. These results are particularly important for the management of endangered species, as underestimating inbreeding signals in the genome can substantially undermine conservation initiatives. We also found that small true ROHs can be incorrectly lumped together and called as longer ROHs, leading to erroneous inference of recent inbreeding. To address these challenges, we suggest using a combination of ROH detection tools and ROH length-specific inferences, along with sensitivity analysis, to generate robust and context-appropriate population inferences regarding inbreeding history. We outline these recommendations for ROH estimation at multiple levels of sequencing effort, which are typical of conservation genomics studies.

                <p>by Lingxia Qiao, Michael Getz, Ben Gross, Brian Tenner, Jin Zhang, Padmini Rangamani</p>

The nanoscale organization of enzymes associated with the dynamics of second messengers is critical for ensuring compartmentation and localization of signaling molecules in cells. Specifically, the spatiotemporal orchestration of cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations is critical for many cellular functions. Previous experimental studies have shown that the formation of nanodomains of A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP150) and adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) on the surface of pancreatic MIN6 β cells modulates the phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP oscillations from out-of-phase to in-phase. In this work, we develop computational models of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP pathway and AKAP/AC nanodomain formation that give rise to the two important predictions: instead of an arbitrary phase difference, the out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation reaches Ca<sup>2+</sup> trough and cAMP peak simultaneously, which is defined as inversely out-of-phase; the in-phase and inversely out-of-phase oscillations associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP dynamics on and away from the nanodomains can be explained by an incoherent feedforward loop. Factors such as cellular surface-to-volume ratio, compartment size, and distance between nanodomains do not affect the existence of in-phase or inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation, but cellular surface-to-volume ratio and compartment size can affect the time delay for the inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation while the distance between two nanodomains does not. Finally, we predict that both the Turing pattern-generated nanodomains and experimentally measured nanodomains demonstrate the existence of in-phase and inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation when the AC8 is at a low level, consistent with the behavior of an incoherent feedforward loop. These findings unveil the key circuit motif that governs cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and advance our understanding of how nanodomains can lead to spatial compartmentation of second messengers.

                <p>by Emmanouil Giannakakis, Oleg Vinogradov, Victor Buendía, Anna Levina</p>

Cortical neurons are versatile and efficient coding units that develop strong preferences for specific stimulus characteristics. The sharpness of tuning and coding efficiency is hypothesized to be controlled by delicately balanced excitation and inhibition. These observations suggest a need for detailed co-tuning of excitatory and inhibitory populations. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that a combination of plasticity rules can lead to the emergence of excitation/inhibition (E/I) co-tuning in neurons driven by independent, low-noise signals. However, cortical signals are typically noisy and originate from highly recurrent networks, generating correlations in the inputs. This raises questions about the ability of plasticity mechanisms to self-organize co-tuned connectivity in neurons receiving noisy, correlated inputs. Here, we study the emergence of input selectivity and weight co-tuning in a neuron receiving input from a recurrent network via plastic feedforward connections. We demonstrate that while strong noise levels destroy the emergence of co-tuning in the readout neuron, introducing specific structures in the non-plastic pre-synaptic connectivity can re-establish it by generating a favourable correlation structure in the population activity. We further show that structured recurrent connectivity can impact the statistics in fully plastic recurrent networks, driving the formation of co-tuning in neurons that do not receive direct input from other areas. Our findings indicate that the network dynamics created by simple, biologically plausible structural connectivity patterns can enhance the ability of synaptic plasticity to learn input-output relationships in higher brain areas.

                <p>by Lani Fox, William C. Miller, Dionne Gesink, Irene Doherty, Marc Serre</p>

In 2008–2011 Forsyth County, North Carolina experienced a four-fold increase in syphilis rising to over 35 cases per 100,000 mirroring the 2021 state syphilis rate. Our methodology extends current models with: 1) donut geomasking to enhance resolution while protecting patient privacy; 2) a moving window uniform grid to control the modifiable area unit problem, edge effect and remove kriging islands; and 3) mitigating the “small number problem” with Uniform Model Bayesian Maximum Entropy. Data is 2008–2011 early syphilis cases reported to the NC Department of Health and Human Services for Forsyth County. Results were assessed using latent rate theory cross validation. We show combining a moving window and a UMBME analysis with geomasked data effectively predicted the true or latent syphilis rate 5% to 26% more accurate than the traditional, geopolitical boundary method. It removed kriging islands, reduced background incidence rate to 0, relocated nine outbreak hotspots to more realistic locations, and elucidated hotspot connectivity producing more realistic geographical patterns for targeted insights. Using the Forsyth outbreak as a case study showed how the outbreak emerged from endemic areas spreading through sexual core transmitters and contextualizing the outbreak to current and past outbreaks. As the dynamics of sexually transmitted infections spread have changed to online partnership selection and demographically to include more women, partnership selection continues to remain highly localized. Furthermore, it is important to present methods to increase interpretability and accuracy of visual representations of data.

Curiosity-driven exploration involves actively engaging with the environment to learn from it. Here, we hypothesize that the cognitive mechanisms underlying exploratory behavior may differ across individuals depending on personal characteristics such as autistic traits. In turn, this variability might influence successful exploration. To investigate this, we collected self- and other-reports of autistic traits from university students, and tested them in an exploration task in which participants could learn the hiding patterns of multiple characters. Participants’ prediction errors and learning progress (i.e., the decrease in prediction error) on the task were tracked with a hierarchical delta-rule model. Crucially, participants could freely decide when to disengage from a character and what to explore next. We examined whether autistic traits modulated the relation of prediction errors and learning progress with exploration. We found that participants with lower scores on other-reports of insistence-on-sameness and general autistic traits were less persistent, primarily relying on learning progress during the initial stages of exploration. Conversely, participants with higher scores were more persistent and relied on learning progress in later phases of exploration, resulting in better performance in the task. This research advances our understanding of the interplay between autistic traits and exploration drives, emphasizing the importance of individual traits in learning processes and highlighting the need for personalized learning approaches.

                <p>by Malin Ramne, Jon Sensinger</p>

Pain perception is influenced not only by sensory input from afferent neurons but also by cognitive factors such as prior expectations. It has been suggested that overly precise priors may be a key contributing factor to chronic pain states such as neuropathic pain. However, it remains an open question how overly precise priors in favor of pain might arise. Here, we first verify that a Bayesian approach can describe how statistical integration of prior expectations and sensory input results in pain phenomena such as placebo hypoalgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, chronic pain, and spontaneous neuropathic pain. Our results indicate that the value of the prior, which is determined by the internal model parameters, may be a key contributor to these phenomena. Next, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian approach to update the parameters of the internal model based on the difference between the predicted and the perceived pain, to reflect that people integrate prior experiences in their future expectations. In contrast with simpler approaches, this hierarchical model structure is able to show for placebo hypoalgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia how these phenomena can arise from prior experiences in the form of a classical conditioning procedure. We also demonstrate the phenomenon of offset analgesia, in which a disproportionally large pain decrease is obtained following a minor reduction in noxious stimulus intensity. Finally, we turn to simulations of neuropathic pain, where our hierarchical model corroborates that persistent non-neuropathic pain is a risk factor for developing neuropathic pain following denervation, and additionally offers an interesting prediction that complete absence of informative painful experiences could be a similar risk factor. Taken together, these results provide insight to how prior experiences may contribute to pain perception, in both experimental and neuropathic pain, which in turn might be informative for improving strategies of pain prevention and relief.

                <p>by Tamjid A. Chowdhury, David A. Luy, Garrett Scapellato, Dorian Farache, Amy S. Y. Lee, Christopher C. Quinn</p>

Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be a key component of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that protect against mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment. Here, we address this question through the investigation of <i>rbm-26</i>, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ortholog of the <i>RBM27</i> autism candidate gene, which encodes an RNA-binding protein whose role in neurons is unknown. We report that RBM-26 (RBM26/27) protects against axonal defects by negatively regulating expression of the MALS-1 (MALSU1) mitoribosomal assembly factor. Autism-associated missense variants in RBM-26 cause a sharp decrease in RBM-26 protein expression along with defects in axon overlap and axon degeneration that occurs during larval development. Using a biochemical screen, we identified the mRNA for the MALS-1 mitoribosomal assembly factor as a binding partner for RBM-26. Loss of RBM-26 function causes a dramatic overexpression of <i>mals-1</i> mRNA and MALS-1 protein. Moreover, genetic analysis indicates that this overexpression of MALS-1 is responsible for the mitochondrial and axon degeneration defects in <i>rbm-26</i> mutants. These observations reveal a mechanism that regulates expression of a mitoribosomal assembly factor to protect against axon degeneration during neurodevelopment.

Clearance of dying neurons by microglia is critical to healthy neurodevelopment, but what else do microglia eat? A new study in PLOS Biology demonstrates that microglia not only eat neurons but each other, and that this “microglia cannibalism” causes necroptotic cell death.

During brain development, neurons are selectively cleared by microglia to sculpt neural circuits. This primer discusses a recent study in PLOS Biology showing that microglia also clear away debris from other microglia, which is followed by microglial necroptosis.

The spinal cord is of fundamental importance for integrative processing in brain–body communication, yet routine noninvasive recordings in humans are hindered by vast methodological challenges. Here, we overcome these challenges by developing an easy-to-use electrophysiological approach based on high-density multichannel spinal recordings combined with multivariate spatial-filtering analyses. These advances enable a spatiotemporal characterization of spinal cord responses and demonstrate a sensitivity that permits assessing even single-trial responses. To furthermore enable the study of integrative processing along the neural processing hierarchy in somatosensation, we expand this approach by simultaneous peripheral, spinal, and cortical recordings and provide direct evidence that bottom-up integrative processing occurs already within the spinal cord and thus after the first synaptic relay in the central nervous system. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by providing noninvasive recordings of nociceptive spinal cord responses during heat-pain stimulation. Beyond establishing a new window on human spinal cord function at millisecond timescale, this work provides the foundation to study brain–body communication in its entirety in health and disease.

Aberrant aggregation of α-Synuclein is the pathological hallmark of a set of neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have led to the structural determination of the first synucleinopathy-derived α-Synuclein fibrils, which contain a non-proteinaceous, “mystery density” at the core of the protofilaments, hypothesized to be highly negatively charged. Guided by previous studies that demonstrated that polyphosphate (polyP), a universally conserved polyanion, significantly accelerates α-Synuclein fibril formation, we conducted blind docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments to model the polyP binding site in α-Synuclein fibrils. Here, we demonstrate that our models uniformly place polyP into the lysine-rich pocket, which coordinates the mystery density in patient-derived fibrils. Subsequent in vitro studies and experiments in cells revealed that substitution of the 2 critical lysine residues K43 and K45 with alanine residues leads to a loss of all previously reported effects of polyP binding on α-Synuclein, including stimulation of fibril formation, change in filament conformation and stability as well as alleviation of cytotoxicity. In summary, our study demonstrates that polyP fits the unknown electron density present in in vivo α-Synuclein fibrils and suggests that polyP exerts its functions by neutralizing charge repulsion between neighboring lysine residues.

This reproducibility crisis is now being met with an Open Science movement, which has risen to prominence within the scientific community and academic libraries especially. To address the need for reproducible computational research and promote Open Science within the community, members of the Open Science and Data Collaborations Program at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries organized a single-day hackathon centered around reproducibility. Partnering with a faculty researcher in English and Digital Humanities, this event allowed several students an opportunity to interact with real research outputs, test the reproducibility of data analyses with code, and offer feedback for improvements. With Python code and data shared by the researcher in an open repository, we revealed that students could successfully reproduce most of the data visualizations, but they required completing some manual setup and modifications to address depreciated libraries to successfully rerun the code. During the event, we also investigated the option of using ChatGPT to debug and troubleshoot rerunning this code. By interacting with a ChatGPT API in the code, we found and addressed the same roadblocks and successfully reproduced the same figures as the participating students. Assessing a second option, we also collaborated with the researcher to publish a compute capsule in Code Ocean. This option presented an alternative to manual setup and modifications, an accessible option for more limited devices like tablets, and a simple solution for outside researchers to modify or build on existing research code.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1304/v1?src=rss">Rethinking Food and Nutrition Security: Why Income Alone Isn’t Enough in Coffee-Producing Areas of Ethiopia. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Coffee-growing communities in Yayu, Southwestern Ethiopia, are perceived to be food secure due to income from coffee production. However, while income ensures caloric sufficiency, it does not necessarily translate into complete food security, especially in terms of nutrient intake. Our study assessed the food and nutrition security of smallholder farm households in Yayu, with a particular focus on dietary diversity and hidden hunger. We found significant gaps in nutritional intake, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and children under five. Policy and Implications Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) targets food-insecure areas based on economic status, assuming that income ensures food security. However, our findings suggest that this approach may be flawed, as households in coffee-growing regions are often labeled food secure despite significant deficiencies in essential nutrients such as heme iron. This calls for a re-evaluation of food security policies in cash-crop-dominated areas to address not only income but also access to diverse and nutrient-rich foods. Recommendations 1. Enhance Nutritional Education: Implement targeted educational programs focusing on the importance of dietary diversity, particularly in coffee-producing areas. 2. Diversify Agriculture: Encourage smallholder farmers to diversify crops, integrating nutrient-dense foods alongside coffee cultivation. 3. Improve Market Access: Strengthen local markets to ensure that nutrient-rich foods are available and affordable during both surplus and shortage seasons. 4. Revise PSNP Criteria: Use localized food and nutrition data rather than income alone to identify food insecurity in cash-crop regions. Conclusion Income from coffee production in Yayu improves caloric sufficiency but does not guarantee nutritional adequacy. To combat hidden hunger, policies must move beyond income-based indicators of food security and prioritize access to diverse, nutrient-rich foods. This will ensure a more comprehensive approach to food and nutrition security in Ethiopia’s coffee-growing regions.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27119?af=R">Cost‐Effectiveness of Endovascular Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes. These results further support adaptation of systems of care to accommodate the expansion of thrombectomy eligibility to patients with large cores and maximize EVT benefits.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses high mortality and morbidity rates with limited evidence-based therapeutic approaches. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the management of ICH.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This systematic review and meta-analysis followed recommended guidelines and protocols. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to April 12, 2024. The inclusion was restricted to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of high quality, ensuring they were not deemed to have a high risk of bias in any of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) domains. Primary outcomes were good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0–3) and mortality beyond 90 days. Secondary outcomes were early mortality within 30 days and rebleeding rates. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fourteen high-quality RCTs were included. There were 3,027 patients with ICH (1,475 randomized to MIS, and 1,452 randomized to medical management or craniotomy). Of included patients, 1,899 (62.7%) were males. MIS resulted in higher odds of achieving long-term good functional outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.25–1.82]), lower odds of long-term mortality (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90]) and lower odds of early mortality (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.95]). Rebleeding rates were similar (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.55–2.19]). The treatment effect of MIS was consistent across multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including individuals with deep ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This meta-analysis provides high-quality clinical trial evidence supporting the use of MIS as a primary treatment strategy in the management of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background During pregnancy, the placenta is an extremely important organ as it secretes its own hormones, e.g. insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), to ensure proper intrauterine fetal growth and development. Ethanol, an addictive and widely used drug, has numerous adverse effects during pregnancy, including fetal growth restriction (FGR). To date, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol triggers its toxic effects during pregnancy, particularly in the placenta, are not entirely known. For this reason, a murine model of partial IGF-1 deficiency was used to determine ethanol alterations in placental morphology and aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase (AAH) expression. Methods Wild type (WT, Igf1 +/+) and heterozygous (HZ, Igf1 +/-) female mice were given 10% ethanol in water during 14 days as an acclimation period and throughout pregnancy. WT and HZ female mice given water were used as controls. At gestational day 19, pregnant dams were sacrificed, placentas were collected and genotyped for subsequent studies. Results IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption during pregnancy altered placental morphology, and decreased placental efficiency and AAH expression in placentas from all genotypes. No differences were found in Igf1, Igf2, Igf1r and Igf2r mRNA expression in placentas from all groups. Conclusions IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption throughout gestation altered placental development, suggesting the crucial role of IGF-1 in the establishment of an adequate intrauterine environment that allows fetal growth. However, more studies are needed to study the precise mechanism to stablish the relation between both insults.

                Background Disregulation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) preformance status at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. We also observe that some glioma patients have increased prothrombin time compared to reference values. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from altered coagulation states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance, measurement, and treatment of abnormal coagulation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background People need critical thinking skills to make well-informed health choices and avoid waste and unnecessary suffering. However, educational interventions can have adverse effects, which is often overlooked. We created a framework of potential harms of interventions to improve critical thinking about health choices. The objective was to identify potential effects and articulate potential mechanisms. We intended to use the framework to inform the development and evaluation of an intervention in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Methods We created an initial framework drawing on two earlier frameworks. We surveyed external experts using Likert-scale and open-ended items, including researchers, educators, and others, in a variety of relevant fields. We emailed the survey to an international advisory network, and all other experts recommended by respondents. We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We revised the framework based on those results. To identify any effects missing from the revised framework, we individually interviewed a convenience sample of one teacher from each of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Results We received responses from 38 of 70 external experts (54%). The quantitative survey data suggested respondents agreed with the initial framework overall. However, the qualitative data led to substantial revisions. The revised framework consists of categories of adverse outcomes; outcomes within each category; sub-outcomes; individuals, groups, and populations that might experience each adverse outcome; beneficial outcomes corresponding with adverse outcomes; and potential mechanisms of adverse effects. There are six categories: decision-making harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, waste, and other harms. In the interviews with teachers, we did not identify any effects missing from the revised framework. Conclusions As far as we know, the framework is the first tool of its kind for education research. It can be improved upon and adapted.

                The mechanisms contributing to age-related deterioration of the female reproductive system are complex, however aberrant protein homeostasis is a major contributor. We elucidated exceptionally stable proteins, structures, and macromolecules that persist in mammalian ovaries and gametes across the reproductive lifespan. Ovaries exhibit localized structural and cell-type-specific enrichment of stable macromolecules in both the follicular and extrafollicular environments. Moreover, ovaries and oocytes both harbor a panel of exceptionally long-lived proteins, including cytoskeletal, mitochondrial, and oocyte-derived proteins. The exceptional persistence of these long-lived molecules suggest a critical role in lifelong maintenance and age-dependent deterioration of reproductive tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90603">Hundreds of myosin 10s are pushed to the tips of filopodia and could cause traffic jams on actin</a></h4>

              
                Myosin 10 (Myo10) is a motor protein known for its role in filopodia formation. Although Myo10-driven filopodial dynamics have been characterized, there is no information about the absolute number of Myo10 molecules during the filopodial lifecycle. To better understand molecular stoichiometries and packing restraints in filopodia, we measured Myo10 abundance in these structures. We combined SDS-PAGE densitometry with epifluorescence microscopy to quantitate HaloTag-labeled Myo10 in U2OS cells. About 6% of total intracellular Myo10 localizes to filopodia, where it enriches at opposite cellular ends. Hundreds of Myo10s are in a typical filopodium, and their distribution across filopodia is log-normal. Some filopodial tips even contain more Myo10 than accessible binding sites on the actin filament bundle. Live-cell movies reveal a dense cluster of over a hundred Myo10 molecules that initiates filopodial elongation. Hundreds of Myo10 molecules continue to accumulate during filopodial growth, but accumulation ceases when retraction begins. Rates of filopodial elongation, second-phase elongation, and retraction are inversely related to Myo10 quantities. Our estimates of Myo10 molecules in filopodia provide insight into the physics of packing Myo10, its cargo, and other filopodia-associated proteins in narrow membrane compartments. Our protocol provides a framework for future work analyzing Myo10 abundance and distribution upon perturbation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96942">Formin-like 1β phosphorylation at S1086 is necessary for secretory polarized traffic of exosomes at the immune synapse in Jurkat T lymphocytes</a></h4>

              
                We analyzed here how formin-like 1 β (FMNL1β), an actin cytoskeleton-regulatory protein, regulates microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and multivesicular bodies (MVB) polarization and exosome secretion at an immune synapse (IS) model in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. IS formation was associated with transient recruitment of FMNL1β to the IS, which was independent of protein kinase C δ (PKCδ). Simultaneous RNA interference of all FMNL1 isoforms prevented MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion, which were restored by FMNL1βWT expression. However, expression of the non-phosphorylatable mutant FMNL1βS1086A did not restore neither MTOC/MVB polarization nor exosome secretion to control levels, supporting the crucial role of S1086 phosphorylation in MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. In contrast, the phosphomimetic mutant, FMNL1βS1086D, restored MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. Conversely, FMNL1βS1086D mutant did not recover the deficient MTOC/MVB polarization occurring in PKCδ-interfered clones, indicating that S1086 FMNL1β phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. FMNL1 interference inhibited the depletion of F-actin at the central region of the immune synapse (cIS), which is necessary for MTOC/MVB polarization. FMNL1βWT and FMNL1βS1086D, but not FMNL1βS1086A expression, restored F-actin depletion at the cIS. Thus, actin cytoskeleton reorganization at the IS underlies the effects of all these FMNL1β variants on polarized secretory traffic. FMNL1 was found in the IS made by primary T lymphocytes, both in T cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-evoked synapses. Taken together, these results point out a crucial role of S1086 phosphorylation in FMNL1β activation, leading to cortical actin reorganization and subsequent control of MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87258">A Pvr–AP-1–Mmp1 signaling pathway is activated in astrocytes upon traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by external mechanical forces is a major health burden worldwide, but the underlying mechanism in glia remains largely unclear. We report herein that <i>Drosophila</i> adults exhibit a defective blood–brain barrier, elevated innate immune responses, and astrocyte swelling upon consecutive strikes with a high-impact trauma device. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of these astrocytes revealed upregulated expression of genes encoding PDGF and VEGF receptor-related (Pvr, a receptor tyrosine kinase), adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1<i>,</i> a transcription factor complex of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway) composed of Jun-related antigen (Jra) and kayak (kay), and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1) following TBI. Interestingly, Pvr is both required and sufficient for AP-1 and Mmp1 upregulation, while knockdown of AP-1 expression in the background of Pvr overexpression in astrocytes rescued Mmp1 upregulation upon TBI, indicating that Pvr acts as the upstream receptor for the downstream AP-1–Mmp1 transduction. Moreover, dynamin-associated endocytosis was found to be an important regulatory step in downregulating Pvr signaling. Our results identify a new Pvr–AP-1–Mmp1 signaling pathway in astrocytes in response to TBI, providing potential targets for developing new therapeutic strategies for TBI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95852">PUFA stabilizes a conductive state of the selectivity filter in IKs channels</a></h4>

              
                In cardiomyocytes, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs), pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels (Gmax). However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability, and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99858">Structural basis for molecular assembly of fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins in a diatom photosystem I supercomplex</a></h4>

              
                Photosynthetic organisms exhibit remarkable diversity in their light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). LHCs are associated with photosystem I (PSI), forming a PSI-LHCI supercomplex. The number of LHCI subunits, along with their protein sequences and pigment compositions, has been found to differ greatly among the PSI-LHCI structures. However, the mechanisms by which LHCIs recognize their specific binding sites within the PSI core remain unclear. In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a PSI supercomplex incorporating fucoxanthin chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>c</i>-binding proteins (FCPs), designated as PSI-FCPI, isolated from the diatom <i>Thalassiosira pseudonana</i> CCMP1335. Structural analysis of PSI-FCPI revealed five FCPI subunits associated with a PSI monomer; these subunits were identified as RedCAP, Lhcr3, Lhcq10, Lhcf10, and Lhcq8. Through structural and sequence analyses, we identified specific protein–protein interactions at the interfaces between FCPI and PSI subunits, as well as among FCPI subunits themselves. Comparative structural analyses of PSI-FCPI supercomplexes, combined with phylogenetic analysis of FCPs from <i>T. pseudonana</i> and the diatom <i>Chaetoceros gracilis</i>, underscore the evolutionary conservation of protein motifs crucial for the selective binding of individual FCPI subunits. These findings provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and selective binding of FCPIs in diatoms.

	<p>The stability&amp;amp;ndash;plasticity dilemma remains a critical challenge in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of continuous learning. This perspective paper presents a novel approach by drawing inspiration from the mammalian hippocampus&amp;amp;ndash;cortex system. We elucidate how this biological system&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to balance rapid learning with long-term memory retention can inspire novel AI architectures. Our analysis focuses on key mechanisms, including complementary learning systems and memory consolidation, with emphasis on recent discoveries about sharp-wave ripples and barrages of action potentials. We propose innovative AI designs incorporating dual learning rates, offline consolidation, and dynamic plasticity modulation. This interdisciplinary approach offers a framework for more adaptive AI systems while providing insights into biological learning. We present testable predictions and discuss potential implementations and implications of these biologically inspired principles. By bridging neuroscience and AI, our perspective aims to catalyze advancements in both fields, potentially revolutionizing AI capabilities while deepening our understanding of neural processes.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorder (SUD) significantly impacts public health, economics, and legal systems worldwide. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) was initially developed in the late 1980s as a therapeutic approach for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using bilateral stimulation to integrate traumatic memories with calming physiological responses. However, the effectiveness of EMDR in treating SUD remains unclear. This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of EMDR therapy on craving reduction in individuals with SUD. The search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Web of Science, focusing on studies that measured craving and employed EMDR interventions. Both random and fixed effects models were used to pool effect sizes, utilizing an R software meta-package (R-4.4.1). The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The results indicated a significant reduction in cravings among patients undergoing EMDR therapy. Specifically, under the fixed effect model, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was &amp;amp;minus;0.866 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from &amp;amp;minus;1.121 to &amp;amp;minus;0.611 (z = &amp;amp;minus;6.66, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). These findings may demonstrate the significant efficacy of EMDR therapy in decreasing cravings in people with SUD.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) can indicate affective states&amp;amp;mdash;including psychosocial stress&amp;amp;mdash;in mice and rats. However, stress-induced USV changes could be confounded by laboratory experimental variables such as the type of behavioral stress paradigm, the elicitation method, rodent strain, etc. We sought to provide a review of the current literature to delineate how psychosocial stress-altered rodent USVs may be affected by factors of age, sex, strain, species, elicitation paradigm, and stressor. Methods: We used PubMed, Scopus (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EBSCO), and the following Web of Science (Clarivate) databases: Biological Abstracts, CAB Abstracts, Science Citation Index-Expanded, and Emerging Sources Citation Index. The studies identified by our search strategy were independently screened by two authors with the following inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed, in English, reported original data, and described USV in response to stress in rats or mice. The data extracted included USV acoustic parameters (mean peak frequency and mean amplitude (loudness)), details of the stress and USV elicitation paradigms, rodent species, age, and sex variables. Results: The following screening of 5309 titles/abstracts and 687 full-text articles revealed 148 articles. Footshock (20%), cold exposure (14%), and maternal separation (23.5%) were the most commonly used stress paradigms (duration and type of stressor varied across studies), with the total number of USV calls being the most commonly reported acoustic outcome. In rats, 121 articles described stress-altered USVs, while 25 studies reported the same in mice, and two reported multiple rodent species (rats and mice, alongside other rodent species such as gerbils). With respect to stress-altered USV changes with age, mice and rats increase USV rates after birth, with a peak around 6 to 10 days, and decrease USVs until weanling age. Of the five studies that reported sex-related differences in stress-induced USVs, females had an increased number of calls and lower average peak frequency in response to stress when compared to males. Only two to four studies reported strain-related differences in stress-induced vocalizations in rats and mice, respectively. Conclusions: The data from this review lay the groundwork for better understanding rodent USVs in response to psychosocial stress with effects of elicitation paradigm, stressor, age, and sex.</p>

	<p>Background: When integrating visual and somatosensory processing into the subjective postural vertical using the Romberg test, patients with hemiplegic can be sorted into either post-stroke or pushers with unilateral spatial neglect (USN). This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of the integrated processing of the integrated subjective postural vertical (ISPV) with open or closed eyes in patients with hemiplegic and/or pusher with USN. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 91 patients with hemiplegic and 45 with pusher and USN. The outcomes included the ratio and sum of SPV with the eyes closed and open. Statistical analyses were performed using the parametric and/or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test, or chi-square test after the Shapiro&amp;amp;ndash;Wilk test. Results: The outcomes in the 91 patients with hemiplegic were as follows: moderate-to-severe ISPV with ratio, 1.64&amp;amp;deg;; ISPV sum (ISPVS), 9.41&amp;amp;deg;. The outcomes in the 45 patients with pusher and USN were as follows: moderate-to-severe, ISPV: 1.35&amp;amp;deg;, and ISPVS: 13.96&amp;amp;deg;. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of demographic data or ISPV. However, the number of patients with pusher syndrome was significantly higher in the ISPVS group than in stroke patients with hemiplegic. Conclusions: Adaptation occurs by integrating sensory modalities, and the pusher behavior in patients with USN is characterized by the specific pathophysiology of a two-modality disorder with visual and somatosensory deficits. This study provides key insights into the pathophysiological characteristics of patients with pusher syndrome and USN.</p>

                Background Two-wheeled vehicles are the major mode of transportation in India. Such vehicles are exposed to excessive vibration on the road when compared to four-wheeled vehicles. However, the research on the reduction of whole body vibration in the case of two-wheelers is not explored in detail. The present study predicts rider comfort in the case of an electric two-wheeler as per ISO 2631-1, by obtaining the finding the weighted acceleration at the strategic locations of vibration at the test rig. Methods An electric two-wheeler test rig is used in the study. The values of acceleration from the test rig in running conditions are obtained by using NI LabVIEW 2019. The drive cycle of the electric vehicle (EV) test rig is controlled by Sync sols’ EV lab software. Obtaining the weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration from running the test setup, it is compared with the ISO 2631-1 standard to obtain the rider comfort. Results Loading area, traction motor, base mount, and suspension were found to be the strategic points of vibration. Frequency weighted RMS acceleration of 0.3 to 0.4 m/s2 obtained at these points are prone to cause discomfort for the rider. Vehicle speed, road profile, and duration of exposure were found to be important parameters affecting the rider’s comfort. A maximum of 4.6 m/s2 amplitude was observed. The loading area, which corresponds to a rider’s seat in actual vehicle, is important and reduction of these vibrations make the ride comfortable for the rider. Suspension and base mount of the test rig are found to be uncomfortable observing the weighted RMS acceleration. Conclusions A suitable damping technique design is very much essential in reducing these vibrations and improve the rider comfort, as many more non-deterministic vibrations are prone to cause dis-comfort in case of actual on road riding conditions.

                Background The emergence of antifungal resistance in fungal pathogens highlights the need for local epidemiological data to guide empirical therapy in clinical settings. Fungal research and anti-fungal drug resistance studies are limited in developing countries; hence, there is a need for burden estimation in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the spectrum of fungal pathogens and the anti-fungal resistance profile of fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urinary tracts of prison inmates in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in which sputum and urine samples were obtained from inmates presenting with symptoms of respiratory and urogenital infections at a prison outpatient clinic. One hundred and sixty-two samples were collected and subjected to fungal investigation using standard protocols. Susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole was assessed using standard broth microdilution. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Results From the 162, 94 samples were positive for fungal pathogens, with an overall prevalence of 58%. Seventeen (18%) of the isolated fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Histoplasma. There was a statistically significant difference between fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urogenital tracts in both sexes (p<0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing against itraconazole showed 2 of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus were resistant. Conclusion Mycological agents are significant causes of respiratory and UTI infections among prison inmates, which could be attributed to prison conditions and misdiagnosis as bacterial infections. This highlights the need for specific control measures to reduce exposure to fungal infections in prisons and in the general population.

                <p>Experimental evidence showed that an increase in intracellular chloride concentration <f></f> caused by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) input can promote epileptic firing activity, but the actual mechanisms remain elusive. Here in this theoretical work, we show that influx of chloride and concomitant bicarbonate ion <f></f> efflux upon GABA receptor activation can induce epileptic firing activity by transition of GABA from inhibition to excitation. We analyzed the intrinsic property of neuron firing states as a function of <f></f>. We found that as <f></f> increases, the system exhibits a saddle&ndash;node bifurcation, above which the neuron exhibits a spectrum of intensive firing, periodic bursting interrupted by depolarization block (DB) state, and eventually a stable DB through a Hopf bifurcation. We demonstrate that only GABA stimuli together with <f></f> efflux can switch GABA's effect to excitation which leads to a series of seizure-like events (SLEs). Exposure to a low <f></f> can drive neurons with high concentrations of <f></f> downward to lower levels of <f></f>, during which it could also trigger SLEs depending on the exchange rate with the bath. Our analysis and simulation results show how the competition between GABA stimuli-induced accumulation of <f></f> and <f></f> application-induced decrease of <f></f> regulates the neuron firing activity, which helps to understand the fundamental ionic dynamics of SLE.</p>

                <p>Aggression involves both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions. How the brain implements these two types of actions is poorly understood. We found that in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, a set of neurons, which we call CL062, previously shown to mediate male aggression also mediate female aggression. These neurons elicit aggression acutely and without the presence of a target. Although the same set of actions is elicited in males and females, the overall behavior is sexually dimorphic. The CL062 neurons do not express <I>fruitless</I>, a gene required for sexual dimorphism in flies, and expressed by most other neurons important for controlling fly aggression. Connectomic analysis in a female electron microscopy dataset suggests that these neurons have limited connections with <I>fruitless</I> expressing neurons that have been shown to be important for aggression and signal to different descending neurons. Thus, CL062 is part of a monomorphic circuit for aggression that functions parallel to the known dimorphic circuits.</p>

                <p>Odor information arrives first in the main olfactory bulb and is then broadcasted to the olfactory cortices and striatum. Downstream regions have unique cellular and connectivity architectures that may generate different coding patterns to the same odors. To reveal region-specific response features, tuning and decoding of single-unit populations, we recorded responses to the same odors under the same conditions across regions, namely, the main olfactory bulb (MOB), the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the anterior piriform cortex (aPC), and the olfactory tubercle of the ventral striatum (OT), of awake male mice. We focused on chemically closely related aldehydes that still create distinct percepts. The MOB had the highest decoding accuracy for aldehydes and was the only region encoding chemical similarity. The MOB had the highest fraction of inhibited responses and narrowly tuned odor-excited responses in terms of timing and odor selectivity. Downstream, the interconnected AON and aPC differed in their response patterns to the same stimuli. While odor-excited responses dominated the AON, the aPC had a comparably high fraction of odor-inhibited responses. Both cortices share a main output target that is the MOB. This prompted us to test if the two regions convey also different net outputs. Aldehydes activated AON terminals in the MOB as a bulk signal but inhibited those from the aPC. The differential cortical projection responses generalized to complex odors. In summary, olfactory regions reveal specialized features in their encoding with AON and aPC differing in their local computations, thereby generating inverse net centrifugal and intercortical outputs.</p>

                <p>Harmonics are an integral part of music, speech, and vocalizations of animals. Since the rest of the auditory environment is primarily made up of nonharmonic sounds, the auditory system needs to perceptually separate the above two kinds of sounds. In mice, harmonics, generally with two-tone components (two-tone harmonic complexes, TTHCs), form an important component of vocal communication. Communication by pups during isolation from the mother and by adult males during courtship elicits typical behaviors in female mice&mdash;dams and adult courting females, respectively. Our study shows that the processing of TTHC is specialized in mice providing neural basis for perceptual differences between tones and TTHCs and also nonharmonic sounds. Investigation of responses in the primary auditory cortex (Au1) from in vivo extracellular recordings and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to TTHCs exhibit enhancement, suppression, or no-effect with respect to tones. Irrespective of neuron type, harmonic enhancement is maximized, and suppression is minimized when the fundamental frequencies (<I>F</I><SUB>0</SUB>) match the neuron's best fundamental frequency (BF<SUB>0</SUB>). Sex-specific processing of TTHC is evident from differences in the distributions of neurons&rsquo; best frequency (BF) and best fundamental frequency (BF<SUB>0</SUB>) in single units, differences in harmonic suppressed cases re-BF<SUB>0</SUB>, independent of neuron types, and from pairwise noise correlations among excitatory and parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons. Furthermore, TTHCs elicit a higher response compared with two-tone nonharmonics in females, but not in males. Thus, our study shows specialized neural processing of TTHCs over tones and nonharmonics, highlighting local network specialization among different neuronal types.</p>

                <p>It is well established that holding information in working memory (WM) elicits sustained stimulus-specific patterns of neural activity. Nevertheless, here we provide evidence for a distinct class of neural activity that tracks the number of individuated items in working memory, independent of the type of visual features stored. We present two EEG studies of young adults of both sexes that provide robust evidence for a signal tracking the number of individuated representations in working memory, regardless of the specific feature values stored. In Study 1, subjects maintained either colors or orientations across separate blocks in a single session. We found near-perfect generalization of the load signal between these two conditions, despite being able to simultaneously decode which feature had been voluntarily stored. In Study 2, participants attended to two features with very distinct cortical representations: color and motion coherence. We again found evidence for a neural load signal that robustly generalized across these distinct visual features, even though cortically disparate regions process color and motion coherence. Moreover, representational similarity analysis provided converging evidence for a content-independent load signal, while simultaneously showing that unique variance in EEG activity tracked the specific features that were stored. We posit that this load signal reflects a content-independent "pointer" operation that binds objects to the current context while parallel but distinct neural signals represent the features that are stored for each item in memory.</p>

                <p>In demanding listening situations, a listener's motivational state may affect their cognitive investment. Here, we aim to delineate how domain-specific sensory processing, domain-general neural alpha power, and pupil size as a proxy for cognitive investment encode influences of motivational state under demanding listening. Participants (male and female) performed an auditory gap-detection task while the pupil size and the magnetoencephalogram were simultaneously recorded. Task demand and a listener's motivational state were orthogonally manipulated through changes in gap duration and monetary-reward prospect, respectively. Whereas task difficulty impaired performance, reward prospect enhanced it. The pupil size reliably indicated the modulatory impact of an individual's motivational state. At the neural level, the motivational state did not affect auditory sensory processing directly but impacted attentional postprocessing of an auditory event as reflected in the late evoked-response field and alpha-power change. Both pregap pupil dilation and higher parietal alpha power predicted better performance at the single-trial level. The current data support a framework wherein the motivational state acts as an attentional top&ndash;down neural means of postprocessing the auditory input in challenging listening situations.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus receives a direct projection from retinal ganglion cells. In primates, it remains unknown if the same ganglion cells also supply the lateral geniculate nucleus. To address this issue, a double-label experiment was performed in two male macaques. The animals fixated a target while injection sites were scouted in the superior colliculus by recording and stimulating with a tetrode. Once suitable sites were identified, cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 488 was injected via an adjacent micropipette. In a subsequent acute experiment, cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 555 was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus at matching retinotopic locations. After a brief survival period, ganglion cells were examined in retinal flatmounts. The percentage of double-labeled cells varied locally, depending on the relative efficiency of retrograde transport by each tracer and the precision of retinotopic overlap of injection sites in each target nucleus. In counting boxes with extensive overlap, 76&ndash;98% of ganglion cells projecting to the superior colliculus were double labeled. Cells projecting to the superior colliculus constituted 4.0&ndash;6.7% of the labeled ganglion cell population. In one particularly large zone, there were 5,746 cells labeled only by CTB-AF555, 561cells double labeled by CTB-AF555 and CTB-AF488, but no cell labeled only by CTB-AF488. These data indicate that retinal input to the macaque superior colliculus arises from a collateral axonal branch supplied by ~5% of the ganglion cells that project to the lateral geniculate nucleus. Surprisingly, there exist no ganglion cells that project exclusively to the SC.</p>

                <p>Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) have been repeatedly implicated in neuropsychiatric vulnerability, in part via their roles in mediating the decision-making processes. Although two neuromodulators share a synthesis pathway and are coactivated under states of arousal, they engage in distinct circuits and modulatory roles. However, the specific role of each neuromodulator in decision-making, in particular the exploration&ndash;exploitation tradeoff, remains unclear. Revealing how each neuromodulator contributes to exploration&ndash;exploitation tradeoff is important in guiding mechanistic hypotheses emerging from computational psychiatric approaches. To understand the differences and overlaps of the roles of these two catecholamine systems in regulating exploration, a direct comparison using the same dynamic decision-making task is needed. Here, we ran male and female mice in a restless two-armed bandit task, which encourages both exploration and exploitation. We systemically administered a nonselective DA antagonist (flupenthixol), a nonselective DA agonist (apomorphine), a NE beta-receptor antagonist (propranolol), and a NE beta-receptor agonist (isoproterenol) and examined changes in exploration within subjects across sessions. We found a bidirectional modulatory effect of dopamine on exploration. Increasing dopamine activity decreased exploration and decreasing dopamine activity increased exploration. The modulatory effect of beta-noradrenergic receptor activity on exploration was mediated by sex. Reinforcement learning model parameters suggested that dopamine modulation affected exploration via decision noise and norepinephrine modulation affected exploration via sensitivity to outcome. Together, these findings suggested that the mechanisms that govern the exploration&ndash;exploitation transition are sensitive to changes in both catecholamine functions and revealed differential roles for NE and DA in mediating exploration.</p>

                <p>The capabilities of the human ear are remarkable. We can normally detect acoustic stimuli down to a threshold sound-pressure level of 0&nbsp;dB (decibels) at the entrance to the external ear, which elicits eardrum vibrations in the picometer range. From this threshold up to the onset of pain, 120&nbsp;dB, our ears can encompass sounds that differ in power by a trillionfold. The comprehension of speech and enjoyment of music result from our ability to distinguish between tones that differ in frequency by only 0.2%. All these capabilities vanish upon damage to the ear's receptors, the mechanoreceptive sensory hair cells. Each cochlea, the auditory organ of the inner ear, contains some 16,000 such cells that are frequency-tuned between ~20&nbsp;Hz (cycles per second) and 20,000&nbsp;Hz. Remarkably enough, hair cells do not simply capture sound energy: they can also exhibit an active process whereby sound signals are amplified, tuned, and scaled. This article describes the active process in detail and offers evidence that its striking features emerge from the operation of hair cells on the brink of an oscillatory instability&mdash;one example of the critical phenomena that are widespread in physics.</p>

                <p>Neuroinflammation can positively influence axon regeneration following injury in the central nervous system. Inflammation promotes the release of neurotrophic molecules and stimulates intrinsic proregenerative molecular machinery in neurons, but the detailed mechanisms driving this effect are not fully understood. We evaluated how microRNAs are regulated in retinal neurons in response to intraocular inflammation to identify their potential role in axon regeneration. We found that miR-383-5p is downregulated in retinal ganglion cells in response to zymosan-induced intraocular inflammation. MiR-383-5p downregulation in neurons is sufficient to promote axon growth in vitro, and the intravitreal injection of a miR-383-5p inhibitor into the eye promotes axon regeneration following optic nerve crush. MiR-383-5p directly targets ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor components, and miR-383-5p inhibition sensitizes adult retinal neurons to the outgrowth-promoting effects of CNTF. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that CNTF treatment is sufficient to reduce miR-383-5p levels in neurons, constituting a positive-feedback module, whereby initial CNTF treatment reduces miR-383-5p levels, which then disinhibits CNTF receptor components to sensitize neurons to the ligand. Additionally, miR-383-5p inhibition derepresses the mitochondrial antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin-3 (PRDX3) which was required for the proregenerative effects associated with miR-383-5p loss-of-function in vitro. We have thus identified a positive-feedback mechanism that facilitates neuronal CNTF sensitivity in neurons and a new molecular signaling module that promotes inflammation-induced axon regeneration.</p>

                <p>GABAergic inhibitory interneurons comprise many subtypes that differ in their molecular, anatomical, and functional properties. In mouse visual cortex, they also differ in their modulation with an animal&rsquo;s behavioral state, and this state modulation can be predicted from the first principal component (PC) of the gene expression matrix. Here, we ask whether this link between transcriptome and state-dependent processing generalizes across species. To this end, we analysed seven single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets from mouse, human, songbird, and turtle forebrains. Despite homology at the level of cell types, we found clear differences between transcriptomic PCs, with greater dissimilarities between evolutionarily distant species. These dissimilarities arise from two factors: divergence in gene expression within homologous cell types and divergence in cell-type abundance. We also compare the expression of cholinergic receptors, which are thought to causally link transcriptome and state modulation. Several cholinergic receptors predictive of state modulation in mouse interneurons are differentially expressed between species. Circuit modelling and mathematical analyses suggest conditions under which these expression differences could translate into functional differences.</p>

                <p>Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel technique for noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). TUS delivered in a theta (5&nbsp;Hz) burst pattern (tbTUS) induces plasticity in the human primary motor cortex (M1) for 30&ndash;60&nbsp;min, showing promise for therapeutic development. Metaplasticity refers to activity-dependent changes in neural functions governing synaptic plasticity; depotentiation is the reversal of long-term potentiation (LTP) by a subsequent protocol with no effect alone. Metaplasticity can enhance plasticity induction and clinical efficacy of NIBS protocols. In our study, we compared four NIBS protocol combinations to investigate metaplasticity on tbTUS in humans of either sex. We delivered four interventions: (1) sham continuous theta burst stimulation with 150 pulses (cTBS150) followed by real tbTUS (tbTUS only), (2) real cTBS150 followed by sham tbTUS (cTBS only), (3) real cTBS150 followed by real tbTUS (metaplasticity), and (4) real tbTUS followed by real cTBS150 (depotentiation). We measured motor-evoked potential amplitude, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-interval intracortical facilitation before and up to 90&nbsp;min after plasticity intervention. Plasticity effects lasted at least 60&nbsp;min longer when tbTUS was primed with cTBS150 compared with tbTUS alone. Plasticity was abolished when cTBS150 was delivered after tbTUS. cTBS150 alone had no significant effect. No changes in M1 intracortical circuits were observed. Plasticity induction by tbTUS can be modified in manners consistent with homeostatic metaplasticity and depotentiation. This substantiates evidence that tbTUS induces LTP-like processes and suggests that metaplasticity can be harnessed in the therapeutic development of TUS.</p>

                Introduction Pediatric meningiomas are rare tumors originating from the meninges’ arachnoid cap cells, representing a small fraction of all meningiomas. The clinical presentation of pediatric meningiomas varies widely depending on their location within the central nervous system. We report a case of pediatric spinal meningioma revealed by gait disturbance. We emphasize clinical and imaging features, as well as therapeutic management of spinal meningiomas. Case presentation We present the case of a 15-year-old boy with a one-year history of chronic thoracic back pain, worsening gait disturbances, and difficulty walking. Neurological examination revealed a spastic gait with increased muscle tone and bilateral pyramidal syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a posterior intradural extramedullary mass at the T6-T7 level, causing dorsal spinal cord compression. The patient underwent complete resection of the tumor, and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a WHO grade I psammomatous spinal meningioma. Conclusion This case highlights the clinical and imaging characteristics of spinal meningiomas in pediatric patients. MRI remains the gold standard for diagnostic imaging, effectively narrowing down differential diagnoses. However, a definitive diagnosis requires histological examination. The primary therapeutic approach for pediatric meningiomas is surgical resection.

                The utilization of zein and gum arabic has grown in an attempt to formulate wall materials based on protein–polysaccharide complexes. This mixture provides a versatile delivery system for hydrophilic (guava leaf extract, GLE) or lipophilic (fish oil, FO) bioactive compounds, and it can be used as an edible film-forming polymer. This study was undertaken to characterize FO-containing edible films that were double-layered with a film containing GLE. Modified zein and gum arabic solutions (MG complex) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1.5 (v/v), adjusted to pH 5, added with glycerol (20% of the complex) and FO (5% of the complex), and finally adjusted to pH 5. This was prepared as the bottom/lower layer. The upper/active layer was prepared by mixing MG complex, glycerol, and GLE (1, 3, and 5% w/v of the complex). The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in GLE were 15.81 mg GAE/g extract and 6.99 mg QE/g extract, respectively. The IC50 of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of GLE was 26.86 ppm with antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli of 9.83 and 12.55 mm. The total plate counts of double-layered films containing GLE were retained below 3 log CFU/g during 28-day storage. The peroxide values of these films were dimmed for no more than 9.08 meq/kg sample on day 28 of storage. Thickness (872.00-971.67 μm), water vapor transmission rate (12.99-17.04 g/m2/day), tensile strength (1.56-2.02 kPa), elongation at break (61.53-75.41%), glass transition (52.74-57.50°C), melting peak (131.59-142.35°C), inhibition against B. subtilis (33.67-40.58 mm), and inhibition against E. coli (2.05-9.04 mm) were obtained by double-layered films. GLE can be successfully incorporated into the active layer of a double-layer film to improve its characteristics while significantly slowing down the microbial contamination and oxidation rate. MG complex and FO can also contribute to the performance of the edible film.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-106/v3?src=rss">Comparison of the efficacy of aescin and diclofenac sodium in the management of postoperative sequelae and their effect on salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels after surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar: a randomize</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Surgical removal of an impacted third molar is one of the most common oral surgical procedures performed in dental offices. The postoperative phase is often associated with severe inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed to manage postoperative discomfort. NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function disturbances, and platelet count reductions. Thus, the present study demonstrates the utility of aescin in managing postoperative discomfort after the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. This study aimed to correlate and compare the impact of aescin and diclofenac on salivary PGE2 levels and serum C-reactive protein levels after surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar. The study will also evaluate and compare the effectiveness of individual drug therapy in managing postoperative pain, swelling and mouth opening. Methods The planned study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, prospective clinical trial. Each patient will be prescribed either diclofenac sodium 150 mg/day or aescin (escin) 120 mg/day to be taken orally in divided doses for five days after surgically removing the impacted mandibular third molar. Pain will be assessed using a visual analog scale. Facial swelling and mouth opening will be recorded using a metric scale with standardized reference points. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be employed to measure salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels. All parameters will be recorded preoperatively (T0) on the second postoperative day (T1) and fifth postoperative day (T2). Conclusion The proposed study is expected to show a clinically acceptable response to the administration of aescin for the management of postoperative discomfort compared to diclofenac sodium after third molar surgery. The proposed study is expected to positively manipulate the levels of salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein, which are reliable inflammatory markers. The outcome of this study may provide an efficacious and safe alternative to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for managing postoperative discomfort following third molar surgery.

                Background Faith and belief systems impact the emotional as well as immunological states of believers in ways that we are just beginning to understand. However, the clinical implications of prior studies are limited. The aim of the HEALING (Hospital-based Ecumenical and Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) study is to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized patients after meeting with a chaplain coupled with the study of biblical readings. Methods Hospitalized patients were pre-screened to identify those who were most in need of a spiritual intervention. A passage from the Bible was read to them during a meeting with the chaplain at bedside (n = 20) or in the chapel (n = 18). No meeting occurred in the randomized control group (n = 19). Blood samples were obtained 30 min prior and 60 min after the meeting to measure white blood cell (WBC) count, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, IgG, and complement 3 (C3). A subgroup of the visited patients was subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), during which they listened to an audiotape of readings of the same biblical passage (n = 21). Results Immunological changes were not significant. Conversely, a significant (pfwe = 0.003) correlation was observed between lymphocyte changes and activation of the angular gyrus (left BA39) during fMRI, a brain area involved in word recognition. Conclusions This article contributes to the relevant literature by helping to create a realistic picture of the possibilities of neuroimmune modulation in clinical practice. Compared to healthy volunteers, the extent of short-term neuroimmunomodulation becomes narrower in a clinical setting. Although limited by the sample size and cohort study design, the findings suggest that the depth of psycho-immunological changes could depend on the degree to which the chaplain’s main message is understood.

                Occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is a rare genetic disease and copper transport disorder caused by a faulty ATP7A gene with multisystemic presentations, most originally related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue affections. In our case, a male neonate with OHS presented soon after birth with pathognomonic occipital exostosis, cutis laxa at the nape region, and widely opened skull sutures and fontanels. A skeletal survey showed occipital exostosis projecting from the line of insertion of the trapezius muscle and wide fontanels on skull X-ray films with no exostoses or deformities elsewhere. In addition to our case report being the second reported case for the condition detected early in the neonatal period, it also emphasizes the importance of investigating any sign thoroughly, as it may be an early alarming sign of a progressive disease that may affect the patient’s quality of life. In addition, it highlights the value of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of these patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-935/v2?src=rss">Data on selfـــefficacy  and its sources during the COVID-19 crisis:  A Saudi auditor’s perspective [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Auditors during COVID-19 experienced an unprecedented situation, in which normal audit activities were difficult to conduct. Moreover, COVID-19 forced auditors to introduce a new audit approach, “remote auditing,” which was not common in most audit firms and required the adoption of more advanced technologies. Overall, auditors during the COVID-19 pandemic needed both cognitive and technical factors to deliver high-quality audits. Despite these challenges, research on how auditors deal with these issues is limited, presenting an intriguing area of study. Methods This dataset provides insights into Saudi auditors’ experience and beliefs regarding audit activities during COVID-19. Through an online survey, researchers collected data from 193 of 417 registered auditors with the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). The survey assessed auditors’ self-efficacy in conducting audits during the pandemic and explored its sources and potential moderating factors. Specifically, the dataset includes responses to eight items related to self-efficacy, 19 items covering four common sources of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological/emotional states), and six items assessing virtual audit competency. Additionally, the dataset contains demographic information that is valuable for researchers analyzing the relationship between auditor self-efficacy, its sources, and other influencing factors. Conclusions Overall, the dataset included in this study may serve a broader audience and be useful in improving several stakeholders’ understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on auditors and how auditors assess their ability to adapt to COVID-19 consequences. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the need for auditors to adapt to new circumstances and adopt innovative approaches during challenging times, thereby ensuring the delivery of high-quality audits.

                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

                <p>by Gaspard Oliviers, Rafal Bogacz, Alexander Meulemans</p>

It has been suggested that the brain employs probabilistic generative models to optimally interpret sensory information. This hypothesis has been formalised in distinct frameworks, focusing on explaining separate phenomena. On one hand, classic predictive coding theory proposed how the probabilistic models can be learned by networks of neurons employing local synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, neural sampling theories have demonstrated how stochastic dynamics enable neural circuits to represent the posterior distributions of latent states of the environment. These frameworks were brought together by variational filtering that introduced neural sampling to predictive coding. Here, we consider a variant of variational filtering for static inputs, to which we refer as Monte Carlo predictive coding (MCPC). We demonstrate that the integration of predictive coding with neural sampling results in a neural network that learns precise generative models using local computation and plasticity. The neural dynamics of MCPC infer the posterior distributions of the latent states in the presence of sensory inputs, and can generate likely inputs in their absence. Furthermore, MCPC captures the experimental observations on the variability of neural activity during perceptual tasks. By combining predictive coding and neural sampling, MCPC can account for both sets of neural data that previously had been explained by these individual frameworks.

                <p>by Alessio Andronico, Juliette Paireau, Simon Cauchemez</p>

Seasonal influenza causes significant annual morbidity and mortality worldwide. In France, it is estimated that, on average, 2 million individuals consult their GP for influenza-like-illness (ILI) every year. Traditionally, mathematical models used for epidemic forecasting can either include parameters capturing the infection process (mechanistic or compartmental models) or rely on time series analysis approaches that do not make mechanistic assumptions (statistical or phenomenological models). While the latter make extensive use of past epidemic data, mechanistic models are usually independently initialized in each season. As a result, forecasts from such models can contain trajectories that are vastly different from past epidemics. We developed a mechanistic model that takes into account epidemic data from training seasons when producing forecasts. The parameters of the model are estimated via a first particle filter running on the observed data. A second particle filter is then used to produce forecasts compatible with epidemic trajectories from the training set. The model was calibrated and tested on 35 years’ worth of surveillance data from the French Sentinelles Network, representing the weekly number of patients consulting for ILI over the period 1985–2019. Our results show that the new method improves upon standard mechanistic approaches. In particular, when retrospectively tested on the available data, our model provides increased accuracy for short-term forecasts (from one to four weeks into the future) and peak timing and intensity. Our new approach for epidemic forecasting allows the integration of key strengths of the statistical approach into the mechanistic modelling framework and represents an attempt to provide accurate forecasts by making full use of the rich surveillance dataset collected in France since 1985.

                <p>by Hannah Gordon, Zachary T. Schafer, Cody J. Smith</p>

The overproduction of cells and subsequent production of debris is a universal principle of neurodevelopment. Here, we show an additional feature of the developing nervous system that causes neural debris—promoted by the sacrificial nature of embryonic microglia that irreversibly become phagocytic after clearing other neural debris. Described as long-lived, microglia colonize the embryonic brain and persist into adulthood. Using transgenic zebrafish to investigate the microglia debris during brain construction, we identified that unlike other neural cell types that die in developmental stages after they have expanded, necroptosis-dependent microglial debris is prevalent when microglia are expanding in the zebrafish brain. Time-lapse imaging of microglia demonstrates that this debris is cannibalized by other microglia. To investigate features that promote microglia death and cannibalism, we used time-lapse imaging and fate-mapping strategies to track the lifespan of individual developmental microglia. These approaches revealed that instead of embryonic microglia being long-lived cells that completely digest their phagocytic debris, once most developmental microglia in zebrafish become phagocytic they eventually die, including ones that are cannibalistic. These results establish a paradox—which we tested by increasing neural debris and manipulating phagocytosis—that once most microglia in the embryo become phagocytic, they die, create debris, and then are cannibalized by other microglia, resulting in more phagocytic microglia that are destined to die.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The effects of seizure control on outcomes in persons with dementia (PWD) remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of seizure control on mortality, function, cognition, and mood among PWD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This longitudinal, multicenter study is based on 39 Alzheimer's disease centers (ADCs) in the United States from September 2005 to December 2021. PWD were grouped by seizure status into recurrent (seizures in the past year), remote (prior seizures but none in the past year), and no seizures (controls). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality among seizure groups. We used Weibull survival analysis to assess the mortality risks by seizure status after adjusting for age, sex, education, race, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, degree of cognitive impairment, dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation, brain trauma, stroke, Parkinson's disease, alcohol abuse, and depression. Cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating), function (physical dependence and nursing home residence), day-to-day activities (Functional Assessment Scores), and mood (Geriatric Depression Scale) were compared among seizure groups after adjusting for dementia duration and age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 26,501 participants, 374 (1.4%) had recurrent seizures and 510 (1.9%) had remote seizures. In multivariable survival analysis, recurrent seizures were associated with a higher mortality risk than remote and no seizures (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]; recurrent aHR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.51 to 2.12; remote aHR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.38). Median time-to-death for recurrent, remote, and no seizures was 2.4, 4.0, and 4.7 years, respectively. People with recurrent seizures had worse cognition, day-to-day function, and physical dependence than those with remote seizures and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PWD with poorly controlled recurrent seizures have worse mortality, functional, and cognitive outcomes than PWD with remote and no seizures. These findings underscore the need for timely identification and management of ongoing seizures in PWD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

An exploration using a novel, value-based, publication metric framework: the EMPIRE Index [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not app</a></h4>

              
                Background The EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index is a value-based, multi-component metric framework to assess the impact of medical publications in terms of relevance to different stakeholders. It comprises three component scores (social, scholarly and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics that indicate a different aspect of engagement with the publication. Here, we present an exploratory investigation of whether publication types or disease indications influence EMPIRE Index scores. Methods Article-level metrics were extracted and EMPIRE Index scores were calculated for 5825 journal articles published from 1 May 2017 to 1 May 2018, representing 12 disease indications (chosen to reflect a wide variety of common and rare diseases with a variety of aetiologies) and five publication types. Results There were significant differences in scores between article types and disease indications. Median (95% CI) social and scholarly impact scores ranged from 1.2 (0.3–1.6) to 4.8 (3.1–6.6), respectively, for phase 3 clinical trials, and from 0.3 (0.3–0.4) to 2.3 (1.9–2.6), respectively, for observational studies. Social and scholarly impact scores were highest for multiple sclerosis publications and lowest for non-small cell lung cancer publications. Systematic reviews achieved greater impact than regular reviews. Median trends in the social impact of different disease areas matched the level of public interest as assessed through Google search interest. Although most articles did not register societal impact, mean societal impact scores were highest for migraine publications. Conclusions The EMPIRE Index successfully identified differences in impact by disease area and publication type, which supports the notion that the impact of each publication needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors, and potentially others. These findings should be considered when using the EMPIRE Index to assess publication impact.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the effects of directional subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-dDBS) on gait and balance disorders, including freezing of gait (FOG), in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 10 participants who underwent STN-DBS and presented severe preoperative FOG, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. We used segmented DBS electrodes to investigate whether directing the predicted volume of tissue activated (VTA) to overlap the central STN preferentially improved gait and balance disorders compared to directional DBS applied in the more posterior STN (sensorimotor). We also assessed non-directional (ring-mode) STN-DBS. Our primary outcome was gait and balance control measured using instrumented gait recordings. Each patient had a pre-operative structural and diffusion-weighted imaging to model individual VTAs and to examine cortico-subthalamic connectivity. We used linear mixed-effects models to contrast the effects of central STN-dDBS, posterior STN-dDBS, and ring-mode STN-DBS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Central STN-dDBS produced significantly better improvement in gait and balance control compared to posterior STN-dDBS (<i>p</i> = 0.027), with fewer FOG episodes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, ring-mode STN-DBS resulted in worsened postural control compared to central STN-dDBS (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The cortico-subthalamic connectivity with the STN VTAs involved mostly primary sensorimotor, premotor, and medial frontal cortices, with a higher overall cortico-STN connectivity with ring-mode STN-DBS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Central STN-dDBS represents the best option to improve gait and balance disorders in PD patients, including FOG. Our findings raise the possibility of reprogramming STN-DBS toward the central area in selected patients with disabling FOG and/or postural instability after surgery.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its associated pathology have been primarily identified in humans, who have relatively large brains and long lifespans. To expand what is known about aging and neurodegeneration across mammalian species, we characterized amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau lesions in five species of aged felids (<i>n</i> = 9; cheetah, clouded leopard, African lion, serval, Siberian tiger). We performed immunohistochemistry to detect Aβ40 and Aβ42 in plaques and vessels and hyperphosphorylated tau in the temporal lobe gyrus sylvius and in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. We also quantified the densities and morphological types of microglia expressing IBA1. We found that diffuse Aβ42 plaques, but not dense-core plaques, were present more frequently in the temporal cortex and tended to be more common than Aβ40 plaques across species. Conversely, vascular Aβ was labeled more consistently with Aβ40 for each species on average. Although all individuals showed some degree of Aβ40 and/or Aβ42 immunoreactivity, only the cheetahs and clouded leopards exhibited intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated tau (i.e., pretangles), which was more common in the hippocampus. Reactive, intermediate microglia were significantly associated with total Aβ40 vessel area and pretangle load in the hippocampus. This study demonstrates the co-occurrence of Aβ and tau pathology in two felid species, cheetahs and clouded leopards. Overall, these results provide an initial view of the manifestation of Aβ and tau pathology in aged, large-brained felids, which can be compared with markers of neurodegeneration across different taxa, including domestic cats, nonhuman primates, and humans.</p>
