	<p>This systematic review examined available findings on spatial and temporal characteristics of cortical activity in response to unpredicted mechanical perturbations. Secondly, this review investigated associations between cortical activity and behavioral/biomechanical measures. Databases were searched from 1980&amp;amp;ndash;2021 and a total of 35 cross-sectional studies (31 EEG and 4 fNIRS) were included. Majority of EEG studies assessed perturbation-evoked potentials (PEPs), whereas other studies assessed changes in cortical frequencies. Further, fNIRS studies assessed hemodynamic changes. The PEP-N1, commonly identified at sensorimotor areas, was most examined and was influenced by context prediction, perturbation magnitude, motor adaptation and age. Other PEPs were identified at frontal, parietal and sensorimotor areas and were influenced by task position. Further, changes in cortical frequencies were observed at prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal areas and were influenced by task difficulty. Lastly, hemodynamic changes were observed at prefrontal and frontal areas and were influenced by task prediction. Limited studies reported associations between cortical and behavioral outcomes. This review provided evidence regarding the involvement of cerebral cortex for sensory processing of unpredicted perturbations, error-detection of expected versus actual postural state, and planning and execution of compensatory stepping responses. There is still limited evidence examining cortical activity during reactive balance tasks in populations with high fall-risk.</p>

	<p>In recent years, the information crosstalk between the central nervous system and the periphery has been a hot topic, such as the brain&amp;amp;ndash;gut axis, brain&amp;amp;ndash;lung axis, etc. Among them, some studies have shown that brainstem nuclei activity can significantly affect the progression of peripheral tumor; however, regarding lung cancer, our understanding of the basic characteristics of the lung-innervating brain nuclei responsive to lung cancer progression remains deficient. Therefore, we used the pseudorabies virus for retrograde labeling of nerves to study the neural circuits between the lung and brain. We then established a mouse orthotopic lung cancer model and used the expression of the c-Fos gene in brain regions to characterize activated brain circuits and compared these results with those of the control group. We focused on c-Fos activity in nuclei associated with retrograde tracing regions of the brainstem. We found over 16 nuclei in the whole brain with direct or indirect lung innervation through neural retrograde labeling with the pseudorabies virus. We further revealed that the neuronal activity of the rostral ventrolateral reticular nucleus (RVL), caudal nucleus of Raphe (raphe obscurus nucleus, ROb), Raphe pallidus nucleus (RPa), and ventral gigantocellular reticular nucleus (GiV) in the rostral ventromedial and lateral medulla were significantly changed in an orthotopic lung cancer mouse model by the immunostaining of c-Fos early responsive protein. Thus, the distinctive rostroventral medulla area, functionally closely related to the vagus nerve, likely plays a role in central neural interaction with peripheral lung tumors and deserves future investigation.</p>

	<p>Alcohol abuse dramatically affects individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; lives nationwide. The 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) estimated that 10.2% of Americans suffer from alcohol use disorder. Although social support has been shown to aid in general addiction prevention and rehabilitation, the benefits of social support are not entirely understood. The present study sought to compare the benefits of social interaction on the conditioned ethanol approach behavior in rats through a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in which a drug is paired with one of two distinct contexts. In experiment 1A, rats were single-housed and received conditioning trials in which ethanol was paired with the less preferred context. In experiment 1B, rats underwent procedures identical to experiment 1A, but were pair-housed throughout the paradigm. In experiment 1C, rats were single-housed, but concurrently conditioned to a socially-paired context and an ethanol-paired context. By comparing the time spent between the ethanol-paired environment and the saline-paired or socially-paired environment, we extrapolated the extent of ethanol approach behavior in the pair-housed, single-housed, and concurrently conditioned rats. Our results revealed that social interaction, both in pair-housed animals or concurrently socially-conditioned animals, diminished the ethanol approach behavior, which highlights the importance of social support in addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery programs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Authentic leadership and innovative work behavior through organizational culture: A study in Indonesian state-owned enterprises [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Innovation is one of the keys for organizations to win the competition and be able to survive. State-owned enterprises require employees to face the competition by showing innovative work behavior where leadership factors and organizational culture could influence this behavior. This study examines the role of authentic leadership in innovative work behavior through organizational culture as a mediator. Methods: Participants in this survey study were 272 employees of Indonesian state-owned enterprises, but only 153 employees from 17 work teams were involved in data analysis at the group level. The research instrument was adapted from the innovative work behavior scale, authentic leadership questionnaire, and the Indonesian state-owned enterprises culture scale, which consists of six core values: trustworthy, competent, harmonious, loyal, adaptive, and collaborative. Data collection in this study was carried out by distributing questionnaires in the form of a Likert scale online via a google form. The data were analyzed using partial-least square analysis. Results: The results showed that organizational culture mediated the relationship between authentic leadership and innovative work behavior. Conclusions: The group experience of the presence of an authentic leader can improve the implementation of organizational culture, which in turn may increase innovative work behavior at the group level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ex vivo comparative investigation of suprachiasmatic nucleus excitotoxic resiliency [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Glutamate signaling in the brain is regulated by release, reuptake, and receptor responsiveness. In diseased conditions, glutamate signaling can exceed normal regulatory processes, giving rise to a condition called excitotoxicity. Although regional differences in the excitotoxic effects of glutamate in the brain have been reported, the extent and characteristics of these potential differences are not clear.  Here we compared the excitotoxic resiliency of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), anterior hypothalamus (AH) and cortex.  Methods: We treated acute brain slices containing either the SCN and AH or the cortex from adult male mice at different times across the diurnal cycle with varying concentrations of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), NMDA+ α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or control medium. The extent of cell damage was assessed using propidium iodide (PI), a cell death marker. Results: The results indicate that all three brain regions exhibited increasing cell damage/death when treated with increasing concentrations of NMDA. However, higher concentrations of NMDA were needed to significantly increase cell damage in the SCN compared to the cortex and AH.  All three brain regions also exhibited greater cell death/damage when treated in the nighttime compared to the daytime, although the SCN exhibited increased cell death during a more restricted time interval compared to the AH and cortex.  Conclusions: Together, these data confirm previous studies showing excitotoxic resiliency in the SCN, while extending them in two ways.  First, we demonstrate a dose-dependency in excitotoxic susceptibility that differentiates the SCN from the surrounding AH and the cortex using a brain slice preparation. Second, we demonstrate a diurnal rhythm in excitotoxic susceptibility with a broadly similar phase across all three brain regions. These data increase our understanding of the extent and nature of the SCN excitotoxic resiliency, which will inform future studies on the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pesticide exposure and lung cancer risk: A case-control study in Nakhon Sawan, Thailand [version 6; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pesticide exposure might increase risk of lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the historical use of pesticides and lung cancer using a case-control design. Methods: This case-control study compared a lifetime pesticide exposure of 233 lung cancer cases, and 447 healthy neighbours matched for gender, and age (±5 years). Data on demographic, pesticide exposure and other related factors were collected using a face-to-face interview questionnaire. Associations between lung cancer and types of pesticides as well as individual pesticides were analysed using logistic regression adjusted for gender, age, cigarette smoking, occupation, cooking fumes exposure, and exposure to air pollution. Results: It was found that lung cancer was positively associated with lifetime use of herbicides and insecticides. Compared to people in the non-exposed groups, those in Q3-Q4 days of using herbicides and insecticides had an elevated risk of lung cancer, with odds ratio (OR) between 2.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-3.89), and 3.99 (95% CI 1.62-7.11) (p < 0.001). For individual pesticides, those presenting a significant association with lung cancer were dieldrin (OR = 2.56; 95% CI 1.36-4.81), chlorpyrifos (OR = 3.29; 95 % CI 1.93-5.61), and carbofuran (OR = 2.10; 95% CI 1.28-3.42). It was also found, for the first time, carbofuran, glyphosate, and paraquat to be significantly associated with lung cancer. Conclusions: The results reconfirmed the association between pesticides exposure and lung cancer. In the study, five individual pesticides, e.g. dieldrin, chlorpyrifos, carbofuran, glyphosate, and paraquat were identified as a potential risk factors for the disease. More studies are still required to confirm the results and to identify more individual pesticides that could cause lung cancer. The issues should receive more attention since these chemicals are used widely.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pancreatic cancer grading in pathological images using deep learning convolutional neural networks [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The cancer grades define how aggressively the cancer will spread and give indication for doctors to make proper prognosis and treatment. The current method of pancreatic cancer grading, by means of manual examination of the cancerous tissue following a biopsy, is time consuming and often results in misdiagnosis and thus incorrect treatment. This paper presents an automated grading system for pancreatic cancer from pathology images developed by comparing deep learning models on two different pathological stains. Methods: A transfer-learning technique was adopted by testing the method on 14 different ImageNet pre-trained models. The models were fine-tuned to be trained with our dataset. Results: From the experiment, DenseNet models appeared to be the best at classifying the validation set with up to 95.61% accuracy in grading pancreatic cancer despite the small sample set. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in grading pancreatic cancer based on pathology images. Previous works have either focused only on detection (benign or malignant), or on radiology images (computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] etc.). The proposed system can be very useful to pathologists in facilitating an automated or semi-automated cancer grading system, which can address the problems found in manual grading.

                Background: The purpose of this study is to explore the trends and causes of established and emerging nations' stock market integration with India. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) indices act as a counterweight to international market indices. This study investigates the sustained interest of foreign investors in the Indian stock market in the wake of capital market reforms, as well as whether it moves in tandem with other markets in Asia and the United States. Methods: Our study examined the possibility of cross-country cointegration between the largest economies and indices around the world using multiple financial econometric models, such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Unit Root, Correlation, and Johansen Cointegration. Results: The findings of this study significantly support the notion that Indian and international financial markets are highly integrated. Vector error correction model indicates that the Indian market (NSE) is highly cointegrated with the US market (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) and increased volatility signifies global contagion. Conclusion: A cursory examination of the data reveals distinct investment and portfolio diversification options for global investors. This could assist regulators in formulating more effective rules regarding price discovery processes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of problem-based learning on students’ attitude towards learning physics: a cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attitude is a learning scale that informs which approach should be used to call students to school. It can be seen a supporting tool that informs teachers, policymakers, and researchers of the needs for raising interest in learning a certain subject, such as physics. This study aimed at determining the effect of problem-based learning on students’ attitude towards learning physics. Methods: The study followed a quantitative approach with a quasi-experimental design employing cross-sectional survey techniques. The participants of the study were 419 13th-grade physics students of the 2020/2021 school year in both Ugandan government and private secondary schools. Among these students, one group was taught using problem-based learning instruction while another group was taught using traditional instruction for 12 weeks. Data were collected using a standardized tool called Views About Science Survey. Using Microsoft Excel 2016 and Statistical Package for Social Scientist version 23.0, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to determine a significant difference between experiment and control groups. Results: It was found that both problem-based learning and traditional instructions caused a statistically significant positive effect on students’ attitudes towards physics. However, the experimental group gained more positive attitude than the control group as they were more inclined towards the expert-like attitude (thinking like a scientist in a domain) than their counterparts due to the problem-based learning approach they learned in. Conclusions: Therefore, it was concluded that problem-based learning is a more effective method of teaching physics than traditional methods. Hence, we suggest that secondary school teachers need to adopt the use of problem-based learning in the teaching of science concepts, especially physics.

                The Chalan ravine is a deep bed creek that runs through Licto (Ecuador). It has been known since the 19th century for the abundance of paleontological remains of Pleiostocene fauna and megafauna in its profiles, where entire remains of mastodons were recovered. The abundance of these remains made one of the high areas, where marmites exist in different forms, was traditionally considered as mastodon footprints. Archaeological prospecting, geographic information system (GIS) technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), photogrammetry, and the geological study of the place, allowed us to determine that the mythical traces of mastodon were marmites made by the water erosion produced in the same ravine over time.

                Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with high morbidity and disability. The routines involved in taking medications, side effects, the nature of medicines, difficulties with the healthcare system, and disruptions to social activities all contribute to patients frequently experiencing medication-related burdens (MRB). The current study aimed to assess the perceived MRB among a sample of SLE patients from Iraq and to look for any possible relationship between MRB and disease activity. Methods: The current study was cross-sectional on diagnosed SLE patients who arrived at Baghdad Teaching Hospital/Medical City/Rheumatology department from September 2021 to January 2022. MRB was measured using the Living with Medicines Questionnaire (LMQ). Results: The study recruited 156 SLE patients. The patients were 35.8 ±11.7 years old on average. Great majority of them were women (96.8 %). The average LMQ score was 117.30± 18.37. The results showed that most patients (69.87%) experienced a moderate level of burden, followed by a low level (19.87%), high level (7.69%), and no burden at all (2.56%). No patients experienced an extremely high level of burden (0.0%). The mean burden scores for two LMQ domains—relationships with health care professionals (HCPs) and effectiveness of prescription medications—were the lowest (below average). Conclusions: Many of the SLE patients in this study reported experiencing MRB. Healthcare professionals should implement strategies to reduce this burden, particularly for low-income patients.

                Background: Research Software is a concept that has been only recently clarified. In this paper we address the need for a similar enlightenment concerning the Research Data concept. Methods: Our contribution begins by reviewing the Research Software definition, which includes the analysis of software as a legal concept, followed by the study of its production in the research environment and within the Open Science framework. Then we explore the challenges of a data definition and some of the Research Data definitions proposed in the literature. Results: We propose a Research Data concept featuring three characteristics: the data should be produced (collected, processed, analyzed, shared & disseminated) to answer a scientific question, by a scientific team, and has yield a result published or disseminated in some article or scientific contribution of any kind. Conclusions: The analysis of this definition and the context in which it is proposed provides some answers to the Borgman’s conundrum challenges, that is, which Research Data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. They are completed with answers to the questions: how? and where?

                Background: Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes and burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the early warning signs of mental distress is very important to ensure the provision of quality patient care. Methods: In this facility-based cross-sectional study, HCWs of the teaching hospitals affiliated to Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore were assessed regarding their mental health status using a semi-structured questionnaire. All doctors and nurses who were willing to participate from these teaching hospitals were included in the study. Data was collected over a period of four months (1st March -30th June 2021) till the required sample size was reached and analysed using IBM SPSS and expressed using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range), and proportions. Univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with mental health outcomes among the HCWs and the corresponding unadjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were reported. Results: A total of 245 HCWs [52.2% (n=128) doctors and 47.8% (n=117) nurses] were included in our study. The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia assessed using PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI-7 scales were 49% (n=119), 38% (n=93), and 42% (n=102) respectively. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were more likely to be experienced by HCWs aged > 27 years, females, and involved in COVID-19 patient care. (p>0.05) Conclusions:  Our findings that 38% of the examined HCWs had clinically relevant anxiety symptoms and 49% had clinically relevant depression symptoms draws attention to the importance of systematically tracking the mental health of HCWs during this ongoing pandemic. HCWs should monitor their stress reactions and seek appropriate help both on a personal and professional level. Appropriate workplace interventions including psychological support should be provided to HCWs, to ensure provision of uncompromised quality patient care.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How public can public goods be? Environmental context shapes the evolutionary ecology of partially private goods</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brian A. Lerch, Derek A. Smith, Thomas Koffel, Sarah C. Bagby, Karen C. Abbott</p>

The production of costly public goods (as distinct from metabolic byproducts) has largely been understood through the realization that spatial structure can minimize losses to non-producing “cheaters” by allowing for the positive assortment of producers. In well-mixed systems, where positive assortment is not possible, the stable production of public goods has been proposed to depend on lineages that become indispensable as the sole producers of those goods while their neighbors lose production capacity through genome streamlining (the Black Queen Hypothesis). Here, we develop consumer-resource models motivated by nitrogen-fixing, siderophore-producing bacteria that consider the role of colimitation in shaping eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our models demonstrate that in well-mixed environments, single “public goods” can only be ecologically and evolutionarily stable if they are partially privatized (i.e., if producers reserve a portion of the product pool for private use). Colimitation introduces the possibility of subsidy: strains producing a fully public good can exclude non-producing strains so long as the producing strain derives sufficient benefit from the production of a second partially private good. We derive a lower bound for the degree of privatization necessary for production to be advantageous, which depends on external resource concentrations. Highly privatized, low-investment goods, in environments where the good is limiting, are especially likely to be stably produced. Coexistence emerges more rarely in our mechanistic model of the external environment than in past phenomenological approaches. Broadly, we show that the viability of production depends critically on the environmental context (i.e., external resource concentrations), with production of shared resources favored in environments where a partially-privatized resource is scarce.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mycn regulates intestinal development through ribosomal biogenesis in a zebrafish model of Feingold syndrome 1</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yun-Fei Li, Tao Cheng, Ying-Jie Zhang, Xin-Xin Fu, Jing Mo, Guo-Qin Zhao, Mao-Guang Xue, Ding-Hao Zhuo, Yan-Yi Xing, Ying Huang, Xiao-Zhi Sun, Dan Wang, Xiang Liu, Yang Dong, Xiao-Sheng Zhu, Feng He, Jun Ma, Dong Chen, Xi Jin, Peng-Fei Xu</p>

Feingold syndrome type 1, caused by loss-of-function of MYCN, is characterized by varied phenotypes including esophageal and duodenal atresia. However, no adequate model exists for studying the syndrome’s pathological or molecular mechanisms, nor is there a treatment strategy. Here, we developed a zebrafish Feingold syndrome type 1 model with nonfunctional <i>mycn</i>, which had severe intestinal atresia. Single-cell RNA-seq identified a subcluster of intestinal cells that were highly sensitive to Mycn, and impaired cell proliferation decreased the overall number of intestinal cells in the <i>mycn</i> mutant fish. Bulk RNA-seq and metabolomic analysis showed that expression of ribosomal genes was down-regulated and that amino acid metabolism was abnormal. Northern blot and ribosomal profiling analysis showed abnormal rRNA processing and decreases in free 40S, 60S, and 80S ribosome particles, which led to impaired translation in the mutant. Besides, both Ribo-seq and western blot analysis showed that mTOR pathway was impaired in <i>mycn</i> mutant, and blocking mTOR pathway by rapamycin treatment can mimic the intestinal defect, and both L-leucine and Rheb, which can elevate translation via activating TOR pathway, could rescue the intestinal phenotype of <i>mycn</i> mutant. In summary, by this zebrafish Feingold syndrome type 1 model, we found that disturbance of ribosomal biogenesis and blockage of protein synthesis during development are primary causes of the intestinal defect in Feingold syndrome type 1. Importantly, our work suggests that leucine supplementation may be a feasible and easy treatment option for this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The microbiota promotes social behavior by modulating microglial remodeling of forebrain neurons</a></h4>

Host-associated microbiotas guide the trajectory of developmental programs, and altered microbiota composition is linked to neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. Recent work suggests that microbiotas modulate behavioral phenotypes associated with these disorders. We discovered that the zebrafish microbiota is required for normal social behavior and reveal a molecular pathway linking the microbiota, microglial remodeling of neural circuits, and social behavior in this experimentally tractable model vertebrate. Examining neuronal correlates of behavior, we found that the microbiota restrains neurite complexity and targeting of forebrain neurons required for normal social behavior and is necessary for localization of forebrain microglia, brain-resident phagocytes that remodel neuronal arbors. The microbiota also influences microglial molecular functions, including promoting expression of the complement signaling pathway and the synaptic remodeling factor <i>c1q</i>. Several distinct bacterial taxa are individually sufficient for normal microglial and neuronal phenotypes, suggesting that host neuroimmune development is sensitive to a feature common among many bacteria. Our results demonstrate that the microbiota influences zebrafish social behavior by stimulating microglial remodeling of forebrain circuits during early neurodevelopment and suggest pathways for new interventions in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sleep and wake cycles dynamically modulate hippocampal inhibitory synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kunwei Wu, Wenyan Han, Wei Lu</p>

Sleep is an essential process that consolidates memories by modulating synapses through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we report that GABAergic synapses in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons undergo daily rhythmic alterations. Specifically, wake inhibits phasic inhibition, whereas it promotes tonic inhibition compared to sleep. We further utilize a model of chemically induced inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) to examine inhibitory plasticity. Intriguingly, while CA1 pyramidal neurons in both wake and sleep mice undergo iLTP, wake mice have a much higher magnitude. We also employ optogenetics and observe that inhibitory inputs from parvalbumin-, but not somatostatin-, expressing interneurons contribute to dynamic iLTP during sleep and wake. Finally, we demonstrate that synaptic insertion of α5-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors underlies the wake-specific enhancement of iLTP at parvalbumin-synapses, which is independent of time of the day. These data reveal a previously unappreciated daily oscillation of inhibitory LTP in hippocampal neurons and uncover a dynamic contribution of inhibitory synapses in memory mechanisms across sleep and wake.

                Background: Developing countries need funding for researchers to maximize the evidence base, especially in stunting research. This short policy is expected to provide opportunities for Indonesia to receive more research funding to stunt philanthropists. Policy and implications: Multi-sector cooperation is arguably the leading player in acceleration programs to reduce growth delays. The Stunted Reduction Acceleration Program, complemented by higher research and development expenditures (RDEs) and open policies to support philanthropic activities in Indonesia, will help improve the efficiency of stunted stunt reduction through adequate funding and investment. As evidenced by Singapore and Thailand, the increase in government budgets focused on research and development (R&D) and supportive environments, as shown by Global Philanthropy Environment Index (GPEI), prove that evidence-based and practical researches can lead to the reduction of estimated prevalence of stunting rather than innovation-stage research. Recommendations: Attention needs to be directed in proposing major changes in law and policy which regulate the allocation of research-development expenditure, which will initiate the creation of a supportive environment for philanthropy acts regarding stunting. The challenges associated with these issues are: (1) Stunted research and innovation are still left behind, (2) The availability of data and the lack of transparency, (3) Subpar performance in relation to philanthropists, (4) Inconsistent legal definitions and a lack of industry-specific guidelines, (5) Inadequate law enforcement, (6) Local leaders must engage in evidence-based advocacy, (7) Philanthropists have limited opportunities to learn.

                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 can spread rapidly. Surgery in the oral cavity poses a high risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of mouthwash containing 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 0.2% povidone iodine (PI) to reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory tract and decrease the risk of transmission. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water on the cycle threshold (CT) value obtained by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: This study is a randomized single blind controlled clinical trial which has been registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry on the 3rd February 2022 (Registration number: ISRCTN18356379). In total, 69 subjects recruited from Persahabatan General Hospital who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups or the control group. The subjects were instructed to gargle with 15 mL of mouthwash for 30 s in the oral cavity followed by 30 s in the back of the throat, three times per day for 5 days. CT values were collected on postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Results: The results of the Friedman test significantly differed among the groups (n=15). The CT values increased from baseline (day 0) to postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Conclusions: Mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water increased the CT value.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVDs) are a major cause of stroke and dementia. We used cutting-edge 7T-MRI techniques in patients with Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), to establish which aspects of cerebral small vessel function are affected by this monogenic form of cSVD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 23 CADASIL patients (age 51.1 ± 10.1 years, 52% women) and 13 age- and sex-matched controls (46.1 ± 12.6, 46% women). Small vessel function measures included: basal ganglia and centrum semiovale perforating artery blood flow velocity and pulsatility, vascular reactivity to a visual stimulus in the occipital cortex and reactivity to hypercapnia in the cortex, subcortical gray matter, white matter, and white matter hyperintensities.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with controls, CADASIL patients showed lower blood flow velocity and higher pulsatility index within perforating arteries of the centrum semiovale (mean difference − 0.09 cm/s, <i>p</i> = 0.03 and 0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and basal ganglia (mean difference − 0.98 cm/s, <i>p</i> = 0.003 and 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.06). Small vessel reactivity to a short visual stimulus was decreased (blood-oxygen-level dependent [BOLD] mean difference −0.21%, <i>p</i> = 0.04) in patients, while reactivity to hypercapnia was preserved in the cortex, subcortical gray matter, and normal appearing white matter. Among patients, reactivity to hypercapnia was decreased in white matter hyperintensities compared to normal appearing white matter (BOLD mean difference −0.29%, <i>p</i> = 0.02).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Multiple aspects of cerebral small vessel function on 7T-MRI were abnormal in CADASIL patients, indicative of increased arteriolar stiffness and regional abnormalities in reactivity, locally also in relation to white matter injury. These observations provide novel markers of cSVD for mechanistic and intervention studies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

By targeting FRs selectively, they demonstrate that modulating FR activity can drastically alter adaptive immune responses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid encoding of task regularities in the human hippocampus guides sensorimotor timing</a></h4>

              
                The brain encodes the statistical regularities of the environment in a task-specific yet flexible and generalizable format. Here, we seek to understand this process by bridging two parallel lines of research, one centered on sensorimotor timing, and the other on cognitive mapping in the hippocampal system. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a fast-paced time-to-contact (TTC) estimation task, we found that the hippocampus signaled behavioral feedback received in each trial as well as performance improvements across trials along with reward-processing regions. Critically, it signaled performance improvements independent from the tested intervals, and its activity accounted for the trial-wise regression-to-the-mean biases in TTC estimation. This is in line with the idea that the hippocampus supports the rapid encoding of temporal context even on short time scales in a behavior-dependent manner. Our results emphasize the central role of the hippocampus in statistical learning and position it at the core of a brain-wide network updating sensorimotor representations in real time for flexible behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microplankton life histories revealed by holographic microscopy and deep learning</a></h4>

              
                The marine microbial food web plays a central role in the global carbon cycle. However, our mechanistic understanding of the ocean is biased toward its larger constituents, while rates and biomass fluxes in the microbial food web are mainly inferred from indirect measurements and ensemble averages. Yet, resolution at the level of the individual microplankton is required to advance our understanding of the microbial food web. Here, we demonstrate that, by combining holographic microscopy with deep learning, we can follow microplanktons throughout their lifespan, continuously measuring their three-dimensional position and dry mass. The deep-learning algorithms circumvent the computationally intensive processing of holographic data and allow rapid measurements over extended time periods. This permits us to reliably estimate growth rates, both in terms of dry mass increase and cell divisions, as well as to measure trophic interactions between species such as predation events. The individual resolution provides information about selectivity, individual feeding rates, and handling times for individual microplanktons. The method is particularly useful to detail the rates and routes of organic matter transfer in micro-zooplankton, the most important and least known group of primary consumers in the oceans. Studying individual interactions in idealized small systems provides insights that help us understand microbial food webs and ultimately larger-scale processes. We exemplify this by detailed descriptions of micro-zooplankton feeding events, cell divisions, and long-term monitoring of single cells from division to division.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Instructions and experiential learning have similar impacts on pain and pain-related brain responses but produce dissociations in value-based reversal learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent data suggest that interactions between systems involved in higher order knowledge and associative learning drive responses during value-based learning. However, it is unknown how these systems impact subjective responses, such as pain. We tested how instructions and reversal learning influence pain and pain-evoked brain activation. Healthy volunteers (n = 40) were either instructed about contingencies between cues and aversive outcomes or learned through experience in a paradigm where contingencies reversed three times. We measured predictive cue effects on pain and heat-evoked brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Predictive cues dynamically modulated pain perception as contingencies changed, regardless of whether participants received contingency instructions. Heat-evoked responses in the insula, anterior cingulate, and other regions updated as contingencies changed, and responses in the prefrontal cortex mediated dynamic cue effects on pain, whereas responses in the brainstem's rostroventral medulla (RVM) were shaped by initial contingencies throughout the task. Quantitative modeling revealed that expected value was shaped purely by instructions in the Instructed Group, whereas expected value updated dynamically in the Uninstructed Group as a function of error-based learning. These differences were accompanied by dissociations in the neural correlates of value-based learning in the rostral anterior cingulate, thalamus, and posterior insula, among other regions. These results show how predictions dynamically impact subjective pain. Moreover, imaging data delineate three types of networks involved in pain generation and value-based learning: those that respond to initial contingencies, those that update dynamically during feedback-driven learning as contingencies change, and those that are sensitive to instruction. Together, these findings provide multiple points of entry for therapies designs to impact pain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Collective dynamics support group drumming, reduce variability, and stabilize tempo drift</a></h4>

              
                Humans are social animals who engage in a variety of collective activities requiring coordinated action. Among these, music is a defining and ancient aspect of human sociality. Human social interaction has largely been addressed in dyadic paradigms and it is yet to be determined whether the ensuing conclusions generalize to larger groups. Studied more extensively in nonhuman animal behaviour, the presence of multiple agents engaged in the same task space creates different constraints and possibilities than in simpler dyadic interactions. We addressed whether collective dynamics play a role in human circle drumming. The task was to synchronize in a group with an initial reference pattern and then maintain synchronization after it was muted. We varied the number of drummers, from solo to dyad, quartet, and octet. The observed lower variability, lack of speeding up, smoother individual dynamics, and leader-less inter-personal coordination indicated that stability increased as group size increased, a sort of temporal wisdom of crowds. We propose a hybrid continuous-discrete Kuramoto model for emergent group synchronization with pulse-based coupling that exhibits a mean field positive feedback loop. This research suggests that collective phenomena are among the factors that play a role in social cognition.

                The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is a major hub that receives sensory information from both internal and external environments. Specific populations of PBN neurons are involved in behaviors including food and water intake, nociceptive responses, breathing regulation, as well as learning and responding appropriately to threatening stimuli. However, it is unclear how many PBN neuron populations exist and how different behaviors may be encoded by unique signaling molecules or receptors. Here we provide a repository of data on the molecular identity, spatial location, and projection patterns of dozens of PBN neuron subclusters. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified 21 subclusters of neurons in the PBN and neighboring regions. Multiplexed <i>in situ</i> hybridization showed many of these subclusters are enriched within specific PBN subregions with scattered cells in several other regions. We also provide detailed visualization of the axonal projections from 21 Cre-driver lines of mice. These results are all publicly available for download and provide a foundation for further interrogation of PBN functions and connections.

                A morbidostat is a bioreactor that uses antibiotics to control the growth of bacteria, making it well-suited for studying the evolution of antibiotic resistance. However, morbidostats are often too expensive to be used in educational settings. Here we present a low-cost morbidostat called the EVolutionary biorEactor (EVE) that can be built by students with minimal engineering and programming experience. We describe how we validated EVE in a real classroom setting by evolving replicate <i>Escherichia coli</i> populations under chloramphenicol challenge, thereby enabling students to learn about bacterial growth and antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is essential for hearing by regulating cholesterol distribution in hair bundles</a></h4>

              
                Unbiased genetic screens implicated a number of uncharacterized genes in hearing loss, suggesting some biological processes required for auditory function remain unexplored. Loss of <i>Kiaa1024L/Minar2</i>, a previously understudied gene, caused deafness in mice, but how it functioned in the hearing was unclear. Here we show that disruption of <i>kiaa1024L/minar2</i> causes hearing loss in the zebrafish. Defects in mechanotransduction, longer and thinner hair bundles, and enlarged apical lysosomes in hair cells are observed in <i>kiaa1024L/minar2</i> mutant. In cultured cells, Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is mainly localized to lysosomes and its overexpression recruits cholesterol and increases cholesterol labeling. Strikingly, cholesterol is highly enriched in the hair bundle membrane, and loss of <i>kiaa1024L/minar2</i> reduces cholesterol localization to the hair bundles. Lowering cholesterol levels aggravates, while increasing cholesterol levels rescues hair cell defects in <i>kiaa1024L/minar2</i> mutant. Therefore cholesterol plays an essential role in hair bundles, and Kiaa1024L/Minar2 regulates cholesterol distribution and homeostasis to ensure normal hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulated degradation of the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN2 maintains nuclear envelope architecture and function</a></h4>

              
                Nuclear architecture and functions depend on dynamic interactions between nuclear components (such as chromatin) and inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins. Mutations in INM proteins interfering with these interactions result in disease. However, mechanisms controlling the levels and turnover of INM proteins remain unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism of regulated degradation of the INM SUN domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2). We show that Casein Kinase II and the C-terminal domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1) have opposing effects on SUN2 levels by regulating SUN2 binding to the ubiquitin ligase Skp/Cullin1/F-Box<sup>βTrCP </sup>(SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>). Upon binding to phosphorylated SUN2, SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> promotes its ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated SUN2 is membrane extracted by the AAA ATPase p97 and delivered to the proteasome for degradation. Importantly, accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 results in aberrant nuclear architecture, vulnerability to DNA damage and increased lagging chromosomes in mitosis. These findings uncover a central role of proteolysis in INM protein homeostasis.

                Social deficit is a major feature of neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined neuronal discharge characteristics in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of IRSp53/Baiap2-mutant mice, which show social deficits, during social approach. We found a decrease in the proportion of IRSp53-mutant excitatory mPFC neurons encoding social information, but not that encoding non-social information. In addition, the firing activity of IRSp53-mutant neurons was less differential between social and non-social targets. IRSp53-mutant excitatory mPFC neurons displayed an increase in baseline neuronal firing, but decreases in the variability and dynamic range of firing as well as burst firing during social and non-social target approaches compared to wild-type controls. Treatment of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist that rescues social deficit in IRSp53-mutant mice, alleviates the reduced burst firing of IRSp53-mutant pyramidal mPFC neurons<i>.</i> These results suggest that suppressed neuronal activity dynamics and burst firing may underlie impaired cortical encoding of social information and social behaviors in IRSp53-mutant mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">History information emerges in the cortex during learning</a></h4>

              
                We learn from our experience but the underlying neuronal mechanisms incorporating past information to facilitate learning is relatively unknown. Specifically, which cortical areas encode history-related information and how is this information modulated across learning? To study the relationship between history and learning, we continuously imaged cortex-wide calcium dynamics as mice learn to use their whiskers to discriminate between two different textures. We mainly focused on comparing the same trial type with different history information, i.e., a different preceding trial. We found history information in barrel cortex (BC) during stimulus presentation. Importantly, history information in BC emerged only as the mouse learned the task. Next, we also found learning-dependent history information in rostrolateral (RL) association cortex that emerges before stimulus presentation, preceding activity in BC. History information was also found in other cortical areas and was not related to differences in body movements. Interestingly, a binary classifier could discriminate history information at the single trial level just as well as current information both in BC and RL. These findings suggest that past experience emerges in the cortex around the time of learning, starting from higher-order association area RL and propagating down (i.e., top-down projection) to lower-order BC where it can be integrated with incoming sensory information. This integration between the past and present may facilitate learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dlg5 and Cadherins are key to peripheral glia integrity</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells in the peripheral nerve wrap axons to insulate them and ensure efficient conduction of neuronal signals. In the myelin sheath, it is proposed that the autotypic tight junctions and adherens junctions form glia-glia complexes that stabilize the glia sheath in myelinating glia. Yet the role of adhesion junctions in non-myelinating glia of vertebrates or invertebrates has not been clearly established. Many components of adhering junctions contain PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO1) domains or are recruited to these junctions by PDZ binding motifs. To test for the role of PDZ domain proteins in glial sheath formation, we carried out an RNAi screen using Drosophila melanogaster to knockdown each of the 66 predicted PDZ domain proteins in the peripheral glia. We identified six PDZ genes with potential roles in glial morphology, and further investigated Discs-large 5 (Dlg5), a scaffolding protein with no previously known function in glia. Knockdown of Dlg5 disrupts subperineurial glia (SPG) morphology, including gaps in the membrane that coincide with disruption of septate junction proteins. To further our investigation of Dlg5, we focused on cadherins and found both N-Cadherin and E-Cadherin are expressed throughout peripheral glia. Knockdown of Ecad phenocopied the loss of Dlg5 leading to gaps in the SPG and septate junctions while only simultaneous loss of both N-Cadherins (Ncad, and CadN2) had the same effect. The loss of all three Cadherins enhanced these phenotypes as did loss of Dlg5 when paired with Cadherin knockdown. This leads to a model where Dlg5 plays a role in conjunction with Cadherins in glial membrane stabilization and SJ formation in the subperineurial glia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on whole-brain functional and effective connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics have emerged as promising candidate treatments for various psychiatric conditions, and given their clinical potential, there is a need to identify biomarkers that underlie their effects. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) using regression dynamic causal modelling (rDCM), a novel technique that assesses whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We modelled data from two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trials, in which 45 participants were administered 100 g LSD and placebo in two resting-state fMRI sessions. We compared EC against whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) using classical statistics and machine learning methods. Multivariate analyses of EC parameters revealed widespread increases in interregional connectivity and reduced self-inhibition under LSD compared to placebo, with the notable exception of primarily decreased interregional connectivity and increased self-inhibition in occipital brain regions. This finding suggests that LSD perturbs the Excitation/Inhibition balance of the brain. Moreover, random forests classified LSD vs. placebo states based on FC and EC with comparably high accuracy (FC: 85.56%, EC: 91.11%) suggesting that both EC and FC are promising candidates for clinically-relevant biomarkers of LSD effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gasdermin-E mediates mitochondrial damage in axons and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction and axon loss are hallmarks of neurologic diseases. Gasdermin (GSDM) proteins are executioner pore-forming molecules that mediate cell death, yet their roles in the central nervous system (CNS) are not well understood. Here, we find that one GSDM family member, GSDME is expressed by both mouse and human neurons. GSDME plays a role in mitochondrial damage and axon loss. Mitochondrial neurotoxins induced caspase-dependent GSDME cleavage and rapid localization to mitochondria in axons, where GSDME promoted mitochondrial depolarization, trafficking defects, and neurite retraction. The frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated proteins TDP-43 and PR-50 induced GSDME-mediated damage to mitochondria and neurite loss. GSDME deficiency prolonged survival, ameliorated motor dysfunction, and rescued motor neuron loss in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. GSDME knockdown also protected against neurite loss in ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons. Thus, we identify GSDME as an executioner of neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction that contributes to neurodegeneration.

                A subset of patients suffering from a familial retinitis pigmentosa (RP) carry mutations in several spliceosomal components including PRPF8 protein. Here, we established two novel alleles of murine Prpf8 that genocopy or mimic aberrant PRPF8 found in RP patients - the substitution p.Tyr2334Asn and an extended protein variant p.Glu2331ValfsX15. Homozygous mice expressing either of the aberrant Prpf8 variants developed within first 2 months progressive atrophy of the cerebellum due to extensive granule neuron loss. Comparison of transcriptome from pre-degenerative and degenerative tissues revealed a subset of circRNAs that were deregulated in all tissues and both Prpf8-RP mouse strains. To identify potential risk factors that sensitize cerebellum for Prpf8 mutations we monitored expression of several splicing proteins during first eight weeks. We observed downregulation of all selected splicing proteins in wild-type cerebellum, which coincided with neurodegeneration onset. The decrease in splicing protein expression was further pronounced in mouse strains expressing mutated Prpf8. Collectively, we propose a model where physiological reduction of spliceosomal components during postnatal tissue maturation sensitizes cells to expression of aberrant Prpf8 and the subsequent deregulation of circRNAs triggers neuron death.

                Abstract Brain activity during the resting state is widely used to examine brain organization, cognition and alterations in disease states. While it is known that neuromodulation and the state of alertness impact resting-state activity, neural mechanisms behind such modulation of resting-state activity are unknown. In this work, we used a computational model to demonstrate that cholinergic input influences resting-state activity and its functional connectivity through cellular and synaptic modulation. The results from the computational model match closely with experimental work on direct cholinergic modulation of Default Mode Network (DMN) in rodents. We extend those results to the human connectome derived from diffusion-weighted MRI. In the human resting state simulations, an increase in cholinergic input resulted in a brain-wide reduction of functional connectivity. Further, selective cholinergic modulation of DMN closely captured transitions between the baseline resting state and states with suppressed DMN fluctuations associated with attention to external tasks. Our study thus provides insight into potential neural mechanisms for cholinergic neuromodulation on resting state activity and its dynamics.

                Background: Ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression. However, inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine's molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. Methods: We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled study in which 40 healthy participants received acute ketamine (initial bolus 0.23 mg/kg, continuous infusion 0.58 mg/kg/hour). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity, related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation, and compared it to cortical gene expression targets. Results: We found that: i) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; ii) ketamine's data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, implicating the role of SST and PVALB interneurons in ketamine's acute effects; and iii) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings support the possibility for developing individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcranial magnetic stimulation to frontal but not occipital cortex disrupts endogenous attention</a></h4>

              
                Covert endogenous (voluntary) attention improves visual performance. Human neuroimaging studies suggest that the putative human homolog of macaque FEF (FEF+) is critical for this improvement, whereas early visual areas are not. Yet, MRI methods are correlational, as they do not manipulate brain function. Here we investigated whether rFEF+ or V1/V2 play a causal role in endogenous attention. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to alter activity in visual cortex (Exp.1) or rFEF+ (Exp.2) when observers performed an orientation discrimination task while attention was manipulated. On every trial, they received double-pulse TMS at a predetermined site (stimulated region) around the occipital pole or the rFEF+. Two cortically magnified gratings were presented, one in the stimulated region (contralateral to the stimulated cortical area) and another in the symmetric (ipsilateral) non-stimulated region. Grating contrast was varied to measure contrast response functions (CRFs) for all attention and stimulation combinations. In Exp.1, the CRFs were similar at the stimulated and non-stimulated regions, indicating that early visual areas do not modulate endogenous attention during stimulus presentation. In contrast, occipital TMS eliminates exogenous (involuntary) attention effects on performance (1). In Exp.2, rFEF+ stimulation decreased the overall attentional effect; neither benefits at the attended location nor cost at the unattended location were significant. This pattern is mimicked in the frequency and directionality of microsaccades: Whereas occipital stimulation did not affect microsaccades, rFEF+ stimulation caused a higher microsaccade rate selectively directed toward the stimulated hemifield. These results provide causal evidence of the role of this frontal region for endogenous attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontal stimulation disrupts motor memory consolidation at the micro timescale</a></h4>

              
                Functional brain responses in hippocampo- and striato-cortical networks during initial motor sequence learning (MSL) are critical for memory consolidation. We have recently shown that prefrontal stimulation applied prior to initial MSL can alter these learning-related responses. In the present study, we investigated whether such stimulation-induced modulations of brain responses can influence motor memory consolidation at different timescales. Specifically, we examined the effect of prefrontal stimulation on the behavioral and neural responses associated to (i) fast consolidation processes occurring during short rest episodes interspersed with practice during initial learning (i.e., micro timescale) and (ii) slow consolidation process taking place across practice sessions separated by 24h (i.e., macro timescale). To do so, we applied active (inhibitory or facilitatory) or control theta-burst stimulation to the prefrontal cortex of young healthy participants before they were trained on an MSL task while their brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Motor performance was retested, in the MRI scanner, after a night of sleep. Both our behavioral and brain imaging results indicate that while stimulation did not modulate consolidation at the macro timescale, it disrupted the micro-offline consolidation process. Specifically, our behavioral data indicate that active - as compared to control - stimulation resulted in a decrease in micro-offline gains in performance over the short rest intervals. At the brain level, stimulation disrupted activity in the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus during the micro-offline intervals. Additionally, multivariate pattern persistence from task into inter-practice rest episodes - which is thought to reflect the reactivation of learning-related patterns - was hindered by active prefrontal stimulation in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. Importantly, stimulation also altered the link between the brain and the behavioral markers of the micro-offline consolidation process. These results collectively suggest that active prefrontal stimulation prior to MSL disrupted both the behavioral and neural correlates of motor memory consolidation at the micro timescale.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential Patterns of Synaptic Plasticity in the Nucleus Accumbens Caused by Continuous and Interrupted Morphine Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Opioid exposure and withdrawal both cause adaptations in brain circuits that may contribute to abuse liability. These adaptations vary in magnitude and direction following different patterns of opioid exposure, but few studies have systematically manipulated the pattern of opioid administration while measuring neurobiological impact. In this study, we compared cellular and synaptic adaptations in the nucleus accumbens shell caused by morphine exposure that was either continuous, or interrupted by daily bouts of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. At the behavioral level, continuous morphine administration caused psychomotor tolerance, which was reversed when the continuity of morphine action was interrupted by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Using ex vivo slice electrophysiology in female and male mice, we investigated how these patterns of morphine administration altered intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. We found that morphine-evoked adaptations at excitatory synapses were predominately conserved between patterns of administration, but there were divergent effects on inhibitory synapses and the subsequent balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Overall, our data suggest that continuous morphine administration produces adaptations that dampen the output of D1-MSNs, which are canonically thought to promote reward-related behaviors. Interruption of otherwise continuous morphine exposure does not dampen D1-MSN functional output to the same extent, which may enhance behavioral responses to subsequent opioid exposure. Our findings support the hypothesis that maintaining continuity of opioid administration could be an effective therapeutic strategy to minimize the vulnerability to opioid use disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Letrozole delays acquisition of water maze task in female BALB/c mice: possible involvement of anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor (AI), is used as an adjuvant therapy in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Similar to other AIs, it induces many side effects, including impaired cognition. Despite its negative effect in humans, results from animal models are inconsistent and suggest that letrozole can either impair or improve cognition. Here we studied effects of letrozole on cognitive behavior of adult female BALB/c mice, a relevant animal model for breast cancer studies. Mice were continuously treated with once-a-day subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of letrozole (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg/day) or vehicle and subjected to behavioral testing starting on day 21 after treatment initiation. During the treatments, vaginal smears were taken from the mice to evaluate estrous cyclicity. Both doses of letrozole suspended cyclicity and the smears showed that the mice were in constant metestrus. Exposure to letrozole did not significantly affect response to novelty measured as a locomotor activity in open field. However, repeated testing in open field (4 days x 15 min) revealed that letrozole 0.3 mg/kg facilitated locomotor habituation (a form of non-associative learning), significantly reducing locomotor activity on 3rd and 4th day of testing. These findings suggest that certain doses of letrozole may have positive effects on cognitive behavior. Training to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze (15 days x 4 trials), however, indicated that letrozole 0.1 mg/kg-treated mice had significant learning impairment, as, throughout the training, they swam longer times than vehicle-treated mice to reach the hidden platform. Similarly, in a probe test performed 72 h after the last day of the training, letrozole 0.1 mg/kg-treated mice did not show preference for the training platform zones. These results indicate that cognitive impairments reported by women treated with letrozole can be captured in BALB/c mice treated with clinically relevant doses of the drug. Interestingly, most of the letrozole 0.1 mg/kg-treated mice were able to learn the new platform position in reversal training and performed similar to control mice in a reversal probe test. Results of the reversal test suggest that letrozole did not completely disrupt spatial navigation but rather delayed acquisition of spatial information. The current study shows that letrozole dose dependently modulates behavioral response and that its effects are task dependent.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FUS regulates RAN translation through modulating the G-quadruplex structure of GGGGCC repeat RNA in C9orf72-linked ALS/FTD</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal expansions of GGGGCC repeat sequence in the noncoding region of the C9orf72 gene is the most common cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). The expanded repeat sequence is translated into dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) by noncanonical repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Since DPRs play central roles in the pathogenesis of C9-ALS/FTD, we here investigate the regulatory mechanisms of RAN translation, focusing on the effects of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) targeting GGGGCC repeat RNAs. Using C9-ALS/FTD model flies, we demonstrated that the ALS/FTD-linked RBP FUS suppresses RAN translation and neurodegeneration in an RNA-binding activity-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that FUS directly binds to and modulates the G-quadruplex structure of GGGGCC repeat RNA as an RNA chaperone, resulting in the suppression of RAN translation in vitro. These results reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of RAN translation by G-quadruplex-targeting RBPs, providing therapeutic insights for C9-ALS/FTD and other repeat expansion diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Preservation of prehearing spontaneous activityenables early auditory system development in deaf mice</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically generated neural activity propagates through the developing auditory system to promote maturation and refinement of sound processing circuits prior to hearing onset. This early patterned activity is induced by non-sensory supporting cells in the organ of Corti, which are highly interconnected through gap junctions containing connexin 26 (Gjb2). Although loss of function mutations in Gjb2 impair cochlear development and are the most common cause of congenital deafness, it is not known if these mutations disrupt spontaneous activity and the developmental trajectory of sound processing circuits in the brain. Here, we show in a new mouse model of Gjb2-mediated congenital deafness that cochlear supporting cells unexpectedly retained intercellular coupling and the capacity to generate spontaneous activity, exhibiting only modest deficits prior to hearing onset. This coordinated activation of IHCs led to coincident bursts of activity in central auditory neurons that will later process similar frequencies of sound. Despite alterations in the structure of the sensory epithelium, hair cells within the cochlea of Gjb2 deficient mice were intact and central auditory neurons could be activated within appropriate tonotopic domains by loud sounds at hearing onset, indicating that early maturation and refinement of auditory circuits was preserved. Only after cessation of spontaneous activity following hearing onset did progressive hair cell degeneration and enhanced auditory neuron excitability manifest. This preservation of cochlear spontaneous activity in the absence of connexin 26 may increase the effectiveness of early therapeutic interventions to restore hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural basis of melodic learning explains cross-cultural regularities in musical scales</a></h4>

              
                Seeking exposure to unfamiliar experiences constitutes an essential aspect of the human condition, and the brain must adapt to the constantly changing environment by learning the evolving statistical patterns emerging from it. Cultures are shaped by norms and conventions and therefore novel exposure to an unfamiliar culture induces a type of learning that is often described as implicit: when exposed to a set of stimuli constrained by unspoken rules, cognitive systems must rapidly build a mental representation of the underlying grammar. Music offers a unique opportunity to investigate this implicit statistical learning, as sequences of tones forming melodies exhibit structural properties learned by listeners during short- and long-term exposure. Understanding which specific structural properties of music enhance learning in naturalistic learning conditions reveals hard-wired properties of cognitive systems while elucidating the prevalence of these features across cultural variations. Here we provide behavioral and neural evidence that the prevalence of non-uniform musical scales may be explained by their facilitating effects on melodic learning. In this study, melodies were generated using an artificial grammar with either a uniform (rare) or non-uniform (prevalent) scale. After a short exposure phase, listeners had to detect ungrammatical new melodies while their EEG responses were recorded. Listeners' performance on the task suggested that the extent of statistical learning during music listening depended on the musical scale context: non-uniform scales yielded better syntactic learning. This behavioral effect was mirrored by enhanced encoding of musical syntax in the context of non-uniform scales, which further suggests that their prevalence stems from fundamental properties of learning.

                A major challenge in neurosciences is the elucidation of neural mechanisms in brains that are crucial for the processing of sensory information and the generation of adaptive behavior. In conjunction with the ever-growing body of experimental data, computational simulations have become crucial in integrating information and testing hypotheses, requiring fast large-scale simulators. We constructed a whole-brain neural circuit model of the fly Drosophila with biophysically detailed multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models based on the morphologies of individual neurons published in open databases. Performance tuning of the simulator enabled near real-time simulation of the resting state of the Drosophila whole-brain model in the large-scale computational environment of the supercomputer Fugaku, for which we achieved in excess of 630 TFLOPS using 480k cores. In our whole-brain model, neural circuit dynamics related to a standard insect learning paradigm, the association of taste rewards with odors could be simulated.

                As an organism develops, a zygote becomes the body through repeated cell division. This process produces the mitotic family tree, and cells specialize into their ultimate phenotype through interaction with other cells but also through the history of divisions. Biologists often cluster cells in the body into "cell types," using e.g. their morphologies and molecular makeup. While morphomolecular cell type carries information about phenotype and function, there may be unknown, missing information available in this family tree. Emerging methods are making these lineage trees progressively observable. Here, using the complete mitotic family tree and connectome of the nematode C. elegans we ask about the role of cell-types and their family tree. We can thus evaluate how well we can predict synaptic connection with only cell-type information versus with the family tree lineage. We show that neglecting lineage can produce misleading insights into the mechanisms underlying neural wiring: underlying lineage can confound the effect of cell type. These results suggest that the concept of cell-type needs to be re-thought in the context of this emerging knowledge about cell lineage.

                MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that regulate fundamental biological processes. miR-132, a key miRNA with established functions in Tau homeostasis and neuroprotection, is consistently downregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. miR-132 overexpression rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in several AD models. To complement research on miRNA-mimicking oligonucleotides targeting the central nervous system, we developed a high-throughput-screen coupled high-throughput-sequencing (HTS-HTS) in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons to identify small molecule inducers of miR-132. We discovered that cardiac glycosides, which are canonical sodium-potassium ATPase inhibitors, selectively upregulated miR-132 in the sub-M range. Coordinately, cardiac glycoside treatment downregulated total and phosphorylated Tau in rodent and human neurons and protected against toxicity by glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, rotenone, and A{beta} oligomers. In conclusion, we identified small-molecule drugs that upregulated the neuroprotective miR-132 and ameliorated neurodegenerative phenotypes. Our dataset also represents a comprehensive resource for discovering small molecules that modulate specific miRNAs for therapeutic purposes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reconstructing Computational Dynamics from Neural Measurements with Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Mechanistic and computational models in neuroscience usually take the form of systems of differential or time-recursive equations. The spatio-temporal behavior of such systems is the subject of dynamical systems theory (DST). DST provides a powerful mathematical toolbox for describing and analyzing neurobiological processes at any level, from molecules to behavior, and has been a mainstay of computational neuroscience for decades. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) became a popular machine learning tool for studying the nonlinear dynamics underlying neural or behavioral observations. By training RNNs on the same behavioral tasks as employed for animal subjects and dissecting their inner workings, insights and hypotheses about the neuro-computational underpinnings of behavior could be generated. Alternatively, RNNs may be trained directly on the physiological and behavioral time series at hand. Ideally, the once trained RNN would then be able to generate data with the same temporal and geometrical properties as those observed. This is called dynamical systems reconstruction, a burgeoning field in machine learning and nonlinear dynamics. Through this more powerful approach the trained RNN becomes a surrogate for the experimentally probed system, as far as its dynamical and computational properties are concerned. The trained system can then be systematically analyzed, probed and simulated. Here we will review this highly exciting and rapidly expanding field, including recent trends in machine learning that may as yet be less well known in neuroscience. We will also discuss important validation tests, caveats, and requirements of RNN-based dynamical systems reconstruction. Concepts and applications will be illustrated with various examples from neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical microstructural gradients capture memory network reorganization in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), one of the most common pharmaco-resistant epilepsies, is associated with pathology of paralimbic brain regions, particularly in the mesiotemporal lobe. Cognitive dysfunction in TLE is frequent, and particularly affects episodic memory. Crucially, these difficulties challenge the quality of life of patients, sometimes more than seizures, underscoring the need to assess neural processes of cognitive dysfunction in TLE to improve patient management. Our work harnessed a novel conceptual and analytical approach to assess spatial gradients of microstructural differentiation between cortical areas based on high-resolution MRI analysis. Gradients track region-to-region variations in intracortical lamination and myeloarchitecture, serving as a system-level measure of structural and functional reorganization. Comparing cortex-wide microstructural gradients between 21 patients and 35 healthy controls, we observed a contracted gradient in TLE driven by reduced microstructural differentiation between paralimbic cortices and the remaining cortex with marked abnormalities in ipsilateral temporopolar and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Findings were replicated in an independent cohort. Using an independent post mortem dataset, we observed that in vivo findings reflected topographical variations in cortical lamination patterns, confirming that TLE-related changes in the microstructural gradient reflected increased proximity of regions with more dissimilar laminar structure. Disease-related transcriptomics could furthermore show specificity of our findings to TLE over other common epilepsy syndromes. Finally, microstructural dedifferentiation was associated with cognitive network reorganization seen during an episodic memory functional MRI paradigm, and correlated with inter-individual differences in task accuracy. Collectively, our findings showing a pattern of reduced microarchitectural differentiation between paralimbic regions and the remaining cortex provide a parsimonious explanation for functional network reorganization and cognitive dysfunction characteristic of TLE.

                The purpose of this paper is to serve as an instructive resource and a reference catalog for biologically plausible modeling with i) conductance-based models, coupled with ii) strength varying slow synapse models, culminating in iii) two canonical pair-wise rhythm-generating networks. We document the properties of basic network components: cell models and synaptic models, which are prerequisites for proper network assembly. Using the slow-fast decomposition we present a detailed analysis of the cellular dynamics including a discussion of the most relevant bifurcations. Several approaches to model synaptic coupling are also discussed, and a new logistic model of slow synapses is introduced. Finally, we describe and examine two types of bicellular rhythm-generating networks: i) half center oscillators ii) excitatory-inhibitory pairs and elucidate a key principle - the network hysteresis underlying the stable onset of emergent slow bursting in these neural building blocks. These two cell networks are a basis for more complicated neural circuits of rhythmogenesis and feature in our models of swim central pattern generators.

                The LC is a brainstem region associated with broad physiological and neural arousal as part of the release of norepinephrine, but it has increasingly been associated with multiple specific cognitive processes. These include sustained attention, deficits in which are associated with a variety of neuropsychological disorders. Neural models of attention deficits to date have focused on interrupted dynamics between the salience network (SAL) with the fronto-parietal network (FPN), which has been associated with task-switching and processing of external stimuli, respectively. Conflicting findings based on these regions suggest the possibility of upstream signaling leading to attention dysfunction, and recent research suggest the LC may play this role. In this study, resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and behavioral performance on an attention task was examined within 584 individuals. Analysis revealed significant clusters connected to the LC activity in the bilateral insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral ventral striatum, all regions associated with the SAL. Given previous findings that attention deficits may be caused by dysfunctions in network switching by the SAL, our findings here further suggest that dysfunction in LC signaling to the SAL may interfere with attention.

                Homeostatic (anti-Hebbian) forms of synaptic are effective at eliminating "prediction errors" that signal the differences between predicted and actual sensory input. However, such mechanisms appear to preclude the possibility of transmitting the resulting predictions to downstream circuits, severely limiting their utility. Using modeling and recordings from the electrosensory lobe of mormyrid fish, we reveal interactions between axonal and dendritic spikes that support both the learning and transmission of predictions. We find that sensory input modulates the rate of dendritic spikes by adjusting the amplitude of backpropagating axonal action potentials. Homeostatic plasticity counteracts these effects through changes in the underlying membrane potential, allowing the dendritic spike rate to be restored to equilibrium while simultaneously transmitting predictions through modulation of the axonal spike rate. These results reveal how two types of spikes dramatically enhance the computational power of single neurons in support of an ethologically relevant multi-layer computation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GluK2 Q/R editing regulates kainate receptor signalling and synaptic AMPA receptor expression and function.</a></h4>

              
                Q/R editing of kainate receptor (KAR) subunit GluK2 pre-mRNA replaces a genetically encoded glutamine to an arginine residue in the channel pore to alter the biophysical and trafficking properties of assembled KARs in recombinant systems. However, the consequences of GluK2 Q/R editing in vivo remain largely unexplored. Here we investigated differences between GluK2-editing deficient mice, that express ~95% unedited GluK2(Q) compared to wild-type counterparts that express ~85% edited GluK2(R). At hippocampal mossy fibre-CA3 (MF-CA3) synapses the editing-deficient (GluK2(Q)) mice displayed enhanced postsynaptic KAR function and increased KAR-mediated presynaptic facilitation, demonstrating heightened ionotropic function. Conversely, KAR-mediated metabotropic function, measured by regulation of afterhyperpolarization currents, was reduced in GluK2(Q) mice. Moreover, GluK2(Q) mice had fewer GluA1-containing synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and reduced postsynaptic AMPAR currents at MF-CA3 synapses. Using patterns of stimulation that replicate physiological activity, we show that GluK2(Q) mice have reduced long-term potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission at Schaffer collateral synapses. These findings indicate that GluK2 Q/R editing influences the balance of ionotropic versus metabotropic KAR signalling and regulates synaptic AMPAR expression and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hearing elliptic movements reveals the imprint of action on prototypical geometries</a></h4>

              
                Within certain categories of geometric shapes, prototypical exemplars that best characterize the category have been evidenced. These geometric prototypes are classically identified through the visual and haptic perception or motor production and are usually characterized by their spatial dimension. However, whether prototypes can be recalled through the auditory channel has not been formally investigated. Here we address this question by using auditory cues issued from timbre-modulated friction sounds evoking human drawing elliptic movements. Since non-spatial auditory cues were previously found useful for discriminating distinct geometric shapes such as circles or ellipses, it is hypothesized that sound dynamics alone can evoke shapes such as an exemplary ellipse. Four experiments were conducted and altogether revealed that a common elliptic prototype emerges from auditory, visual, and motor modalities. This finding supports the hypothesis of a common coding of geometric shapes according to biological rules with a prominent role of sensory-motor contingencies in the emergence of such prototypical geometry.

                Neuropeptides are ancient, widespread signaling molecules that underpin almost all brain functions. They constitute a broad ligand-receptor network, mainly by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the organization of the peptidergic network and roles of many neuropeptides remain elusive, as our insight into neuropeptide-receptor interactions is limited and many peptide GPCRs in animal models and humans are still orphan receptors. Here we report a genome-wide neuropeptide-GPCR interaction map in C. elegans. By reverse pharmacology screening of over 55,384 possible interactions, we identify 461 cognate peptide-GPCR couples that uncover a broad signaling network with specific and complex combinatorial interactions encoded across and within single peptidergic genes. These interactions provide insights into neuropeptide functions and evolution. Combining our dataset with phylogenetic analysis supports peptide-receptor co-evolution and conservation of at least 14 bilaterian peptidergic systems in C. elegans. This resource lays a foundation for system-wide analysis of the peptidergic network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Axon guidance pathways modulate neurotoxicity of ALS-associated UBQLN2</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the ubiquitin (Ub) chaperone Ubiquilin 2 (UBQLN2) cause X-linked forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that aggregation-prone, ALS-associated mutants of UBQLN2 (UBQLN2ALS) trigger heat stress-dependent neurodegeneration in Drosophila. A genetic modifier screen implicated endolysosomal and axon guidance genes, including the netrin receptor, Unc-5, as key modulators of UBQLN2 toxicity. Reduced gene dosage of Unc-5 or its coreceptor Dcc/frazzled diminished neurodegenerative phenotypes, including motor dysfunction, neuromuscular junction defects, and shortened lifespan, in flies expressing UBQLN2ALS alleles. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) harboring UBQLN2ALS knockin mutations exhibited lysosomal defects while inducible motor neurons (iMNs) expressing UBQLN2ALS alleles exhibited cytosolic UBQLN2 inclusions, reduced neurite complexity, and growth cone defects that were partially reversed by silencing of UNC5B and DCC. The combined findings suggest that altered growth cone dynamics are a conserved pathomechanism in UBQLN2-associated ALS/FTD.

                Background: Psychedelics have resurged in neuroscience and psychiatry with promising success in psychedelic-assisted therapy for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and addiction. At the cellular level, psychedelics elicit neuroplastic processes 24 hours after administration, priming neural circuits for change. The acute effects of psychedelics are well characterized with functional imaging and neural oscillations showing an increase in the entropy of spontaneous cortical activity. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that cortical-striatal oscillations recorded in rats would confirm the effects of psychedelics. We also hypothesized that brain stimulation delivered 24 hours after LSD administration would lead to different effects than brain stimulation alone. Methods: We recorded local field potential (LFP) oscillations from rats following lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or saline administration and determined if exposure to these treatments altered the effect of a targeted intervention (brain stimulation) 24 hours later. Results: We confirmed acutely decreased low frequency power across the brain when rats are given LSD. We also demonstrated these altered states return to baseline after 24 hours. Brain stimulation applied in this window of heightened neuroplasticity produced distinct shifts in brain state compared to brain stimulation applied 24 hours after saline. Conclusions: Despite the acute effects of LSD disappearing after 24 hours, there are still latent effects that synergize with brain stimulation to create different changes in brain activity compared to brain stimulation alone. Our findings are the first to suggest that psychedelics could have a role clinically in combination with brain stimulation to achieve enhanced effects on brain activity and clinical outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">YTHDF2 in dentate gyrus is the m6A reader mediating m6A modification in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory</a></h4>

              
                N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been demonstrated to regulate learning and memory in mice. To investigate the mechanism by which m6A modification exerts its function through its reader proteins in the hippocampus, as well as to unveil the specific subregions of the hippocampus that are crucial for memory formation, we generated dentate gyrus (DG)-, CA3-, and CA1-specific Ythdf1 and Ythdf2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice, respectively. Surprisingly, we found that only the DG-specific Ythdf2 cKO mice displayed impaired memory formation, which is inconsistent with the previous report showing that YTHDF1 was involved in this process. YTHDF2 controls the stability of its target transcripts which encode proteins that regulate the elongation of mossy fibers (MF), the axons of granule cells in DG. DG-specific Ythdf2 ablation caused MF overgrowth and impairment of the MF-CA3 excitatory synapse development and transmission in the stratum lucidum. Thus, this study identifies the m6A reader YTHDF2 in dentate gyrus as the only regulator that mediates m6A modification in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.

                CD8 T cell engagement of brain vasculature is a putative mechanism of neuropathology in human cerebral malaria. To define contributions of brain endothelial cell MHC class I antigen-presentation to CD8 T cells in establishing this pathology, we developed novel H-2Kb LoxP and H-2Db LoxP mice crossed with Cdh5-Cre mice to achieve targeted deletion of discrete class I molecules on brain endothelium. Using the Plasmodium berghei ANKA model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), we observe that H-2Kb and H-2Db regulate distinct patterns of disease onset, CD8 T cell infiltration, targeted cell death, and regional blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Strikingly, ablation of H-2Kb or H-2Db from brain endothelial cells resulted in reduced CD8 T cell activation, attenuated T cell interaction with brain vasculature, lessened targeted cell death, preserved BBB integrity, and prevented ECM and the death of the animal. These data demonstrate that interactions of CD8 T cells with discrete MHC class I molecules on brain endothelium regulate development of ECM neuropathology. Therefore, targeting MHC class I interactions therapeutically may hold potential for treatment of cases of severe malaria.

                Mossy cells comprise a large fraction of excitatory neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and their loss is one of the major hallmarks of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The vulnerability of mossy cells in TLE is well known in animal models as well as in patients, however the mechanisms leading to cellular death is unclear. One possible explanation for their sensitivity is linked to their specific ion channel composition. TRPM4 is a Ca2+-activated non-selective cation channel regulating diverse physiological function of excitable cells. Here, we identified that TRPM4 is present and functionally active in hilar mossy cells. Furthermore, we showed that TRPM4 contributes to mossy cells death following status epilepticus and therefore modulates seizure susceptibility and epilepsy-related memory deficits in the chronic phase of TLE.

	<p>This study aimed to determine whether dissociative symptoms and childhood trauma (CT) may help identify a specific subgroup of patients among those hospitalized for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We assessed 587 patients hospitalized for an AUD in a French addiction rehabilitation center (cross-sectional study) regarding dissociative symptoms (DES-taxon), childhood trauma (CTQ), depression (BDI), anxiety (STAI-state and STAI-trait), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; PCL-5), and AUD symptoms (AUDIT). We ran a hierarchical cluster analysis and compared the clusters in terms of dissociation and CT, as well as AUD, depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. We identified three clusters of patients: (1) patients with low AUD severity and low dissociation (LALD); (2) patients with high AUD severity and low dissociation (HALD); (3) patients with high AUD severity and high dissociation (HAHD). Patients from the HAHD group had significantly higher dissociation and more severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms than those with LALD and HALD. They also reported more emotional and sexual abuse than those with LALD. Among patients with an AUD, those with high dissociation may constitute an independent subgroup that exhibits a higher prevalence for CT and higher AUD severity, as well as higher depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Patients with more severe AUD and associated psychiatric symptoms should be systematically screened for dissociation and provided with tailor-based treatments.</p>

	<p>Background: Rathke&amp;amp;rsquo;s cleft cysts (RCC) arise from the pars intermedia because of incomplete regression of the embryologic Rathke pouch. A subset of RCC becomes symptomatic causing headaches, visual and endocrinological disturbances such that surgical intervention is indicated. Several points in surgical management remain controversial including operative strategy (simple fenestration (SF) vs complete cyst wall resection (CWR)) as well as reconstructive techniques. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of pathologically confirmed RCC operated on by endoscopic endonasal approach from 2006 to 2019. Pre-operative symptoms, imaging characteristics, operative strategy, symptom response, complications and recurrences were recorded. Results: Thirty-nine patients were identified. Thirty-three underwent SF and six underwent CWR. Worsening pituitary function was significantly increased with CWR (50%) compared to SF (3%) (p = 0.008). All patients underwent &amp;amp;ldquo;closed&amp;amp;rdquo; reconstruction with a post-operative CSF leak rate of 5% (3% SF vs 16% CWR, p = 0.287). Six (15%) recurrences necessitating surgery were reported. Recurrence rates stratified by surgical technique (18% SF vs 0% CWR, p = 0.564) were not found to be significantly different. Conclusions: The current series illustrates variability in the surgical management of RCCs. SF with closed reconstruction is a reasonable operative strategy for most symptomatic RCCs cases while CWR can be reserved for selected cases.</p>

	<p>Surgical area nurses provide comprehensive care to patients throughout the surgical process. Increases in life expectancy lead to the appearance and development of diseases, translating into an increase in the number of necessary interventions. Increases in the workload can be another risk factor for the development of burnout in professionals in this area. Knowledge of psychological and personality-related variables provides relevant information of level changes in the dimensions of burnout syndrome. Three logistic regression models, based on a cross-sectional study with 214 nurses working in the surgical area in the Andalusian Health Service, Spain, were built for each dimension. These models included different variables related to depression and personality, with some being significant at the population level and consequently true risk or protection factors. Friendliness, responsibility and extraversion are protection factors for the personal accomplishment dimension, whilst neuroticism is a risk factor for this dimension. Friendliness is also a protection factor for depersonalization, whilst depression is a risk factor. Finally, neuroticism, responsibility and depression are risk factors for the emotional exhaustion dimension of burnout. These findings provide relevant information that makes anticipation of this syndrome in this group easier.</p>

	<p>Background: The diagnosis of hydrocephalus is mainly based on imaging findings. However, the significance of many imaging indicators may change, especially in some degenerative diseases, and even lead to misdiagnosis. Methods: This study explored the effectiveness of commonly used morphological parameters and typical radiographic findings in hydrocephalus diagnosis. The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; imaging data were divided into three groups, including the hydrocephalus group, the symptomatic group, and the normal control group. The diagnostic validity and weight of various parameters were compared between groups by multiple machine learning methods. Results: Our results demonstrated that Evans&amp;amp;rsquo; ratio is the most valuable diagnostic indicator compared to the hydrocephalus group and the normal control group. But frontal horns&amp;amp;rsquo; ratio is more useful in diagnosing patients with symptoms. Meanwhile, the sign of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space and third ventricle enlargement could be effective diagnostic indicators in all situations. Conclusion: Both morphometric parameters and radiological features were essential in diagnosing hydrocephalus, but the weights are different in different situations. The machine learning approaches can be applied to optimize the diagnosis of other diseases and consistently update the clinical diagnostic criteria.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Controlling microbial co-culture based on substrate pulsing can lead to stability through differential fitness advantages</a></h4>

              
                <p>by J. Andres Martinez, Matheo Delvenne, Lucas Henrion, Fabian Moreno, Samuel Telek, Christian Dusny, Frank Delvigne</p>

Microbial consortia are an exciting alternative for increasing the performances of bioprocesses for the production of complex metabolic products. However, the functional properties of microbial communities remain challenging to control, considering the complex interaction mechanisms occurring between co-cultured microbial species. Indeed, microbial communities are highly dynamic and can adapt to changing environmental conditions through complex mechanisms, such as phenotypic diversification. We focused on stabilizing a co-culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli in continuous cultures. Our preliminary data pointed out that transient diauxic shifts could lead to stable co-culture by providing periodic fitness advantages to the yeast. Based on a computational toolbox called MONCKS (for MONod-type Co-culture Kinetic Simulation), we were able to predict the dynamics of diauxic shift for both species based on a cybernetic approach. This toolbox was further used to predict the frequency of diauxic shift to be applied to reach co-culture stability. These simulations were successfully reproduced experimentally in continuous bioreactors with glucose pulsing. Finally, based on a bet-hedging reporter, we observed that the yeast population exhibited an increased phenotypic diversification process in co-culture compared with mono-culture, suggesting that this mechanism could be the basis of the metabolic fitness of the yeast.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DMFpred: Predicting protein disorder molecular functions based on protein cubic language model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yihe Pang, Bin Liu</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDP/IDRs) are widespread in living organisms and perform various essential molecular functions. These functions are summarized as six general categories, including entropic chain, assembler, scavenger, effector, display site, and chaperone. The alteration of IDP functions is responsible for many human diseases. Therefore, identifying the function of disordered proteins is helpful for the studies of drug target discovery and rational drug design. Experimental identification of the molecular functions of IDP in the wet lab is an expensive and laborious procedure that is not applicable on a large scale. Some computational methods have been proposed and mainly focus on predicting the entropic chain function of IDRs, while the computational predictive methods for the remaining five important categories of disordered molecular functions are desired. Motivated by the growing numbers of experimental annotated functional sequences and the need to expand the coverage of disordered protein function predictors, we proposed DMFpred for disordered molecular functions prediction, covering disordered assembler, scavenger, effector, display site and chaperone. DMFpred employs the Protein Cubic Language Model (PCLM), which incorporates three protein language models for characterizing sequences, structural and functional features of proteins, and attention-based alignment for understanding the relationship among three captured features and generating a joint representation of proteins. The PCLM was pre-trained with large-scaled IDR sequences and fine-tuned with functional annotation sequences for molecular function prediction. The predictive performance evaluation on five categories of functional and multi-functional residues suggested that DMFpred provides high-quality predictions. The web-server of DMFpred can be freely accessed from http://bliulab.net/DMFpred/.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">G2Φnet: Relating genotype and biomechanical phenotype of tissues with deep learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Enrui Zhang, Bart Spronck, Jay D. Humphrey, George Em Karniadakis</p>

Many genetic mutations adversely affect the structure and function of load-bearing soft tissues, with clinical sequelae often responsible for disability or death. Parallel advances in genetics and histomechanical characterization provide significant insight into these conditions, but there remains a pressing need to integrate such information. We present a novel genotype-to-biomechanical phenotype neural network (G2Φnet) for characterizing and classifying biomechanical properties of soft tissues, which serve as important functional readouts of tissue health or disease. We illustrate the utility of our approach by inferring the nonlinear, genotype-dependent constitutive behavior of the aorta for four mouse models involving defects or deficiencies in extracellular constituents. We show that G2Φnet can infer the biomechanical response while simultaneously ascribing the associated genotype by utilizing limited, noisy, and unstructured experimental data. More broadly, G2Φnet provides a powerful method and a paradigm shift for correlating genotype and biomechanical phenotype quantitatively, promising a better understanding of their interplay in biological tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mutual influence between language and perception in multi-agent communication games</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xenia Ohmer, Michael Marino, Michael Franke, Peter König</p>

Language interfaces with many other cognitive domains. This paper explores how interactions at these interfaces can be studied with deep learning methods, focusing on the relation between language emergence and visual perception. To model the emergence of language, a sender and a receiver agent are trained on a reference game. The agents are implemented as deep neural networks, with dedicated vision and language modules. Motivated by the mutual influence between language and perception in cognition, we apply systematic manipulations to the agents’ (i) visual representations, to analyze the effects on emergent communication, and (ii) communication protocols, to analyze the effects on visual representations. Our analyses show that perceptual biases shape semantic categorization and communicative content. Conversely, if the communication protocol partitions object space along certain attributes, agents learn to represent visual information about these attributes more accurately, and the representations of communication partners align. Finally, an evolutionary analysis suggests that visual representations may be shaped in part to facilitate the communication of environmentally relevant distinctions. Aside from accounting for co-adaptation effects between language and perception, our results point out ways to modulate and improve visual representation learning and emergent communication in artificial agents.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Getting higher on rugged landscapes: Inversion mutations open access to fitter adaptive peaks in NK fitness landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leonardo Trujillo, Paul Banse, Guillaume Beslon</p>

Molecular evolution is often conceptualised as adaptive walks on rugged fitness landscapes, driven by mutations and constrained by incremental fitness selection. It is well known that epistasis shapes the ruggedness of the landscape’s surface, outlining their topography (with high-fitness peaks separated by valleys of lower fitness genotypes). However, within the strong selection weak mutation (SSWM) limit, once an adaptive walk reaches a local peak, natural selection restricts passage through downstream paths and hampers any possibility of reaching higher fitness values. Here, in addition to the widely used point mutations, we introduce a minimal model of sequence inversions to simulate adaptive walks. We use the well known NK model to instantiate rugged landscapes. We show that adaptive walks can reach higher fitness values through inversion mutations, which, compared to point mutations, allows the evolutionary process to escape local fitness peaks. To elucidate the effects of this chromosomal rearrangement, we use a graph-theoretical representation of accessible mutants and show how new evolutionary paths are uncovered. The present model suggests a simple mechanistic rationale to analyse escapes from local fitness peaks in molecular evolution driven by (intragenic) structural inversions and reveals some consequences of the limits of point mutations for simulations of molecular evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Vigilance, arousal, and acetylcholine: Optimal control of attention in a simple detection task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sahiti Chebolu, Peter Dayan, Kevin Lloyd</p>

Paying attention to particular aspects of the world or being more vigilant in general can be interpreted as forms of ‘internal’ action. Such arousal-related choices come with the benefit of increasing the quality and situational appropriateness of information acquisition and processing, but incur potentially expensive energetic and opportunity costs. One implementational route for these choices is widespread ascending neuromodulation, including by acetylcholine (ACh). The key computational question that elective attention poses for sensory processing is when it is worthwhile paying these costs, and this includes consideration of whether sufficient information has yet been collected to justify the higher signal-to-noise ratio afforded by greater attention and, particularly if a change in attentional state is more expensive than its maintenance, when states of heightened attention ought to persist. We offer a partially observable Markov decision-process treatment of optional attention in a detection task, and use it to provide a qualitative model of the results of studies using modern techniques to measure and manipulate ACh in rodents performing a similar task.

                <p>by Eric Lewitus, Jennifer Hoang, Yifan Li, Hongjun Bai, Morgane Rolland</p>

The immense global diversity of HIV-1 is a significant obstacle to developing a safe and effective vaccine. We recently showed that infections established with multiple founder variants are associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. We propose a novel vaccine design strategy that integrates the variability observed in acute HIV-1 infections with multiple founder variants. We developed a probabilistic model to simulate this variability, yielding a set of sequences that present the minimal diversity seen in an infection with multiple founders. We applied this model to a subtype C consensus sequence for the Envelope (Env) (used as input) and showed that the simulated Env sequences mimic the mutational landscape of an infection with multiple founder variants, including diversity at antibody epitopes. The derived set of multi-founder-variant-like, minimally distant antigens is designed to be used as a vaccine cocktail specific to a HIV-1 subtype or circulating recombinant form and is expected to promote the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Navigation task and action space drive the emergence of egocentric and allocentric spatial representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sandhiya Vijayabaskaran, Sen Cheng</p>

In general, strategies for spatial navigation could employ one of two spatial reference frames: egocentric or allocentric. Notwithstanding intuitive explanations, it remains unclear however under what circumstances one strategy is chosen over another, and how neural representations should be related to the chosen strategy. Here, we first use a deep reinforcement learning model to investigate whether a particular type of navigation strategy arises spontaneously during spatial learning without imposing a bias onto the model. We then examine the spatial representations that emerge in the network to support navigation. To this end, we study two tasks that are ethologically valid for mammals—guidance, where the agent has to navigate to a goal location fixed in allocentric space, and aiming, where the agent navigates to a visible cue. We find that when both navigation strategies are available to the agent, the solutions it develops for guidance and aiming are heavily biased towards the allocentric or the egocentric strategy, respectively, as one might expect. Nevertheless, the agent can learn both tasks using either type of strategy. Furthermore, we find that place-cell-like allocentric representations emerge preferentially in guidance when using an allocentric strategy, whereas egocentric vector representations emerge when using an egocentric strategy in aiming. We thus find that alongside the type of navigational strategy, the nature of the task plays a pivotal role in the type of spatial representations that emerge.

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) make up a significant part of our genomes. Their expression is frequently associated with disease, but this Primer explores the implications of a new study in PLOS Biology which found that HERV-K (HML-2) is expressed in more than 50 healthy tissues. Several of these viral DNA fossils have retained intact open reading frames and may encode functional proteins.

<p>Memory is vital to our daily existence. Although a large number of studies have suggested that the hippocampus is dedicated to long-term memory, understanding how memory is anatomically encoded within the hippocampal neuronal network is still lacking. Previously our laboratory showed that hippocampal pyramidal cells are organized in cell clusters to encode both spatial and episodic memory. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that “cluster-type” is a functional organization principal in the hippocampus to encode all types of memory. Here, we tested whether contextual fear, another hippocampus-dependent memory, is also organized in cell clusters. We further investigated the possibility that post-learning sleep may affect functional organization. Cluster formation was examined by assessing the topographic localization of active cells using immediate early gene (IEG, Zif268) imaging methods. The first experiment provides evidence of a cluster-type organization in the hippocampus for fear memory by showing a spatial distribution of adjacent Zif268 positive cells. Exposure to the context itself, without electric shocks, induced a similar cellular formation; however, the degree of clustering was significantly lower. The second experiment provides evidence that sleep plays a role in the refinement and long-term stability of the clusters. The present results confirm the existence of a cluster-type topographic functional neuronal organization in the hippocampus for memory, and further suggest that post-learning sleep enhances the cluster-type organization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Circadian stabilization loop: the regulatory hub and therapeutic target promoting circadian resilience and physiological health [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock is a fundamental biological mechanism that orchestrates essential cellular and physiological processes to optimize fitness and health. The basic functional unit is the cell-autonomous oscillator, consisting of intersecting negative feedback loops. Whereas the core loop is primarily responsible for rhythm generation, auxiliary loops, most notably the secondary or stabilization loop, play pivotal roles to confer temporal precision and molecular robustness. The stabilization loop contains opposing nuclear receptor subfamilies REV-ERBs and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs), competing to modulate rhythmic expression of the basic helix-loop-helix ARNT like 1 (Bmal1) genes in the core loop as well as other clock-controlled genes. Therefore, REV-ERBs and RORs are strategically located to interface the oscillator and the global transcriptomic network, promoting cellular homeostasis and physiological fitness throughout lifespan. Disruption of REV-ERB and ROR functions has been linked with diseases and aging, and pharmacological manipulation of these factors has shown promise in various mouse disease models. Nobiletin is a natural compound that directly binds to and activates RORα/γ, modulating circadian rhythms, and shows robust in vivo efficacies to combat clock-associated pathophysiologies and age-related decline. Results from several studies demonstrate an inverse relation between nobiletin efficacy and clock functional state, where nobiletin elicits little effect in young and healthy mice with growing efficacy as the clock is perturbed by environmental and genetic challenges. This mode of action is consistent with the function of the stabilization loop to promote circadian and physiological resilience. Future studies should further investigate the function and mechanism of REV-ERBs and RORs, and test strategies targeting these factors against disease and aging.

                Background: Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of death in patients with cardiovascular disease. Natural products containing high antioxidant activity have been used as an alternative therapy to improve the living conditions of patients. In this study, we examine the protective effect of tamarind seed (TS) on myocardial hypoxic injury. Methods: The hypoxia model was mimicked by mineral oil overlayed on H9c2 cardiomyoblasts for 4 h. TS extract was pretreated and administered during the hypoxic condition. Radical scavenging activity of TS extract was measured and exhibited very potent antioxidant activities on 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays. Results: TS extract at a concentration of 10 µg/ml significantly reversed the effect of hypoxia-induced cell death and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We also observed hypoxia-induced over-expression of both inflammatory cytokine mRNA and activation of cellular apoptosis. Pretreatment of TS extract significantly reduced hypoxia-induced HIF-1α and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, IL-1β and IL-6. The Western blot analysis for apoptotic regulatory molecules, caspase 3, caspase 8 and Bax proteins, also showed hypoxic injury reversal by TS extract treatment. Conclusions: The results suggest that the anti-ischemic effect of TS extract protects against hypoxia-induced injury and has potential to be an effective alternative therapy for ischemic heart disease and oxidative-damage related disease.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Natural compounds are increasingly becoming an important source of drug leads for computer-aided drug design approaches. Cucurbita maxima has been observed to have medicinal properties and can, therefore, be a potential source of novel drug leads. However, before compounds can be synthesized in the lab for tests, modern approaches require that the candidate compounds be screened for drug-likeness characteristics and toxicity, among others. In this work, the computational tools, SwissADME and DataWarrior were used to screen C. maxima compounds for their potential consideration as drug leads. A total of 130 compounds, downloaded from the LOTUS natural products database, were computationally analysed. The data set presented in this work will be useful to researchers searching for novel drug leads based on natural compounds.

                It is well known that typical antipsychotic drugs have been implicated as a cause of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest; studies have shown that conventional antipsychotics increase the risk of hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest nearly 2-fold. However, atypical antipsychotics are not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. The use of atypical antipsychotics increased since they were first discovered and now are the mainstay of treatment, but with their broad use, heart effects have been documented, such as prolonged QT interval. Clozapine has been linked to severe cardiac problems, and risperidone has been linked to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. We present a case of a patient with bipolar disorder who presented with symptomatic bradycardia secondary to aripiprazole.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of the exuviae of larva from Teinopalpus aureus Mell, 1923 using the complete mitochondrial genome [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Teinopalpus aureus Mell (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) is distributed throughout China, Vietnam and Laos, and is listed as a Class I species in China. To identify whether the exuviae of larva is belonging to Teinopalpus aureus Mell, 1923 or not, and to compare the gene structure and genetic differences among the known populations, ten mitogenomes of T. aureus from the exuviae of larva collected in the Michelia maudiae were sequenced. This method of sequencing the mitogenomes of exuviae of larva can give us the chance to monitor the conservation of rare butterflies. Ten mitogenomes of T. aureus showed typical gene arrangements and contained 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and a non-coding control region (D-loop). The two haplotypes with one base different in T. aureus were found. We also conducted phylogenetic analyses including all different populations of T. aureus to assess the phylogenetic relationship of T. aureus. The lengths of the 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes from both haplotypes were 776 base pairs (bp) and 1,334 bp, respectively. The genetic distance of the ten samples was calculated as 0-0.000065 on the basis of the whole mitogenomes. T. aureus found in Taishun, Zhejiang province, China had a close phylogenetic relationship with the clade of T. aureus found in Pingshan, Jiangxi province, China, which was supported by neighbour-joining analysis.

                Background: Difficulties in translating the in vitro potency determined by cellular assays into in vivo efficacy in living organisms complicates the design and development of drugs. However,  the residence time of a drug in its molecular target is becoming a key parameter in the design and optimization of new drugs, as recent studies show that residence time can reliably predict drug efficacy in vivo. Experimental approaches to binding kinetics and target ligand complex solutions are currently available, but known bioinformatics databases do not usually report information about the ligand residence time in its molecular target. Methods: To extend existing databases we developed the Protein Data Bank (PDB) residence time database (PDBrt) which reports drug residence time. The database is implemented as an open access web-based tool. The front end uses Bootstrap with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), jQuery for the interface and 3Dmol.js to visualize the complexes. The server-side code uses Python web application framework, Django Rest Framework and backend database PostgreSQL. Results: The PDBrt database is a free, non-commercial repository for 3D protein-ligand complex data, including the measured ligand residence time inside the binding pocket of the specific biological macromolecules as deposited in The Protein Data Bank. The PDBrt database contains information about both the protein and the ligand separately, as well as the protein-ligand complex, binding kinetics, and time of the ligand residence inside the protein binding site.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genetic and environmental perturbations alter the rhythmic expression pattern of a circadian long non-coding RNA, Per2AS, in mouse liver [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a wide variety of biological roles without encoding a protein. Although the functions of many lncRNAs have been uncovered in recent years, the regulatory mechanism of lncRNA expression is still poorly understood despite that the expression patterns of lncRNAs are much more specific compared to mRNAs. Here, we investigated the rhythmic expression of Per2AS, a novel lncRNA that regulates circadian rhythms. Given that Per2AS expression is antiphasic to Period2 (Per2), a core circadian clock gene, and transcribed from the antisense strand of Per2, we hypothesized that the rhythmic Per2AS expression is driven either by its own promoter or by the rhythmic Per2 transcription via transcriptional interference. Methods: We leveraged existing circadian RNA-seq datasets and analyzed the expression patterns of Per2AS and Per2 in response to the genetic or environmental disruption of the circadian rhythm in mouse liver. We tested our hypotheses by comparing the changes in the expression patterns of Per2AS and Per2. Conclusions: We found that, in some cases, Per2AS expression is independently controlled by other circadian transcription factors. In other cases, the pattern of expression change is consistent with both transcriptional interference and independent regulation hypotheses. Although additional experiments will be necessary to distinguish these possibilities, findings from this work contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of how the expression of lncRNA is regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A methylbenzimidazole derivative regulates mammalian circadian rhythms by targeting Cryptochrome proteins [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Impairment of the circadian clock has been associated with numerous diseases, including sleep disorders and metabolic disease. Although small molecules that modulate clock function may form the basis of drug discovery of clock-related diseases, only a few compounds that selectively target core clock proteins have been identified. Three scaffolds were previously discovered as small-molecule activators of the clock protein Cryptochrome (CRY), and they have been providing powerful tools to understand and control the circadian clock system. Identifying new scaffolds will expand the possibilities of drug discovery. Methods: A methylbenzimidazole derivative TH401 identified from cell-based circadian screens was characterized. Effects of TH401 on circadian rhythms were evaluated in cellular assays. Functional assays and X-ray crystallography were used to elucidate the effects of the compound on CRY1 and CRY2 isoforms. Results: TH401 lengthened the period of circadian rhythms and stabilized both CRY1 and CRY2. The compound repressed Per2 reporter activity, which was reduced by Cry1 or Cry2 knockout and abolished by Cry1/Cry2 double knockout, indicating the dependence on CRY isoforms. Thermal shift assays showed slightly higher interaction of TH401 with CRY2 over CRY1. The crystal structure of CRY1 in complex with TH401 revealed a conformational change of the gatekeeper W399, which is involved in isoform-selectivity determination. Conclusions: The present study identified a new small molecule TH401 that targets both CRY isoforms. This compound has expanded the chemical diversity of CRY activators, and will ultimately aid in the development of therapeutics against circadian clock-related disorders.

                Background: Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic drug, used mainly in many cancerous stages, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases, but its use has been limited by its nephrotoxicity. Cyanocobalamin is a water-soluble vitamin possessing nephro-protective properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cyanocobalamin on the nephrotoxicity of methotrexate. Methods: In this study 42 albino adult female rats were used, divided into six groups each containing seven rats (n=7). First  group: Control group (Negative control), 7 rats were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5ml/kg/day NS. Second group: 7 rats were injected intraperitoneal with a single dose of methotrexate (20 mg/kg) for 4 days. Third Group: 7 rats were given intraperitoneal cyanocobalamin at a dose (1.5 mg/kg/day) for two weeks, fourth, fifth, sixth group: 7 rats from each group were injected intraperitoneal with different concentrations of cyanocobalamin (0.5, 1, 1.5 mg/kg /day) respectively for two weeks and MTX (20 mg/kg) which was injected only on day 11. On day 15, rats from all groups were euthanized, and blood samples were taken for biochemical tests, including evaluating serum urea and creatinine. The kidneys were extracted for histological investigation and evaluation of antioxidant (GSH) and oxidative stress (MDA) by using kidney tissue homogenates. Results: This study revealed that kidney damage produced by the MTX (group II) is manifested by significantly elevated (P<0.05) urea and creatinine. On the contrary, the cyanocobalamin groups (IV, V, VI) significantly (P<0.05) reduced urea and creatinine. Renal antioxidant defense systems, such as reduced glutathione depleted by MTX therapy, were restored to normal levels by cyanocobalamin. Furthermore, cyanocobalamin reduced oxidative stress (MDA) and histologically reduced renal tissue injury induced by MTX. Conclusions: In conclusion, the study revealed that cyanocobalamin has a nephroprotective action upon MTX-induced renal damage in rats; cyanocobalamin may offer a protective effect, such as antioxidant action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling computer assisted audit techniques (CAATs) in enhancing the Indonesian public sector [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to examine public sector auditors' tendency to use somputer assisted audit techniques (CAATs) in managing their audit works. Methods: A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed to auditors working in the public sectors in Central Java, West Java, and East Java. From the total, 225 questionnaires were returned and completed.  The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and Partial Least Square (PLS) were used to analyze the data. Results: The empirical findings reveal that performance expectation and facilitating conditions have encouraged auditors to use CAATs in their works. Further, there is a positive influence between the intention to use and CAATs audit. This implies that auditors with an intention will be more open to using the CAATs optimally in achieving effective and efficient work. The utilization of CAATs in public services needs to have strong support from the government and positive attitudes from the auditors as the users of the system. Conclusion: This study covers broad areas of Central Java, West Java, and East Java. Further, the findings add to the literature on emerging markets specifically for Indonesian government auditors' intention and appropriateness of using CAATs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of clinical efficacy of Ginkgo biloba extract in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a randomized clinical trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by deteriorating articular cartilage. Most patients may not get enough control of symptoms in spite of the availability of various treatment options. Because of the synergistic impact of flavonoids and ginkgolides, Ginkgo biloba (GB) has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties besides its generally safe profile. This study aims to assess the efficacy of the Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) in patient with Knee OA. Methods: This is a randomized double blinded clinical trial conducted in a private orthopaedic clinic in Al-Najaf Government-Iraq. Patients were randomized into two groups; Group A administered the standard treatment (diclofenac capsule 100 milligram sustained released with paracetamol 1 gram twice daily) with GBE 120 milligram twice daily, while Group B administered the standard treatment with placebo (starch) capsule only. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was performed to assess the efficacy of the GBE in patient with Knee OA for eight weeks. Results: 60 patients successfully completed the eight weeks follow up. Pain, symptoms, sport, activity of daily living (ADL) scores showed significant improvement in Group A from the first two weeks after treatment with GB in comparison with group B. however, scores of quality of life (QOL) were not significantly improved in two group comparison at each assessment week. Only 10 patients reported gastrointestinal adverse effects during the study which were all mild. Conclusions: GB may provide additional beneficial health effects to patients with knee OA based on KOOS scores when add to the standard treatment regime. Registration: ClincialTrials.gov (NCT05398874, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05398874).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons and glia have distinct yet interactive functions but are both characterized by branching morphology. Dendritic trees have been digitally traced for over 40 years in many animal species, anatomical regions, and neuron types. Recently, long-range axons also are being reconstructed throughout the brain of many organisms from invertebrates to primates. In contrast, less attention has been paid until lately to glial morphology. Thus, although glia and neurons are similarly abundant in the nervous systems of humans and most animal models, glia have traditionally been much less represented than neurons in morphological reconstruction repositories such as NeuroMorpho.Org. This is rapidly changing with the advent of high-throughput glia tracing. NeuroMorpho.Org introduced glial cells in 2017 and today they constitute nearly a third of the database content. It took NeuroMorpho.Org 10 years to collect the first 40,000 neurons and now that amount of data can be produced in a single publication. This not only demonstrates the spectacular technological progress in data production, but also demands a corresponding advancement in informatics processing. At the same time, these publicly available data also open new opportunities for quantitative analysis and computational modeling to identify universal or cell-type-specific design principles in the cellular architecture of nervous systems. As a first application, we demonstrated that supervised machine learning of tree geometry classifies neurons and glia with practically perfect accuracy. Furthermore, we discovered a new morphometric biomarker capable of robustly separating these cell classes across multiple species, brain regions, and experimental preparations, with only sparse sampling of branch measurements.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of conjunctive representations in prioritizing and selecting planned actions</a></h4>

              
                For flexible goal-directed behavior, prioritizing and selecting a specific action among multiple candidates is often important. Working memory has long been assumed to play a role in prioritization and planning, while bridging cross-temporal contingencies during action selection. However, studies of working memory have mostly focused on memory for single components of an action plan, such as a rule or a stimulus, rather than management of all of these elements during planning. Therefore, it is not known how post-encoding prioritization and selection operate on the entire profile of representations for prospective actions. Here, we assessed how such control processes unfold over action representations, highlighting the role of conjunctive representations that nonlinearly integrate task-relevant features during maintenance and prioritization of action plans. For each trial, participants prepared two independent rule-based actions simultaneously, then they were retro-cued to select one as their response. Prior to the start of the trial, one rule-based action was randomly assigned to be high priority by cueing that it was more likely to be tested. We found that both full action plans were maintained as conjunctive representations during action preparation, regardless of priority. However, during output selection, the conjunctive representation of the high priority action plan was more enhanced and readily selected as an output. Further, the strength of the high priority conjunctive representation was associated with behavioral interference when the low priority action was tested. Thus, multiple alternate upcoming actions were maintained as integrated representations and served as the target of post-encoding attentional selection mechanisms to prioritize and select an action from within working memory.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Constitutively active STING causes neuroinflammation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in mice</a></h4>

              
                Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is activated after detection of cytoplasmic dsDNA by cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) as part of the innate immunity defence against viral pathogens. STING binds TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). TBK1 mutations are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the STING pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of further neurodegenerative diseases. To test whether STING activation is sufficient to induce neurodegeneration, we analysed a mouse model that expresses the constitutively active STING variant N153S. In this model, we focused on dopaminergic neurons, which are particularly sensitive to stress and represent a circumscribed population that can be precisely quantified. In adult mice expressing N153S STING, the number of dopaminergic neurons was smaller than in controls, as was the density of dopaminergic axon terminals and the concentration of dopamine in the striatum. We also observed alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta. Neuroinflammation was quantified by staining astroglia and microglia, by measuring mRNAs, proteins and nuclear translocation of transcription factors. These neuroinflammatory markers were already elevated in juvenile mice although at this age the number of dopaminergic neurons was still unaffected, thus preceding the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. More neuroinflammatory markers were blunted in mice deficient for inflammasomes than in mice deficient for signalling by type I interferons. Neurodegeneration, however, was blunted in both mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Targeting the STING pathway could therefore be beneficial in Parkinson’s disease and further neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sex-specific role of myostatin signaling in neonatal muscle growth, denervation atrophy, and neuromuscular contractures</a></h4>

              
                Neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) causes disabling and incurable muscle contractures that result from impaired longitudinal growth of denervated muscles. This deficit in muscle growth is driven by increased proteasome-mediated protein degradation, suggesting a dysregulation of muscle proteostasis. The myostatin (MSTN) pathway, a prominent muscle-specific regulator of proteostasis, is a putative signaling mechanism by which neonatal denervation could impair longitudinal muscle growth, and thus a potential target to prevent NBPI-induced contractures. Through a mouse model of NBPI, our present study revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of MSTN signaling induces hypertrophy, restores longitudinal growth, and prevents contractures in denervated muscles of female but not male mice, despite inducing hypertrophy of normally innervated muscles in both sexes. Additionally, the MSTN-dependent impairment of longitudinal muscle growth after NBPI in female mice is associated with perturbation of 20S proteasome activity, but not through alterations in canonical MSTN signaling pathways. These findings reveal a sex dimorphism in the regulation of neonatal longitudinal muscle growth and contractures, thereby providing insights into contracture pathophysiology, identifying a potential muscle-specific therapeutic target for contracture prevention, and underscoring the importance of sex as a biological variable in the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrast-polarity specific mapping improves efficiency of neuronal computation for collision detection</a></h4>

              
                Neurons receive information through their synaptic inputs, but the functional significance of how those inputs are mapped on to a cell's dendrites remains unclear. We studied this question in a grasshopper visual neuron that tracks approaching objects and triggers escape behavior before an impending collision. In response to black approaching objects, the neuron receives OFF excitatory inputs that form a retinotopic map of the visual field onto compartmentalized, distal dendrites. Subsequent processing of these OFF inputs by active membrane conductances allows the neuron to discriminate the spatial coherence of such stimuli. In contrast, we show that ON excitatory synaptic inputs activated by white approaching objects map in a random manner onto a more proximal dendritic field of the same neuron. The lack of retinotopic synaptic arrangement results in the neuron’s inability to discriminate the coherence of white approaching stimuli. Yet, the neuron retains the ability to discriminate stimulus coherence for checkered stimuli of mixed ON/OFF polarity. The coarser mapping and processing of ON stimuli thus has a minimal impact, while reducing the total energetic cost of the circuit. Further, we show that these differences in ON/OFF neuronal processing are behaviorally relevant, being tightly correlated with the animal’s escape behavior to light and dark stimuli of variable coherence. Our results show that the synaptic mapping of excitatory inputs affects the fine stimulus discrimination ability of single neurons and document the resulting functional impact on behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A DARPin-based molecular toolset to probe gephyrin and inhibitory synapse biology</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience currently requires the use of antibodies to study synaptic proteins, where antibody binding is used as a correlate to define the presence, plasticity, and regulation of synapses. Gephyrin is an inhibitory synaptic scaffolding protein used to mark GABAergic and glycinergic postsynaptic sites. Despite the importance of gephyrin in modulating inhibitory transmission, its study is currently limited by the tractability of available reagents. Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) are a class of synthetic protein binder derived from diverse libraries by <i>in vitro</i> selection, and tested by high-throughput screening to produce specific binders. In order to generate a functionally diverse toolset for studying inhibitory synapses, we screened a DARPin library against gephyrin mutants representing both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states. We validated the robust use of anti-gephyrin DARPin clones for morphological identification of gephyrin clusters in rat neuron culture and mouse brain tissue, discovering previously overlooked clusters. This DARPin-based toolset includes clones with heterogenous gephyrin binding modes that allowed for identification of the most extensive gephyrin interactome to date, and defined novel classes of putative interactors, creating a framework for understanding gephyrin's non-synaptic functions. This study demonstrates anti-gephyrin DARPins as a versatile platform for studying inhibitory synapses in an unprecedented manner.

                Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for ~10% of all haematologic malignancies. Little is known about high intratumour heterogeneities in patients stratified by the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS). Herein, we constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas to compare differential expression patterns among stages. We found that a novel cytotoxic plasma cell (PC) population exhibited with NKG7 positive was obviously enriched in stage II patients. Additionally, a malignant plasma cell population with significantly elevated expression of MKI67 and PCNA was associated with unfavourable prognosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in our collected samples. Moreover, Ribonucleotide Reductase Regulatory Subunit M2 (RRM2) was found and verified to promote proliferation of MM cell lines, suggesting RRM2 may serve as a detrimental marker in MM. The percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NKT cells decreased along with R-ISS stages, reflecting the plasticity of the tumour immune microenvironment. Importantly, their crosstalks with myeloid cells and PC identified several potential immunotargets such as SIRPA-CD47, and CD74-MIF, respectively. Collectively, this study provided an R-ISS-related single-cell MM atlas and revealed the clinical significance of novel PC clusters, as well as potential immunotargets in MM progression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Precise and stable edge orientation signaling by human first-order tactile neurons</a></h4>

              
                Fast-adapting type 1 (FA-1) and slow-adapting type 1 (SA-1) first-order neurons in the human tactile system have distal axons that branch in the skin and form many transduction sites, yielding receptive fields with many highly sensitive zones or 'subfields'. We previously demonstrated that this arrangement allows FA-1 and SA-1 neurons to signal the geometric features of touched objects, specifically the orientation of raised edges scanned with the fingertips. Here we show that such signaling operates for fine edge orientation differences (5-20°) and is stable across a broad range of scanning speeds (15-180 mm/s); that is, under conditions relevant for real-world hand use. We found that both FA-1 and SA-1 neurons weakly signal fine edge orientation differences via the intensity of their spiking responses and only when considering a single scanning speed. Both neuron types showed much stronger edge orientation signaling in the sequential structure of the evoked spike trains and FA-1 neurons performed better than SA-1 neurons. Represented in the spatial domain, the sequential structure was strikingly invariant across scanning speeds, especially those naturally used in tactile spatial discrimination tasks. This speed invariance suggests that neurons' responses are structured via sequential stimulation of their subfields and thus links this capacity to their terminal organization in the skin. Indeed, the spatial precision of elicited action potentials rationally matched spatial acuity of subfield arrangements, which corresponds to a spatial period similar to the dimensions of individual fingertip ridges.

                How the neural structures supporting human cognition develop and arose in evolution is an enduring question of interest. Yet, we still lack appropriate procedures to align ages across primates, and this lacuna has hindered progress in understanding the evolution of biological programs. We generated a dataset of unprecedented size consisting of 573 time points from abrupt and gradual changes in behavior, anatomy, and transcription across human and 8 non-human primate species. We included time points from diverse human populations to capture within-species variation in the generation of cross-species age alignments. We also extracted corresponding ages from organoids. The identification of corresponding ages across the lifespan of 8 primate species, including apes (e.g., orangutans, gorillas) and monkeys (i.e., marmosets, macaques) reveal that some biological pathways are extended in humans compared with some non-human primates. Particularly, the human lifespan is unusually extended relative to studied nonhuman primates demonstrating that very old age is a phase of life in humans that does not map to other studied primate species. More generally, our work prompts a reevaluation in the choice of a model system to understand aging given very old age in humans is a period of life with a clear counterpart in great apes.

                Efforts are currently ongoing to map synaptic wiring diagrams or connectomes in order to understand the neural basis of brain function. However, chemical synapses represent only one type of functionally important neuronal connection; in particular, extrasynaptic, "wireless" signaling by neuropeptides is widespread and plays essential roles in all nervous systems. By integrating single-cell anatomical and gene expression datasets with comprehensive biochemical analysis of receptor-ligand interactions, we have generated a draft connectome of neuropeptide signaling in the C. elegans nervous system. This neuropeptide connectome is characterized by a high connection density, extended signaling cascades, autocrine foci, and a decentralized topology, with a large, highly interconnected core containing three constituent communities sharing similar patterns of input connectivity. Intriguingly, several of the most important nodes in this connectome are little-studied neurons that are specialized for peptidergic neuromodulation. We anticipate that the C. elegans neuropeptidergic connectome will serve as a prototype to understand basic organizational principles of neuroendocrine signaling networks.

                A role for axon guidance genes in the adult nervous system has not been fully elucidated. We performed an RNAi screen against guidance genes in the adult Drosophila melanogaster nervous system and identified fourteen genes required for adult survival and normal motility. Additionally, we show that adult expression of Semaphorins and Plexins in motoneurons is necessary for neuronal survival, indicating that guidance genes have critical functions in the mature nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mixed Models Quantify Annual Volume Change; Linear Regression Determines Thalamic Volume as the Best Subcortical Structure Volume Predictor in Alzheimer's Disease and Aging</a></h4>

              
                Background: Thalamus-hippocampus-putamen and thalamus-cerebellar interconnections are dense. The extent this connectivity is paralleled by each structure's volume impact on another is unquantified in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mixed model quantification of annual volume change in AD is scarce and absent inclusive of the cerebellum, hippocampus, putamen and lateral ventricles and thalamus. Among these structures, autopsy evidence of early-stage AD seems largely but not entirely restricted to the hippocampus and thalamus. Objective: Variation in annual volume related to time and baseline age was assessed for the hippocampus, putamen, cerebellum, lateral ventricles and thalamus. Which subcortical structure's volume had the largest explanatory effect of volume variation in other subcortical structures was also determined. Method: The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess test-retest reliability of structure automated segmentation. Linear regression (N = 45) determined which structure's volume most impacted volume of other structures. Finally, mixed models (N = 36; 108 data points) quantified annual structure volume change from baseline to 24-months. Results: High test-retest reliability was indicated by a mean ICC score of .989 (SD = .012). Thalamic volume consistently had the greatest explanatory effect of hippocampal, putamen, cerebellar and lateral ventricular volume. The group variable proxy for AD significantly contributed to the best-fitting hippocampal linear regression model, hippocampal and thalamic longitudinal mixed models, and approached significance in the longitudinal lateral ventricular mixed model. Mixed models determined time (1 year) had a negative effect on hippocampal, cerebellar and thalamic volume, no effect on putamen volume, and a positive effect on lateral ventricular volume. Baseline age had a negative effect on hippocampal and thalamic volume, no effect on cerebellar or putamen volume and a positive effect on lateral ventricular volume. Interpretation: Linear regression determined thalamic volume as a virtual centralized index of hippocampal, cerebellar, putamen, and lateral ventricular volume. Relative to linear regression, longitudinal mixed models had greater sensitivity to detect contribution of early AD, or potential AD pathology (MCI), via the group variable not just to volume reduction in the hippocampus but also in the thalamus.

                Numerous studies have shown that individuals with dementia have exhibited activation of inflammatory pathways in their brains. Typically, these studies use traditional and well-established regression methods for data analysis. In this paper, a new approach is introduced that utilizes the analysis of the covariance structure using methods related to the principal component analysis (PCA) theory. Eleven biomarkers related to neuroinflammation were used to determine the association with the onset of dementia. Various demographic covariates were adjusted to account for possible confounding effects of the covariance structure. Three hypothesis testing methods were considered to discern differences between partial covariance matrices for comparing power and Type I errors through simulation studies. Application of hypothesis testing methods using data from Framingham Heart Study (FHS) found significant differences in covariance matrices between the non-dementia and dementia groups.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-attractor modeling of resting-state functional connectivity in psychiatric disorders reveals disturbances in excitation, inhibition, and energy gaps</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is altered across various psychiatric disorders. Biophysical network modeling (BNM) has the potential to reveal the neurobiological underpinnings of such abnormalities by dynamically modeling the structure-function relationship and examining biologically relevant parameters after fitting the models with real data. Although innovative BNM approaches have been developed, two main issues need to be further addressed. First, previous BNM approaches are primarily limited to simulating noise-driven dynamics near a chosen attractor (or a stable brain state). Such approaches miss out on the multi(or cross)-attractor dynamics that have been shown to better capture non-stationarity and switching between states in the resting brain. Second, previous BNM work is limited to characterizing one disorder at a time. Given the large degree of co-morbidity across psychiatric disorders, comparing BNMs across disorders might provide a novel avenue to generate insights regarding the dynamical features that are common across (vs. specific to) disorders. Here, we address these issues by (1) examining the layout of the attractor repertoire over the entire multi-attractor landscape using a recently developed cross-attractor BNM approach; and (2) characterizing and comparing multiple disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar, and ADHD) with healthy controls using an openly available and moderately large multimodal dataset from the UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics. Both global and local differences were observed across disorders. Specifically, the highest local excitation (across groups) was observed in the ADHD group, whereas the lowest local inhibition was observed in the bipolar group. In line with these results, the ADHD group had the lowest switching costs (energy gaps) across groups. Overall, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting transdiagnostic multi-attractor BNM approaches to better understand psychiatric disorders' pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GGSDT: A unified signal detection framework for confidence data analysis</a></h4>

              
                Human decision behavior entails a graded awareness of its certainty, known as a feeling of confidence. Until now, considerable interest has been paid to behavioral and computational dissociations of decision and confidence, which has raised an urgent need for measurement frameworks that can quantify the efficiency of confidence rating relative to decision accuracy (metacognitive efficiency). As a unique addition to such frameworks, we have developed a new signal detection theory paradigm utilizing the generalized gaussian distribution (GGSDT). This framework evaluates the observer's internal standard deviation ratio and metacognitive efficiency through the scale and shape parameters respectively. The shape parameter quantifies the kurtosis of internal distributions and can practically be understood in reference to the proportion of the gaussian ideal observer's confidence being disrupted with random guessing (metacognitive lapse rate). This interpretation holds largely irrespective of the contaminating effects of decision accuracy or operating characteristic asymmetry. Thus, the GGSDT enables hitherto unexplored research protocols (e.g., direct comparison of yes/no versus forced-choice metacognitive efficiency), expected to find applications in various fields of behavioral science. This paper provides a detailed walkthrough of the GGSDT analysis with an accompanying R package (ggsdt).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural basis of cost-benefit trade-offs in effort investment: a quantitative activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Prominent theories of cognitive effort-based decision-making posit that shared brain regions process both potential reward and task demand, supporting the idea that effort allocation are informed by a cost-benefit trade-off, weighing the expected benefits of successful control against the inherent costs of effort exertion. While the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been proposed as a candidate region supporting this decision, it remains unclear whether dACC activity tracks rewards and costs as independent quantities, or it reflects the effort intensity worth the integrated costs and benefits. While recent accounts of dACC function posit a crucial role the region in negotiating cost-benefit trade-offs, empirical evidence for this account remains scarce across single studies. To address this, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis review of neuroimaging studies, using activation-likelihood estimation method to quantify brain activity across 45 studies (N = 1273 participants) investigating reward-guided effort. We found reliable recruitment of the dACC, putamen, and anterior insula for processing both larger rewards and increasing task demands. However, the dACC clusters sensitive to task demands and rewards were anatomically distinct with no significant overlap: caudal dACC activity tracked increasing task demands, while rostral dACC activity tracked increasing rewards. Critically, we also observed that caudal dACC activity tracked the integration of costs and benefits, compatible with mental effort intensity account. These findings suggest there are distinct signals for demand and effort in the dACC which are also integrated to support the decision to invest effort, supporting recent computational accounts of cost-benefit value integration in effort-based choice.

                Striatal spiny projection neurons are hyperpolarized-at-rest (HaR) and are driven to spike threshold by a small number of powerful inputs - an input-output configuration that is detrimental to response reliability. Because the striatum is important for habitual behaviors and goal-directed learning, we conducted microendoscopic imaging in freely-moving mice that express a genetically-encoded calcium indicator sparsely in striatal HaR neurons to compare their response reliability during self-initiated movements and operant conditioning. The sparse expression was critical for longitudinal studies of response reliability, and for studying correlations among HaR neurons while minimizing spurious correlations arising from contamination by the background neuropil signal. We found that HaR neurons are recruited dynamically into action representation through a moment-by-moment formation of distinct cell assemblies. While individual neurons respond with little reliability, the population response remained reliable. Moreover, we found evidence for the formation of correlated cell assemblies during conditioned (but not innate) behaviors, but this correlation was independent of the distance between neurons.

	<p>In the last decades, a growing body of literature has focused on the link between number and action. Many studies conducted on adult participants have provided evidence for a bidirectional influence between numerosity processing and grasping or reaching actions. However, it is not yet clear whether this link is functional in early infancy. Here, we used the event-related potential (ERP) technique to record electrical activity of the brain in response to number&amp;amp;ndash;hand pairings. We implemented a cueing paradigm where 3- to 4-month-old infants observed images showing either congruency (e.g., a large numerosity primed by a large hand opening) or incongruency (e.g., a large numerosity primed by a small hand opening). Infants&amp;amp;rsquo; brain activity was modulated by the congruency of the pairings: amplitudes recorded over frontal and parietal-occipital scalp positions differed for congruent versus incongruent pairings. These findings suggest that the association between number and hand action processing is already functional early in life.</p>

	<p>We sought to investigate age-related differences in stepping reactions to a sudden balance perturbation, focusing on muscle activity and cortical activation. A total of 18 older healthy adults (older group, OG) and 16 young healthy adults (young group, YG) were recruited into this study. A cable-pull instrument was used to induce a forward perturbation at the waist level among participants, who were required to take the right step to maintain their postural balance. The seven right lower-limb muscle activities during periods of compensatory postural adjustments (CPAs) were recorded by surface electromyography. At the same time, the signals of channels located in the prefrontal, temporal and parietal lobes were recorded by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the whole process. Integral electromyograms of the right peroneus muscle, gluteus medius, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles showed greater activity for the OG in the CPA periods. Two channels belonging to the right pre-frontal (PFC) and pre-motor cortex (PMC) revealed lower activation in the OG compared with the YG. These findings can help us to better understand the differences at the peripheral and central levels and may provide some suggestions for future neuromodulation techniques and other clinical treatments.</p>

	<p>Sensory processing disorders (SPDs) can be described as difficulty detecting, modulating, interpreting, and/or responding to sensory experiences. Because SPDs occur in many individuals with autism spectrum disorder and in other populations with neurodevelopmental disorders, it is important to distinguish between typical and atypical functioning in sensory processes and to identify early phenotypic markers for developing SPDs. This review considers different methods for diagnosing SPDs to outline a multidisciplinary approach useful for developing valid diagnostic measures. In particular, the advantages and limitations of the most commonly used tools in assessment of SPDs, such as caregiver reports, clinical observation, and psychophysical and neuroimaging studies, will be reviewed. Innovative treatment methods such as neuromodulation techniques and virtual reality will also be suggested.</p>

	<p>One of the common causes of falls in people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) is walking impairment. Therefore, assessment of gait is of importance in MS. Gait analysis and fall detection can take place in the clinical context using a wide variety of available methods. However, combining these methods while using machine learning algorithms for detecting falls has not been performed. Our objective was to determine the most relevant method for determining fall risk by analyzing eleven different gait data sets with machine learning algorithms. In addition, we examined the most important features of fall detection. A new feature selection ensemble (FS-Ensemble) and four classification models (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine) were used. The FS-Ensemble consisted of four filter methods: Chi-square test, information gain, Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance and RelieF. Various thresholds (50%, 25% and 10%) and combination methods (Union, Union 2, Union 3 and Intersection) were examined. Patient-reported outcomes using specialized walking questionnaires such as the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) and the Early Mobility Impairment Questionnaire (EMIQ) achieved the best performances with an F1 score of 0.54 for detecting falls. A combination of selected features of MSWS-12 and EMIQ, including the estimation of walking, running and stair climbing ability, the subjective effort as well as necessary concentration and walking fluency during walking, the frequency of stumbling and the indication of avoidance of social activity achieved the best recall of 75%. The Gaussian Naive Bayes was the best classification model for detecting falls with almost all data sets. FS-Ensemble improved the classification models and is an appropriate technique for reducing data sets with a large number of features. Future research on other risk factors, such as fear of falling, could provide further insights.</p>

	<p>Rats, which are highly social animals, are known to communicate using ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) in different frequency ranges. Calls around 50 kHz are related to positive affective states and promote social interactions. Our previous work has shown that the playback of natural 50-kHz USV leads to a strong social approach response toward the sound source, which is related to activation in the nucleus accumbens. In male Wistar rats, the behavioral response habituates, that is, becomes weaker or is even absent, when such playback is repeated several days later, an outcome found to be memory-dependent. Here, we asked whether such habituation is due to the lack of a contingent social consequence after playback in the initial test and whether activation of the nucleus accumbens, as measured by c-fos immunohistochemistry, can still be observed in a retest. To this end, groups of young male Wistar rats underwent an initial 50-kHz USV playback test, immediately after which they were either (1) kept temporarily alone, (2) exposed to a same-sex juvenile, or (3) to their own housing group. One week later, they underwent a retest with playback; this time not followed by social consequences but by brain removal for c-fos immunohistochemistry. Consistent with previous reports, behavioral changes evoked by the initial exposure to 50-kHz USV playback included a strong approach response. In the retest, no such response was found, irrespective of whether rats had experienced a contingent social consequence after the initial test or not. At the neural level, no substantial c-fos activation was found in the nucleus accumbens, but unexpected strong activation was detected in the anterior cingulate cortex, with some of it in GABAergic cells. The c-fos patterns did not differ between groups but cell numbers were individually correlated with behavior, i.e., rats that still approached in response to playback in the retest showed more activation. Together, these data do not provide substantial evidence that the lack of a contingent social consequence after 50-kHz USV playback accounts for approach habituation in the retest. Additionally, there is apparently no substantial activation of the nucleus accumbens in the retest, whereas the exploratory findings in the anterior cingulate cortex indicate that this brain area might be involved when individual rats still approach 50-kHz USV playback.</p>

	<p>Few studies have assessed biomarkers for the differentiation of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, some elements of depression such as hormones and receptors of the renin&amp;amp;ndash;angiotensin&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal system (RAAS), the hypothalamus&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis, and history of early-life stress (ELS) could be considered for differential diagnosis. Therefore, this study aimed to assess aldosterone and cortisol levels, MR and GR gene polymorphisms, and ELS as potential biomarkers for differentiating MDD and BD. This study presents a case&amp;amp;ndash;control design. Groups comprised samples for genetic, cortisol, and aldosterone analysis: healthy control (HC; n = 113/97/103), MDD (n = 78/69/67) and BD (n = 82/68/65) subjects. Furthermore, all subjects were assessed for diagnostic screening, the severity of depression, and history of ELS by applying MINI-PLUS, GRID-HDRS, and CTQ, respectively. In addition, genotype and allelic frequencies of GR (N363S, R22/23K and BclI) and MR (MI180V and -2G/C) polymorphisms were evaluated via PCR. Our findings demonstrate that basal aldosterone levels may be a biomarker for differentiating BD and MDD. Furthermore, ELS affects the HPA axis in BD, cortisol may be considered a biomarker for distinguishing BD and MDD, but only in the absence of ELS, and, finally, history of ELS and MR-2G/C variant alleles are factors that contribute to the severity of depressive symptoms in MDD and BD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cell‐specific dysregulation of iron and oxygen homeostasis as a novel pathophysiology in PSP</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a 4R-tauopathy showing heterogeneous tau cytopathology commencing in the globus pallidus (GP) and the substantia nigra (SN), regions also associated with age-related iron accumulation. Abnormal iron levels have been extensively associated with tau pathology in neurodegenerative brains, however its role in PSP pathogenesis remains yet unknown. We perform the first cell type-specific evaluation of PSP iron homeostasis and the closely related oxygen homeostasis, in relation to tau pathology in human post-mortem PSP brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In brain regions vulnerable to PSP pathology (GP, SN, and putamen), we visualized iron deposition in tau-affected and unaffected neurons, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, using a combination of iron staining with immunolabelling. To further explore molecular pathways underlying our observations, we examined the expression of key iron and oxygen homeostasis mRNA transcripts and proteins.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found astrocytes as the major cell type accumulating iron in the early affected regions of PSP, highly associated with cellular tau pathology. The same regions are affected by dysregulated expression of alpha and beta hemoglobin and neuroglobin showing contrasting patterns. We discovered changes in iron and oxygen homeostasis-related gene expression associated with aging of the brain, and identified dysregulated expression of rare Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) genes associated with tau pathology to distinguish PSP from the healthy ageing brain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We present novel aspects of PSP pathophysiology highlighting an overlap with NBIA pathways. Our findings reveal potential novel targets for therapy development and have implications beyond PSP for other iron-associated neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Postnatal development of hippocampal CA2 structure and function during the emergence of social recognition of peers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is now well-established that the hippocampal CA2 region plays an important role in social recognition memory in adult mice. The CA2 is also important for the earliest social memories, including those that mice have for their mothers and littermates, which manifest themselves as a social preference for familiarity over novelty. The role of the CA2 in the development of social memory for recently encountered same-age conspecifics, that is, peers, has not been previously reported. Here, we used a direct social interaction test to characterize the emergence of novelty preference for peers during development and found that at the end of the second postnatal week, pups begin to significantly prefer novel over familiar peers. Using chemogenetic inhibition at this time, we showed that CA2 activity is necessary for the emergence of novelty preference and for the ability to distinguish never encountered from recently encountered peers. In adulthood, the CA2 region is known to integrate a large number of inputs from various sources, many of which participate in social recognition memory, but previous studies have not determined whether these afferents are present at adult levels by the end of the second postnatal week. To explore the development of CA2 inputs, we used immunolabeling and retrograde adenovirus circuit tracing and found that, by the end of the second postnatal week, the CA2 is innervated by many regions, including the dentate gyrus, supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, the lateral entorhinal cortex, and the median raphe nucleus. Using retroviral labeling of postnatally generated granule cells in the dentate gyrus, we found that mossy fiber projections to the CA2 mature faster during development than those generated in adulthood. Together, our findings indicate that the CA2 is partially mature in afferent connectivity by the end of the second postnatal week, connections that likely facilitate the emergence of social recognition memory and preference for novel peers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">V‐NeuroStack: Open‐source 3D time stack software for identifying patterns in neuronal data</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding functional correlations between the activities of neuron populations is vital for the analysis of neuronal networks. Analyzing large-scale neuroimaging data obtained from hundreds of neurons simultaneously poses significant visualization challenges. We developed V-NeuroStack, a novel network visualization tool to visualize data obtained using calcium imaging of spontaneous activity of neurons in a mouse brain slice as well as in vivo using two-photon imaging. V-NeuroStack creates 3D time stacks by stacking 2D time frames for a time-series dataset. It provides a web interface to explore and analyze data using both 3D and 2D visualization techniques. Previous attempts to analyze such data have been limited by the tools available to visualize large numbers of correlated activity traces. V-NeuroStack's 3D view is used to explore patterns in dynamic large-scale correlations between neurons over time. The 2D view is used to examine any timestep of interest in greater detail. Furthermore, a dual-line graph provides the ability to explore the raw and first-derivative values of activity from an individual or a functional cluster of neurons. V-NeuroStack can scale to datasets with at least a few thousand temporal snapshots. It can potentially support future advancements in in vitro and in vivo data capturing techniques to bring forth novel hypotheses by allowing unambiguous visualization of massive patterns in neuronal activity data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Effect of mobile stroke unit dispatch in all patients with acute stroke or TIA</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the effect of additional mobile stroke unit (MSU) dispatch on functional outcomes among the full spectrum of stroke patients, regardless of subtype or potential reperfusion therapies contraindications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data from the nonrandomized Berlin-based B_PROUD study (02/2017-05/2019), in which MSUs were dispatched based solely on availability, and the linked B-SPATIAL stroke registry. All patients with final stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) diagnosis were eligible. The intervention under study was the additional dispatch of an MSU, an emergency physician-staffed ambulance equipped to provide prehospital imaging and thrombolytic treatment, compared to conventional ambulance alone. The primary outcome was the 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and the co-primary outcome was a 3-tiered disability scale. We identified confounders using Directed Acyclic Graphs and obtained adjusted effect estimates using inverse probability of treatment weighting.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MSUs were dispatched to 1,125 patients (mean age: 74y, 46.5% female), while for 1,141 only conventional ambulances were dispatched (75y, 49.9% female). After confounding adjustment, MSU dispatch was associated with more favorable 3-month mRS scores (common odds ratio, cOR=0.82; 95%CI: 0.71-0.94). No statistically significant association was found with the co-primary outcome (cOR=0.86; 0.72-1.01) or seven-day mortality (OR=0.94; 0.59-1.48).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>When considering the entire population of stroke/TIA patients, MSU dispatch improved 3-month functional outcomes without evidence of compromised safety. Our results are relevant for decision-makers since stroke subtype and treatment eligibility are unknown at time of dispatch.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling the role of contour integration in visual inference</a></h4>

              
                Under difficult viewing conditions, the brain's visual system uses a variety of recurrent modulatory mechanisms to augment feed-forward processing. One resulting phenomenon is contour integration, which occurs in the primary visual (V1) cortex and strengthens neural responses to edges if they belong to a larger smooth contour. Computational models have contributed to an understanding of the circuit mechanisms of contour integration, but less is known about its role in visual perception. To address this gap, we embedded a biologically grounded model of contour integration in a task-driven artificial neural network, and trained it using a gradient-descent variant. We used this model to explore how brain-like contour integration may be optimized for high-level visual objectives as well as its potential roles in perception. When the model was trained to detect contours in a background of random edges, a task commonly used to examine contour integration in the brain, it closely mirrored the brain in terms of behavior, neural responses, and lateral connection patterns. When trained on natural images, the model enhanced weaker contours and distinguished whether two points lay on the same vs. different contours. The model learnt robust features that generalized well to out-of-training-distribution stimuli. Surprisingly, and in contrast with the synthetic task, a parameter-matched control network without recurrence performed the same or better than the model on the natural-image tasks. Thus a contour integration mechanism is not essential to perform these more naturalistic contour-related tasks. Finally, the best performance in all tasks was achieved by a modified contour integration model that did not distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-specific activation of microglial genes in a mouse model of AD</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that increases its prevalence with age. AD is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive function, leading to dementia. The conventional pathological hallmarks of AD include deposition of amyloid plaque, aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles, and sustained inflammation. Recent studies have confirmed that immune responses play an important role in AD progression. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies of the AD mouse model identified the disease-associated microglia (DAM) population during AD progression, where the pro-inflammatory activity was mediated by Trem2. However, the time points and nature of DAM activation remain largely unknown. Here, we compared the time-result bulk sequencing andsingle nuclei RNA sequencing data in a mouse model of AD. We identified an age-dependent activation of Trem2 targeted immune-related genes. We showed that Trem2 affected DAM activation at an early stage (4-8 months) rather than the late stage (12-16 months). Our results highlight an age-dependent change in the Trem2-linked immune response in AD.

                Background: Choroid plexus (ChP) enlargement has been described in first-episode psychosis and psychosis spectrum disorders, but whether ChP enlargement occurs before disease onset is unknown. This study investigated whether ChP volume is enlarged in individuals with clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis and whether these changes are related to clinical, cortical, and plasma analyte measures. Methods: Clinical and neuroimaging data from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2 (NAPLS2) was used for analysis. A total of 509 participants (169 controls, 340 CHR) were recruited across 8 sites. Conversion status was determined until 2-years of follow-up, with 36 patients developing psychosis. The lateral ventricle ChP was manually segmented from all available baseline brain scans. A subsample of 84 participants (31 controls, 53 CHR) had plasma analyte and neuroimaging data. Results: Compared to controls, CHR overall (d=0.22, p=0.017) and converters (d=0.21, p=0.041) demonstrated higher ChP volumes, but not nonconverters. In CHR, greater ChP volume correlated with lower cortical (r=-0.22, p<0.001) and subcortical gray matter volume (r=-0.21, p<0.001), total white matter volume (r=-0.28,p<0.001), and larger lateral ventricle volume (r=0.63,p<0.001). In CHR, greater ChP volume, but not lateral ventricle volume, correlated with higher C3 (r=0.39, p=0.005) and TSH (r=0.31, p=0.026), and lower MMP7 (r=-0.30, p=0.032) and UMOD (r=-0.33, p=0.019). Conclusions and Relevance: CHR and converters to psychosis demonstrated significantly larger ChP volumes compared to controls. ChP enlargement was associated with cortical volume reduction and increased peripheral inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that the ChP may be a key biomarker in psychosis disease onset and conversion.

                Neurons respond to changes in the levels of activity they experience in a variety of ways, including structural changes at pre- and postsynaptic terminals. An essential plasticity signal required for such activity-regulated structural adjustments are reactive oxygen species (ROS). To identify sources of activity-regulated ROS required for structural plasticity in vivo we used the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction as a highly tractable experimental model system. For adjustments of presynaptic motor terminals, we found a requirement for both NADPH oxidases, Nox and Dual Oxidase (Duox), that are encoded in the Drosophila genome. This contrasts with the postsynaptic dendrites from which Nox is excluded. NADPH oxidases generate ROS to the extracellular space. Here, we show that two aquaporins, Bib and Drip, are necessary ROS conduits in the presynaptic motoneuron for activity regulated, NADPH oxidase dependent changes in presynaptic motoneuron terminal growth. Our data further suggest that different aspects of neuronal activity-regulated structural changes might be regulated by different ROS sources: changes in bouton number require both NADPH oxidases, while activity-regulated changes in the number of active zones might be modulated by other sources of ROS. Overall, our results show NADPH oxidases as important enzymes for mediating activity-regulated plasticity adjustments in neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Primary motor cortex drives expressive facial movements related to reward processing in mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals exhibit expressive facial movements in a wide range of behavioral contexts. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain enigmatic. In reward-based learning tasks, mice make expressive movements with their whiskers and nose at the timings of reward expectation and acquisition. Here we show that optogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons (oDAS) as a reward is sufficient to induce such expressive movements. Pavlovian conditioning with a sensory cue and oDAS elicited both cue-locked (reward-expecting) and oDAS-aligned (reward-acquiring) orofacial movements. Inhibition or knock-out of dopamine D1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens inhibited oDAS-induced motion but spared cue-locked motion. Silencing the whisker primary motor cortex (wM1) abolished both oDAS-induced and cue-locked orofacial movements. We found specific neuronal populations in wM1 representing either oDAS-aligned or cue-locked whisker movements. Thus, reward-acquiring and reward-expecting facial movements are driven by accumbal D1 receptor-dependent and -independent neuronal mechanisms, respectively, both dominantly regulated by wM1 activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Routing States Transition During Oscillatory Bursts and Attention States</a></h4>

              
                Neural information routing relies on spatiotemporal activity dynamics across interconnected brain areas. However, it remains unclear how routing states emerge at fast spiking timescales and interact with the slower activity dynamics of larger networks during cognitive processes. Here, we show that localized neural spiking events generate long-range directional routing states with spiking activity in distant brain areas that dynamically switch or amplify during oscillatory bursts, selective attention, and decision-making. Computational modeling and neural recordings from lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and striatum of nonhuman primates revealed that cross-areal, directional routing states arise within ~20 ms around spikes of single neurons. On average, LPFC spikes led activity in the ACC and striatum by few milliseconds. The routing state was amplified during LPFC beta bursts between the LPFC and striatum and switched direction during ACC theta bursts between ACC and LPFC. Selective attention amplified the lead of these theta-specific lead-ensembles in the ACC, while decision-making amplified the lead of ACC and LPFC spiking output over the striatum. Notably, the fast lead/lag relationships of cross-areal neuronal ensembles that were modulated by attention states or decision-making predicted firing rate dynamics of their neurons during those functional states at slower timescales.

                Learning to associate a cue with its aversive consequence enables animals to prevent harm. Associative conditioning relies on activity within the cerebellum, but little is known about how changes in synaptic inputs to its output neurons shape their membrane potential dynamics during learning. Here we studied these changes in inputs using whole-cell and juxtasomal recordings of cerebellar nucleus neurons in awake mice during eyeblink conditioning and doing post-learning structural analysis. We identified changes in mossy fiber- and Purkinje cell-, but not climbing fiber-, inputs, leading to changes in subthreshold processing that correlate with the level and direction of the conditioned eyelid movements. These changes appear sufficient, as optogenetic stimulation of the inputs evoke incremental eyelid closures over the course of conditioning. Our data reveal how electrophysiological and structural modifications at the level of synaptic inputs to cerebellar output neurons facilitate conditioning of eyelid movements.

                In recent years, multiple neuroimaging studies have utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxometry to visualize and explore the intricate laminar microstructure of the cerebral cortex, which is considered a unique anatomical mark of the development, function, connectivity, and even various pathologies of the brain. T1 relaxometry has successfully delineated laminar components across the cortex, expanding its applicability from solely a direct measure of myelin content to an indirect measure of cortical cytoarchitecture. However, analyzing the resulting laminar dataset is no simple task due to its multidimensionality and geometric complexity: six cortical laminar components, representing the regionally varying microstructure of the cortex, are dispersed across a triangulated surface, representing the intricate and tortuous geometry of the cortex. In this study we implement an adaptation of an algorithm that clusters cell omics profiles using their spatial organization to cluster multidimensional surface-based microstructural data in the cortex. The correspondence of the results with an established atlas of cytoarchitectonic features provides further validation of the T1 imaging framework for cortical laminar composition analysis and highlights the role of MRI neuroimaging as a probe of tissue microstructure.

                Speech processing often occurs amidst competing inputs from other modalities, e.g., listening to the radio while driving. We examined the extent to which dividing attention between auditory and visual modalities (bimodal divided attention) impacts neural processing of natural continuous speech from acoustic to linguistic levels of representation. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses when human participants performed a challenging primary visual task, imposing low or high cognitive load while listening to audiobook stories as a secondary task. The two dual-task conditions were contrasted with an auditory single-task condition in which participants attended to stories while ignoring visual stimuli. Behaviorally, the high load dual-task condition was associated with lower speech comprehension accuracy relative to the other two conditions. We fitted multivariate temporal response function encoding models to predict EEG responses from acoustic and linguistic speech features at different representation levels, including auditory spectrograms and information-theoretic models of sublexical-, word-form-, and sentence-level representations. Neural tracking of most acoustic and linguistic features remained unchanged with increasing dual-task load, despite unambiguous behavioral and neural evidence of the high load dual-task condition being more demanding. Compared to the auditory single-task condition, dual-task conditions selectively reduced neural tracking of only some acoustic and linguistic features, mainly at latencies >200 ms, while earlier latencies were surprisingly unaffected. These findings indicate that behavioral effects of bimodal divided attention on continuous speech processing occur not due to impaired early sensory representations but likely at later cognitive processing stages. Crossmodal attention-related mechanisms may not be uniform across different speech processing levels.

                The increase of brain neuron number in relation with brain size is currently considered to be the major evolutionary path to high cognitive power in amniotes. However, how changes in neuron density did contribute to the evolution of the information-processing capacity of the brain remains unanswered. High neuron densities are seen as the main reason why the fovea located at the optical center of the retina is responsible for sharp vision in birds and primates. The emergence of foveal vision is considered as a breakthrough innovation in visual system evolution. We found that neuron densities in the largest visual center of the midbrain, i.e., the optic tectum, are two to four times higher in modern birds with one or two foveae compared to birds deprived of this specialty. Interspecies comparisons enabled us to identify elements of a hitherto unknown developmental process set up by foveate birds for increasing neuron density in the upper layers of their optic tectum. The progenitor cells that generate these neurons proliferate in a ventricular zone that can expand only radially. In this particular context, the number of cells in ontogenetic columns increases, thereby setting the conditions for higher cell densities in the upper layers once neurons did migrate.

                Quantification of individual cells' morphology and their distribution at the whole brain scale is essential to understand the structure and diversity of cell types. Despite recent technological advances, especially single cell labeling and whole brain imaging, for many prevailing animal models, it is exceedingly challenging to reuse similar technologies to study human brains. Here we propose Adaptive Cell Tomography (ACTomography), a low-cost, high-throughput, high-efficacy tomography approach, based on adaptive targeting of individual cells suitable for human-brain scale modeling of single neurons to characterize their 3-D structures, statistical distributions, and extensible for other cellular features. Specifically, we established a platform to inject dyes into cortical neurons in surgical tissues of 18 patients with brain tumors or other conditions and 1 donated fresh postmortem brain. We collected 3-D images of 1746 cortical neurons, of which 852 neurons were subsequentially reconstructed to quantify their local dendritic morphology, and mapped to standard atlases both computationally and semantically. In our data, human neurons are more diverse across brain regions than by subject age or gender. The strong stereotypy within cohorts of brain regions allows generating a statistical tensor-field of neuron morphology to characterize 3-D anatomical modularity of a human brain.

                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is functionally closely related with the insula and the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC). Extensive work on their functional relationships has led to the salience network theory and advanced understanding of value-based learning and decision making. However, the anatomical connections between the ACC and the two regions remain unknown in the human brain. Despite the anatomical ground truth established by nonhuman primate (NHP) tract-tracing, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has not seen success identifying homologous pathways in humans. In this study we show that the negative finding does not reflect a cross-species discrepancy but rather a technical issue. We used NHP dMRI as a bridge to compare the ground-truth pathways in NHPs and dMRI-derived pathways in humans. The insight from NHP data helped pinpoint a bias in fiber orientation distribution functions (fODFs) caused by the disproportion of anterior-posterior vs. medial-lateral fibers in the human brain. Guided by this information, we successfully recovered the ACC-insula and ACC-vlPFC pathways that followed the same trajectories as in the NHP dMRI and tract-tracing data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Poorer Sleep Health is Associated with Altered Cognitive Control Processing in Healthy Adults</a></h4>

              
                This study investigated how proactive and reactive cognitive control processing in the brain was associated with habitual sleep health. BOLD fMRI data was acquired from 81 healthy adults with normal sleep (41 females, age 20.96 - 39.58 years) during a test of cognitive control ("Not-X CPT"). Sleep health was assessed in the week before MRI scanning, using both objective (actigraphy) and self-report measures. Multiple measures indicating poorer sleep health - including later/more variable sleep timing, later chronotype preference, more insomnia symptoms and lower sleep efficiency - were associated with stronger and more widespread BOLD activations (adjusted for age, sex, education, and fMRI task performance). Poorer sleep health was predominantly associated with stronger reactive cognitive control activation, indicating an overall "hyper-reactive" brain state. Analysis of time-on-task effects showed that, with longer time on task, poorer sleep health was predominantly associated with increased proactive cognitive control activation, indicating recruitment of more neural resources over time. Finally, shorter objective sleep duration was associated with poorer task performance and lower BOLD activation with time on task. In conclusion, even in normal sleepers, relatively poorer sleep health is associated with altered cognitive control processing, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms and / or inefficient neural processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of mesolimbic endocannabinoid signaling in stress-driven cocaine use in rats</a></h4>

              
                Stress is prevalent in the lives of those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and influences SUD outcomes. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms through which stress promotes drug use is important for the development of effective SUD interventions. We have developed a model wherein exposure to a stressor, uncontrollable electric footshock, daily at the time of cocaine self-administration (SA) escalates intake in male rats. Here we test the hypothesis that stress-induced escalation of cocaine SA is the result of persistent recruitment of endocannabinoid signaling. Male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/inf, i.v.) during 2-h sessions comprised of four 30-min SA components separated by 5-min shock sequences or 5-min shock-free periods for 14 days. Footshock produced an escalation of cocaine SA that persisted following shock removal. Systemic administration of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) antagonist, AM251, attenuated cocaine intake only in rats with a history of stress. This effect was localized to the mesolimbic system, as intra-nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) micro-infusions of AM251 also attenuated cocaine intake only in stress-escalated rats. Cocaine SA, regardless of stress history, increases CB1R binding site density in the VTA, but not NAc shell. Following extinction, cocaine-primed reinstatement (10 mg/kg, ip) was increased in rats with prior footshock during SA. AM251 attenuated reinstatement only in rats with a stress history. Altogether, these data suggest that repeated stress at the time of cocaine use recruits endocannabinoid signaling in mesolimbic regions to escalate intake and heighten relapse susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangling the role of NAc D1 and D2 cells in hedonic eating</a></h4>

              
                Consumption of highly palatable foods is thought to be influenced by the central reward circuits that control both the hedonic component (liking) of food and the motivation (wanting) to eat it. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain center implicated in these processes, contains two main populations: D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons. The precise contribution of these cells to these reward-associated behaviors is still unresolved and establishing a causal relationship between activation of each neuronal subtype and its effect on motivated behaviors has proven challenging. To understand the forces underlying eating behavior that may lead to overconsumption, we assessed liking and wanting in separate sets of experiments. First, in a free palatable food consumption paradigm, we analyzed licking microstructure to demonstrate that both NAc D1 and D2 cell activity are more strongly correlated with liking than wanting. Second, we evaluated motivation to retrieve a reward (wanting) in an operant task. Both NAc D1 and D2 cell activity encoded motivation during the reward-approach phase, after the cue and before consumption. Lastly, we show that opto-excitation of NAc D1 cells, but not D2 cells, intensifies incentive motivation to overconsume the optostimulation-paired palatable food in a two-bottle choice task. This demonstrates an important role for NAc D1 cells in preference formation and promoting consumption of palatable foods. Our results suggest a fundamental difference: NAc D1 cells promote reinforced behaviors under an operant paradigm or a Pavlovian association task. In contrast, NAc D2 cells are essential for initiating retrieval of palatable food but, once consumed, reduced activity of these cells allows prolonged eating episodes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unified control of temporal and spatial scales of sensorimotor behavior through neuromodulation of short-term synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators such as dopamine have been shown to modulate short-term synaptic plasticity (STP). Here we propose that the neuromodulation of STP provides a general mechanism to scale neural dynamics and motor outputs in time and space. We trained RNNs that incorporated STP to produce complex motor trajectories-handwritten digits-with different temporal (speed) and spatial (size) scales. The learned dynamics underwent temporal and spatial scaling when higher synaptic release probabilities corresponded to higher speed/size. Neuromodulation of STP enhanced temporal or spatial generalization compared to weight modulation alone. The model accounted for the data of two experimental studies involving flexible sensorimotor timing. Our results address a long-standing debate regarding the role of dopamine in timing and predict novel mechanisms by which dopamine may slow down neural dynamics and thus slow 'clock' speed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonhuman primates exploit the prior assumption that the visual world is vertical</a></h4>

              
                When human subjects tilt their heads in dark surroundings, the noisiness of vestibular information impedes precise reports on objects orientation with respect to earth vertical axis. This difficulty is mitigated if a vertical visual background is available. Tilted visual backgrounds induce feelings of head tilt in subjects who are in fact upright. This is often explained as a result of the brain resorting to the prior assumption that natural visual backgrounds are vertical. Here, we tested whether monkeys show comparable perceptual mechanisms. To this end we trained two monkeys to align a visual arrow to a vertical reference line that had variable luminance across trials, while including a large, clearly visible background square whose orientation changed from trial to trial. On around 20% of all trials, the vertical reference line was left out to measure the subjective visual vertical (SVV). When the frame was upright, the monkeys SVV was aligned with the gravitational vertical. In accordance with the perceptual reports of humans, however, when the frame was tilted, it induced an illusion of head tilt as indicated by a bias in SVV towards the frame orientation. Thus all primates exploit the prior assumption that the visual world is vertical.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell RNA-seq reveals alterations in peripheral CX3CR1 and nonclassical monocytes in familial tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Emerging evidence from mouse models is beginning to elucidate the brain's immune response to tau pathology, but little is known about the nature of this response in humans. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent tau pathology and the local inflammatory response within the brain influence the broader immune system. Methods: To address these questions, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from carriers of pathogenic variants in MAPT, the gene encoding tau. Results: Analysis of ~181,000 individual PBMC transcriptomes from MAPT pathogenic variant carriers (n = 8) and healthy non-carrier controls (n = 8) demonstrated striking differential expression in monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. We observed a marked reduction in the expression of CX3CR1 - the gene encoding the fractalkine receptor that is known to modulate tau pathology in mouse models - in monocytes and NK cells. We also observed a significant reduction in the abundance of nonclassical monocytes and dysregulated expression of nonclassical monocyte marker genes, including FCGR3A. Finally, we identified reductions in TMEM176A and TMEM176B, genes thought to be involved in the inflammatory response in human microglia. We confirmed differential expression of select biologically relevant genes dysregulated in our scRNA-seq data using droplet digital PCR as an orthogonal technique for quantitative validation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that human peripheral immune cell expression and abundance are modulated by tau-associated pathophysiologic changes. CX3CR1 and nonclassical monocytes in particular will be a focus of future work exploring the role of these peripheral signals in additional tau-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual Occlusions Result in Phase Synchrony Within Multiple Brain Regions Involved in Sensory Processing and Balance Control</a></h4>

              
                There is a need to develop appropriate balance training interventions to minimize the risk of falls. Recently, we found that intermittent visual occlusions can substantially improve the effectiveness and retention of balance beam walking practice (Symeonidou and Ferris 2022). We sought to determine how the intermittent visual occlusions affect electrocortical activity during beam walking. We hypothesized that areas involved in sensorimotor processing and balance control would demonstrate spectral power changes and inter-trial coherence modulations after loss and restoration of vision. Ten healthy young adults practiced walking on a treadmill-mounted balance beam while wearing high-density EEG and experiencing reoccurring visual occlusions. Results revealed spectral power fluctuations and inter-trial coherence changes in the visual, occipital, temporal, and sensorimotor cortex as well as the posterior parietal cortex and the anterior cingulate. We observed a prolonged alpha increase in the occipital, temporal, sensorimotor, and posterior parietal cortex after the occlusion onset. In contrast, the anterior cingulate showed a strong alpha and theta increase after the occlusion offset. We observed transient phase synchrony in the alpha, theta, and beta bands within the sensory, posterior parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices immediately after occlusion onset and offset. Our results provide support for cross-modal phase resetting and enhanced processing in areas involved in sensory processing and balance control as an explanation for increased long-term balance improvement when training with intermittent visual occlusions. Our training intervention could be implemented in senior and rehabilitation centers, improving the quality of life of elderly and neurologically impaired individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The auditory cortex of bats has a better signal to noise ratio and lower inter-trial variability in response to stimuli trains than mice</a></h4>

              
                The brains of black 6 mice (Mus musculus) and Seba's short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata) weigh roughly the same and share the mammalian neocortical laminar architecture. Bats have highly developed sonar calls and social communication and are an excellent neuroethological animal model for auditory research. Mice are olfactory and somatosensory specialists and are used frequently in auditory neuroscience, particularly for their advantage of standardization and genetic tools. Investigating their potentially different general auditory processing principles would advance our understanding of how the ecological needs of a species shape the development and function of the mammalian nervous system. We compared two existing datasets, recorded with linear multichannel electrodes down the depth of the primary auditory cortex (A1) while awake, across both species while presenting repetitive stimulus trains with different frequencies (~5 and ~40 Hz). We found that while there are similarities between cortical response profiles in bats and mice, there was a better signal to noise ratio in bats under these conditions, which allowed for a clearer following response to stimuli trains. This was most evident at higher frequency trains, where bats had stronger response amplitude suppression to consecutive stimuli. Phase coherence was far stronger in bats during stimulus response, indicating less phase variability in bats across individual trials. These results show that although both species share cortical laminar organization, there are structural differences in relative depth of layers. Better signal to noise ratio in bats could represent specialization for faster temporal processing shaped by their individual ecological niches.

	<p>Autism is a spectrum disorder that occurs globally with increasing numbers of children and adults being identified with this condition. Although rates are higher in more affluent nations, the bulk of people with autism reside in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). However, most do not have access to timely and appropriate support. The types of services delivered in high income countries are often ill-suited to the needs and resources of LMICs. Rather alternative forms of provision need to be devised. In common with other public health initiatives, these should be family-focused and community based, with suitably qualified and experienced leaders who in turn train and supervise a cadre of knowledgeable support workers drawn from local communities and cultures. As well as providing personalized, home-based guidance to people with autism and to their primary carers, regular group-based advocacy and training activities are undertaken in partnership with available mainstream services such as schools and social services. The principles and operations of these new forms of services are described in this paper albeit with an acknowledgment of their limitations. In recent decades, the cost-effectiveness of these approaches have been demonstrated with other chronic illnesses and disabling conditions in LMICs but their extension to autism has barely begun. More affluent countries are being forced to adopt similar strategies in response to the increased numbers of people identified with autism. A transformation in research strategies is essential to building better international support for persons with autism.</p>

	<p>Narcolepsy is a chronic, long-term neurological disorder characterized by a decreased ability to regulate sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake cycles. Some clinical symptoms enter into differential diagnosis with other neurological diseases. Excessive daytime sleepiness and brief involuntary sleep episodes are the main clinical symptoms. The majority of people with narcolepsy experience cataplexy, which is a loss of muscle tone. Many people experience neurological complications such as sleep cycle disruption, hallucinations or sleep paralysis. Because of the associated neurological conditions, the exact pathophysiology of narcolepsy is unknown. The differential diagnosis is essential because relatively clinical symptoms of narcolepsy are easy to diagnose when all symptoms are present, but it becomes much more complicated when sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is episodic or absent. Treatment is tailored to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s symptoms and clinical diagnosis. To facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and to better understand the neuropathological mechanisms of this sleep disorder, this review summarizes current knowledge on narcolepsy, in particular, genetic and non-genetic associations of narcolepsy, the pathophysiology up to the inflammatory response, the neuromorphological hallmarks of narcolepsy, and possible links with other diseases, such as diabetes, ischemic stroke and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. This review also reports all of the most recent updated research and therapeutic advances in narcolepsy. There have been significant advances in highlighting the pathogenesis of narcolepsy, with substantial evidence for an autoimmune response against hypocretin neurons; however, there are some gaps that need to be filled. To treat narcolepsy, more research should be focused on identifying molecular targets and novel autoantigens. In addition to therapeutic advances, standardized criteria for narcolepsy and diagnostic measures are widely accepted, but they may be reviewed and updated in the future with comprehension. Tailored treatment to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s symptoms and clinical diagnosis and future treatment modalities with hypocretin agonists, GABA agonists, histamine receptor antagonists and immunomodulatory drugs should be aimed at addressing the underlying cause of narcolepsy.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary central nervous system malignant tumors. With the development of targeted sequencing and proteomic profiling technology, some new tumor types have been established and a series of novel molecular markers have also been identified. The 2021 updated World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors first mentioned the classification of adult glioma and pediatric glioma based on the molecular diagnosis. Thus, we used single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to explore the diversity and similarities in the occurrence and development of adult and pediatric types. ASTN2, which primarily encodes astrotactin, has been reported to be dysregulated in various neurodevelopmental disorders. Although some studies have demonstrated that ASTN2 plays an important role in glial-guided neuronal migration, there are no studies about its impact on glioblastoma cell migration. Subsequent single-cell RNA sequencing revealed ASTN2 to be a hub gene of a cell cluster which had a poor effect on clinical prognosis. Eventually, a western blot assay and a wound-healing assay first confirmed that ASTN2 expression in glioblastoma cell lines is higher than that in normal human astrocytes and affects the migration ability of glioblastoma cells, making it a potential therapeutic target.</p>

                <h2>Summary for Social Media</h2>
<p>@AliciaCastongu2, @FazalZaidi9, @oozaidat, @Mouhammad_Jumaa</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful predictive tools in the field stroke. Here, we examine the predictive accuracy of ML models for predicting functional outcomes using 24-hour post-treatment characteristics in the Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke (STRATIS) Registry.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ML models, adaptive boost, random forest (RF), classification and regression trees (CART), C5.0 decision tree (C5.0), support vector machine (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and logistic regression (LR), and traditional LR models were used to predict 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0–2). Twenty-four-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was examined as a continuous or dichotomous variable in all models. Model accuracy was assessed using the area under characteristic curve (AUC).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 24-hour NIHSS score was a top-predictor of functional outcome in all models. ML models using the continuous 24-hour NIHSS scored showed moderate-to-good predictive performance (range mean AUC: 0.76–0.92); however, RF (AUC: 0.92 ± 0.028) outperformed all ML models, except LASSO (AUC: 0.89 ± 0.023, <i>p</i> = 0.0958). Importantly, RF demonstrated a significantly higher predictive value than LR (AUC: 0.87 ± 0.031, <i>p</i> = 0.048) and traditional LR (AUC: 85 ± 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.035) when using the 24-hour continuous NIHSS score. Predictive accuracy was similar between the 24-hour NIHSS score dichotomous and continuous ML models.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this substudy, we found similar predictive accuracy for functional outcome when using the 24-hour NIHSS score as a continuous or dichotomous variable in ML models. ML models had moderate-to-good predictive accuracy, with RF outperforming LR models. External validation of these ML models is warranted. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amygdalostriatal transition zone neurons encode sustained valence to direct conditioned behaviors</a></h4>

              
                In order to respond appropriately to threats in the environment, the brain must rapidly determine whether a stimulus is important and whether it is positive or negative, and then use that information to direct behavioral responses. Neurons in the amygdala have long been implicated in valence encoding and in fear responses to threatening stimuli, but show transient firing responses in response to these stimuli that do not match the timescales of associated behavioral responses. For decades, there has been a logical gap in how behavioral responses could be mediated without an ensemble representation of the internal state of valence that has rapid onset, high signal-to-noise, and is sustained for the duration of the behavioral state. Here, we present the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) as a missing piece of this highly conserved process that is of paramount importance for survival, which does exactly this: represents an internal state (e.g. fear) that can be expressed in multiple motor outputs (e.g. freezing or escape). The ASt is anatomically positioned as a "shortcut" to connect the corticolimbic system (important for evaluation) with the basal ganglia (important for action selection) with the inputs of the amygdala and the outputs of the striatum - ideally poised for evaluating and responding to environmental threats. From in vivo cellular resolution recordings that include both electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we find that ASt neurons are unique in that they are sparse coding, extremely high signal-to-noise, and also maintain a sustained response for negative valence stimuli for the duration of the defensive behavior - a rare but essential combination. We further show that photostimulation of the ASt is sufficient to drive freezing and avoidance behaviors. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and in situ RNA labelling we generate a comprehensive profile of cell types and gene expression in the ASt, and find the ASt is genetically distinct from adjacent striatal and amygdalar structures. We also find that the ASt has a greater proportion of neurons expressing Drd2 than neurons expressing Drd1a, a unique feature compared to other regions of the striatum. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we show that that this Drd2+ population robustly encodes stimuli of negative valence, and in loss-of-function experiments find that optogenetic inhibition of Drd2+ ASt neurons causes a striking reduction in cue-conditioned fear responses. Together, our findings identify the ASt as a previously-unappreciated critical missing link for encoding learned associations and directing ongoing behavior.

	<p>The heat-sink effect and thermal damage of conventional thermal ablative technologies can be minimized by irreversible electroporation (IRE), which results in clear ablative boundaries and conservation of blood vessels, facilitating maximal safe surgical resection for glioblastoma. Although much comparative data about the death forms in IRE have been published, the comprehensive genetic regulatory mechanism for apoptosis, among other forms of regulatory cell death (RCD), remains elusive. We investigated the electric field intensity threshold for apoptosis/necrosis (YO-PRO-1/PI co-staining) of the U251 human malignant glioma cell line with stepwise increased uniform field intensity. Time course samples (0&amp;amp;ndash;6 h) of apoptosis induction and sham treatment were collected for transcriptome sequencing. Sequencing showed that transcription factor AP-1 and its target gene Bim (Bcl2l11), related to the signaling pathway, played a major role in the apoptosis of glioma after IRE. The sequencing results were confirmed by qPCR and Western blot. We also found that the transcription changes also implicated three other forms of RCD: autophagy, necroptosis, and immunogenic cell death (ICD), in addition to apoptosis. These together imply that IRE possibly mediates apoptosis by the AP-1-Bim pathway, causes mixed RCD simultaneously, and has the potential to aid in the generation of a systemic antitumor immune response.</p>

	<p>For the clinical assessment of motor speech disorders (MSDs) in French, the MonPaGe-2.0.s protocol has been shown to be sensitive enough to diagnose mild MSD based on a combination of acoustic and perceptive scores. Here, we go a step further by investigating whether these scores&amp;amp;mdash;which capture deviance on intelligibility, articulation, voice, speech rate, maximum phonation time, prosody, diadochokinetic rate&amp;amp;mdash;contribute to the differential diagnosis of MSDs. To this aim, we trained decision trees for two-class automatic classification of different pairs of MSD subtypes based on seven deviance scores that are computed in MonPaGe-2.0.s against matched normative data. We included 60 speakers with mild to moderate MSD from six neuropathologies (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Wilson, Parkinson and Kennedy disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, post-stroke apraxia of speech). The two-class classifications relied mainly on deviance scores from four speech dimensions and predicted with over 85% accuracy the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s correct clinical category for ataxic, hypokinetic and flaccid dysarthria; classification of the other groups (apraxia of speech and mixed dysarthria) was slightly lower (79% to 82%). Although not perfect and only tested on small cohorts so far, the classification with deviance scores based on clinically informed features seems promising for MSD assessment and classification.</p>

	<p>Nontraumatic anterior spinal artery syndrome (ASAS) is an extremely rare clinical condition in pediatric populations with a mostly unknown underlying etiology. Here we discuss the case of a previously healthy 14-year-old girl presenting with sudden onset acute flaccid paralysis to the emergency department. A spinal STIR/DWI MRI revealed hyperintensities extending from cervical vertebrae C3-6, consistent with the diagnosis of ASAS. In order to determine any precipitating causes of ASAS, we also extensively investigated established potential risk factors for ASAS in our patient and noticed that she had a marked folate deficiency requiring folic acid supplementation to prevent future episodes of ASAS as well as to repair the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s injured spinal cord. Interestingly, the patient did not display elevated levels of homocysteine nor did she possess the three pathogenic MTHFR mutations characteristic of ASAS. Although her folate deficiency did not cause responsive hyperhomocysteinemia, and she did not have pathogenic MTHFR mutations that impair the function of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in folate cycle, we suggest that isolated folate deficiency may play a role in adolescent cases of ASAS that, once identified, would require prompt identification and early intervention to improve the prognosis of these patients.</p>

	<p>Our objective is to analyze the difference of microelectrode recording (MER) during awake and asleep subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and the necessity of MER during &amp;amp;ldquo;Asleep DBS&amp;amp;rdquo; under general anesthesia (GA). The differences in MER, target accuracy, and prognosis under different anesthesia methods were analyzed. Additionally, the MER length was compared with the postoperative electrode length by electrode reconstruction and measurement. The MER length of two groups was 5.48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.39 mm in the local anesthesia (LA) group and 4.38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.43 mm in the GA group, with a statistical significance between the two groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The MER length of the LA group was longer than its postoperative electrode length (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), however, there was no significant difference between the MER length and postoperative electrode length in the GA group (p = 0.61). There were also no significant differences in the postoperative electrode length, target accuracy, and postoperative primary and secondary outcome scores between the two groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). These results demonstrate that &amp;amp;ldquo;Asleep DBS&amp;amp;rdquo; under GA is comparable to &amp;amp;ldquo;Awake DBS&amp;amp;rdquo; under LA. GA has influences on MER during surgery, but typical STN discharges can still be recorded. MER is not an unnecessary surgical procedure.</p>

	<p>Decision making is a complex process involving various parts of the brain which are active during different times. It is challenging to measure externally the exact instant when any given region becomes active during the decision-making process. Here, we propose the development and validation of an algorithm to extract and visualize the dynamic functional brain activation information from the observed fMRI data. We propose the use of a regularized deconvolution model to simultaneously map various activation regions within the brain and track how different activation regions changes with time, thus providing both spatial and temporal brain activation information. The proposed technique was validated using simulated data and then applied to a simple decision-making task for identification of various brain regions involved in different stages of decision making. Using the results of the dynamic activation for the decision-making task, we were able to identify key brain regions involved in some of the phases of decision making. The visualization aspect of the algorithm allows us to actually see the flow of activation (and deactivation) in the form of a motion picture. The dynamic estimate may aid in understanding the causality of activation between various brain regions in a better way in future fMRI brain studies.</p>

	<p>Depression is frequent in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients, but the evidence for many antidepressant agents to treat it in PD is insufficient. The aim of the present prospective open-label single-arm study (VOPARK, an open-label study of the effectiveness and safety of VOrtioxetine in PARKinson&amp;amp;acute;s disease patients with depression) was to analyze the effectiveness of vortioxetine on depressive symptoms in PD patients with major depression. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline (VB) at the end of the observational period (12 weeks &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 days; V12w) in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) total score. At VB, all patients had a HAM-D17 total score &amp;amp;ge;16. A total of 30 patients (age 66.23 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.27; 73.3% males) were included between February 2021 (first patient, 12/FEB/21) and March 2022 (last patient, 14/MAR/22). At 12 weeks, 27 patients completed the follow-up (90%). The total HAM-D17 total score was reduced by 52.7% (from 21.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.75 at VB to 10.44 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.54 at V12w; Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size = &amp;amp;minus;2.5; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and the response and remission rates were 50% and 43.3%, respectively. Apathy (Apathy Scale; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), cognition (PD-Cognitive Rating Scale; p = 0.007), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale; p = 0.014), and quality of life (PDQ-39 (p = 0.001) and EUROHIS-QOL8 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001)) improved at 3 weeks as well. A total of 11 adverse events in 10 patients (33.3%) were reported, one of which was severe (vomiting related to vortioxetine with full recovery after drug withdrawal). Vortioxetine was safe and well tolerated and improved depressive symptoms and other non-motor symptoms in PD patients.</p>

	<p>Emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) is a common mental health disorder, manifesting with a range of chronic and debilitating symptoms, including impaired social functioning, unstable mood, and risky impulsive or self-injurious behaviour. Whilst the exact aetiology has not been fully elucidated, implicated factors seem to include genetic factors, environmental causes such as trauma, and neurotransmitter deficits. The literature suggests that impaired functioning of the endocannabinoid system in key brain regions responsible for emotional processing and stress response may underlie the manifestation of EUPD symptoms. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 guidelines state that &amp;amp;ldquo;no drugs have established efficacy in treating or managing EUPD&amp;amp;rdquo;, and yet, patients are commonly prescribed medication which includes antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilisers. Here we present a case series of seven participants diagnosed with EUPD and treated with cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs). Participants were given an initial assessment and followed up one month after CBMPs prescription. Improvement in symptoms was assessed by the completion of ratified rating scales by the participant and psychiatrist. Our results indicate that CBMPs were effective and well tolerated, as six participants reported a noticeable improvement in their symptoms and functioning. Although promising, further research is needed to ascertain the long-term tolerability, efficacy, and dosing strategy for CBMPs in EUPD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Running wheels for mice residing in the home cage are useful for the continuous measurement of locomotor activity for studies testing exercise interventions or exercise-induced effects on brain and metabolism. Here, we have developed an open source, printable, open-faced running wheel that is automated to collect locomotor information such as distance traveled, wheel direction, and velocity that can be binned into epochs over 24 h or multiple days. This system allows for remote data collection to avoid human interference in mouse behavioral experiments. We tested this system in an activity-based anorexia procedure. Using these wheels, we replicate previous findings that food restriction augments wheel-running activity.</p>

                In 2020 we published Liftoff, which was the first standalone tool specifically designed for transferring gene annotations between genome assemblies of the same or closely related species. While the gene content is expected to be very similar in closely related genomes, the differences may be biologically consequential, and a computational method to extract all gene-related differences should prove useful in the analysis of such genomes. Here we present LiftoffTools, a toolkit to automate the detection and analysis of gene sequence variants, synteny, and gene copy number changes.  We provide a description of the toolkit and an example of its use comparing genes mapped between two human genome assemblies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Parameterized syncmer schemes improve long-read mapping</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Abhinav Dutta, David Pellow, Ron Shamir</p>
Motivation <p>Sequencing long reads presents novel challenges to mapping. One such challenge is low sequence similarity between the reads and the reference, due to high sequencing error and mutation rates. This occurs, e.g., in a cancer tumor, or due to differences between strains of viruses or bacteria. A key idea in mapping algorithms is to sketch sequences with their minimizers. Recently, syncmers were introduced as an alternative sketching method that is more robust to mutations and sequencing errors.</p> Results <p>We introduce parameterized syncmer schemes (PSS), a generalization of syncmers, and provide a theoretical analysis for multi-parameter schemes. By combining PSS with downsampling or minimizers we can achieve any desired compression and window guarantee. We implemented the use of PSS in the popular minimap2 and Winnowmap2 mappers. In tests on simulated and real long read data from a variety of genomes, the PSS-based algorithms, with scheme parameters selected on the basis of our theoretical analysis, reduced unmapped reads by 20-60% at high compression while usually using less memory. The advantage was more pronounced at low sequence identity. At sequence identity of 75% and medium compression, PSS-minimap had only 37% as many unmapped reads, and 8% fewer of the reads that did map were incorrectly mapped. Even at lower compression and error rates, PSS-based mapping mapped more reads than the original minimizer-based mappers as well as mappers using the original syncmer schemes. We conclude that using PSS can improve mapping of long reads in a wide range of settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Reaction-diffusion models in weighted and directed connectomes</a></h4>

Connectomes represent comprehensive descriptions of neural connections in a nervous system to better understand and model central brain function and peripheral processing of afferent and efferent neural signals. Connectomes can be considered as a distinctive and necessary structural component alongside glial, vascular, neurochemical, and metabolic networks of the nervous systems of higher organisms that are required for the control of body functions and interaction with the environment. They are carriers of functional epiphenomena such as planning behavior and cognition, which are based on the processing of highly dynamic neural signaling patterns. In this study, we examine more detailed connectomes with edge weighting and orientation properties, in which reciprocal neuronal connections are also considered. Diffusion processes are a further necessary condition for generating dynamic bioelectric patterns in connectomes. Based on our high-precision connectome data, we investigate different diffusion-reaction models to study the propagation of dynamic concentration patterns in control and lesioned connectomes. Therefore, differential equations for modeling diffusion were combined with well-known reaction terms to allow the use of connection weights, connectivity orientation and spatial distances.
Three reaction-diffusion systems Gray-Scott, Gierer-Meinhardt and Mimura-Murray were investigated. For this purpose, implicit solvers were implemented in a numerically stable reaction-diffusion system within the framework of <i>neuroVIISAS</i>. The implemented reaction-diffusion systems were applied to a subconnectome which shapes the mechanosensitive pathway that is strongly affected in the multiple sclerosis demyelination disease. It was found that demyelination modeling by connectivity weight modulation changes the oscillations of the target region, i.e. the primary somatosensory cortex, of the mechanosensitive pathway.
In conclusion, a new application of reaction-diffusion systems to weighted and directed connectomes has been realized. Because the implementation were performed in the <i>neuroVIISAS</i> framework many possibilities for the study of dynamic reaction-diffusion processes in empirical connectomes as well as specific randomized network models are available now.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Separability of Human Motor Memories during reaching adaptation with force cues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frédéric Crevecoeur, James Mathew, Philippe Lefèvre</p>

Judging by the breadth of our motor repertoire during daily activities, it is clear that learning different tasks is a hallmark of the human motor system. However, for reaching adaptation to different force fields, the conditions under which this is possible in laboratory settings have remained a challenging question. Previous work has shown that independent movement representations or goals enabled dual adaptation. Considering the importance of force feedback during limb control, here we hypothesised that independent cues delivered by means of background loads could support simultaneous adaptation to various velocity-dependent force fields, for identical kinematic plan and movement goal. We demonstrate in a series of experiments that indeed healthy adults can adapt to opposite force fields, independently of the direction of the background force cue. However, when the cue and force field were in the same direction but differed by heir magnitude, the formation of different motor representations was still observed but the associated mechanism was subject to increased interference. Finally, we highlight that this paradigm allows dissociating trial-by-trial adaptation from online feedback adaptation, as these two mechanisms are associated with different time scales that can be identified reliably and reproduced in a computational model.

                Background: As more early career scientists enter into diverse career pathways, visiting local companies or organizations can support their exploration of these paths. As an efficient way to facilitate this, we developed a collaborative regional site visit program: the Enhancing Local Industry Transitions through Exploration (ELITE) Consortium.  Consortium members arrange half-day visits to local industry sites, thus providing companies and trainees the opportunity to meet and identify potential professional and career opportunities. Three different training institutions worked cooperatively in the development and maintenance of the program. The ELITE Consortium was developed with eight phased steps; guidelines and operating procedures were created for each of these steps and are provided along with sample materials for institutions interested in building similar programs. Methods: Prior to fully developing the program, trainee interests were evaluated via questionnaire. During program implementation and thereafter, program directors tracked attendance and collected career outcome data from publicly available sources to identify first job positions after training. Regression analyses and chi-squared analyses were used to examine site visit matches and career outcome data. Results: Analyses suggest a positive impact of site visits on postdoctoral and graduate trainees’ career outcomes at companies or institutions that match a similar sector (e.g., for-profit) and type (e.g., biotech, pharmaceutical, contract research organization). Despite a small sample size, evidence suggests an especially positive impact on trainees who organize site visits to companies compared with those who simply participate. Conclusions: The ELITE Consortium was successful in helping trainees explore and identify a multitude of career paths. Trainees attained employment either directly or in related companies and institutions visited by ELITE participants. The joint, three-institution, flexible nature of the ELITE Consortium positively impacts the program’s sustainability and reach. The toolkit provided here will help other institutions to replicate and adapt the program with minimal effort.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The paucity of longitudinal natural history studies in <i>MPZ</i> neuropathy remains a barrier to clinical trials. We have completed a longitudinal natural history study in patients with <i>MPZ</i> neuropathies across 13 sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Change in Charcot–Marie–Tooth Examination Score (CMTES) and Rasch modified CMTES (CMTES-R) were evaluated using longitudinal regression over a 5-year period in subjects with <i>MPZ</i> neuropathy. Data from 139 patients with <i>MPZ</i> neuropathy were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The average baseline CMTES and CMTES-R were 10.84 (standard deviation [SD] = 6.0, range = 0–28) and 14.60 (SD = 7.56, range = 0–32), respectively. A mixed regression model showed significant change in CMTES at years 2–5 (mean change from baseline of 0.87 points at 2 years, <i>p</i> = 0.008). Subgroup analysis revealed greater change in CMTES at 2 years in subjects with axonal as compared to demyelinating neuropathy (mean change of 1.30 points [<i>p</i> = 0.016] vs 0.06 points [<i>p</i> = 0.889]). Patients with a moderate baseline neuropathy severity also showed more notable change, by estimate, than those with mild or severe neuropathy (mean 2-year change of 1.14 for baseline CMTES 8–14 [<i>p</i> = 0.025] vs −0.03 for baseline CMTES 0–7 [<i>p</i> = 0.958] and 0.25 for baseline CMTES ≥ 15 [<i>p</i> = 0.6897]). The progression in patients harboring specific <i>MPZ</i> mutations was highly variable.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CMTES is sensitive to change over time in adult patients with axonal but not demyelinating forms of <i>MPZ</i> neuropathy. Change in CMTES was greatest in patients with moderate baseline disease severity. These findings will inform future clinical trials of <i>MPZ</i> neuropathies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A pericardial effusion secondary to cardiac desmoplastic small round cell tumor [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive malignancy usually described in the abdomen and pelvis of adolescent males but rarely in the chest. A 71-year-old male presented with chest pain and was found to have pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. He underwent pericardiocentesis and pericardial window. Pericardial fluid and cardiac biopsy results confirmed DSRCT. The patient received the P6 protocol with a good but brief response. He had multiple hospitalizations in the following months for pericardial fluid recollection. Repeat imaging showed mediastinal metastasis. He is currently undergoing second-line chemotherapy treatment. We describe a unique case of primary DSRCT invading the pericardium and myocardium and exhibiting extensive mediastinal metastasis. This is the fourth report of cardiac DSRCT in the literature.
