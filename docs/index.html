                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07207">Applying Dynamic Training-Subset Selection Methods Using Genetic Programming for Forecasting Implied Volatility. (arXiv:2007.07207v1 [q-fin.GN])</a></h4>

<p>Volatility is a key variable in option pricing, trading and hedging
strategies. The purpose of this paper is to improve the accuracy of forecasting
implied volatility using an extension of genetic programming (GP) by means of
dynamic training-subset selection methods. These methods manipulate the
training data in order to improve the out of sample patterns fitting. When
applied with the static subset selection method using a single training data
sample, GP could generate forecasting models which are not adapted to some out
of sample fitness cases. In order to improve the predictive accuracy of
generated GP patterns, dynamic subset selection methods are introduced to the
GP algorithm allowing a regular change of the training sample during evolution.
Four dynamic training-subset selection methods are proposed based on random,
sequential or adaptive subset selection. The latest approach uses an adaptive
subset weight measuring the sample difficulty according to the fitness cases
errors. Using real data from SP500 index options, these techniques are compared
to the static subset selection method. Based on MSE total and percentage of non
fitted observations, results show that the dynamic approach improves the
forecasting performance of the generated GP models, specially those obtained
from the adaptive random training subset selection method applied to the whole
set of training samples.

<p>Significance: We demonstrated the potential of using domain adaptation on
functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data to detect and discriminate
different levels of n-back tasks that involve working memory across different
experiment sessions and subjects.
</p>
<p>Aim: To address the domain shift in fNIRS data across sessions and subjects
for task label alignment, we exploited two domain adaptation approaches -
Gromov-Wasserstein (G-W) and Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FG-W).
</p>
<p>Approach: We applied G-W for session-by-session alignment and FG-W for
subject-by-subject alignment with Hellinger distance as underlying metric to
fNIRS data acquired during different n-back task levels. We also compared with
a supervised method - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
</p>
<p>Results: For session-by-session alignment, using G-W resulted in alignment
accuracy of 70 $\pm$ 4 % (weighted mean $\pm$ standard error), whereas using
CNN resulted in classification accuracy of 58 $\pm$ 5 % across five subjects.
For subject-by-subject alignment, using FG-W resulted in alignment accuracy of
55 $\pm$ 3 %, whereas using CNN resulted in classification accuracy of 45 $\pm$
1 %. Where in both cases 25 % represents chance. We also showed that removal of
motion artifacts from the fNIRS data plays an important role in improving
alignment performance.
</p>
<p>Conclusions: Domain adaptation is potential for session-by-session and
subject-by-subject alignment using fNIRS data.

<p>In the context of crowd counting, most of the works have focused on improving
the accuracy without regard to the performance leading to algorithms that are
not suitable for embedded applications. In this paper, we propose a lightweight
convolutional neural network architecture to perform crowd detection and
counting using fewer computer resources without a significant loss on count
accuracy. The architecture was trained using the Bayes loss function to further
improve its accuracy and then pruned to further reduce the computational
resources used. The proposed architecture was tested over the USF-QNRF
achieving a competitive Mean Average Error of 154.07 and a superior Mean Square
Error of 241.77 while maintaining a competitive number of parameters of 0.067
Million. The obtained results suggest that the Bayes loss can be used with
other architectures to further improve them and also the last convolutional
layer provides no significant information and even encourage over-fitting at
training.

<p>Attempts to render deep learning models interpretable, data-efficient, and
robust have seen some success through hybridisation with rule-based systems,
for example, in Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs). These neuro-symbolic models can
induce interpretable rules and learn representations from data via
back-propagation, while providing logical explanations for their predictions.
However, they are restricted by their computational complexity, as they need to
consider all possible proof paths for explaining a goal, thus rendering them
unfit for large-scale applications. We present Conditional Theorem Provers
(CTPs), an extension to NTPs that learns an optimal rule selection strategy via
gradient-based optimisation. We show that CTPs are scalable and yield
state-of-the-art results on the CLUTRR dataset, which tests systematic
generalisation of neural models by learning to reason over smaller graphs and
evaluating on larger ones. Finally, CTPs show better link prediction results on
standard benchmarks in comparison with other neural-symbolic models, while
being explainable. All source code and datasets are available online, at
https://github.com/uclnlp/ctp.

<p>The existing real time object detection algorithm is based on the deep neural
network of convolution need to perform multilevel convolution and pooling
operations on the entire image to extract a deep semantic characteristic of the
image. The detection models perform better for large objects. However, these
models do not detect small objects with low resolution and noise, because the
features of existing models do not fully represent the essential features of
small objects after repeated convolution operations. We have introduced a novel
real time detection algorithm which employs upsampling and skip connection to
extract multiscale features at different convolution levels in a learning task
resulting a remarkable performance in detecting small objects. The detection
precision of the model is shown to be higher and faster than that of the
state-of-the-art models.

<p>We performed a massive evaluation of neural networks with architectures
corresponding to random graphs of various types. Apart from the classical
random graph families including random, scale-free and small world graphs, we
introduced a novel and flexible algorithm for directly generating random
directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and studied a class of graphs derived from
functional resting state fMRI networks. A majority of the best performing
networks were indeed in these new families. We also proposed a general
procedure for turning a graph into a DAG necessary for a feed-forward neural
network. We investigated various structural and numerical properties of the
graphs in relation to neural network test accuracy. Since none of the classical
numerical graph invariants by itself seems to allow to single out the best
networks, we introduced new numerical characteristics that selected a set of
quasi-1-dimensional graphs, which were the majority among the best performing
networks.

<p>The human brain displays rich communication dynamics that are thought to be
particularly well-reflected in its marked community structure. Yet, the precise
relationship between community structure in structural brain networks and the
communication dynamics that can emerge therefrom is not well-understood. In
addition to offering insight into the structure-function relationship of
networked systems, such an understanding is a critical step towards the ability
to manipulate the brain's large-scale dynamical activity in a targeted manner.
We investigate the role of community structure in the controllability of
structural brain networks. At the region level, we find that certain network
measures of community structure are sometimes statistically correlated with
measures of linear controllability. However, we then demonstrate that this
relationship depends on the distribution of network edge weights. We highlight
the complexity of the relationship between community structure and
controllability by performing numerical simulations using canonical graph
models with varying mesoscale architectures and edge weight distributions.
Finally, we demonstrate that weighted subgraph centrality, a measure rooted in
the graph spectrum, and which captures higher-order graph architecture, is a
stronger and more consistent predictor of controllability. Our study
contributes to an understanding of how the brain's diverse mesoscale structure
supports transient communication dynamics.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00716">Do readers use character information when programming return-sweep saccades?. (arXiv:1911.00716v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Reading saccades that occur within a single line of text are guided by the
size of letters. However, readers occasionally need to make longer saccades
(known as return-sweeps) that take their eyes from the end of one line of text
to the beginning of the next. In this study, we tested whether return-sweep
saccades are also guided by font size information and whether this guidance
depends on visual acuity of the return-sweep target area. To do this, we
manipulated the font size of letters (0.29 vs 0.39 deg. per character) and the
length of the first line of text (16 vs 26 deg.). The larger font resulted in
return-sweeps that landed further to the right of the line start and in a
reduction of under-sweeps compared to the smaller font. This suggests that font
size information is used when programming return-sweeps. Return-sweeps in the
longer line condition landed further to the right of the line start and the
proportion of under-sweeps increased compared to the short line condition. This
likely reflects an increase in saccadic undershoot error with the increase in
intended saccade size. Critically, there was no interaction between font size
and line length. This suggests that when programming return-sweeps, the use of
font size information does not depend on visual acuity at the saccade target.
Instead, it appears that readers rely on global typographic properties of the
text in order to maintain an optimal number of characters to the left of their
first fixation on a new line.

<p>The source code suggestions provided by current IDEs are mostly dependent on
static type learning. These suggestions often end up proposing irrelevant
suggestions for a peculiar context. Recently, deep learning-based approaches
have shown great potential in the modeling of source code for various software
engineering tasks. However, these techniques lack adequate generalization and
resistance to acclimate the use of such models in a real-world software
development environment. This letter presents \textit{DeepVS}, an end-to-end
deep neural code completion tool that learns from existing codebases by
exploiting the bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural net. The
proposed tool is capable of providing source code suggestions instantly in an
IDE by using pre-trained BiGRU neural net. The evaluation of this work is
two-fold, quantitative and qualitative. Through extensive evaluation on ten
real-world open-source software systems, the proposed method shows significant
performance enhancement and its practicality. Moreover, the results also
suggest that \textit{DeepVS} tool is capable of suggesting zero-day (unseen)
code tokens by learning coding patterns from real-world software systems.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05493">Deep Transfer Learning for Source Code Modeling. (arXiv:1910.05493v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>In recent years, deep learning models have shown great potential in source
code modeling and analysis. Generally, deep learning-based approaches are
problem-specific and data-hungry. A challenging issue of these approaches is
that they require training from starch for a different related problem. In this
work, we propose a transfer learning-based approach that significantly improves
the performance of deep learning-based source code models. In contrast to
traditional learning paradigms, transfer learning can transfer the knowledge
learned in solving one problem into another related problem. First, we present
two recurrent neural network-based models RNN and GRU for the purpose of
transfer learning in the domain of source code modeling. Next, via transfer
learning, these pre-trained (RNN and GRU) models are used as feature
extractors. Then, these extracted features are combined into attention learner
for different downstream tasks. The attention learner leverages from the
learned knowledge of pre-trained models and fine-tunes them for a specific
downstream task. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with
extensive experiments with the source code suggestion task. The results
indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models in
terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure without training the models
from scratch.

<p>Recently deep learning based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have
shown great potential in the modeling of source code. However, a major
limitation of these approaches is that they take source code as simple tokens
of text and ignore its contextual, syntactical and structural dependencies. In
this work, we present CodeGRU, a gated recurrent unit based source code
language model that is capable of capturing source code's contextual,
syntactical and structural dependencies. We introduce a novel approach which
can capture the source code context by leveraging the source code token types.
Further, we adopt a novel approach which can learn variable size context by
taking into account source code's syntax, and structural information. We
evaluate CodeGRU with real-world data set and it shows that CodeGRU outperforms
the state-of-the-art language models and help reduce the vocabulary size up to
24.93\%. Unlike previous works, we tested CodeGRU with an independent test set
which suggests that our methodology does not requisite the source code comes
from the same domain as training data while providing suggestions. We further
evaluate CodeGRU with two software engineering applications: source code
suggestion, and source code completion. Our experiment confirms that the source
code's contextual information can be vital and can help improve the software
language models. The extensive evaluation of CodeGRU shows that it outperforms
the state-of-the-art models. The results further suggest that the proposed
approach can help reduce the vocabulary size and is of practical use for
software developers.

<p>Gene splicing modulates the potency of cell death effectors, alters neuropathological disease processes, influences neuronal recovery, but may also direct distinct mechanisms of secondary brain injury. Therapeutic targeting of RNA splicing is a promising avenue for next-generation CNS treatments. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate a variety of RNA species and are prime candidates in the hunt for druggable targets to manipulate and tailor gene-splicing responses in the brain. RBPs preferentially recognize unique consensus sequences in targeted mRNAs. Also, RBPs often contain multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs)—each having a unique consensus sequence—suggesting the possibility that drugs could be developed to block individual functional domains, increasing the precision of RBP-targeting therapies. Empirical characterization of most RBPs is lacking and represents a major barrier to advance this emerging therapeutic area. There is a paucity of data on the role of RBPs in the brain including, identification of their unique mRNA targets, defining how CNS insults affect their levels and elucidating which RBPs (and individual domains within) to target to improve neurological outcomes. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art of the RBP tumor suppressor RNA binding motif 5 (RBM5) in the CNS. We discuss its potent pro-death roles in cancer, which motivated our interest to study it in the brain. We review recent studies showing that RBM5 levels are increased after CNS trauma and that it promotes neuronal death in vitro. Finally, we conclude with recent reports on the first set of RBM5 regulated genes identified in the intact brain, and discuss how those findings provide new clues germane to its potential function(s) in the CNS, and pose new questions on its therapeutic utility to mitigate CNS injury.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, chronic, and neurodegenerative disorder that is primarily diagnosed by clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we proposed a machine learning based radiomics method to predict PD. Fifty healthy controls (HC) along with 70 PD patients underwent resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). For all subjects, we extracted five types of 6664 features, including mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and gray matter (GM) volume. After conducting dimension reduction utilizing Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), fifty-three radiomic features including 46 RSFCs, 1 mALFF, 3 mReHos, 1 VMHC, 2 GM volumes and 1 clinical factor were retained. The selected features also indicated the most discriminative regions for PD. We further conducted model fitting procedure for classifying subjects in the training set employing random forest and support volume machine (SVM) to evaluate the performance of the two methods. After cross-validation, both methods achieved 100% accuracy and area under curve (AUC) for distinguishing between PD and HC in the training set. In the testing set, SVM performed better than random forest with the accuracy, true positive rate (TPR) and AUC being 85%, 1 and 0.97, respectively. These findings demonstrate the radiomics technique has the potential to support radiological diagnosis and to achieve high classification accuracy for clinical diagnostic systems for patients with PD.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and devastating multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. Although the pathogenesis of ALS is still not completely understood, numerous studies suggest that mitochondrial deregulation may be implicated in its onset and progression. Interestingly, mitochondrial deregulation has also been associated with changes in neural stem cells (NSC) proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In this review, we highlight the importance of mitochondrial function for neurogenesis, and how both processes are correlated and may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS; we have focused primarily on preclinical data from animal models of ALS, since to date no studies have evaluated this link using human samples. As there is currently no cure and no effective therapy to counteract ALS, we have also discussed how improving neurogenic function by epigenetic modulation could benefit ALS. In support of this hypothesis, changes in histone deacetylation can alter mitochondrial function, which in turn might ameliorate cellular proliferation as well as neuronal differentiation and migration. We propose that modulation of epigenetics, mitochondrial function, and neurogenesis might provide new hope for ALS patients, and studies exploring these new territories are warranted in the near future.</p>

<p>Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most frequent cause of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). Several genetic manipulations of the LRRK2 gene have been developed in animal models such as rodents, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and zebrafish. These models can help us further understand the biological function and derive potential pathological mechanisms for LRRK2. Here we discuss common phenotypic themes found in LRRK2-associated PD animal models, highlight several issues that should be addressed in future models, and discuss emerging areas to guide their future development.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00278">Alterations of Spontaneous Brain Activity in Hemodialysis Patients</a></h4>

<p>Cognitive impairment is prevalent in hemodialysis end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. It might be associated with poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms have not been completely clarified. This study explored spontaneous brain activity in ESRD patients on hemodialysis by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). Nineteen ESRD patients on regular hemodialysis were included in this study. Eighteen age-, sex- and education level-matched volunteers were enrolled as the healthy control group. All participants had resting-state functional MRI scanning, neuropsychological tests, and laboratory testing. ALFF was used for assessing intrinsic brain activity. Independent samples t-test was used for obtaining group differences. Spearman correlation analysis was applied to assess the association between ALFF changes, neuropsychological, and clinical indices. Compared to the healthy control group, hemodialysis patients showed decreased ALFF in the precuneus, right angular gyrus/inferior lobule as well as increased ALFF in the left parahippocampus/hippocampus and right precentral/postcentral gyrus. The ALFF abnormalities in these regions were closely associated with hemoglobin levels. Also, increased ALFF in the left parahippocampus/hippocampus showed a negative correlation with the score of long-delayed free recall. Hemodialysis patients had aberrant ALFF in the default mode network (DMN) regions, particularly in the precuneus and parahippocampus/hippocampus, which may be correlated with neuropathological mechanisms involved in hemodialysis.</p>

<p>Our jobs can provide intellectually and socially enriched environments but also be the source of major psychological and physical stressors. As the average full-time worker spends &gt;8 h at work per weekday and remains in the workforce for about 40 years, occupational experiences must be important factors in cognitive and brain aging. Therefore, we studied whether occupational complexity and stress are associated with hippocampal volume and cognitive ability in 99 cognitively normal older adults. We estimated occupational complexity, physical stress, and psychological stress using the Work Design Questionnaire (Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006), Quantitative Workload Inventory and Interpersonal Conflict at Work Scale (Spector and Jex, 1998). We found that physical stress, comprising physical demands and work conditions, was associated with smaller hippocampal volume and poorer memory performance. These associations were independent of age, gender, brain size, socioeconomic factors (education, income, and job title), duration of the job, employment status, leisure physical activity and general stress. This suggests that physical demands at work and leisure physical activity may have largely independent and opposite effects on brain and cognitive health. Our findings highlight the importance of considering midlife occupational experiences, such as work physical stress, in understanding individual trajectories of cognitive and brain aging.</p>

<p>In vivo 1-photon (1p) calcium imaging is an increasingly prevalent method in behavioral neuroscience. Numerous analysis pipelines have been developed to improve the reliability and scalability of pre-processing and ROI extraction for these large calcium imaging datasets. Despite these advancements in pre-processing methods, manual curation of the extracted spatial footprints and calcium traces of neurons remains important for quality control. Here, we propose an additional semi-automated curation step for sorting spatial footprints and calcium traces from putative neurons extracted using the popular constrained non-negative matrixfactorization for microendoscopic data (CNMF-E) algorithm. We used the automated machine learning (AutoML) tools TPOT and AutoSklearn to generate classifiers to curate the extracted ROIs trained on a subset of human-labeled data. AutoSklearn produced the best performing classifier, achieving an F1 score &gt;92% on the ground truth test dataset. This automated approach is a useful strategy for filtering ROIs with relatively few labeled data points and can be easily added to pre-existing pipelines currently using CNMF-E for ROI extraction.</p>

<p>As the technological hurdles are overcome and optogenetic techniques advance to have more control over neurons, therapies based on these approaches will begin to emerge in the clinic. Here, we consider the technical challenges surrounding the transition of this breakthrough technology from an investigative tool to a true therapeutic avenue. The emerging strategies and remaining tasks surrounding genetically encoded molecules which respond to light as well as the vehicles required to deliver them are discussed.The use of optogenetics in humans would represent a completely new paradigm in medicine and would be associated with unprecedented technical considerations. To be applied for stimulation of neurons in humans, an ideal optogenetic tool would need to be non-immunogenic, highly sensitive, and activatable with red light or near-infrared light (to maximize light penetration while minimizing photodamage). To enable sophisticated levels of neuronal control, the combined use of optogenetic actuators and indicators could enable closed-loop all-optical neuromodulation. Such systems would introduce additional challenges related to spectral orthogonality between actuator and indicator, the need for decision making computational algorithms and requirements for large gene cassettes. As in any gene therapy, the therapeutic efficiency of optogenetics will rely on vector delivery and expression in the appropriate cell type. Although viral vectors such as those based on AAVs are showing great potential in human trials, barriers to their general use remain, including immune responses, delivery/transport, and liver clearance. Limitations associated with the gene cassette size which can be packaged in currently approved vectors also need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Telomere attrition is increased in various disorders and is therefore a potential biomarker for diagnosis and/or prognosis of these disorders. The contribution of telomere attrition in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders is yet to be fully elucidated. We are reviewing the current knowledge regarding the telomere biology in two common neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Furthermore, we are discussing future prospective of telomere research in these disorders. The majority of studies reported consistent evidence of the accelerated telomere attrition in AD patients, possibly in association with elevated oxidative stress levels. On the other hand in PD, various studies reported contradictory evidence regarding telomere attrition. Consequently, due to the low specificity and sensitivity, the clinical benefit of telomere length as a biomarker of neurodegenerative disease development and progression is not yet recognized. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies in large carefully selected cohorts might provide further elucidation of the complex involvement of the telomeres in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Telomere length maintenance is a complex process characterized by environmental, genetic, and epigenetic determinants. Thus, in addition to the selection of the study cohort, also the selection of analytical methods and types of biological samples for evaluation of the telomere attrition is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>Cerebral ischemic stroke is regarded as one of the most serious diseases in the human central nervous system. The secondary ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury increased the difficulty of treatment. Moreover, the latent molecular regulating mechanism in I/R injury is still unclear. Based on our previous clinical study, we discovered that FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) is significantly upregulated in patients, who suffered acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with high diagnostic value. Levels of FKBP5 were positively correlated with patients’ neurological impairments. Furthermore, a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of mice was used to confirm that FKBP5 expression in plasma could reflect its relative level in brain tissue. Thus, we hypothesized that FKBP5 participated in the regulation of cerebral I/R injury. In order to explore the possible roles FKBP5 acted, the oxygen and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was established to mimic I/R injury in vitro. FKBP5 expressing levels were changed by plasmid stable transfection. The altered expression of FKBP5 influenced cell viability and autophagy after OGD/R injury notably. Besides, AKT/FOXO3 cascade was involved in the FKBP5-regulating process. In the present study, FKBP5 was verified upregulated in cerebral I/R injury, related to the severity of ischemia and reperfusion injury. Additionally, our analyses revealed that FKBP5 regulates autophagy induced by OGD/R via the downstream AKT/FOXO3 signaling pathway. Our findings provide a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis of ischemic stroke and a potential strategy for treatment.</p>

<p>Heart rate variability (HRV) mirrors autonomic nervous system activities and might serve as a parameter to monitor health status in older adults. However, it is currently unknown which functional health measures, including cognitive, physical, and gait performance parameters, are most strongly related to HRV indices. This knowledge would enable implementing HRV assessments into health monitoring routines and training planning for older adults. Simultaneous cognitive–motor and exergame training may be effective to improve HRV indices but has not been investigated yet. Eighty-nine healthy older adults (≥70 years of age) were randomized into three groups: (1) virtual reality video game dancing, i.e., exergaming (DANCE); (2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY); or (3) treadmill walking only (PHYS). Strength and balance exercises complemented each program. Over 6 months, two weekly 1-h training sessions were performed. HRV indices (standard deviation of N–N intervals, SDNN; root mean square of successive R–R interval differences, RMSSD; and absolute power of high-frequency band (0.15–0.4 Hz), HF power) and various measures of cognitive, physical, and gait performance were assessed at baseline and after 3 months and 6 months. Multiple linear regression analyses with planned comparisons were calculated. At baseline, 8–12% of HRV variance was significantly explained by cognitive executive functions and leg strength (inversely related). Verbal long-term memory, aerobic and functional fitness, and gait performance did not contribute to the model (SDNN: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.082, p = 0.016; RMSSD: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.121, p = 0.013; HF power: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.119, p = 0.015). After 6 months, DANCE improved HRV indices, while MEMORY and PHYS did not (time × intervention interactions: first-contrast DANCE/MEMORY vs. PHYS: SDNN p = 0.014 one-tailed, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.020 and RMSSD p = 0.052 one-tailed (trend), ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.007; second-contrast DANCE vs. MEMORY: SDNN p = 0.002 one-tailed, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.035, RMSSD p = 0.017 one-tailed, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.012, and HF power p = 0.011 one-tailed, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.013). We conclude that mainly cognitive executive functions are associated with HRV indices and that exergame training improves global and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activities in older adults. Periodic assessments of HRV in older citizens could be particularly beneficial to monitor cognitive health and provide indications for preventative exercise measures.</p>

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated ion channel complex that controls mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and regulates cell metabolism. MCU and EMRE form the channel while Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation is conferred by MICU1 and MICU2 through an enigmatic process. We present a cryo-EM structure of an MCU-EMRE-MICU1-MICU2 holocomplex comprising MCU and EMRE subunits from the beetle Tribolium castaneum in complex with a human MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer at 3.3 Å resolution. With analogy to how neuronal channels are blocked by protein toxins, a uniporter interaction domain on MICU1 binds to a channel receptor site comprising MCU and EMRE subunits to inhibit ion flow under resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions. A Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound structure of MICU1-MICU2 at 3.1 Å resolution indicates how Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent changes enable dynamic response to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.

<p>by David Tadres, Matthieu Louis</p>

Tools enabling closed-loop experiments are crucial to delineate causal relationships between the activity of genetically labeled neurons and specific behaviors. We developed the Raspberry Pi Virtual Reality (PiVR) system to conduct closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of neural functions in unrestrained animals. PiVR is an experimental platform that operates at high temporal resolution (70 Hz) with low latencies (&lt;30 milliseconds), while being affordable (&lt;6 hours). Through extensive documentation, this tool was designed to be accessible to a wide public, from high school students to professional researchers studying systems neuroscience. We illustrate the functionality of PiVR by focusing on sensory navigation in response to gradients of chemicals (chemotaxis) and light (phototaxis). We show how <i>Drosophila</i> adult flies perform negative chemotaxis by modulating their locomotor speed to avoid locations associated with optogenetically evoked bitter taste. In <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, we use innate positive chemotaxis to compare behavior elicited by real- and virtual-odor gradients. Finally, we examine how positive phototaxis emerges in zebrafish larvae from the modulation of turning maneuvers to orient in virtual white-light gradients. Besides its application to study chemotaxis and phototaxis, PiVR is a versatile tool designed to bolster efforts to map and to functionally characterize neural circuits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TZkBZnaofMc" width="1" />

Improving the reproducibility of biomedical research is a major challenge. Transparent and accurate reporting is vital to this process; it allows readers to assess the reliability of the findings and repeat or build upon the work of other researchers. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) were developed in 2010 to help authors and journals identify the minimum information necessary to report in publications describing in vivo experiments. Despite widespread endorsement by the scientific community, the impact of ARRIVE on the transparency of reporting in animal research publications has been limited. We have revised the ARRIVE guidelines to update them and facilitate their use in practice. The revised guidelines are published alongside this paper. This explanation and elaboration document was developed as part of the revision. It provides further information about each of the 21 items in ARRIVE 2.0, including the rationale and supporting evidence for their inclusion in the guidelines, elaboration of details to report, and examples of good reporting from the published literature. This document also covers advice and best practice in the design and conduct of animal studies to support researchers in improving standards from the start of the experimental design process through to publication.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TVG_d0RsR0c" width="1" />

<p>by Nathalie Percie du Sert, Viki Hurst, Amrita Ahluwalia, Sabina Alam, Marc T. Avey, Monya Baker, William J. Browne, Alejandra Clark, Innes C. Cuthill, Ulrich Dirnagl, Michael Emerson, Paul Garner, Stephen T. Holgate, David W. Howells, Natasha A. Karp, Stanley E. Lazic, Katie Lidster, Catriona J. MacCallum, Malcolm Macleod, Esther J.

Reproducible science requires transparent reporting. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) were originally developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research. They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved. Here, we introduce ARRIVE 2.0. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise and divide the items of the guidelines into 2 sets, the “ARRIVE Essential 10,” which constitutes the minimum requirement, and the “Recommended Set,” which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration (E&amp;E) document, which serves (1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, (2) to clarify key concepts, and (3) to provide illustrative examples. We aim, through these changes, to help ensure that researchers, reviewers, and journal editors are better equipped to improve the rigour and transparency of the scientific process and thus reproducibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/z2lkpZ3p6v0" width="1" />

Dvl (Dishevelled) is one of several essential nonenzymatic components of the Wnt signaling pathway. In most current models, Dvl forms complexes with Wnt ligand receptors, Fzd and LRP5/6 at the plasma membrane, which then recruits the destruction complex, eventually leading to inactivation of β-catenin degradation.

<p>Autocatalytic networks have been used to model the emergence of
self-organizing structure capable of sustaining life and undergoing biological
evolution. Here, we model the emergence of cognitive structure capable of
undergoing cultural evolution. Mental representations of knowledge and
experiences play the role of catalytic molecules, and interactions amongst them
(e.g., the forging of new associations) play the role of reactions, and result
in representational redescription. The approach tags mental representations
with their source, i.e., whether they were acquired through social learning,
individual learning (of pre-existing information), or creative thought
(resulting in the generation of new information). This makes it possible to
model how cognitive structure emerges, and to trace lineages of cumulative
culture step by step. We develop a formal representation of the cultural
transition from Oldowan to Acheulean tool technology using Reflexively
Autocatalytifc and Food set generated (RAF) networks. Unlike more primitive
Oldowan stone tools, the Acheulean hand axe required not only the capacity to
envision and bring into being something that did not yet exist, but
hierarchically structured thought and action, and the generation of new mental
representations: the concepts EDGING, THINNING, SHAPING, and a meta-concept,
HAND AXE. We show how this constituted a key transition towards the emergence
of semantic networks that were self-organizing, self-sustaining, and
autocatalytic, and discuss how such networks replicated through social
interaction. The model provides a promising approach to unraveling one of the
greatest anthropological mysteries: that of why development of the Acheulean
hand axe was followed by over a million years of cultural stasis.

<p>For a considerable time, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have
reached human benchmark performance in object recognition. On that account,
computational neuroscience and the field of machine learning have started to
attribute numerous similarities and differences to artificial and biological
vision. This study aims towards a behavioral comparison of visual core object
recognition between humans and feedforward neural networks in a classification
learning paradigm on an ImageNet data set. For this purpose, human participants
(n = 65) competed in an online experiment against different feedforward DCNNs.
The designed approach based on a typical learning process of seven different
monkey categories included a training and validation phase with natural
examples, as well as a testing phase with novel shape and color manipulations.
Analyses of accuracy revealed that humans not only outperform DCNNs on all
conditions, but also display significantly greater robustness towards shape and
most notably color alterations. Furthermore, a precise examination of
behavioral patterns highlights these findings by revealing independent
classification errors between the groups. The obtained results endorse an
implementation of recurrent circuits similar to the primate ventral stream in
artificial vision models as a way to achieve adequate object generalization
abilities across unexperienced manipulations.

<p>We demonstrate a declarative differentiable programming framework based on
the language of Lifted Relational Neural Networks, where small parameterized
logic programs are used to encode relational learning scenarios. When presented
with relational data, such as various forms of graphs, the program interpreter
dynamically unfolds differentiable computational graphs to be used for the
program parameter optimization by standard means. Following from the used
declarative Datalog abstraction, this results into compact and elegant learning
programs, in contrast with the existing procedural approaches operating
directly on the computational graph level. We illustrate how this idea can be
used for an efficient encoding of a diverse range of existing advanced neural
architectures, with a particular focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
Additionally, we show how the contemporary GNN models can be easily extended
towards higher relational expressiveness. In the experiments, we demonstrate
correctness and computation efficiency through comparison against specialized
GNN deep learning frameworks, while shedding some light on the learning
performance of existing GNN models.

<p>The aim of this work is to develop a fully-distributed algorithmic framework
for training graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The proposed method is able
to exploit the meaningful relational structure of the input data, which are
collected by a set of agents that communicate over a sparse network topology.
After formulating the centralized GCN training problem, we first show how to
make inference in a distributed scenario where the underlying data graph is
split among different agents. Then, we propose a distributed gradient descent
procedure to solve the GCN training problem. The resulting model distributes
computation along three lines: during inference, during back-propagation, and
during optimization. Convergence to stationary solutions of the GCN training
problem is also established under mild conditions. Finally, we propose an
optimization criterion to design the communication topology between agents in
order to match with the graph describing data relationships. A wide set of
numerical results validate our proposal. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work combining graph convolutional neural networks with distributed
optimization.

context, evolutionary algorithms such as COEGAN were proposed to solve the
challenges in GAN training. Nevertheless, the lack of diversity and premature
optimization can be found in some of these solutions. We propose in this paper
the application of a quality-diversity algorithm in the evolution of GANs. The
solution is based on the Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC)
algorithm, adapting the concepts used in COEGAN to this new proposal. We
compare our proposal with the original COEGAN model and with an alternative
version using a global competition approach. The experimental results evidenced
that our proposal increases the diversity of the discovered solutions and
leverage the performance of the models found by the algorithm. Furthermore, the
global competition approach was able to consistently find better models for
GANs.

<p>Neuron death is a complex phenomenon with implications for model
trainability, but until recently it was measured only empirically. Recent
articles have claimed that, as the depth of a rectifier neural network grows to
infinity, the probability of finding a valid initialization decreases to zero.
In this work, we provide a simple and rigorous proof of that result. Then, we
show what happens when the width of each layer grows simultaneously with the
depth. We derive both upper and lower bounds on the probability that a ReLU
network is initialized to a trainable point, as a function of model
hyperparameters. Contrary to previous claims, we show that it is possible to
increase the depth of a network indefinitely, so long as the width increases as
well. Furthermore, our bounds are asymptotically tight under reasonable
assumptions: first, the upper bound coincides with the true probability for a
single-layer network with the largest possible input set. Second, the true
probability converges to our lower bound when the network width and depth both
grow without limit. Our proof is based on the striking observation that very
deep rectifier networks concentrate all outputs towards a single eigenvalue, in
the sense that their normalized output variance goes to zero regardless of the
network width. Finally, we develop a practical sign flipping scheme which
guarantees with probability one that for a $k$-layer network, the ratio of
living training data points is at least $2^{-k}$. We confirm our results with
numerical simulations, suggesting that the actual improvement far exceeds the
theoretical minimum. We also discuss how neuron death provides a theoretical
interpretation for various network design choices such as batch normalization,
residual layers and skip connections, and could inform the design of very deep
neural networks.

<p>In this work we explore recurrent representations of leaky integrate and fire
neurons operating at a timescale equal to their absolute refractory period. Our
coarse time scale approximation is obtained using a probability distribution
function for spike arrivals that is homogeneously distributed over this time
interval. This leads to a discrete representation that exhibits the same
dynamics as the continuous model, enabling efficient large scale simulations
and backpropagation through the recurrent implementation. We use this approach
to explore the training of deep spiking neural networks including
convolutional, all-to-all connectivity, and maxpool layers directly in Pytorch.
We found that the recurrent model leads to high classification accuracy using
just 4-long spike trains during training. We also observed a good transfer back
to continuous implementations of leaky integrate and fire neurons. Finally, we
applied this approach to some of the standard control problems as a first step
to explore reinforcement learning using neuromorphic chips.

<p>This tutorial paper refers to the use of graph-theoretic concepts for
analyzing brain signals. For didactic purposes it splits into two parts: theory
and application. In the first part, we commence by introducing some basic
elements from graph theory and stemming algorithmic tools, which can be
employed for data-analytic purposes. Next, we describe how these concepts are
adapted for handling evolving connectivity and gaining insights into network
reorganization. Finally, the notion of signals residing on a given graph is
introduced and elements from the emerging field of graph signal processing
(GSP) are provided. The second part serves as a pragmatic demonstration of the
tools and techniques described earlier. It is based on analyzing a multi-trial
dataset containing single-trial responses from a visual ERP paradigm. The paper
ends with a brief outline of the most recent trends in graph theory that are
about to shape brain signal processing in the near future and a more general
discussion on the relevance of graph-theoretic methodologies for analyzing
continuous-mode neural recordings.

<p>The Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted research interest due to
its temporal information processing capability, low power consumption, and high
biological plausibility. The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model is one
of the most popular spiking neuron models used in SNNs for it achieves a
balance between computing cost and biological plausibility. The most important
parameter of a LIF neuron is the membrane time constant $\tau$, which
determines the decay rate of membrane potential. The value of $\tau$ plays a
crucial role in SNNs containing LIF neurons. However, $\tau$ is usually treated
as a hyper-parameter, which is preset before training SNNs and adjusted
manually. In this article, we propose a novel spiking neuron, namely parametric
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neuron, whose $\tau$ is a learnable parameter
rather than an empirical hyper-parameter. We evaluate the performance of SNNs
with PLIF neurons for image classification tasks on both traditional static
MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 datasets, and neuromorphic N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS
datasets. The experiment results show that SNNs augmented by PLIF neurons
outperform those with conventional spiking neurons.

<p>The increasing rise in machine learning and deep learning applications is
requiring ever more computational resources to successfully meet the growing
demands of an always-connected, automated world. Neuromorphic technologies
based on Spiking Neural Network algorithms hold the promise to implement
advanced artificial intelligence using a fraction of the computations and power
requirements by modeling the functioning, and spiking, of the human brain. With
the proliferation of tools and platforms aiding data scientists and machine
learning engineers to develop the latest innovations in artificial and deep
neural networks, a transition to a new paradigm will require building from the
current well-established foundations. This paper explains the theoretical
workings of neuromorphic technologies based on spikes, and overviews the
state-of-art in hardware processors, software platforms and neuromorphic
sensing devices. A progression path is paved for current machine learning
specialists to update their skillset, as well as classification or predictive
models from the current generation of deep neural networks to SNNs. This can be
achieved by leveraging existing, specialized hardware in the form of SpiNNaker
and the Nengo migration toolkit. First-hand, experimental results of converting
a VGG-16 neural network to an SNN are shared. A forward gaze into industrial,
medical and commercial applications that can readily benefit from SNNs wraps up
this investigation into the neuromorphic computing future.

<p>Learning adaptable policies is crucial for robots to operate autonomously in
our complex and quickly changing world. In this work, we present a new
meta-learning method that allows robots to quickly adapt to changes in
dynamics. In contrast to gradient-based meta-learning algorithms that rely on
second-order gradient estimation, we introduce a more noise-tolerant Batch
Hill-Climbing adaptation operator and combine it with meta-learning based on
evolutionary strategies. Our method significantly improves adaptation to
changes in dynamics in high noise settings, which are common in robotics
applications. We validate our approach on a quadruped robot that learns to walk
while subject to changes in dynamics. We observe that our method significantly
outperforms prior gradient-based approaches, enabling the robot to adapt its
policy to changes based on less than 3 minutes of real data.

<p>Fontenele and collaborators reported extensive analyses of power-law scalings
of neuronal avalanches in experimental recordings and in a critical theoretical
model. One of their main conclusions is that the brain operates at criticality
in specific regimes. To prove this point, they developed a test (hereafter,
"Fontenele test") for criticality, which they indicate to rely on our own
theoretical result. However, the results we established do not provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for criticality, and cannot be extrapolated
to derive a test for criticality. Moreover, the authors did not include any
control applying the Fontenele test to non-critical systems, to assess possible
differences with the experimental data. We propose here two such controls, and
show that the Fontenele test can misclassify as critical these non-critical
systems. This implies that the analyses of Fontenele et al. do not support
their conclusions, and the question of whether the brain operates at
criticality remains open.

<p>Previously, in (Hermundstad et al., 2014), we showed that when sampling is
limiting, the efficient coding principle leads to a "variance is salience"
hypothesis, and that this hypothesis accounts for visual sensitivity to binary
image statistics. Here, using extensive new psychophysical data and image
analysis, we show that this hypothesis accounts for visual sensitivity to a
large set of grayscale image statistics at a striking level of detail, and also
identify the limits of the prediction. We define a 66-dimensional space of
local grayscale light-intensity correlations, and measure the relevance of each
direction to natural scenes. The "variance is salience" hypothesis predicts
that two-point correlations are most salient, and predicts their relative
salience. We tested these predictions in a texture-segregation task using
un-natural, synthetic textures. As predicted, correlations beyond second order
are not salient, and predicted thresholds for over 300 second-order
correlations match psychophysical thresholds closely (median fractional error
&lt;0.13).

<p>People learn throughout life. However, incrementally updating conventional
neural networks leads to catastrophic forgetting. A common remedy is replay,
which is inspired by how the brain consolidates memory. Replay involves
fine-tuning a network on a mixture of new and old instances. While there is
neuroscientific evidence that the brain replays compressed memories, existing
methods for convolutional networks replay raw images. Here, we propose REMIND,
a brain-inspired approach that enables efficient replay with compressed
representations. REMIND is trained in an online manner, meaning it learns one
example at a time, which is closer to how humans learn. Under the same
constraints, REMIND outperforms other methods for incremental class learning on
the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset. We probe REMIND's robustness to data ordering
schemes known to induce catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate REMIND's
generality by pioneering online learning for Visual Question Answering (VQA).

<p>In the first and so far only mathematical runtime analysis of an
estimation-of-distribution algorithm (EDA) on a multimodal problem, Hasen\"ohrl
and Sutton (GECCO 2018) showed for any $k = o(n)$ that the compact genetic
algorithm (cGA) with any hypothetical population size $\mu = \Omega(ne^{4k} +
n^{3.5+\varepsilon})$ with high probability finds the optimum of the
$n$-dimensional jump function with jump size $k$ in time $O(\mu n^{1.5} \log
n)$.
</p>
<p>We significantly improve this result for small jump sizes $k \le \frac 1 {20}
\ln n -1$. In this case, already for $\mu = \Omega(\sqrt n \log n) \cap
\text{poly}(n)$ the runtime of the cGA with high probability is only $O(\mu
\sqrt n)$. For the smallest admissible values of $\mu$, our result gives a
runtime of $O(n \log n)$, whereas the previous one only shows
$O(n^{5+\varepsilon})$. Since it is known that the cGA with high probability
needs at least $\Omega(\mu \sqrt n)$ iterations to optimize the unimodal OneMx
function, our result shows that the cGA in contrast to most classic
evolutionary algorithms here is able to cross moderate-sized valleys of low
fitness at no extra cost.
</p>
<p>For large $k$, we show that the exponential (in $k$) runtime guarantee of
Hasen\"ohrl and Sutton is tight and cannot be improved, also not by using a
smaller hypothetical population size. We prove that any choice of the
hypothetical population size leads to a runtime that, with high probability, is
at least exponential in the jump size $k$. This result might be the first
non-trivial exponential lower bound for EDAs that holds for arbitrary parameter
settings.

<p>Robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task
in quantum information technology, molecular chemistry and atomic physics. In
this paper, an improved differential evolution algorithm, referred to as
\emph{msMS}\_DE, is proposed to search robust fields for various quantum
control problems. In \emph{msMS}\_DE, multiple samples are used for fitness
evaluation and a mixed strategy is employed for the mutation operation. In
particular, the \emph{msMS}\_DE algorithm is applied to the control problems of
(i) open inhomogeneous quantum ensembles and (ii) the consensus goal of a
quantum network with uncertainties. Numerical results are presented to
demonstrate the excellent performance of the improved machine learning
algorithm for these two classes of quantum robust control problems.
Furthermore, \emph{msMS}\_DE is experimentally implemented on femtosecond laser
control applications to optimize two-photon absorption and control
fragmentation of the molecule $\text{CH}_2\text{BrI}$. Experimental results
demonstrate excellent performance of \emph{msMS}\_DE in searching for effective
femtosecond laser pulses for various tasks.

However, both preclinical and clinical studies indicate the capacity of electrical and pharmacological interventions to synergistically increase the engagement of spinal sensorimotor networks and regain motor function after SCI. This study explored whether selective pharmacological antagonism of the adenosine A1 receptor subtype synergizes with ESS, thereby increasing motor response. We hypothesized that selective pharmacological antagonism of A1 receptors during ESS would produce facilitatory effects in spinal sensorimotor networks detected as an increased amplitude of spinally-evoked motor potentials and sustained duration of ESS induced activity. Terminal experiments were performed in adult rats using trains of stereotyped pulses at 40 Hz delivered at L5 with the local administration to the cord of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). We demonstrated that ESS combined with the blockage of A1 receptors increased the magnitude of the endogenous modulation and postponed the decay of responses that occur during ESS alone. Although DPCPX significantly increased the yield of repetitive stimulation in intact spinal cords, the effects of A1 antagonism on motor evoked responses after an acute spinal transection was not detected. These studies support the future investigation of the optimal dosage, methods of delivery, and systemic effects of the synergistic application of A1 antagonists and spinal stimulation in the intact and injured spinal cord.</p>

<p>Cochlear implants (CIs) are widely used to provide auditory rehabilitation to individuals having severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, insertion of electrode leads to inner trauma and activation of inflammatory and apoptotic signaling cascades resulting in loss of residual hearing in implanted individuals. Pharmaceutical interventions that can target these signaling cascades hold great potential for preserving residual hearing by preventing sensory cell damage. Bile salts have shown efficacy in various regions of the body as powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. However, their efficacy against inner ear trauma has never been explored. The objective of this study was to determine whether taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), a bile salt derivative, can prevent sensory cell damage employing an in vitro model of electrode insertion trauma (EIT). The organ of Corti (OC) explants were dissected from postnatal day 3 (P-3) rats and placed in serum-free media. Explants were divided into control and experimental groups: (1) untreated controls; (2) EIT; (3) EIT+ TDCA (different concentrations). Hair cell (HC) density, analyses of apoptosis pathway (cleaved caspase 3), levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) were assayed. Treatment with TDCA provided significant otoprotection against HC loss in a dose-dependent manner. The molecular mechanisms underlying otoprotection involved decreasing oxidative stress, lowering levels of iNOS, and abrogating generation of cleaved caspase 3. The results of the present study suggest that TDCA provides efficient otoprotection against EIT, in vitro and should be explored for developing pharmaceutical interventions to preserve residual hearing post-cochlear implantation.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation in the brain of intraneuronal aggregates of abnormally and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and of extracellular deposits of amyloid-β surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Numerous experimental models have shown that tau pathology develops in the brain after intracerebral injection of brain homogenates or pathological tau [paired helical filaments (PHF)-tau)] from AD brains. Further investigations are however necessary to identify or exclude potential extracerebral routes of tau pathology transmission, e.g., through the intravascular route. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of intravenous injection of PHF-tau proteins from AD brains on the formation of tau and amyloid pathologies in the brain of wild-type (WT) mice and of 5XFAD mice (an amyloid model). We observed that 5XFAD mice with a disrupted blood–brain barrier showed increased plaque-associated astrogliosis, microgliosis, and increased deposits of Aβ40 and Aβ42 after intravenous injection of PHF-tau proteins. In addition, an increased phosphotau immunoreactivity was observed in plaque-associated dystrophic neurites. These results suggest that blood products contaminated by PHF-tau proteins could potentially induce an exacerbation of neuroinflammation and AD pathologies.</p>

<p>Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) caused by noise exposure and attendant loss of glutamatergic synapses between cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and hair cells is the most common sensory deficit worldwide. We show here that systemic administration of a bisphosphonate to mice 24 h after synaptopathic noise exposure regenerated synapses between inner hair cells and SGNs and restored cochlear function. We further demonstrate that this effect is mediated by inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. These results are highly significant because they suggest that bisphosphonates could reverse cochlear synaptopathy for the treatment of SNHL.</p>

<p>Background: There exists a cohort of children and adults who exhibit an inordinately high degree of discomfort when experiencing what would be considered moderate and manageable levels of sensory input. That is, they show over-responsivity in the face of entirely typical sound, light, touch, taste, or smell inputs, and this occurs to such an extent that it interferes with their daily functioning and reaches clinical levels of dysfunction. What marks these individuals apart is that this sensory processing disorder (SPD) is observed in the absence of other symptom clusters that would result in a diagnosis of Autism, ADHD, or other neurodevelopmental disorders more typically associated with sensory processing difficulties. One major theory forwarded to account for these SPDs posits a deficit in multisensory integration, such that the various sensory inputs are not appropriately integrated into the central nervous system, leading to an overwhelming sensory-perceptual environment, and in turn to the sensory-defensive phenotype observed in these individuals.</p><p>Methods: We tested whether children (6–16 years) with an over-responsive SPD phenotype (N = 12) integrated multisensory speech differently from age-matched typically-developing controls (TD: N = 12). Participants identified monosyllabic words while background noise level and sensory modality (auditory-alone, visual-alone, audiovisual) were varied in pseudorandom order. Improved word identification when speech was both seen and heard compared to when it was simply heard served to index multisensory speech integration.</p><p>Results: School-aged children with an SPD show a deficit in the ability to benefit from the combination of both seen and heard speech inputs under noisy environmental conditions, suggesting that these children do not benefit from multisensory integrative processing to the same extent as their typically developing peers. In contrast, auditory-alone performance did not differ between the groups, signifying that this multisensory deficit is not simply due to impaired processing of auditory speech.</p><p>Conclusions: Children with an over-responsive SPD show a substantial reduction in their ability to benefit from complementary audiovisual speech, to enhance speech perception in a noisy environment. This has clear implications for performance in the classroom and other learning environments. Impaired multisensory integration may contribute to sensory over-reactivity that is the definitional of SPD.</p>

<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder caused by the lack of dystrophin with progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles. Most studies regarding DMD understandably focus on muscle, but dystrophin is also expressed in the central nervous system, potentially resulting in cognitive and behavioral changes. Animal models are being used for developing more comprehensive neuromonitoring protocols and clinical image acquisition procedures. The recently developed DMD rat is an animal model that parallels the progressive muscle wasting seen in DMD. Here, we studied the brain and temporalis muscle structure and neurochemistry of wild type (WT) and dystrophic (DMD) rats using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Both structural and neurochemistry alterations were observed in the DMD rat brain and the temporalis muscle. There was a decrease in absolute brain volume (WT = 1579 mm<sup>3</sup>; DMD = 1501 mm<sup>3</sup>; p = 0.039, Cohen’s d = 1.867), but not normalized (WT = 4.27; DMD = 4.02; p = 0.306) brain volume. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed structural alterations in the DMD temporalis muscle, with increased mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). In the DMD rat thalamus, DTI revealed an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and a decrease in RD. Smaller normalized brain volume correlated to severity of muscle dystrophy (r = −0.975). Neurochemical changes in the DMD rat brain included increased GABA and NAA in the prefrontal cortex, and GABA in the hippocampus. Such findings could indicate disturbed motor and sensory signaling, resulting in a dysfunctional GABAergic neurotransmission, and an unstable osmoregulation in the dystrophin-null brain.</p>

<p>Cervical discogenic pain (CDP) is a clinically common pain syndrome caused by cervical disk degeneration. A large number of studies have reported that CDP results in brain functional impairments. However, the detailed dynamic brain functional abnormalities in CDP are still unclear. In this study, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored the neural basis of CDP with 40 CDP patients and 40 age-, gender-matched healthy controls to delineate the changes of the voxel-level static and dynamic amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). We found increased static ALFF in left insula (INS) and posterior precuneus (PCu), and decreased static ALFF in left precentral/postcentral gyrus (PreCG/PoCG), thalamus (THA), and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in CPD patients compared to healthy controls. We also found decreased dynamic ALFF in left PreCG/PoCG, right posterior middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral THA. Moreover, we found that static ALFF in left PreCG/PoCG and dynamic ALFF in THA were significantly negatively correlated with visual analog scale and disease duration, respectively. Our findings provide the neurophysiological basis for CDP and facilitate understanding the neuropathology of CDP.</p>

<p>DNA hypermethylation has been widely observed in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), in which NR4A1 knockdown has been reported to be able to alleviate seizure severity in mouse model, while the underlying methylation-imaging pathway modulated by aberrant methylation levels of NR4A1 remains to be clarified in patients with TLE. Here, using multi-site canonical correlation analysis with reference, methylation levels of NR4A1 in blood were used as priori to guide fusion of three MRI features: functional connectivity (FC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and gray matter volume (GMV) for 56 TLE patients and 65 healthy controls. Post-hoc correlations were further evaluated between the identified NR4A1-associated brain components and disease onset. Results suggested that higher NR4A1 methylation levels in TLE were related with impaired temporal-cerebellar and occipital-cerebellar FC strength, lower FA in cingulum (hippocampus), and reduced GMV in putamen, temporal pole, and cerebellum. Moreover, findings were also replicated well in both patient subsets with either right TLE or left TLE only. Particularly, right TLE patients showed poorer cognitive abilities and more severe brain impairment than left TLE patients, especially more reduced GMV in thalamus. In summary, this work revealed a potential imaging-methylation pathway modulated by higher NR4A1 methylation in TLE via data mining, which may impact the above-mentioned multimodal brain circuits and was also associated with earlier disease onset and more cognitive deficits.</p>

<p>The aim of this perspective is to propose and discuss the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with virtual reality (VR) food exposure for therapeutic interventions for food addiction. “Food addiction” is a dysfunctional eating pattern which is typically observed in eating disorders (ED) such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Food addiction has been compared to substance use disorder due to the necessity of consuming a substance (food) and the presence of a dependence behavior. In recent years, VR has been applied in the treatment of ED because it triggers psychological and physiological responses through food exposure in place of real stimuli. Virtual reality-Cue exposure therapy has been proven as a valid technique for regulating anxiety and food craving in ED. More, TMS has been proven to modulate circuits and networks implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and is effective in treating addiction such as nicotine craving and consumption and cocaine use disorder. The combination of a simulative technology and a neurostimulation would presumably provide better improvement compared to a single intervention because it implies the presence of both cognitive and neuropsychological techniques. The possible advantage of this approach will be discussed in the perspective.</p>

<p>Understanding how neural networks generate activity patterns and communicate with each other requires monitoring the electrical activity from many neurons simultaneously. Perfectly suited tools for addressing this challenge are genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) because they can be targeted to specific cell types and optically report the electrical activity of individual, or populations of neurons. However, analyzing and interpreting the data from voltage imaging experiments is challenging because high recording speeds and properties of current GEVIs yield only low signal-to-noise ratios, making it necessary to apply specific analytical tools. Here, we present NOSA (Neuro-Optical Signal Analysis), a novel open source software designed for analyzing voltage imaging data and identifying temporal interactions between electrical activity patterns of different origin. In this work, we explain the challenges that arise during voltage imaging experiments and provide hands-on analytical solutions. We demonstrate how NOSA’s baseline fitting, filtering algorithms and movement correction can compensate for shifts in baseline fluorescence and extract electrical patterns from low signal-to-noise recordings. NOSA allows to efficiently identify oscillatory frequencies in electrical patterns, quantify neuronal response parameters and moreover provides an option for analyzing simultaneously recorded optical and electrical data derived from patch-clamp or other electrode-based recordings. To identify temporal relations between electrical activity patterns we implemented different options to perform cross correlation analysis, demonstrating their utility during voltage imaging in Drosophila and mice. All features combined, NOSA will facilitate the first steps into using GEVIs and help to realize their full potential for revealing cell-type specific connectivity and functional interactions.</p>

<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been and will continue to be two common chronic diseases globally that are difficult to diagnose during the prodromal phase. Current molecular genetics, cell biological, and epidemiological evidences have shown the correlation between PD and DM. PD shares the same pathogenesis pathways and pathological factors with DM. In addition, β-cell reduction, which can cause hyperglycemia, is a striking feature of DM. Recent studies indicated that hyperglycemia is highly relevant to the pathologic changes in PD. However, further correlation between DM and PD remains to be investigated. Intriguingly, polycystic monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which is co-expressed in dopaminergic neurons and β cells, is responsible for taking up dopamine into the presynaptic vesicles and can specifically bind to the β cells. Furthermore, we have summarized the specific molecular and diagnostic functions of VMAT2 for the two diseases reported in this review. Therefore, VMAT2 can be applied as a target probe for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to detect β-cell and dopamine level changes, which can contribute to the diagnosis of DM and PD during the prodromal phase. Targeting VMAT2 with the molecular probe <sup>18</sup>F-FP-(+)-DTBZ can be an entry point for the β cell mass (BCM) changes in DM at the molecular level, to clarify the potential relationship between DM and PD. VMAT2 has promising clinical significance in investigating the pathogenesis, early diagnosis, and treatment evaluation of the two diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00675">Focused Ultrasound for Noninvasive, Focal Pharmacologic Neurointervention</a></h4>

<p>A long-standing goal of translational neuroscience is the ability to noninvasively deliver therapeutic agents to specific brain regions with high spatiotemporal resolution. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging technology that can noninvasively deliver energy up the order of 1 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> with millimeter and millisecond resolution to any point in the human brain with Food and Drug Administration-approved hardware. Although FUS is clinically utilized primarily for focal ablation in conditions such as essential tremor, recent breakthroughs have enabled the use of FUS for drug delivery at lower intensities (i.e., tens of watts per square centimeter) without ablation of the tissue. In this review, we present strategies for image-guided FUS-mediated pharmacologic neurointerventions. First, we discuss blood–brain barrier opening to deliver therapeutic agents of a variety of sizes to the central nervous system. We then describe the use of ultrasound-sensitive nanoparticles to noninvasively deliver small molecules to millimeter-sized structures including superficial cortical regions and deep gray matter regions within the brain without the need for blood–brain barrier opening. We also consider the safety and potential complications of these techniques, with attention to temporal acuity. Finally, we close with a discussion of different methods for mapping the ultrasound field within the brain and describe future avenues of research in ultrasound-targeted drug therapies.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00028">Deciphering the Morphology of Motor Evoked Potentials</a></h4>

<p>Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) are used to monitor disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Their morphology plays an important role in this process. Currently, however, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a normal or abnormal morphology. To address this, five experts independently labeled the morphology (normal or abnormal) of the same set of 1,000 MEPs. The intra- and inter-rater agreement between the experts indicates they agree on the concept of morphology, but differ in their choice of threshold between normal and abnormal morphology. We subsequently performed an automated extraction of 5,943 time series features from the MEPs to identify a valid proxy for morphology, based on the provided labels. To do this, we compared the cross-validation performances of one-dimensional logistic regression models fitted to each of the features individually. We find that the approximate entropy (ApEn) feature can accurately reproduce the majority-vote labels. The performance of this feature is evaluated on an independent test set by comparing to the majority vote of the neurologists, obtaining an AUC score of 0.92. The model slightly outperforms the average neurologist at reproducing the neurologists consensus-vote labels. We can conclude that MEP morphology can be consistently defined by pooling the interpretations from multiple neurologists and that ApEn is a valid continuous score for this. Having an objective and reproducible MEP morphological abnormality score will allow researchers to include this feature in their models, without manual annotation becoming a bottleneck. This is crucial for large-scale, multi-center datasets. An exploratory analysis on a large single-center dataset shows that ApEn is potentially clinically useful. Introducing an automated, objective, and reproducible definition of morphology could help overcome some of the barriers that are currently obstructing broad adoption of evoked potentials in daily care and patient follow-up, such as standardization of measurements between different centers, and formulating guidelines for clinical use.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia patients often show impaired facial expression recognition, which leads to difficulties in adaptation to daily life. However, it remains unclear whether the deficit is at the perceptual or higher cognitive level of facial emotion processing. Recent studies have shown that earlier face-evoked event-related potential (ERP) components such as N170 and P100 can effectively distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls; however, findings for later waveforms are ambiguous. To clarify this point, in this study we compared electroencephalographic signals in schizophrenia patients and control subjects during a facial expression judgment task. We found that group effects of the occipital N170 and frontal lobe contingent negative variation (CNV) were both significant. The effect sizes (ESs) of N170 and CNV amplitudes were generally medium or small, whereas that of CNV slope for an upright face was large (&gt;0.8). Moreover, N170 amplitude and CNV slope but not CNV amplitude was correlated with Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale score. These results suggest that the slope of CNV drift during facial expression processing has a potential clinical value for schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Introduction: Extended periods of sitting may have detrimental effects on brain health. However, the effects of breaking up prolonged sedentary periods with frequent, short physical activity bouts on mechanisms to improve brain health remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the immediate effects of uninterrupted sitting and frequent, short bouts of physical activity on cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in the prefrontal cortex in middle-aged adults.</p><p>Methods: This is a protocol article to describe a randomized crossover study. We will collect data from 13 healthy adults, aged between 40 and 60 years old, with a body mass index &lt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Participants will be required to come into the laboratory on three occasions, sit for 3 h, and perform a different type of break for 3 min every 30 min at each visit in a random order, being either: (1) a social break; (2) brisk walk on a treadmill; or (3) simple resistance activities. Before and after each experimental condition, cerebral blood flow (primary outcome) will be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), with short-separation channels, and working memory (1-, 2-, and 3-back on the computer) will be assessed. The following additional secondary outcomes will be collected: psychological factors (questionnaires); arterial stiffness; salivary cortisol levels; and blood glucose levels.</p><p>Conclusion: The results from this randomized crossover study will determine the effects of uninterrupted sitting and frequent, short bouts of physical activity on cerebral blood flow and cognitive performance. Publication of this study protocol emphasizes the importance of registration and publication of protocols in the field of sedentary behavior research.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), a major brain vessel that supplies the primary motor and premotor cortex, is one of the most common causes for severe upper limb impairment. Currently available motor rehabilitation training largely lacks satisfying efficacy with over 70% of stroke survivors showing residual upper limb dysfunction. Motor imagery-based functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic technique to improve motor impairment in stroke survivors. In this preregistered proof-of-concept study (https://osf.io/y69jc/), we translated graded fMRI-NF training, a new paradigm that we have previously studied in healthy participants, to first-time MCA stroke survivors with residual mild to severe impairment of upper limb motor function. Neurofeedback was provided from the supplementary motor area (SMA) targeting two different neurofeedback target levels (low and high). We hypothesized that MCA stroke survivors will show (1) sustained SMA-region of interest (ROI) activation and (2) a difference in SMA-ROI activation between low and high neurofeedback conditions during graded fMRI-NF training. At the group level, we found only anecdotal evidence for these preregistered hypotheses. At the individual level, we found anecdotal to moderate evidence for the absence of the hypothesized graded effect for most subjects. These null findings are relevant for future attempts to employ fMRI-NF training in stroke survivors. The study introduces a Bayesian sequential sampling plan, which incorporates prior knowledge, yielding higher sensitivity. The sampling plan was preregistered together with a priori hypotheses and all planned analysis before data collection to address potential publication/researcher biases. Unforeseen difficulties in the translation of our paradigm to a clinical setting required some deviations from the preregistered protocol. We explicitly detail these changes, discuss the accompanied additional challenges that can arise in clinical neurofeedback studies, and formulate recommendations for how these can be addressed. Taken together, this work provides new insights about the feasibility of motor imagery-based graded fMRI-NF training in MCA stroke survivors and serves as a first example for comprehensive study preregistration of an (fMRI) neurofeedback experiment.</p>

<p>Children born very preterm (VPT) are at high-risk for altered brain development and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes but are not well-studied before school-age. We investigated 64 four-year-olds: 37 VPT children [&lt;32 weeks gestational age [GA]; 22 males; mean GA: 28.8 weeks ± 1.6], 25 full-term (FT) children (12 males), plus two VPT cases with ventriculomegaly and exceptionally resilient outcomes. All children underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and developmental assessments. Measures of brain volume, cortical thickness, and surface area were obtained. Children born VPT demonstrated reduced cerebral and cerebellar white matter volumes yet increased cerebral gray matter, temporal lobe, occipital lobe and ventricle volumes after adjusting for total brain volume. Cortical thickness was greater in the VPT children compared to FT children across all lobes. On developmental assessments, the VPT children scored lower on average than FT children while the two cases had intact cognitive abilities. In addition to larger ventricle volumes, the two cases had white matter and gray matter volumes within the ranges of the FT children. The VPT children displayed distinct differences in structural brain volumes at 4 years of age, consistent with delayed maturation. The cases with persistent ventriculomegaly and good cognitive outcomes displayed typical gray matter and increased white matter volumes, indicating a potential protective developmental phenomenon contributing to their intact cognitive abilities.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00161">Optimization of Efficient Neuron Models With Realistic Firing Dynamics. The Case of the Cerebellar Granule Cell</a></h4>

<p>Biologically relevant large-scale computational models currently represent one of the main methods in neuroscience for studying information processing primitives of brain areas. However, biologically realistic neuron models tend to be computationally heavy and thus prevent these models from being part of brain-area models including thousands or even millions of neurons. The cerebellar input layer represents a canonical example of large scale networks. In particular, the cerebellar granule cells, the most numerous cells in the whole mammalian brain, have been proposed as playing a pivotal role in the creation of somato-sensorial information representations. Enhanced burst frequency (spiking resonance) in the granule cells has been proposed as facilitating the input signal transmission at the theta-frequency band (4–12 Hz), but the functional role of this cell feature in the operation of the granular layer remains largely unclear. This study aims to develop a methodological pipeline for creating neuron models that maintain biological realism and computational efficiency whilst capturing essential aspects of single-neuron processing. Therefore, we selected a light computational neuron model template (the adaptive-exponential integrate-and-fire model), whose parameters were progressively refined using an automatic parameter tuning with evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The resulting point-neuron models are suitable for reproducing the main firing properties of a realistic granule cell from electrophysiological measurements, including the spiking resonance at the theta-frequency band, repetitive firing according to a specified intensity-frequency (I-F) curve and delayed firing under current-pulse stimulation. Interestingly, the proposed model also reproduced some other emergent properties (namely, silent at rest, rheobase and negligible adaptation under depolarizing currents) even though these properties were not set in the EA as a target in the fitness function (FF), proving that these features are compatible even in computationally simple models. The proposed methodology represents a valuable tool for adjusting AdEx models according to a FF defined in the spiking regime and based on biological data. These models are appropriate for future research of the functional implication of bursting resonance at the theta band in large-scale granular layer network models.</p>

<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a model disorder for understanding brain development because the genes that cause TSC are known, many downstream molecular pathways have been identified, and the resulting perturbations of cellular events are established. TSC, therefore, provides an intellectual framework to understand the molecular and biochemical pathways that orchestrate normal brain development. The TSC1 and TSC2 genes encode Hamartin and Tuberin which form a GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex. Inactivating mutations in TSC genes (TSC1/TSC2) cause sustained Ras homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) activation of the mammalian isoform of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). TOR is a protein kinase that regulates cell size in many organisms throughout nature. mTORC1 inhibits catabolic processes including autophagy and activates anabolic processes including mRNA translation. mTORC1 regulation is achieved through two main upstream mechanisms. The first mechanism is regulation by growth factor signaling. The second mechanism is regulation by amino acids. Gene mutations that cause too much or too little mTORC1 activity lead to a spectrum of neuroanatomical changes ranging from altered brain size (micro and macrocephaly) to cortical malformations to Type I neoplasias. Because somatic mutations often underlie these changes, the timing, and location of mutation results in focal brain malformations. These mutations, therefore, provide gain-of-function and loss-of-function changes that are a powerful tool to assess the events that have gone awry during development and to determine their functional physiological consequences. Knowledge about the TSC-mTORC1 pathway has allowed scientists to predict which upstream and downstream mutations should cause commensurate neuroanatomical changes. Indeed, many of these predictions have now been clinically validated. A description of clinical imaging and histochemical findings is provided in relation to laboratory models of TSC that will allow the reader to appreciate how human pathology can provide an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of development.</p>

<p>Olfactory dysfunction could be an early and reliable indicator for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. In this paper, we compare the potential of different noninvasive medical imaging modalities (optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, and fluorescence endomicroscopy) to distinguish how the olfactory epithelium, both at the cellular and the structural levels, is altered. Investigations were carried out on three experimental groups: two pathological groups (mice models with deliberately altered olfactory epithelium and Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice models) were compared with healthy mice models. As histological staining, the three tested noninvasive imaging tools demonstrated the general tubular organization of the olfactory epithelium on healthy mice. Contrary to OCT, confocal microscopy, and endomicroscopy allowed visualizing the inner structure of olfactory epithelium as well as its morphological or functional changes on pathological models, alterations classically observed with histological assessment. The results could lead to relevant development of imaging tools for noninvasive and early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases through the in situ characterization of the olfactory epithelium.</p>

Objectives<p>Clinical characteristics of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) include migraine, recurrent stroke, white matter lesions, and vascular dementia. CADASIL is one of the most common hereditary cerebral small vessel diseases. Clinical presentation of CADASIL varies and a racial gap may exist between the Asian and Caucasian populations. This is the first nationwide epidemiological survey which aimed to elucidate the clinical features of CADASIL in Japan. Moreover, the registration database of CADASIL was constructed.</p>Methods<p>Subjects included CADASIL patients who visited the hospitals (totally 1,448 hospitals) certified by the Japanese Society of Neurology and/or Japan Stroke Society in 2016. This study consisted of a two-step survey; patients with CADASIL were identified genetically by the first questionnaire, and their clinical features were assessed by the second questionnaire. Selected 6 hospitals registered the data of all CADASIL patients using a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system for the second questionnaire.</p>Results<p>Based on the criteria, 88 patients (50 male and 38 female) with CADASIL were enrolled. The mean age of symptom onset was 49.5 years. Sixteen (18.2%) patients had an elderly onset (&gt;60 years). Thirteen patients (13.6%) had history of migraine with aura and 33 patients (37.5%) had vascular risk factor(s). From among the 86 patients who were examined using magnetic resonance imaging, abnormal deep white matter lesions were detected in 85 patients (98.8%), WMLs extending to anterior temporal pole in 73 patients (84.9%), and cerebral microbleeds in 41 patients (47.7%). Anti-platelet therapy was received by 65 patients (73.9%). Thirty-eight patients (43.2%) underwent treatment with lomerizine hydrochloride. Thirty-four different mutations of NOTCH3 were found in exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, and 19. Most of the mutations existed in exon 4 (n = 44, 60.3%). The prevalence rate of CADASIL was 1.20 to 3.58 per 100,000 adults in Japan.</p>Conclusion<p>This questionnaire-based study revealed clinical features and treatment status in Japanese CADASIL patient, although it may not be an exhaustive search. We have constructed the REDCap database for these CADASIL patients.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has become a major disease contributing to human death and is thought to be closely related to the aging process. The rich antioxidant substances in plants have been shown to play a role in delaying aging, and in recent years, significant research has focused on also examining their potential role in AD onset and progression. Many plant-derived antioxidant research studies have provided insights for the future treatment and prevention of AD. This article reviews various types of plant-derived antioxidants with anti-aging effects on neurons. Also it distinguishes the different types of active substances that exhibit different degrees of protection for the nervous system and summarizes the mechanism thereof. Plant-derived antioxidants with neuroprotective functions can protect various components of the nervous system in a variety of ways and can have a positive impact on interventions to prevent and alleviate AD. Furthermore, when considering neuroprotective agents, glial cells also contribute to the defense of the nervous system and should not be ignored.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease is an emerging global epidemic that is becoming increasingly unsustainable. Most of the clinical trials have been centered around targeting β-amyloid and have met with limited success. There is a great impetus to identify alternative drug targets. Iron appears to be the common theme prevalent across neurodegenerative diseases. Iron has been shown to promote aggregation and pathogenicity of the characteristic aberrant proteins, β-amyloid, tau, α-synuclein, and TDP43, in these diseases. Further support for the involvement of iron in pathogenesis is provided by the recent discovery of a new form of cell death, ferroptosis. Arising from iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis is augmented in conditions of cysteine deficiency and glutathione peroxidase-4 inactivation. Here, we review clinical trials that provide the rationale for targeting ferroptosis to delay the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), potentially of relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60346">Peroxiredoxin promotes longevity and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-resistance in yeast through redox-modulation of protein kinase A</a></h4>

Peroxiredoxins are H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging enzymes that also carry H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling and chaperone functions. In yeast, the major cytosolic peroxiredoxin, Tsa1 is required for both promoting resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and extending lifespan upon caloric restriction. We show here that Tsa1 effects both these functions not by scavenging H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but by repressing the nutrient signaling Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway at the level of the protein kinase A (PKA) enzyme. Tsa1 stimulates sulfenylation of cysteines in the PKA catalytic subunit by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and a significant proportion of the catalytic subunits are glutathionylated on two cysteine residues. Redox modification of the conserved Cys243 inhibits the phosphorylation of a conserved Thr241 in the kinase activation loop and enzyme activity, and preventing Thr241 phosphorylation can overcome the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Tsa1-deficient cells. Results support a model of aging where nutrient signaling pathways constitute hubs integrating information from multiple aging-related conduits, including a peroxiredoxin-dependent response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58716">Does the human placenta express the canonical cell entry mediators for SARS-CoV-2?</a></h4>

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 10 million people, including pregnant women. To date, no consistent evidence for the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 exists. The novel coronavirus canonically utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for cell entry. Herein, building upon our previous single-cell study (Pique-Regi, 2019), another study, and new single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing data, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 throughout pregnancy in the placenta as well as in third-trimester chorioamniotic membranes. We report that co-transcription of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is negligible in the placenta, thus not a likely path of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, which cause congenital infections, are highly expressed by placental cell types. These data show that the placenta minimally expresses the canonical cell-entry mediators for SARS-CoV-2.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57183">A two-lane mechanism for selective biological ammonium transport</a></h4>

The transport of charged molecules across biological membranes faces the dual problem of accommodating charges in a highly hydrophobic environment while maintaining selective substrate translocation. This has been the subject of a particular controversy for the exchange of ammonium across cellular membranes, an essential process in all domains of life. Ammonium transport is mediated by the ubiquitous Amt/Mep/Rh transporters that includes the human Rhesus factors. Here, using a combination of electrophysiology, yeast functional complementation and extended molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal a unique two-lane pathway for electrogenic NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transport in two archetypal members of the family, the transporters AmtB from <i>Escherichia coli </i>and Rh50 from <i>Nitrosomonas</i><i> europaea</i>. The pathway underpins a mechanism by which charged H<sup>+</sup> and neutral NH<sub>3</sub> are carried separately across the membrane after NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> deprotonation. This mechanism defines a new principle of achieving transport selectivity against competing ions in a biological transport process.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57179">Flotillin-mediated membrane fluidity controls peptidoglycan synthesis and MreB movement</a></h4>

The bacterial plasma membrane is an important cellular compartment. In recent years it has become obvious that protein complexes and lipids are not uniformly distributed within membranes. Current hypotheses suggest that flotillin proteins are required for the formation of complexes of membrane proteins including cell-wall synthetic proteins. We show here that bacterial flotillins are important factors for membrane fluidity homeostasis. Loss of flotillins leads to a decrease in membrane fluidity that in turn leads to alterations in MreB dynamics and, as a consequence, in peptidoglycan synthesis. These alterations are reverted when membrane fluidity is restored by a chemical fluidizer. In vitro, the addition of a flotillin increases membrane fluidity of liposomes. Our data support a model in which flotillins are required for direct control of membrane fluidity rather than for the formation of protein complexes via direct protein-protein interactions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56860">Risk of psychiatric disorders among the surviving twins after a co-twin loss</a></h4>

Losing a co-twin by death is a severely stressful event yet with unknown impact on the surviving twin’s risk of psychiatric disorders. We identified all Swedish-born twins who lost a co-twin by death between 1973 and 2013 (n = 4,528), their 4939 non-twin full siblings, together with 22,640 age- and sex-matched non-bereaved twins. Compared to the non-bereaved twins, exposed twins were at increased risk of receiving a first diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (hazard ratio = 1.65, 95% confidence interval1.48–1.83), particularly during the first month after loss. Similarly, compared to non-twin full siblings, the relative risks were significantly increased after loss of monozygotic co-twin (2.45-fold), and loss of a dizygotic co-twin (1.29-fold), with higher HR observed with greater age gaps between twins and non-twin siblings. As dizygotic twins share equal genetic relatedness to the deceased twin as their full siblings, this pattern suggests that beyond the contribution of genetic factors, shared early life experiences and attachment contribute to the risk of psychiatric disorders among surviving twins after co-twin loss.

Mutations in the gene encoding <i>Ras-associated binding protein 23</i> (<i>RAB23</i>) cause Carpenter Syndrome, which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development, we generated <i>Rab23</i> deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. Along with polysyndactyly, these mice exhibit premature fusion of multiple sutures resultant from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. FGF10 driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in <i>Rab23<sup>-/-</sup></i> sutures with a consequent imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling results in the normalization of osteoprogenitor proliferation with a concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression, and prevention of craniosynostosis. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, and additionally non-canonical regulation of GLI1. RAB23 regulates GLI1 through pERK1/2.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53995">Sleep is bi-directionally modified by amyloid beta oligomers</a></h4>

Disrupted sleep is a major feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), often arising years before symptoms of cognitive decline. Prolonged wakefulness exacerbates the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) species, a major driver of AD progression, suggesting that sleep loss further accelerates AD through a vicious cycle. However, the mechanisms by which Aβ affects sleep are unknown. We demonstrate in zebrafish that Aβ acutely and reversibly enhances or suppresses sleep as a function of oligomer length. Genetic disruptions revealed that short Aβ oligomers induce acute wakefulness through Adrenergic receptor b2 (Adrb2) and Progesterone membrane receptor component 1 (Pgrmc1), while longer Aβ forms induce sleep through a pharmacologically tractable Prion Protein (PrP) signaling cascade. Our data indicate that Aβ can trigger a bi-directional sleep/wake switch. Alterations to the brain’s Aβ oligomeric milieu, such as during the progression of AD, may therefore disrupt sleep via changes in acute signaling events.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53125">Recurrent circuitry is required to stabilize piriform cortex odor representations across brain states</a></h4>

Pattern completion, or the ability to retrieve stable neural activity patterns from noisy or partial cues, is a fundamental feature of memory. Theoretical studies indicate that recurrently connected auto-associative or discrete attractor networks can perform this process. Although pattern completion and attractor dynamics have been observed in various recurrent neural circuits, the role recurrent circuitry plays in implementing these processes remains unclear. In recordings from head-fixed mice, we found that odor responses in olfactory bulb degrade under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia while responses immediately downstream, in piriform cortex, remain robust. Recurrent connections are required to stabilize cortical odor representations across states. Moreover, piriform odor representations exhibit attractor dynamics, both within and across trials, and these are also abolished when recurrent circuitry is eliminated. Here, we present converging evidence that recurrently-connected piriform populations stabilize sensory representations in response to degraded inputs, consistent with an auto-associative function for piriform cortex supported by recurrent circuitry.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53080">Proteome-wide analysis of a malaria vaccine study reveals personalized humoral immune profiles in Tanzanian adults</a></h4>

Tanzanian adult male volunteers were immunized by direct venous inoculation with radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved <i>Plasmodium falciparum </i>(Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ Vaccine) and protective efficacy assessed by homologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses were analyzed longitudinally using a Pf protein microarray covering 91% of the proteome, providing first insights into naturally acquired and PfSPZ Vaccine-induced whole parasite antibody profiles in malaria pre-exposed Africans. Immunoreactivity was identified against 2,239 functionally diverse Pf proteins, showing a wide breadth of humoral response. Antibody-based immune 'fingerprints' in these individuals indicated a strong person-specific immune response at baseline, with little changes in the overall humoral immunoreactivity pattern measured after immunization. The moderate increase in immunogenicity following immunization and the extensive and variable breadth of humoral immune response observed in the volunteers at baseline suggest that pre-exposure reduces vaccine-induced antigen reactivity in unanticipated ways.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51121">Stable task information from an unstable neural population</a></h4>

Over days and weeks, neural activity representing an animal's position and movement in sensorimotor cortex has been found to continually reconfigure or 'drift' during repeated trials of learned tasks, with no obvious change in behavior. This challenges classical theories which assume stable engrams underlie stable behavior. However, it is not known whether this drift occurs systematically, allowing downstream circuits to extract consistent information. Analyzing long-term calcium imaging recordings from posterior parietal cortex in mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>), we show that drift is systematically constrained far above chance, facilitating a linear weighted readout of behavioural variables. However, a significant component of drift continually degrades a fixed readout, implying that drift is not confined to a null coding space. We calculate the amount of plasticity required to compensate drift independently of any learning rule, and find that this is within physiologically achievable bounds. We demonstrate that a simple, biologically plausible local learning rule can achieve these bounds, accurately decoding behavior over many days.

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe lung disease (COVID-19) in humans. Pruijssers et al. demonstrate that the antiviral drug remdesivir potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cell cultures. Therapeutic treatment of infected mice with remdesivir reduces viral loads and improves clinical outcomes, further supporting use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.

Maruyama et al. report that St18 is a negative regulator of VEGF-A expression in macrophages. Myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice are vulnerable to sepsis accompanied by elevated serum VEGF-A concentrations. St18 binds to Sp1 and attenuates its activity, leading to the suppression of Sp1 target gene VEGF-A.

Misfolded protein accumulation causes cytotoxicity, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. Using budding yeast as a model organism, Higgins et al. show that ubiquitination of misfolded proteins depletes free ubiquitin, which compromises ubiquitin-dependent cellular functions and causes cytotoxicity. The Cdc48/p97 segregase antagonizes this cytotoxicity by promoting ubiquitin recycling from misfolded proteins.

Fontana et al. show that cardiac atrioventricular valve formation in zebrafish requires blood flow-induced shear stress to trigger differences in endocardial cell fates. The induction of Notch and Klf2a represses the expression of Flt4. In turn, Flt4 prevents Notch activity within no-flow regions. This fine-tuned mechanism shapes cardiac valve morphogenesis.

Naturalistic stimuli evoke strong, consistent, and information-rich patterns of brain activity, and engage large extents of the human brain. They allow researchers to compare highly similar brain responses across subjects, and to study how complex representations are encoded in brain activity. Here, we describe and share a dataset where 25 subjects watched part of the feature film "The Grand Budapest Hotel" by Wes Anderson. The movie has a large cast with many famous actors. Throughout the story, the camera shots highlight faces and expressions, which are fundamental to understand the complex narrative of the movie. This movie was chosen to sample brain activity specifically related to social interactions and face processing. This dataset provides researchers with fMRI data that can be used to explore social cognitive processes and face processing, adding to the existing neuroimaging datasets that sample brain activity with naturalistic movies.

The escape response and rhythmic swimming in zebrafish are distinct behaviors mediated by two functionally distinct motoneuron (Mn) types. The primary (1{ring}Mn) type depresses, has a large quantal content (Qc), and a high release probability (Pr). Conversely, the secondary (2{ring}Mn) type facilitates and has low and variable Qc and Pr. This functional duality matches well the distinct associated behaviors, with the 1{ring}Mn providing the strong, singular C-bend initiating escape and the 2{ring}Mn confers weaker, rhythmic contractions. Contributing to these functional distinctions is our identification of P/Q type calcium channels mediating transmitter release in 1{ring}Mns and N type channels in 2{ring}Mns. Remarkably, despite these functional and behavioral distinctions, all ~15 individual synapses on each muscle cell are shared by a 1{ring}Mn bouton and at least one 2{ring}Mn bouton. This novel blueprint of synaptic sharing provides an efficient way of controlling two different behaviors at the level of a single postsynaptic cell.

Despite decades of discussion in the neuroanatomical literature, the role of the synaptic spinule in synaptic development and function remains elusive. Canonically, spinules are finger-like projections that emerge from postsynaptic spines and can become enveloped by presynaptic boutons. When a presynaptic bouton encapsulates a spinule in this manner, the membrane apposition between the spinule and surrounding bouton can be significantly larger than the membrane interface at the synaptic active zone. Hence, spinules may represent a mechanism for extrasynaptic neuronal communication, and/or may function as structural anchors that increase the stability of cortical synapses. Yet despite their potential to impact synaptic function, we have little information on the percentages of developing and adult cortical bouton populations that contain spinules, the percentages of these cortical spinule-bearing boutons (SBBs) that contain spinules from distinct neuronal/glial origins, or whether the onset of activity or cortical plasticity are correlated with increased prevalence of cortical SBBs. Here, we employed 2D and 3D electron microscopy to determine the prevalence of spinules in excitatory presynaptic boutons at key developmental time points in the primary visual cortex (V1) of female and male ferrets. We find that the prevalence of SBBs in V1 increases across postnatal development, such that ~25% of excitatory boutons in late adolescent ferret V1 contain spinules. In addition, we find that a majority of spinules within SBBs at later developmental time points emerge from postsynaptic spines and adjacent boutons/axons, suggesting that synaptic spinules may enhance synaptic stability and allow for axo-axonal communication in mature sensory cortex.

Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide originating in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, with a role in influencing various social behaviors. However, pinpointing its actions only during the time animals are performing specific behaviors has been difficult to study. Here we developed an optogenetic gene expression system designed to selectively label neuronal populations activated by OXT in the presence of blue-light, named OXTR-iTango2. The OXTR-iTango2 was capable of inducing gene expression of a reporter gene in both human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and neurons in a quantitative manner. In vivo expression of OXTR-iTango2 selectively labeled OXT-sensitive neurons in a blue-light dependent manner. Furthermore, we were able to detect a subset of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that receive OXT activation during social interaction. Thus, we provide a genetically-encoded, scalable optogenetic toolset to target neural circuits activated by OXT in behaving animals with a high temporal resolution.

Recent studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of how visual objects like faces or bodies are categorized. What is less clear is whether a category attribute like the emotional expression influences category representation as is limited to extra-category selective areas and whether the coding of the expression in category and extra category areas is influenced by the task. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate methods, we measured BOLD responses while participants viewed whole body expressions and performed an explicit (emotion) and implicit (shape) recognition task. Our results show that the type of task can be decoded in EBA, VLPFC and IPL with higher activity for the explicit task condition in the first two areas and no evidence of emotion specificity processes in any of them. During explicit recognition of the body expression, category representation was strengthened while action related information was be suppressed. These results provide evidence that body representations in high level visual cortex and frontoparietal cortex are task sensitive and that body selective areas differentially contribute to expression representation based on their different anatomical connectivity.

Achieving optimal behavior requires animals to flexibly retrieve prior knowledge. Here we show that adult newborn granule cells (anbGCs) mediate emotional-state-dependent plasticity of memory retrieval. We find that acute social reward (aSR) enhances memory retrieval by increasing the reactivation of engram cells, while acute social stress (aSS) weakens retrieval and reduces the reactivation. Such bidirectional regulation relies on the activation of distinct populations of anbGCs by aSR and aSS, triggering opposing modifications of dDG activity, which is sufficient to regulate and predict the performance of memory retrieval. Concordantly, in emotional disorder models, aSR-dependent memory plasticity is impaired, while the effect of aSS remains intact. Together, our data revealed that anbGCs mediate plasticity of memory retrieval, allowing animals to flexibly retrieve memory according to the current emotional state, and suggested the essential roles of anbGCs in translating emotional information to the regulation of memory expression.

Understanding the similarity of cortico-subcortical networks topologies between humans and nonhuman primate species is critical to study the origin of network alternations underlying human neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. The New World common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has become popular as a non-human primate model for human brain function. Most marmoset connectomic research, however, has exclusively focused on cortical areas, with connectivity to subcortical networks less extensively explored. In this study, we aimed to first isolate patterns of subcortical connectivity with cortical resting-state networks (RSNs) in awake marmosets using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), then to compare these networks to those in humans using connectivity fingerprinting. While we could match several marmoset and human RSNs based on their functional fingerprints, we also found a few striking differences, for example strong functional connectivity of the default mode network with the superior colliculus in marmosets that was much weaker in humans. Together, these findings demonstrate that many of the core cortico-subcortical networks in humans are also present in marmosets, but that small, potentially functionally relevant differences exist.

Cell and molecular biology analyses of sporadic Alzheimer's disease brain are confounded by clinical variability, ageing and genetic heterogeneity. Therefore, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize cell composition and gene expression in the cerebral cortex in early-onset, monogenic Alzheimer's disease. Constructing a cellular atlas of frontal cortex from 8 monogenic AD individuals and 8 matched controls, provided insights into which neurons degenerate in AD and responses of different cell types to AD at the cellular and systems level. Such responses are a combination of positively adaptive and deleterious changes, including large-scale changes in synaptic transmission and marked metabolic reprogramming in neurons. The nature and scale of the transcriptional changes in AD emphasizes the global impact of the disease across all brain cell types.

The efficiency of reading, to a crucial extent, results from the fact that visual word recognition is faster in predictive contexts (like sentences or texts). This observation is consistent with predictive coding models, but it is so far not sufficiently understood which aspects of the rich set of linguistic representations that is activated during reading contribute to this context-dependent facilitation. Candidate representations are visual, orthographic, phonological, and/or lexical-semantic in nature. Our study investigates which representations contribute to efficient word recognition in predictive context with a well-controlled repetition priming paradigm, including words and pseudowords (i.e., pronounceable nonwords), that was combined with magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements in human participants (both sexes). We used high-powered linear mixed modeling to test the hypothesis that context-dependent facilitation relies on the pre-activation of linguistic representations prior to perceiving the expected stimulus. Behavioral data from 49 participants indicate that word predictability (i.e., context present vs. absent) facilitated orthographic and lexical-semantic, but not visual or phonological processes. MEG data from 38 participants show sustained activation of orthographic and lexical-semantic codes in the interval between prime and target, i.e., before processing the predicted stimulus. Also, we found a positive correlation between these pre-activation effects and brain responses elicited when processing the expected letter string. Pre-activation was more stable across time in words than in pseudowords. These results suggest that readers use orthographic and lexical-semantic representations to actively predict upcoming words and that this predictive process is modulated by the presence of prior knowledge (in words as opposed to pseudowords).

Distinct forms of memory processing are often causally identified with specific brain regions, but a key facet of memory processing includes linking separated neuronal populations. Using cell-specific manipulations of inhibitory neuronal activity, we discovered a key role of the dentate gyrus (DG) in coordinating dispersed neuronal populations during memory formation. In whole-brain fMRI and electrophysiological experiments, we found that parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the DG control the functional coupling of the hippocampus within a wider network of neocortical and subcortical structures including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In a novel object-location task, regulation of PV interneuron activity enhanced or prevented memory encoding and, without effect upon the total number of task activated c-Fos+ cells, revealed a correlation between activated neuronal populations in the hippocampus-PFC-NAc network. These data suggest a critical regulatory role of PV interneurons in the dentate gyrus in brain-wide polysynaptic communication channels and the association of cell assemblies across multiple brain regions.

Writing systems are a recent cultural invention, which makes it unlikely that specific cognitive mechanisms have developed through selective pressure for reading itself. Instead, reading might capitalize on evolutionary older mechanisms that originally supported other tasks. Accordingly, animals such as baboons can be trained to perform visual word recognition. This suggests that the visual mechanisms supporting reading might be phylogenetically old and domain-general. Here we propose that if the human reading system relies on domain-general visual mechanisms, effects that are typically found within the domain of reading should also be observable with non-orthographic visual stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we systematically tested different types of visual material with the same experimental design. Subjects were passively familiarized with a set of composite visual items, and then tested in an oddball paradigm for their ability to detect novel stimuli. Some of these novel stimuli shared their statistical structure with the familiar items, and were found to be hard to detect in two experiments using strings of letter-like symbols; this replicates the well-known, and supposedly reading-specific, bigram effect. Crucially, in two further experiments we show that the same effect emerges with made-up, 3D objects and sinusoidal gratings. The effect size was equivalent across experiments, despite the use of radically different stimuli. These data suggest that a fundamental mechanism behind visual word learning also supports the learning of other visual stimuli, implying that such mechanism is general-purpose. This mechanism would enable the statistical learning of regularities in the visual environment.

Mammalian genomes include many maternally or paternally imprinted genes. Most of these are also expressed in the brain and several were previously implicated in regulating specific behavioral traits. We have used here a knockout approach to study the function of Peg13. Peg13 codes for a fast evolving lncRNA and is part of a complex of imprinted genes on chromosome 15 in the mouse and chromosome 8 in humans. Two knockout constructs were analyzed, one with a full deletion of the gene, the other with a deletion of the three prime-half. The full deletion is semi lethal, while the partial deletion is fully viable, but the mice show distinctive behavioral differences. They lose interest in the opposite sex and show instead a preference for wildtype animals of the same sex. Further, they show a higher level of anxiety, as well as lowered activity and curiosity and females have a deficiency in pup retrieval behavior. Brain RNA expression analysis reveals that genes involved in the serotonergic system, formation of glutamergic synapses, olfactory processing and estrogen signaling, as well as more than half of the other known imprinted genes are affected in Peg13 deficient mice. Intriguingly, the pathways are differentially affected in the sexes, with the result that the male and female brains of Peg13 deficient mice differ more from each other than those of wildtype mice. We conclude that Peg13 is part of a developmental pathway that regulates the neurobiology of social interactions.

To distinguish between somatic stimuli, the primary somatosensory cortex should process dissimilar stimuli with distinct patterns of neuronal activation. Two-photon calcium imaging permits simultaneous optical recording of sensory evoked activity in hundreds of cortical neurons during varied sensory stimulation. Hence, it allows a visualization of patterns of activity in individual neurons and local cortical networks in response to distinct stimulation. Here, flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging was used to map the somatosensory cortex of anaesthetized C57BL/6 mice, and in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging was used to define patterns of neuronal activation during mechanical stimulation of the contralateral forelimb or hindlimb at various frequencies (3, 10, 100, 200, and 300 Hz). The data revealed that neurons within the limb associated somatosensory cortex exhibit stimulus-specific patterns of activity. Subsets of neurons were found to have sensory-evoked activity that is either primarily responsive to single stimulus frequencies or broadly responsive to multiple frequencies of limb movement. High frequency stimuli were shown to elicit more activation across the population, with a greater percentage of the population responding and greater percentage of cells with high amplitude responses. Stimulus-evoked cell-cell correlations within these neuronal networks varied as a function of frequency of stimulation, such that each stimulus elicited a distinct pattern that was more consistent across multiple trials of the same stimulus compared to trials at different frequencies of stimulation. The variation in cortical response to these artificial stimuli can thus be represented by the population pattern of supra-threshold Ca2+ transients, the magnitude and temporal properties of the evoked activity, and the structure of the stimulus-evoked correlation between responsive neurons.

BACKGROUND Commercially-made low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) devices have become increasingly available over the last decade. One of these devices, Emotiv EPOC, is currently used in a wide variety of settings, including brain-computer interface (BCI) and cognitive neuroscience research. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to chart peer-reviewed reports of Emotiv EPOC projects to provide an informed summary on the use of this device for scientific purposes. METHODS We followed a five-stage methodological framework for a scoping review that included a systematic search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. We searched the following electronic databases: PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. We charted study data according to application (BCI, clinical, signal processing, experimental research, and validation) and location of use (as indexed by the first authors address). RESULTS We identified 382 relevant studies. The top five publishing countries were the United States (n = 35), India (n = 25), China (n = 20), Poland (n = 17), and Pakistan (n = 17). The top five publishing cities were Islamabad (n = 11), Singapore (n = 10), Cairo, Sydney, and Bandung (n = 7 each). Most of these studies used Emotiv EPOC for BCI purposes (n = 277), followed by experimental research (n = 51). Thirty-one studies were aimed at validating EPOC as an EEG device and a handful of studies used EPOC for improving EEG signal processing (n = 12) or for clinical purposes (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS In its first 10 years, Emotiv EPOC has been used around the world in diverse applications, from control of robotic limbs and wheelchairs to user authentication in security systems to identification of emotional states. Given the widespread use and breadth of applications, it is clear that researchers are embracing this technology.

It is now possible to monitor the activity of a large number of neurons across the brain as animals perform behavioural tasks. A primary aim for modeling is to reveal (i) how sensory inputs are represented in neural activities and (ii) how these representations translate into behavioural responses. Predominant methods apply rather disjoint techniques to (i) and (ii); by contrast, we suggest an end-to-end model which jointly fits both behaviour and neural activities and tracks their covariabilities across trials using inferred noise correlations. Our model exploits recent developments of flexible, but tractable, neural network point-process models to characterize dependencies between stimuli, actions and neural data. We apply the framework to a dataset collected using Neuropixel probes in a visual discrimination task and analyse noise correlations to gain novel insights into the relationships between neural activities and behaviour.

Persistent tactile pain is a poorly managed symptom of inflammatory and neuropathic injury. To develop therapies for this maladaptive sensation, the underlying molecular mediators must be identified. Using knockout mice and pharmacological inhibitors, we identified transient receptor canonical 5 (TRPC5) as a key contributor to the persistent tactile pain that occurs in many inflammatory and neuropathic preclinical rodent models. TRPC5 inhibition was effective in injuries associated with elevated levels of the bioactive phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Exogenous application of LPC induced TRPC5-dependent behavioral mechanical allodynia, neuronal mechanical hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain. In vitro, LPC activated both homomeric mouse and human TRPC5 channels, which upon examination of human dorsal root ganglia tissue, were expressed in 75% of human sensory neurons. Based on these results, TRPC5 inhibitors should be pursued as personalized therapy for spontaneous and tactile pain in conditions where elevated LPC is a biomarker.

Near-threshold perception is a paradigm case of perceptual reports diverging from reality - perception of an unchanging stimulus can vacillate from undetected to clearly perceived. Among the many factors that predict whether a stimulus will reach awareness, the amplitude of low-frequency brain oscillations - particularly in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) - has emerged as a reliable predictor of trial-to-trial variability in perceptual decisions. Analysis grounded in signal detection theory suggest that strong prestimulus alpha oscillations diminish subjective perception without affecting the accuracy or sensitivity (d-prime) of perceptual decisions. These results, coupled with recent studies on sensory responses, point to an inhibitory influence of alpha-band amplitude on early visuocortical activity. The findings to date have been based on simple, low-level visual stimuli, which warrant a focus on early visual processing. However, the physiology of alpha in higher-level visual areas is known to be distinct from early visual cortex, with evidence indicating that alpha amplitude in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex is excitatory (rather than inhibitory, as in early visual cortex). Here, we addressed the question of how spontaneous oscillatory amplitude impacts subjective and objective aspects of perception using a high-level perceptual decision task. Human observers completed a near-threshold face/house discrimination task with subjective visibility ratings while electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded. Using a single-trial multiple regression analysis, we found that spontaneous fluctuations in pre-stimulus alpha-band amplitude were negatively related to visibility ratings but did not predict trial-by-trial accuracy. These results suggest that the inhibitory influence of prestimulus alpha activity in early visual cortex, rather than the excitatory influence of alpha in IT, comes to bias high-level perceptual reports. Our findings provide further evidence that ongoing alpha amplitude dissociates subjective and objective measures of visual perception.

Various models (e.g. scalar, state-dependent network, and vector models) have been proposed to explain the global aspects of time perception, but they have not been tested against specific visual phenomena like perisaccadic time compression and novel stimulus time dilation. Here, we tested how the perceived duration of a novel stimulus is influenced by 1) a simultaneous saccade, in combination with 2) a prior series of repeated stimuli in human participants. This yielded a novel behavioral interaction: pre-saccadic stimulus repetition neutralizes perisaccadic time compression. We then tested these results against simulations of the above models. Our data yielded low correlations against scalar model simulations, high but non-specific correlations for our feedforward neural network, and correlations that were both high and specific for a vector model based on identity of objective and subjective time. These results demonstrate the power of global time perception models in explaining disparate empirical phenomena and suggest that subjective time has a similar essence to time's physical vector.

Several MRI measures have been proposed as in vivo biomarkers of myelin content, each with a concrete application ranging from plasticity to pathology. Despite the broad availability of these myelin-sensitive MRI modalities, specificity and sensitivity have been a matter of discussion. Debate about which MRI measure is the most suitable one for quantifying myelin is still ongoing. In this study, we performed a systematic review of published quantitative validation studies, and used meta-analysis tools to clarify how different these measures are when compared to the underlying histology, controlling for the study sample size and using interactive visualization tools. A first qualitative selection of 58 studies proposed 35 different measures to characterize myelin content. However, a quantitative analysis showed that most of these measures have a limited coefficient of determination and provide little information to inform future studies, because of the large prediction intervals and high heterogeneity. These results indicate that most measures are statistically equivalent regarding their relationship with histology and that future work should take inter-study variability into consideration.

The organization of sensory maps in the cerebral cortex depends on experience, which drives homeostatic and long-term synaptic plasticity of cortico-cortical circuits. In the mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) afferents from the higher-order, posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm) gate synaptic plasticity in layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons via disinhibition and the production of dendritic plateau potentials. Here we address whether these thalamocortically mediated responses play a role in whisker map plasticity in S1. We find that trimming all but two whiskers causes a partial fusion of the representations of the two spared whiskers, concomitantly with an increase in the occurrence of POm-driven, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent plateau potentials. Blocking the plateau potentials restores the archetypical organization of the sensory map. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for experience-dependent cortical map plasticity in which higher-order thalamocortically mediated plateau potentials facilitate the fusion of normally segregated cortical representations.

Currently, several human brain functional atlases are used to define the spatial constituents of the resting-state networks (RSNs). However, the only brain atlases available are derived from samples of young adults. As brain networks are continuously reconfigured throughout life, the lack of brain atlases derived from older populations may influence RSN results in late adulthood. To address this, we aimed to construct a reliable brain atlas derived from older participants only. To do so, we analyzed the resting-state functional MRI data from three cohorts of healthy individuals in late life (total N=563; age=55-95years) and a mid-life cohort (N=322; age=18-54years). First, we identified five major RSNs across the late-life cohorts. Then, we demonstrated: high spatial reproducibility across the late-life cohorts with an average spatial overlap of 67%; and RSNs derived from the late-life cohorts were spatially different from those derived from the mid-life cohort (p=0.016). In response, we constructed a novel brain atlas, called Atlas55+, which includes a consensus of the major RSNs across the late-life cohorts. Atlas55+ provides a reliable age-appropriate template for the major RSNs in late adulthood and is publicly available. Our results confirm the need to construct age-appropriate brain functional atlases for studies investigating aging-related brain mechanisms.

Healthy ageing involves degeneration of the neuromuscular system which impacts movement control and proprioception. Yet the relationship between these sensory and motor deficits in upper limb reaching has not been examined in detail. Recently, we reported that age-related proprioceptive deficits were unrelated to accuracy in rapid arm movements, but whether this applied in motor tasks more heavily dependent on proprioceptive feedback was not clear. To address this, we have tested groups of younger and older adults on a force-field adaptation task under either full or limited visual feedback conditions and examined how performance related to dynamic proprioceptive acuity. Adaptive performance was similar between the age groups, regardless of visual feedback condition, although older adults showed increased after-effects. Physically inactive individuals made larger systematic (but not variable) proprioceptive errors, irrespective of age. However, dynamic proprioceptive acuity was unrelated to adaptation and there was no consistent evidence of proprioceptive recalibration with adaptation to the force-field for any group. Finally, in spite of clear age-dependent loss of spatial working memory capacity, we found no relationship between memory capacity and adaptive performance or proprioceptive acuity. Thus, non-clinical levels of deficit in dynamic proprioception, due to age or physical inactivity, do not affect force-field adaptation, even under conditions of limited visual feedback that might require greater proprioceptive control.

The deployment of neural alpha (8-12 Hz) lateralization in service of spatial attention is well-established: Alpha power increases in the cortical hemisphere ipsilateral to the attended hemifield, and decreases in the contralateral hemisphere, respectively. Much less is known about humans ability to deploy such alpha lateralization in time, and to thus exploit alpha power as a spatio-temporal filter. Here we show that spatially lateralized alpha power does signify - beyond the direction of spatial attention - the distribution of attention in time and thereby qualifies as a spatio-temporal attentional filter. Participants (N = 20) selectively listened to spoken numbers presented on one side (left vs right), while competing numbers were presented on the other side. Key to our hypothesis, temporal foreknowledge was manipulated via a visual cue, which was either instructive and indicated the to-be-probed number position (70% valid) or neutral. Temporal foreknowledge did guide participants attention, as they recognized numbers from the to-be-attended side more accurately following valid cues. In the magnetoencephalogram (MEG), spatial attention to the left versus right side induced lateralization of alpha power in all temporal cueing conditions. Modulation of alpha lateralization at the 0.8-Hz presentation rate of spoken numbers was stronger following instructive compared to neutral temporal cues. Critically, we found stronger modulation of lateralized alpha power specifically at the onsets of temporally cued numbers. These results suggest that the precisely timed hemispheric lateralization of alpha power qualifies as a spatio-temporal attentional filter mechanism susceptible to top-down behavioral goals.

Acute stress is ubiquitous in everyday life, but the extent to which acute stress affects how people learn from the outcomes of their choices is still poorly understood. Here, we investigate how acute stress impacts reward and punishment learning in men using a reinforcement-learning task. Sixty-two male participants performed the task whilst under stress and control conditions. We observed that acute stress impaired participants' choice performance towards monetary gains, but not losses. To unravel the mechanism(s) underlying such impairment, we fitted a reinforcement-learning model to participants' trial-by-trial choices. Computational modeling indicated that under acute stress participants learned more slowly from positive prediction errors - when the outcomes were better than expected - consistent with stress-induced dopamine disruptions. Such mechanistic understanding of how acute stress impairs reward learning is particularly important given the pervasiveness of stress in our daily life and the impact that stress can have on our wellbeing and mental health.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairment, affecting quality of life and increasing fall risk, due to ineffective postural control. To this day, the diagnosis remains based on clinical approach. Similarly, motor evaluation is based on heterogeneous, operator-dependent observational criteria. A synthetic, replicable index to quantify motor impairment is still lacking. In this paper, we build upon the idea that the trunk is crucial in balance control. Hence, we have designed a new measure of postural stability which assess the trunk displacement in relation to the center of mass, that we named trunk displacement index (TDI). METHODS: Twenty-three PD patients and twenty-three healthy controls underwent clinical (UPDRS-III) and motor examination (3D gait analysis). The TDI was extracted from kinematic measurements using a stereophotogrammetric system. A correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship of TDI with typical gait parameters, to verify its biomechanical value, and UPDRS-III, to observe its clinical relevance. Finally, its sensitivity was measured, comparing pre- and post- L-DOPA subclinical intake. RESULTS: The TDI showed significant correlations with many gait parameters, including both velocity and stability characteristics of gait, and with the UPDRS-III. Finally, the TDI resulted capable in discriminating between off and on state in PD, whereas typical gait parameters failed two show any difference between those two conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the TDI may be considered a highly sensitive biomechanical index, reflecting the overall motor condition in PD, and provided of clinical relevance due to the correlation with the clinical evaluation.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QNHklWhCOGI/article">Heart failure-induced atrial remodelling promotes electrical and conduction alternans</a></h4>

<p>by Na Zhao, Qince Li, Kevin Zhang, Kuanquan Wang, Runnan He, Yongfeng Yuan, Henggui Zhang</p>

Heart failure (HF) is associated with an increased propensity for atrial fibrillation (AF), causing higher mortality than AF or HF alone. It is hypothesized that HF-induced remodelling of atrial cellular and tissue properties promotes the genesis of atrial action potential (AP) alternans and conduction alternans that perpetuate AF. However, the mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility to atrial alternans in HF remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of how HF-induced atrial cellular electrophysiological (with prolonged AP duration) and tissue structural (reduced cell-to-cell coupling caused by atrial fibrosis) remodelling can have an effect on the generation of atrial AP alternans and their conduction at the cellular and one-dimensional (1D) tissue levels. Simulation results showed that HF-induced atrial electrical remodelling prolonged AP duration, which was accompanied by an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude. Further analysis demonstrated that HF-induced atrial electrical remodelling increased susceptibility to atrial alternans mainly due to the increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake, modulated by increased phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation, and the decreased transient outward K<sup>+</sup> current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>). The underlying mechanism has been suggested that the increased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and prolonged AP did not fully recover to their previous levels at the end of diastole, resulting in a smaller SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and AP in the next beat. These produced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient alternans and AP alternans, and further caused AP alternans and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient alternans through Ca<sup>2+</sup>→AP coupling and AP→Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling, respectively. Simulation of a 1D tissue model showed that the combined action of HF-induced ion channel remodelling and a decrease in cell-to-cell coupling due to fibrosis increased the heart tissue’s susceptibility to the formation of spatially discordant alternans, resulting in an increased functional AP propagation dispersion, which is pro-arrhythmic. These findings provide insights into how HF promotes atrial arrhythmia in association with atrial alternans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QNHklWhCOGI" width="1" />

Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies are enabling the study of mutations and their evolutionary trajectories in cancer. Somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) have been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer. A wide array of methods for CNA detection has been either developed specifically for or adapted to single-cell DNA sequencing data. Understanding the strengths and limitations that are unique to each of these methods is very important for obtaining accurate copy number profiles from single-cell DNA sequencing data. We benchmarked three widely used methods–Ginkgo, HMMcopy, and CopyNumber–on simulated as well as real datasets. To facilitate this, we developed a novel simulator of single-cell genome evolution in the presence of CNAs. Furthermore, to assess performance on empirical data where the ground truth is unknown, we introduce a phylogeny-based measure for identifying potentially erroneous inferences. While single-cell DNA sequencing is very promising for elucidating and understanding CNAs, our findings show that even the best existing method does not exceed 80% accuracy. New methods that significantly improve upon the accuracy of these three methods are needed. Furthermore, with the large datasets being generated, the methods must be computationally efficient.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a13HESH3ra4" width="1" />

<p>by Richard J. Beck, Dario I. Bijker, Joost B. Beltman</p>

Although quantitative insights into the killing behaviour of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) are necessary for the rational design of immune-based therapies, CTL killing function remains insufficiently characterised. One established model of CTL killing treats CTL cytotoxicity as a Poisson process, based on the assumption that CTLs serially kill antigen-presenting target cells via delivery of lethal hits, each lethal hit corresponding to a single injection of cytotoxic proteins into the target cell cytoplasm. Contradicting this model, a recent <i>in vitro</i> study of individual CTLs killing targets over a 12-hour period found significantly greater heterogeneity in CTL killing performance than predicted by Poisson-based killing. The observed killing process was dynamic and varied between CTLs, with the best performing CTLs exhibiting a marked increase in killing during the final hours of the experiments, along with a “burst killing” kinetic. Despite a search for potential differences between CTLs, no mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneous killing kinetics was found. Here we have used stochastic simulations to assess whether target cells might require multiple hits from CTLs before undergoing apoptosis, in order to verify whether multiple-hitting could explain the late onset, burst killing dynamics observed <i>in vitro</i>. We found that multiple-hitting from CTLs was entirely consistent with the observed killing kinetics. Moreover, the number of available targets and the spatiotemporal kinetics of CTL:target interactions influenced the realised CTL killing rate. We subsequently used realistic, spatial simulations to assess methods for estimating the hitting rate and the number of hits required for target death, to be applied to microscopy data of individual CTLs killing targets. We found that measuring the cumulative duration of individual contacts that targets have with CTLs would substantially improve accuracy when estimating the killing kinetics of CTLs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a5KHho2JRgo" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spiders possess a wide array of sensory‐driven behaviors and therefore provide rich models for studying evolutionary hypotheses about the relationship between brain morphology, sensory systems, and behavior. Despite this, only a handful of studies have examined brain variation across the order of Araneae. In this study, I present descriptions of the gross brain morphology for 19 families of spiders that vary in eye morphology. Spiders showed the most variation in the secondary eye visual pathway. Based on this variation, spiders could be categorized into four groups. Group 1 spiders had small, underdeveloped laminae, no medullae, and no mushroom bodies. Group 2 spiders had large laminae, no medullae and large mushroom bodies. Group 3 spiders had laminae and some evidence of reduced medullae and mushroom bodies. Group 4 spiders had the most complex systems, with large laminae, medullae formed from optical glomeruli, and robust mushroom bodies. Within groups, there was large variation in the shape and size of individual regions, indicating possible variation in neuronal organization. The possible evolutionary implications of the loss of a dedicated olfactory organ in spiders and its effects on the mushroom body are also discussed.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate if neurodegenerative biomarkers in cerebro‐spinal fluid (CSF) diffferentiate patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not respond.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data of 62 consecutive patients who presented with MRI‐changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40‐50 ml CSF. Additionally, S100, NSE, ß‐amyloid protein, tau‐protein, phospho‐tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer’s disease (N = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer’s disease (N = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, Alzheimer’s positive CSF biomarkers predicted these improvements.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer’s disease and NPH‐changes supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative NPH and a true idiopathic NPH the latter of which appearing to be rare.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We wanted to determine whether pregnancy is associated with cervical artery dissection.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a case–control study using claims data from all nonfederal emergency departments and acute care hospitals in New York and Florida between 2005 and 2015. Cases were women 12–42 years of age hospitalized with cervical artery dissection, defined using validated diagnosis codes for carotid/vertebral artery dissection. Controls were women 12–42 years of age with a primary diagnosis of renal colic. Cases and controls were matched 1:1 on age, race, insurance, income, state, and visit year. The exposure variable was pregnancy, defined as labor and delivery within 90 days before or 6 months after the index visit. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of pregnancy between cases and controls. We performed a secondary cohort‐crossover study comparing the risk of cervical artery dissection during pregnancy versus the same time period 1 year later.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pregnancy was twice as common among 826 women with cervical artery dissection compared with the 826 matched controls with renal colic (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–4.7). In our secondary analysis, pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of cervical artery dissection (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.5), with the heightened risk limited to the postpartum period (IRR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.6–11.7).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05395">On the variability of functional connectivity and network measures in source-reconstructed EEG time-series. (arXiv:2007.05395v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The idea to estimate the statistical interdependence among (interacting) EEG
signals has motivated numerous researchers to investigate how the resulting
networks may reorganize themselves under any conceivable scenario. Even though
this idea is not at initial stages, its application is still far to be
widespread. One concurrent cause may be related to the proliferation of
different approaches that promise to catch the underlying correlation among the
(interacting) units. This issue has probably contributed to hinder the
comparison among different studies. Not only all these approaches go under the
same name (functional connectivity) but they have been often tested and
validated using different methods, therefore, making it difficult to understand
to what extent they are similar or not. In this study, we aim to compare a set
of different approaches commonly used to estimate the functional connectivity
on a public EEG dataset representing a possible realistic scenario. Our results
show that source-level EEG functional connectivity estimates and the derived
network measures display a substantial dependency on the arbitrary choice of
the selected connectivity metric. The observed variability reflects ambiguity
and concern that should be always discussed when reporting findings based on
any connectivity metric.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05352">Multi-Emitter MAP-Elites: Improving quality, diversity and convergence speed with heterogeneous sets of emitters. (arXiv:2007.05352v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Quality-Diversity (QD) optimisation is a new family of learning algorithms
that aims at generating collections of diverse and high-performing solutions.
Among those algorithms, MAP-Elites is a simple yet powerful approach that has
shown promising results in numerous applications. In this paper, we introduce a
novel algorithm named Multi-Emitter MAP-Elites (ME-MAP-Elites) that improves
the quality, diversity and convergence speed of MAP-Elites. It is based on the
recently introduced concept of emitters, which are used to drive the
algorithm's exploration according to predefined heuristics. ME-MAP-Elites
leverages the diversity of a heterogeneous set of emitters, in which each
emitter type is designed to improve differently the optimisation process.
Moreover, a bandit algorithm is used to dynamically find the best emitter set
depending on the current situation. We evaluate the performance of
ME-MAP-Elites on six tasks, ranging from standard optimisation problems (in 100
dimensions) to complex locomotion tasks in robotics. Our comparisons against
MAP-Elites and existing approaches using emitters show that ME-MAP-Elites is
faster at providing collections of solutions that are significantly more
diverse and higher performing. Moreover, in the rare cases where no fruitful
synergy can be found between the different emitters, ME-MAP-Elites is
equivalent to the best of the compared algorithms.

<p>Growing evidence shows that top-down projections from excitatory neurons in piriform cortex selectively synapse onto local inhibitory granule cells in the main olfactory bulb, effectively gating their own inputs by controlling inhibition. An open question in olfaction is the role this feedback plays in shaping the dynamics of local circuits, and the resultant computational benefits it provides. Using rate models of neuronal firing in a network consisting of excitatory mitral and tufted cells, inhibitory granule cells and top-down piriform cortical neurons, we found that changes in the weight of feedback to inhibitory neurons generated diverse network dynamics and complex transitions between these dynamics. Changes in the weight of top-down feedback supported a number of computations, including both pattern separation and oscillatory synchrony. Additionally, the network could generate gamma oscillations though a mechanism we termed Top-down control of Inhibitory Neuron Gamma (TING). Collectively, these functions arose from a codimension-2 bifurcation in the dynamical system. Our results highlight a key role for this top-down feedback, gating inhibition to facilitate often diametrically different computations.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is mechanism for non-apoptotic, iron-dependent, oxidative cell death that is characterized by glutathione consumption and lipid peroxides accumulation. Ferroptosis is crucially involved in neurological diseases, including neurodegeneration, stroke and neurotrauma. This review provides detailed discussions of the ferroptosis mechanisms in these neurological diseases. Moreover, it summarizes recent drugs that target ferroptosis for neurological disease treatment. Furthermore, it compares the differences and relationships among the various cell death mechanisms involved in neurological diseases. Elucidating the ferroptosis role in the brain can improve the understanding of neurological disease mechanism and provide potential prevention and treatment interventions for acute and chronic neurological diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60038">Ribosome collisions trigger cis-acting feedback inhibition of translation initiation</a></h4>

Translation of aberrant mRNAs can cause ribosomes to stall, leading to collisions with trailing ribosomes. Collided ribosomes are specifically recognized by ZNF598 to initiate protein and mRNA quality control pathways. Here we found using quantitative proteomics of collided ribosomes that EDF1 is a ZNF598-independent sensor of ribosome collisions. EDF1 stabilizes GIGYF2 at collisions to inhibit translation initiation <i>in cis</i> via 4EHP. The GIGYF2 axis acts independently of the ZNF598 axis, but each pathway's output is more pronounced without the other. We propose that the widely conserved and highly abundant EDF1 monitors the transcriptome for excessive ribosome density, then triggers a GIGYF2-mediated response to locally and temporarily reduce ribosome loading. Only when collisions persist is translation abandoned to initiate ZNF598-dependent quality control. This tiered response to ribosome collisions would allow cells to dynamically tune translation rates while ensuring fidelity of the resulting protein products.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58943">Microtubules originate asymmetrically at the somatic Golgi and are guided via Kinesin2 to maintain polarity in neurons</a></h4>

Neurons contain polarised microtubule arrays essential for neuronal function. How microtubule nucleation and polarity are regulated within neurons remains unclear. We show that γ-tubulin localises asymmetrically to the somatic Golgi within <i>Drosophila</i> neurons. Microtubules originate from the Golgi with an initial growth preference towards the axon. Their growing plus ends also turn towards and into the axon, adding to the plus-end-out microtubule pool. Any plus ends that reach a dendrite, however, do not readily enter, maintaining minus-end-out polarity. Both turning towards the axon and exclusion from dendrites depend on Kinesin-2, a plus-end-associated motor that guides growing plus ends along adjacent microtubules. We propose that Kinesin-2 engages with a polarised microtubule network within the soma to guide growing microtubules towards the axon; while at dendrite entry sites engagement with microtubules of opposite polarity generates a backward stalling force that prevents entry into dendrites and thus maintains minus-end-out polarity within proximal dendrites.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57354">Alzheimer's disease risk gene <i>BIN1</i> induces Tau-dependent network hyperexcitability</a></h4>

Genome-wide association studies identified the <i>BIN1</i> locus as a leading modulator of genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One limitation in understanding <i>BIN1</i>'s contribution to AD is its unknown function in the brain. AD-associated <i>BIN1</i> variants are generally noncoding and likely change expression. Here, we determined the effects of increasing expression of the major neuronal isoform of human BIN1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Higher BIN1 induced network hyperexcitability on multielectrode arrays, increased frequency of synaptic transmission, and elevated calcium transients, indicating that increasing BIN1 drives greater neuronal activity. In exploring the mechanism of these effects on neuronal physiology, we found that BIN1 interacted with L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LVGCCs) and that BIN1–LVGCC interactions were modulated by Tau in rat hippocampal neurons and mouse brain. Finally, Tau reduction prevented BIN1-induced network hyperexcitability. These data shed light on BIN1's neuronal function and suggest that it may contribute to Tau-dependent hyperexcitability in AD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57011">Sleep spindles mediate hippocampal-neocortical coupling during long-duration ripples</a></h4>

Sleep is pivotal for memory consolidation. According to two-stage accounts, memory traces are gradually translocated from hippocampus to neocortex during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. Mechanistically, this information transfer is thought to rely on interactions between thalamocortical spindles and hippocampal ripples. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed intracranial and scalp Electroencephalography sleep recordings from pre-surgical epilepsy patients. We first observed a concurrent spindle power increase in hippocampus (HIPP) and neocortex (NC) time-locked to individual hippocampal ripple events. Coherence analysis confirmed elevated levels of hippocampal-neocortical spindle coupling around ripples, with directionality analyses indicating an influence from NC to HIPP. Importantly, these hippocampal-neocortical dynamics were particularly pronounced during long-duration compared to short-duration ripples. Together, our findings reveal a potential mechanism underlying active consolidation, comprising a neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical reactivation loop initiated by the neocortex. This hippocampal-cortical dialogue is mediated by sleep spindles and is enhanced during long-duration hippocampal ripples.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56649">Assigning mitochondrial localization of dual localized proteins using a yeast Bi-Genomic Mitochondrial-Split-GFP</a></h4>

A single nuclear gene can be translated into a dual localized protein that distributes between the cytosol and mitochondria. Accumulating evidences show that mitoproteomes contain lots of these dual localized proteins termed echoforms. Unraveling the existence of mitochondrial echoforms using current GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) fusion microscopy approaches is extremely difficult because the GFP signal of the cytosolic echoform will almost inevitably mask that of the mitochondrial echoform. We therefore engineered a yeast strain expressing a new type of Split-GFP that we termed Bi-Genomic Mitochondrial-Split-GFP (BiG Mito-Split-GFP). Because one moiety of the GFP is translated from the mitochondrial machinery while the other is fused to the nuclear-encoded protein of interest translated in the cytosol, the self-reassembly of this Bi-Genomic-encoded Split-GFP is confined to mitochondria. We could authenticate the mitochondrial importability of any protein or echoform from yeast, but also from other organisms such as the human Argonaute 2 mitochondrial echoform.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56547">Growth cone-localized microtubule organizing center establishes microtubule orientation in dendrites</a></h4>

A polarized arrangement of neuronal microtubule arrays is the foundation of membrane trafficking and subcellular compartmentalization. Conserved among both invertebrates and vertebrates, axons contain exclusively 'plus-end-out' microtubules while dendrites contain a high percentage of 'minus-end-out' microtubules, the origins of which have been a mystery. Here we show that in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> the dendritic growth cone contains a non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center, which generates minus-end-out microtubules along outgrowing dendrites and plus-end-out microtubules in the growth cone. RAB-11-positive endosomes accumulate in this region and co-migrate with the microtubule nucleation complex γ-TuRC. The MTOC tracks the extending growth cone by kinesin-1/UNC-116-mediated endosome movements on distal plus-end-out microtubules and dynein clusters this advancing MTOC. Critically, perturbation of the function or localization of the MTOC causes reversed microtubule polarity in dendrites. These findings unveil the endosome-localized dendritic MTOC as a critical organelle for establishing axon-dendrite polarity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56110">Phosphoinositides regulate force-independent interactions between talin, vinculin, and actin</a></h4>

The focal adhesion (FA) proteins talin and vinculin connect integrin to actomyosin networks, acting as the core mechanosensitive FA machinery. Both proteins bind to F-actin and each other, providing a foundation for network formation within FAs. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating their engagement remain unclear. Here, we performed <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution of talin-vinculin-actin assemblies using synthetic membrane systems. Neither talin nor vinculin alone recruit actin filaments to the membrane. In contrast, phosphoinositide-rich membranes recruit and activate talin, and the membrane-bound talin then activates vinculin. Together, they link actin to the membrane. Encapsulation of these components within vesicles reorganized actin into higher-order networks. Notably, these observations were made in the absence of applied force, whereby we infer that the initial assembly stage of FAs is force independent. Our findings demonstrate that the local membrane composition plays a key role in controlling the stepwise recruitment, activation, and engagement of proteins within FAs.

Despite their identification several years ago, molecular identity and developmental relation between human ILC1 and NK cells, comprising group 1 ILCs, is still elusive. To unravel their connection, thorough transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional characterization was performed from umbilical cord blood (CB). Unexpectedly, ILC1-like cells lacked Tbet expression and failed to produce IFNγ. Moreover, in contrast to previously described ILC1 subsets they could be efficiently differentiated into NK cells. These were characterized by highly diversified KIR repertoires including late stage NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> effector cells that are commonly not generated from previously known NK cell progenitor sources. This property was dependent on stroma cell-derived Notch ligands. The frequency of the novel ILC1-like NK cell progenitor (NKP) significantly declined in CB from early to late gestational age. The study supports a model in which circulating fetal ILC1-like NKPs travel to secondary lymphoid tissues to initiate the formation of diversified NK cell repertoires after birth.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53839">Cancer systems immunology</a></h4>

Tumor immunology is undergoing a renaissance due to the recent profound clinical successes of tumor immunotherapy. These advances have coincided with an exponential growth in the development of –omics technologies. Armed with these technologies and their associated computational and modeling toolsets, systems biologists have turned their attention to tumor immunology in an effort to understand the precise nature and consequences of interactions between tumors and the immune system. Such interactions are inherently multivariate, spanning multiple time and size scales, cell types, and organ systems, rendering systems biology approaches particularly amenable to their interrogation. While in its infancy, the field of ‘Cancer Systems Immunology’ has already influenced our understanding of tumor immunology and immunotherapy. As the field matures, studies will move beyond descriptive characterizations toward functional investigations of the emergent behavior that govern tumor-immune responses. Thus, Cancer Systems Immunology holds incredible promise to advance our ability to fight this disease.

Kingsbury et al. find that prefrontal cortex neurons represent the sex of conspecifics during social interaction. Male animals show stronger encoding of female than male cues, which predicts their behavioral preference toward interaction with females. Activation of sex-encoding cells shapes preference behavior by controlling male- versus female-directed sociality.

Beat gestures - spontaneously produced biphasic movements of the hand - are among the most frequently encountered co-speech gestures in human communication. They are closely temporally aligned to the prosodic characteristics of the speech signal, typically occurring on lexically stressed syllables. Despite their prevalence across speakers of the world's languages, how beat gestures impact spoken word recognition is unclear. Can these simple 'flicks of the hand' influence speech perception? Across six experiments, we demonstrate that beat gestures influence the explicit and implicit perception of lexical stress (e.g., distinguishing OBject from obJECT), and in turn, can influence what vowels listeners hear. Thus, we provide converging evidence for a manual McGurk effect: even the simplest 'flicks of the hands' influence which speech sounds we hear.

Treatment of diseases that affect the CNS by gene therapy requires delivery of oligonucleotides to target cells within the brain. As the blood brain barrier prevents movement of large biomolecules, current approaches involve direct injection of the oligonucleotides, which is invasive and may have only a localised effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of 2 nm galactose-coated gold nanoparticles (NP-Gal) as a delivery system of oligonucleotides across brain endothelium. DNA oligonucleotides of different types were attached to NP-Gal by the place exchange reaction and were characterised by EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Several nanoparticle formulations were created, with single- or double-stranded (20nt or 40nt) DNA oligonucleotides, or with different amounts of DNA attached to the carriers. These nanocarriers were applied to transwell cultures of human brain endothelium in vitro (hCMEC/D3 cell-line) or to a 3D-hydrogel model of the blood-brain barrier including astrocytes. Transfer rates were measured by quantitative electron microscopy for the nanoparticles and qPCR for DNA. Despite the increase in nanoparticle size caused by attachment of oligonucleotides to the NP-Gal carrier, the rates of endocytosis and transcytosis of nanoparticles  were both considerably increased when they carried an oligonucleotide cargo. Carriers with 40nt dsDNA were most efficient, accumulating in vesicles, in the cytosol and beneath the basal membrane of the endothelium.  The oligonucleotide cargo remained attached to the nanocarriers during transcytosis and the transport rate across the endothelial cells was increased at least 50fold compared with free DNA. The nanoparticles entered the extracellular matrix and were taken up by the astrocytes in biologically functional amounts. Attachment of DNA confers a strong negative charge to the nanoparticles which may explain the enhanced binding to the endothelium and transcytosis by both vesicular transport and the transmembrane/cytosol pathway. These gold nanoparticles have the potential to transport therapeutic amounts of nucleic acids into the CNS.

Computational modeling in neuroscience has largely focused on simulating the electrical activity of neurons, while ignoring other components of brain tissue, such as glial cells and the extracellular space. As such, most existing models can not be used to address pathological conditions, such as spreading depression, which involves dramatic changes in ion concentrations, large extracellular potential gradients, and glial buffering processes. We here present the electrodiffusive neuron-extracellular-glia (edNEG) model, which we believe is the first model to combine multicompartmental neuron modeling with an electrodiffusive framework for intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics in a local piece of neuro-glial brain tissue. The edNEG model (i) keeps track of all intraneuronal, intraglial, and extracellular ion concentrations and electrical potentials, (ii) accounts for neuronal somatic action potentials, and dendritic calcium spikes, (iii) contains a neuronal and glial homeostatic machinery that gives physiologically realistic ion concentration dynamics, (iv) accounts for electrodiffusive transmembrane, intracellular, and extracellular ionic movements, and (v) accounts for glial and neuronal swelling caused by osmotic transmembrane pressure gradients. We demonstrate that the edNEG model performs realistically as a local and closed system, i.e., that it maintains a steady state for moderate neural activity, but experiences concentration-dependent effects, such as altered firing patterns and homeostatic breakdown, when the activity level becomes too intense. Furthermore, we study the role of glia in making the neuron more tolerable to hyperactive firing and in limiting neuronal swelling. Finally, we discuss how the edNEG model can be integrated with previous spatial continuum models of spreading depression to account for effects of neuronal morphology, action potential generation, and dendritic Ca 2+   spikes which are currently not included in these models.

Maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition is essential for the appropriate control of neuronal network activity. Sustained excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance relies on the orchestrated adjustment of synaptic strength, neuronal activity and network circuitry. While growing evidence indicates that extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain is a crucial regulator of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, it remains unclear whether and how ECM contributes to neuronal circuit stability. Here we demonstrate that the integrity of ECM supports the maintenance of E-I balance by retaining inhibitory connectivity. Depletion of ECM in mature neuronal networks preferentially decreases the density of inhibitory synapses and the size of individual inhibitory postsynaptic scaffolds. After ECM depletion, inhibitory synapse strength homeostatically increases via the reduction of presynaptic GABAB receptors. However, the inhibitory connectivity reduces to an extent that inhibitory synapse scaling is no longer efficient in controlling neuronal network state. Our results indicate that the brain ECM preserves the balanced network state by stabilizing inhibitory control.

<p>Herculano‐Houzel et al. examine numbers of neurons in the brain of 13 bat species and find that the apparently “enlarged” cerebellum of small echolocating bats has the same proportion of brain neurons as other mammals, and is more likely simply the result of a diminutive cerebral cortex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of 7 species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and 6 species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Guidelines recommend to initiate anticoagulation within 4‐14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high risk features on echocardiography.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0‐3 days, 4‐14 days, or &gt;14 days) and outcomes were recurrent stroke/TIA/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 2084 patients, 1289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the three groups: 0‐3 days [10.3% (64/617)], 4‐14 days [(9.7%) 52/535)], &gt;14 days [10.2% (14/137), p=0.933]. In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4‐14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs. 0‐3 days) (OR 1.49 95% CI 0.50 – 4.43) neither did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs. &gt; 14 days) (OR 0.76 95% CI 0.36 – 1.62, p = 0.482).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this multicenter real world cohort, the recommended (4‐14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral parafacial region (pF<sub>L</sub>; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF<sub>L</sub> activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF<sub>L</sub>, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labelled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF<sub>V</sub>] and pF<sub>L</sub>), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labelled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal grey, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF<sub>V</sub>, NTS and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or <i>Locus Coeruleus, </i> no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF<sub>L</sub>. Our results indicate that pF<sub>L</sub> neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and non‐respiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF<sub>L</sub> oscillator for active expiration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a post translational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labelling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labelling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, RVL, A1 and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn). Ultrastructural examination showed labelling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labelling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in dorsal horn.</p>

<p>Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of layer III and layer I. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in layer III with sparser termination in layers I, II and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: 1) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in non‐primate species; 2) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent studies carried out on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients suggest that the disease might initiate in the motor cortex and spread to its targets along the corticofugal tracts. In this study, we aimed to test the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis experimentally.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><i>Sod1 </i>
<sup>
   <i>G86R </i>
</sup> and <i>Fezf2 </i> knockout mouse lines were crossed to generate a model that expresses a mutant of the murine <i>Sod1 </i> gene ubiquitously, a condition sufficient to induce progressive motor symptoms and premature death, but genetically lacks corticospinal neurons and other subcerebral projection neurons, one of the main populations of corticofugal neurons. Disease onset and survival were recorded, and weight and motor behavior were followed longitudinally. Hyper‐reflexia and spasticity were monitored using electromyographic recordings. Neurodegeneration and gliosis were assessed by histological techniques.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Absence of subcerebral projection neurons delayed disease onset, reduced weight loss and motor impairment, and increased survival without modifying disease duration. Absence of corticospinal neurons also limited presymptomatic hyper‐reflexia, a typical component of the upper motoneuron syndrome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Major corticofugal tracts are crucial to the onset and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the context of the disease, subcerebral projection neurons might carry detrimental signals to their downstream targets. In its entirety, this study provides the first experimental arguments in favor of the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Axonal outgrowth is a fundamental process during the development of central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system as well as in nerve regeneration and requires accurate axonal navigation and extension to the correct target. These events need proper coordination between membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangements and are under the control of the small GTPases of the Rho family, among other molecules. Reelin, a relevant protein for CNS development and synaptic function in the adult, is also present in the PNS. Upon sciatic nerve damage, Reelin expression increases and, on the other hand, mice deficient in Reelin exhibit an impaired nerve regeneration. However, the mechanism(s) involved the Reelin‐dependent axonal growth is still poorly understood. In this work, we present evidence showing that Reelin stimulates dorsal root ganglia (DRG) regeneration after axotomy. Moreover, dissociated DRG neurons express the Reelin receptor Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2 and also require the presence of TC10 to develop their axons. TC10 is a Rho GTPase that promotes neurite outgrowth through the exocytic fusion of vesicles at the growth cone. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Reelin controls TC10 activation in DRG neurons. Besides, we confirmed that the known CNS Reelin target Cdc42 is also activated in DRG and controls TC10 activity. Finally, in the process of membrane addition, we found that Reelin stimulates the fusion of membrane carriers containing the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7 in vesicles that contain TC10. Altogether, our work shows a new role of Reelin in PNS, opening the option of therapeutic interventions to improve the regeneration process.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to demonstrate that antibodies from patients with anti‐<i>N </i>‐methyl‐<span class="smallCaps">d </span>‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis alter the levels of dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) and cause psychotic‐like features in mice.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis or controls, and the effects on clusters of D1R and D2R were quantified. In vivo studies included 71 C57BL/6J mice that were chronically infused with CSF from patients or controls through ventricular catheters connected to subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startling reflex (PPI; a marker of psychotic‐like behavior), memory, locomotor activity, and the density of cell‐surface and synaptic D1R, D2R, and NMDAR clusters were examined at different time points using reported techniques.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In cultured neurons, CSF from patients, but not from controls, caused a significant decrease of cell‐surface D1R and an increase of D2R clusters. In mice, CSF from patients caused a significant decrease of synaptic and total cell‐surface D1R clusters and an increase of D2R clusters associated with a decrease of PPI. These effects were accompanied by memory impairment and a reduction of surface NMDARs, as reported in this model. The psychotic‐like features, memory impairment, and changes in levels of D1R, D2R, and NMDAR progressively improved several days after the infusion of CSF from patients stopped.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In addition to memory deficits and reduction of NMDARs, CSF antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis cause reversible psychotic‐like features accompanied by changes (D1R decrease, D2R increase) in cell‐surface dopamine receptor clusters. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>by Areti Tsigkinopoulou, Eriko Takano, Rainer Breitling</p>

Antibiotic production is coordinated in the <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> population through the use of diffusible signaling molecules of the γ-butyrolactone (GBL) family. The GBL regulatory system involves a small, and not completely defined two-gene network which governs a potentially bi-stable switch between the “on” and “off” states of antibiotic production. The use of this circuit as a tool for synthetic biology has been hampered by a lack of mechanistic understanding of its functionality. We hereby present the creation and analysis of a versatile and adaptable ensemble model of the <i>Streptomyces</i> GBL system (detailed information on all model mechanisms and parameters is documented in http://www.systemsbiology.ls.manchester.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). We use the model to explore a range of previously proposed mechanistic hypotheses, including transcriptional interference, antisense RNA interactions between the mRNAs of the two genes, and various alternative regulatory activities. Our results suggest that transcriptional interference alone is not sufficient to explain the system’s behavior. Instead, antisense RNA interactions seem to be the system's driving force, combined with an aggressive <i>scbR</i> promoter. The computational model can be used to further challenge and refine our understanding of the system’s activity and guide future experimentation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vQcdHwJpGWc" width="1" />

<p>by Doron Levin, Tamir Tuller</p>

The importance of mRNA translation models has been demonstrated across many fields of science and biotechnology. However, a whole cell model with codon resolution and biophysical dynamics is still lacking. We describe a whole cell model of translation for <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. The model simulates all major translation components in the cell: ribosomes, mRNAs and tRNAs. It also includes, for the first time, fundamental aspects of translation, such as competition for ribosomes and tRNAs at a codon resolution while considering tRNAs wobble interactions and tRNA recycling. The model uses parameters that are tightly inferred from large scale measurements of translation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a robust modelling approach which relies on state-of-the-art practices of translation modelling and also provides a framework for easy generalizations. This novel approach allows simulation of thousands of mRNAs that undergo translation in the same cell with common resources such as ribosomes and tRNAs in feasible time. Based on this model, we demonstrate, for the first time, the direct importance of competition for resources on translation and its accurate modelling. An effective supply-demand ratio (ESDR) measure, which is related to translation factors such as tRNAs, has been devised and utilized to show superior predictive power in complex scenarios of heterologous gene expression. The devised model is not only more accurate than the existing models, but, more importantly, provides a framework for analyzing complex whole cell translation problems and variables that haven't been explored before, making it important in various biomedical fields.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XlLFYvqkEAQ" width="1" />

<p>by Victor Pedrosa, Claudia Clopath</p>

During the exploration of novel environments, place fields are rapidly formed in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Place cell firing rate increases in early stages of exploration of novel environments but returns to baseline levels in familiar environments. Although similar in amplitude and width, place fields in familiar environments are more stable than in novel environments. We propose a computational model of the hippocampal CA1 network, which describes the formation, dynamics and stabilization of place fields. We show that although somatic disinhibition is sufficient to form place fields, dendritic inhibition along with synaptic plasticity is necessary for place field stabilization. Our model suggests that place cell stability can be attributed to strong excitatory synaptic weights and strong dendritic inhibition. We show that the interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition balances the increased excitatory weights, such that place cells return to their baseline firing rate after exploration. Our model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity. Finally, we predict that artificially induced dendritic events can shift place fields even after place field stabilization.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/riZBHO8GGwk" width="1" />

<p>by Mathilde Foglierini, Leontios Pappas, Antonio Lanzavecchia, Davide Corti, Laurent Perez</p>

High-throughput sequencing of human immunoglobulin genes allows analysis of antibody repertoires and the reconstruction of clonal lineage evolution. The study of antibodies (Abs) affinity maturation is of specific interest to understand the generation of Abs with high affinity or broadly neutralizing activities. Moreover, phylogenic analysis enables the identification of the key somatic mutations required to achieve optimal antigen binding. The Immcantation framework provides a start-to-finish set of analytical methods for high-throughput adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq; Rep-Seq) data. Furthermore, Immcantation’s Change-O package has developed IgPhyML, an algorithm designed to build specifically immunoglobulin (Ig) phylogenic trees. Meanwhile Phylip, an algorithm that has been originally developed for applications in ecology and macroevolution, can also be used for the phylogenic reconstruction of antibodies maturation pathway. To complement Ig lineages made by IgPhyML or Dnaml (Phylip), we developed AncesTree, a graphic user interface (GUI) that aims to give researchers the opportunity to interactively explore antibodies clonal evolution. AncesTree displays interactive immunoglobulins phylogenic tree, Ig related mutations and sequence alignments using additional information coming from specialized antibody tools. The GUI is a Java standalone application allowing interaction with Ig tree that can run under Windows, Linux and Mac OS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Irkwzuv4fQ" width="1" />

The carnivorous Venus flytrap catches prey by an ingenious snapping mechanism. Based on work over nearly 200 years, it has become generally accepted that two touches of the trap’s sensory hairs within 30 s, each one generating an action potential, are required to trigger closure of the trap. We developed an electromechanical model, which, however, suggests that under certain circumstances one touch is sufficient to generate two action potentials. Using a force-sensing microrobotic system, we precisely quantified the sensory-hair deflection parameters necessary to trigger trap closure and correlated them with the elicited action potentials in vivo. Our results confirm the model’s predictions, suggesting that the Venus flytrap may be adapted to a wider range of prey movements than previously assumed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/a8JG4sFhJUg" width="1" />

<p>by Jianfeng Zhang, Zirui Huang, Shankar Tumati, Georg Northoff</p>

Recent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) studies have revealed that the global signal (GS) exhibits a nonuniform spatial distribution across the gray matter. Whether this topography is informative remains largely unknown. We therefore tested rest-task modulation of GS topography by analyzing static GS correlation and dynamic coactivation patterns in a large sample of an fMRI dataset (<i>n</i> = 837) from the Human Connectome Project. The GS topography in the resting state and in seven different tasks was first measured by correlating the GS with the local time series (GSCORR). In the resting state, high GSCORR was observed mainly in the primary sensory and motor regions, whereas low GSCORR was seen in the association brain areas. This pattern changed during the seven tasks, with mainly decreased GSCORR in sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, this rest-task modulation of GSCORR could be traced to transient coactivation patterns at the peak period of GS (GS-peak). By comparing the topography of GSCORR and respiration effects, we observed that the topography of respiration mimicked the topography of GS in the resting state, whereas both differed during the task states; because of such partial dissociation, we assume that GSCORR could not be equated with a respiration effect. Finally, rest-task modulation of GS topography could not be exclusively explained by other sources of physiological noise. Together, we here demonstrate the informative nature of GS topography by showing its rest-task modulation, the underlying dynamic coactivation patterns, and its partial dissociation from respiration effects during task states.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KpYFzcwnd0Q" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00198">The role of cognitive control in age-related changes in well-being</a></h4>

<p>Maintaining emotional well-being in late life is crucial for achieving successful and healthy aging. While previous research from Western cultures has documented that emotional well-being improves as individuals get older, previous research provided mixed evidence on the effects of age on well-being in Eastern Asian cultures. However, previous studies in East Asia do not always take into account the effects of cognitive control – an ability which has been considered as a key to enable older adults to regulate their emotions. In the current study, we tested whether cognitive control abilities interact with age in determining individuals’ well-being in 59 Japanese females (age range: 26-79; Mage = 64.95). Participants’ mental health and mental fatigue were tracked for 5 years together with their cognitive control abilities. We found that as individuals became older, they showed improved mental health and decreased mental fatigue. In addition, for mental fatigue, we found a quadratic effect of age which was further qualified by baseline cognitive control abilities; in those who had a lower level of cognitive control abilities, mental fatigue declined until the mid 60s, at which point it started increasing (a U-shape effect). In contrast, in those who had a higher level of cognitive control ability, mental fatigue showed a steady decrease with age even after their mid-60s. These results suggest that whether advancing age is associated with positive vs. negative changes in well-being depends on cognitive control abilities and that preserved cognitive control is a key to maintain well-being in late life.</p>

<p>AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the brain. Changes in the properties and postsynaptic abundance of AMPARs are pivotal mechanisms in synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission. A wide range of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, despite their extremely diverse etiology, pathogenesis and symptoms, exhibit brain region-specific and AMPAR subunit-specific aberrations in synaptic transmission or plasticity. These include abnormally enhanced or reduced AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission or plasticity. Bidirectional reversal of these changes by targeting AMPAR subunits or trafficking ameliorates drug-seeking behavior, chronic pain, epileptic seizures, or cognitive deficits. This indicates that bidirectional dysregulation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission or plasticity may contribute to the expression of many brain disorders and therefore serve as a therapeutic target. Here, we provide a synopsis of bidirectional AMPAR dysregulation in animal models of brain disorders and review the preclinical evidence on the therapeutic targeting of AMPARs.</p>

<p>While non-invasive brain imaging has made substantial contributions to advance human brain science, estimation of individual state is becoming important to realize its applications in society. Brain activations were used to classify second-language proficiencies. Participants in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment were 20/20 native Japanese speakers with high/low English abilities and 19/19 native English speakers with high/low Japanese abilities. Their cortical activities were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy while they were conducting Japanese/English listening comprehension tests. The data-driven method achieved classification accuracy of 77.5% in the case of Japanese speakers and 81.9% in the case of English speakers. The informative features predominantly originated from regions associated with language function. These results bring an insight of fNIRS neuroscience and its applications in society.</p>

<p>Memory deficits are a common and frequently-cited consequence of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, we know less about how TBI influences relational memory, which allows the binding of the arbitrary elements of experience and the flexible use and recombination of relational representations in novel situations. Relational memory is of special interest for individuals with TBI, given the vulnerability of the hippocampus to injury mechanisms, as well as a growing body of literature establishing the role of relational memory in flexible and goal-directed behavior. In this study, participants with and without a history of moderate-severe TBI completed a continuous relational memory task for face-scene pairings. Participants with TBI exhibited a disruption in relational memory not only when tested after a delay, but also when tested with no experimenter-imposed delay after stimulus presentation. Further, canonical assessments of working and episodic memory did not correspond with performance on the face-scene task, suggesting that this task may tap into relational memory differently and with greater sensitivity than standardized memory assessments. These results highlight the need for rigorous assessment of relational memory in TBI, which is likely to detect deficits that have specific consequences for community reintegration and long-term functional outcomes.</p>

<p>Individuals with autism show difficulties in using sentence context to identify the correct meaning of ambiguous words, such as homonyms. In this study, the brain basis of sentence context effects on word understanding during reading was examined in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development (TD) using magnetoencephalography. The correlates of a history of developmental language delay in ASD were also investigated. Event related field responses at early (150 ms after the onset of a final word) and N400 latencies are reported for three different types of sentence final words: dominant homonyms, subordinate homonyms, and unambiguous words. Clear evidence for semantic access was found at both early and conventional N400 latencies in both TD participants and individuals with ASD with no history of language delay. By contrast, modulation of evoked activity related to semantic access was weak and not significant at early latencies in individuals with ASD with a history of language delay. The reduced sensitivity to semantic context in individuals with ASD and language delay was accompanied by strong right hemisphere lateralization at early and N400 latencies; such strong activity was not observed in TD individuals and individuals with ASD without a history of language delay at either latency. These results provide new evidence and support for differential neural mechanisms underlying semantic processing in ASD, and indicate that delayed language acquisition in ASD is associated with different lateralization and processing of language.</p>

<p>Tactile stimulation is less frequently used than visual for brain-computer interface (BCI) control, partly because of limitations in speed and accuracy. Non-visual BCI paradigms, however, may be required for patients who struggle with vision dependent BCIs because of a loss of gaze control. With the present study, we attempted to replicate earlier results by Herweg et al. (2016), with several minor adjustments and a focus on training effects and usability. We invited 16 healthy participants and trained them with a 4-class tactile P300-based BCI in five sessions. Their main task was to navigate a virtual wheelchair through a 3D apartment using the BCI. We found significant training effects on information transfer rate (ITR), which increased from a mean of 3.10–9.50 bits/min. Further, both online and offline accuracies significantly increased with training from 65% to 86% and 70% to 95%, respectively. We found only a descriptive increase of P300 amplitudes at Fz and Cz with training. Furthermore, we report subjective data from questionnaires, which indicated a relatively high workload and moderate to high satisfaction. Although our participants have not achieved the same high performance as in the Herweg et al. (2016) study, we provide evidence for training effects on performance with a tactile BCI and confirm the feasibility of the paradigm.</p>

<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate interictal neuromagnetic activities in the low- to high-frequency ranges in patients with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), especially those without interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs).</p><p>Methods: We studied 21 clinically-diagnosed BECTS patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using high-sampling magnetoencephalography (MEG). Neuromagnetic sources were assessed with accumulated source imaging (ASI). The MEG data were analyzed in seven frequency bands. The MEG recordings distinguished BECTS without IEDs (n = 10) from those with IEDs (n = 11) and HC (n = 11).</p><p>Results: At 1–4 Hz, the neuromagnetic activities in healthy subjects tended to locate at the precuneus/posterior cingulate, while those of the BECTS patients without IEDs tended to locate at the medial frontal cortex (MFC) compared to BECTS patients with IEDs. The MEG source imaging at 30–80 Hz revealed that BECTS patients without IEDs had higher occurrences of interictal brain activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) compared to controls and the brain activity strength seemed to be weaker. There was a significant correlation between the source strength of the interictal gamma oscillations of BECTS patients without IEDs and the duration of epilepsy.</p><p>Conclusions: IEDs might disrupt the default mode network (DMN). Aberrant brain activities in BECTS patients without IEDs were associated with cognitive areas of the brain. The strength of gamma oscillations in the chronic epilepsy state reflected the duration of BECTS.</p><p>Significance: MEG could reveal the aberrant neural activities in BECTS patients during the interictal period, and such abnormality is frequency-dependent. Gamma oscillations could be used to identify BECTS patients without IEDs.</p>

<p>Schizencephalies are abnormal clefts of the cerebral hemispheres that result from abnormal late neuronal migration and cortical organization. In the present study, we report a different type of unusual motor organization in a patient with a schizencephalic cleft in the right hemisphere and polymicrogyria in the opposite hemisphere. Despite similar brain pathology affecting the sensorimotor cortex, motor organization differed from previously known bilateral congenital brain lesions. We conducted a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion tensor image (DTI) study to confirm the motor organization. In this case, ipsilateral corticospinal projections to the paretic hands were observed during TMS of the less affected hemisphere, along with polymicrogyria, similar to the previous study. However, a crossed corticospinal tract to the paretic hand from the more severely affected hemisphere was observed in this case-a pattern of motor organization that has yet to be reported in this patient population. Our findings indicate that motor organization after early brain injury may be affected by the interhemispheric competition of the corticospinal system and bilateral brain lesions, thereby resulting in unilateral hemiparesis.</p>

<p>Determination of muscle forces during motion can help to understand motor control, assess pathological movement, diagnose neuromuscular disorders, or estimate joint loads. Difficulty of in vivo measurement made computational analysis become a common alternative in which, as several muscles serve each degree of freedom, the muscle redundancy problem must be solved. Unlike static optimization (SO), synergy optimization (SynO) couples muscle activations across all time frames, thereby altering estimated muscle co-contraction. This study explores whether the use of a muscle synergy structure within an SO framework improves prediction of muscle activations during walking. A motion/force/electromyography (EMG) gait analysis was performed on five healthy subjects. A musculoskeletal model of the right leg actuated by 43 Hill-type muscles was scaled to each subject and used to calculate joint moments, muscle–tendon kinematics, and moment arms. Muscle activations were then estimated using SynO with two to six synergies and traditional SO, and these estimates were compared with EMG measurements. Synergy optimization neither improved SO prediction of experimental activation patterns nor provided SO exact matching of joint moments. Finally, synergy analysis was performed on SO estimated activations, being found that the reconstructed activations produced poor matching of experimental activations and joint moments. As conclusion, it can be said that, although SynO did not improve prediction of muscle activations during gait, its reduced dimensional control space could be beneficial for applications such as functional electrical stimulation or motion control and prediction.</p>

<p>Electrical excitation of neural tissue has wide applications, but how electrical stimulation interacts with neural tissue remains to be elucidated. Here, we propose a new theory, named the Circuit-Probability theory, to reveal how this physical interaction happen. The relation between the electrical stimulation input and the neural response can be theoretically calculated. We show that many empirical models, including strength-duration relationship and linear-non-linear-Poisson model, can be theoretically explained, derived, and amended using our theory. Furthermore, this theory can explain the complex non-linear and resonant phenomena and fit in vivo experiment data. In this letter, we validated an entirely new framework to study electrical stimulation on neural tissue, which is to simulate voltage waveforms using a parallel RLC circuit first, and then calculate the excitation probability stochastically.</p>

Microglia are resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The inflammatory responses mediated by microglia play an important role in the occurrence and development of ischemic brain injuries. This article summarizes the activation, polarization, depletion, and repopulation of microglia after ischemic brain injuries, proposing new treatment strategies for such injuries through the modulation of microglial function.</p>

<p>The morphology of microglial cells is often closely related to their functions. The mechanisms that regulate microglial ramification are not well understood. Here we reveal the biological mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate microglial ramification. Morphological variation in mouse microglial cultures was measured in terms of cell area as well as branch number and length. Effects on microglial ramification were analyzed after microinjecting the toxin L-alpha-aminoadipic acid (L-AAA) in the mouse cortex or hippocampus to ablate astrocytes, and after culturing microglia on their own in an astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) or together with astrocytes in coculture. TGF-β expression was determined by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. The TGF-β signaling pathway was blocked by the TGF-β antibody to assess the role of TGF-β on microglial ramification. The results showed that microglia had more and longer branches and smaller cell bodies in brain areas where astrocytes were abundant. In the mouse cortex and hippocampus, ablation of astrocytes by L-AAA decreased number and length of microglial branches and increased the size of cell bodies. Similar results were obtained with isolated microglia in culture. However, isolated microglia were able to maintain their multibranched structure for a long time when cultured on astrocyte monolayers. Ameboid microglia isolated from P0 to P3 mice showed increased ramification when cultured in ACM or on astrocyte monolayers. Microglia cultured on astrocyte monolayers showed more complex branching structures than those cultured in ACM. Blocking astrocyte-derived TGF-β decreased microglial ramification. Astrocytes induced the formation of protuberances on branches of microglia by forming glial fibers that increased traction. These experiments in mice suggest that astrocytes promote microglial ramification by forming glial fibers to create traction and by secreting soluble factors into the surroundings. For example, astrocyte-secreted TGF-β promotes microglia to generate primitive branches, whose ramification is refined by glial fibers.</p>

<p>By limiting protein exchange between the soma and the axon, the axon initial segment (AIS) enables the segregation of specific proteins and hence the differentiation of the somatodendritic compartment and the axonal compartment. Electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence imaging have provided important insights in the ultrastructure of the AIS. Yet, the full extent of its filtering properties is not fully delineated. In particular, it is unclear whether and how the AIS opposes the free exchange of soluble proteins. Here we describe a robust framework to combine whole-cell photobleaching and retrospective high-resolution imaging in developing neurons. With this assay, we found that cytoplasmic soluble proteins that are not excluded from the axon upon expression over tens of hours exhibit a strong mobility reduction at the AIS – i.e., are indeed compartmentalized – when monitored over tens of minutes. This form of compartmentalization is developmentally regulated, requires intact F-actin and may be correlated with the composition and ultrastructure of the submembranous spectrin cytoskeleton. Using computational modeling, we provide evidence that both neuronal morphology and the AIS regulate this compartmentalization but act on distinct time scales, with the AIS having a more pronounced effect on fast exchanges. Our results thus suggest that the rate of protein accumulation in the soma may impact to what extent and over which timescales freely moving molecules can be segregated from the axon. This in turn has important implications for our understanding of compartment-specific signaling in neurons.</p>

<p>Cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (COX5A) is involved in maintaining normal mitochondrial function. However, little is known on the role of COX5A in the development and progress of Alzheimer’s disease (Martinez-Losa et al., 2018). In this study, we established and characterized the genomic profiles of genes expressed in the hippocampus of Senescence-Accelerated Mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, and revealed differential expression of COX5A among 12-month-aged SAMP8 mice and 2-month-aged SAMP8 mice. Newly established transgenic mice with systemic COX5A overexpression (51% increase) resulted in the improvement of spatial recognition memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, recovery of hippocampal CA1 dendrites, and activation of the BDNF/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vivo. Moreover, mice with both COX5A overexpression and BDNF knockdown showed a poor recovery in spatial recognition memory as well as a decrease in spine density and branching of dendrites in CA1, when compared to mice that only overexpressed COX5A. In vitro studies supported that COX5A affected neuronal growth via BDNF. In summary, this study was the first to show that COX5A in the hippocampus plays a vital role in aging-related cognitive deterioration via BDNF/ERK1/2 regulation, and suggested that COX5A may be a potential target for anti-senescence drugs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57572">Evolutionarily distant I domains can functionally replace the essential ligand-binding domain of <i>Plasmodium</i> TRAP</a></h4>

Inserted (I) domains function as ligand-binding domains in adhesins that support cell adhesion and migration in many eukaryotic phyla. These adhesins include integrin αβ heterodimers in metazoans and single subunit transmembrane proteins in apicomplexans such as TRAP in <i>Plasmodium</i> and MIC2 in <i>Toxoplasma</i>. Here we show that the I domain of TRAP is essential for sporozoite gliding motility, mosquito salivary gland invasion and mouse infection. Its replacement with the I domain from Toxoplasma MIC2 fully restores tissue invasion and parasite transmission, while replacement with the aX I domain from human integrins still partially restores liver infection. Mutations around the ligand binding site allowed salivary gland invasion but led to inefficient transmission to the rodent host. These results suggest that apicomplexan parasites appropriated polyspecific I domains in part for their ability to engage with multiple ligands and to provide traction for emigration into diverse organs in distant phyla.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57544">Real-time <i>in vivo</i> imaging of extracellular ATP in the brain with a hybrid-type fluorescent sensor</a></h4>

Adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP) is a ubiquitous extracellular signaling messenger. Here, we describe a method for <i>in-vivo</i> imaging of extracellular ATP with high spatiotemporal resolution. We prepared a comprehensive set of cysteine-substitution mutants of ATP-binding protein, <i>Bacillus</i> FoF<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase e subunit, labeled with small-molecule fluorophores at the introduced cysteine residue. Screening revealed that the Cy3-labeled glutamine-105 mutant (Q105C-Cy3; designated ATPOS) shows a large fluorescence change in the presence of ATP, with submicromolar affinity, pH-independence, and high selectivity for ATP over ATP metabolites and other nucleotides. To enable <i>in-vivo</i> validation, we introduced BoNT/C-Hc for binding to neuronal plasma membrane and Alexa Fluor 488 for ratiometric measurement. The resulting ATPOS complex binds to neurons in cerebral cortex of living mice, and clearly visualized a concentrically propagating wave of extracellular ATP release in response to electrical stimulation. ATPOS should be useful to probe the extracellular ATP dynamics of diverse biological processes <i>in vivo</i>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56782">Dissecting cell type-specific metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</a></h4>

Tumors are composed of many different cell types including cancer cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Dissecting functional metabolic differences between cell types within a mixed population can be challenging due to the rapid turnover of metabolites relative to the time needed to isolate cells. To overcome this challenge, we traced isotope-labeled nutrients into macromolecules that turn over more slowly than metabolites. This approach was used to assess differences between cancer cell and fibroblast metabolism in murine pancreatic cancer organoid-fibroblast co-cultures and tumors. Pancreatic cancer cells exhibited increased pyruvate carboxylation relative to fibroblasts, and this flux depended on both pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme 1 activity. Consequently, expression of both enzymes in cancer cells was necessary for organoid and tumor growth, demonstrating that dissecting the metabolism of specific cell populations within heterogeneous systems can identify dependencies that may not be evident from studying isolated cells in culture or bulk tissue.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56584">Miga mediated endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites regulate neuronal homeostasis</a></h4>

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs) are crucial for multiple cellular processes such as calcium signaling, lipid transport, mitochondrial dynamics, and autophagosome biogenesis. However, the molecular organization, functions, and regulation of ERMCS are not fully understood in higher eukaryotes. Also, the physiological roles of altered ERMCSs are not well defined. In this study, we found that Miga, a mitochondrion located protein, markedly increases ERMCSs and causes severe neurodegeneration upon overexpression in fly eyes. Miga interacts with an ER protein Vap33 through its FFAT-like motif and an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease related Vap33 mutation considerably reduces its interaction with Miga. Multiple serine residues inside and near the Miga FFAT motif were phosphorylated, which is required for its interaction with Vap33 and Miga mediated ERMCS formation. The interaction between Vap33 and Miga promoted further phosphorylation of upstream serine/threonine clusters, which fine-tuned Miga activity. Protein kinases CKI and CaMKII contribute to Miga hyperphosphorylation. MIGA2, encoded by the <i>miga</i> mammalian ortholog, has conserved functions in mammalian cells. We propose a model that shows Miga interacts with Vap33 to mediate ERMCSs and excessive ERMCSs lead to neurodegeneration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55513">Late-life restoration of mitochondrial function reverses cardiac dysfunction in old mice</a></h4>

Diastolic dysfunction is a prominent feature of cardiac aging in both mice and humans. We show here that 8-week treatment of old mice with the mitochondrial targeted peptide SS-31 (elamipretide) can substantially reverse this deficit. SS-31 normalized the increase in proton leak and reduced mitochondrial ROS in cardiomyocytes from old mice, accompanied by reduced protein oxidation and a shift towards a more reduced protein thiol redox state in old hearts. Improved diastolic function was concordant with increased phosphorylation of cMyBP-C Ser282 but was independent of titin isoform shift. Late-life viral expression of mitochondrial-targeted catalase (mCAT) produced similar functional benefits in old mice and SS-31 did not improve cardiac function of old mCAT mice, implicating normalizing mitochondrial oxidative stress as an overlapping mechanism. These results demonstrate that pre-existing cardiac aging phenotypes can be reversed by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and implicate mitochondrial energetics and redox signaling as therapeutic targets for cardiac aging.

<p>by Samuel V. Scarpino, James G. Scott, Rosalind M. Eggo, Bruce Clements, Nedialko B. Dimitrov, Lauren Ancel Meyers</p>

Individuals in low socioeconomic brackets are considered at-risk for developing influenza-related complications and often exhibit higher than average influenza-related hospitalization rates. This disparity has been attributed to various factors, including restricted access to preventative and therapeutic health care, limited sick leave, and household structure. Adequate influenza surveillance in these at-risk populations is a critical precursor to accurate risk assessments and effective intervention. However, the United States of America’s primary national influenza surveillance system (ILINet) monitors outpatient healthcare providers, which may be largely inaccessible to lower socioeconomic populations. Recent initiatives to incorporate Internet-source and hospital electronic medical records data into surveillance systems seek to improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of outbreak detection and situational awareness. Here, we use a flexible statistical framework for integrating multiple surveillance data sources to evaluate the adequacy of traditional (ILINet) and next generation (BioSense 2.0 and Google Flu Trends) data for situational awareness of influenza across poverty levels. We find that ZIP Codes in the highest poverty quartile are a critical vulnerability for ILINet that the integration of next generation data fails to ameliorate.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TufeTsxwbfw" width="1" />

<p>by Samuel F. Rosenblatt, Jeffrey A. Smith, G. Robin Gauthier, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne</p>

Network-based intervention strategies can be effective and cost-efficient approaches to curtailing harmful contagions in myriad settings. As studied, these strategies are often impractical to implement, as they typically assume complete knowledge of the network structure, which is unusual in practice. In this paper, we investigate how different immunization strategies perform under realistic conditions—where the strategies are informed by partially-observed network data. Our results suggest that global immunization strategies, like degree immunization, are optimal in most cases; the exception is at very high levels of missing data, where stochastic strategies, like acquaintance immunization, begin to outstrip them in minimizing outbreaks. Stochastic strategies are more robust in some cases due to the different ways in which they can be affected by missing data. In fact, one of our proposed variants of acquaintance immunization leverages a logistically-realistic ongoing survey-intervention process as a form of targeted data-recovery to improve with increasing levels of missing data. These results support the effectiveness of targeted immunization as a general practice. They also highlight the risks of considering networks as idealized mathematical objects: overestimating the accuracy of network data and foregoing the rewards of additional inquiry.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lFc02eNMJ-g" width="1" />

Kindlin-1, -2, and -3 directly bind integrin β cytoplasmic tails to regulate integrin activation and signaling. Despite their functional significance and links to several diseases, structural information on full-length kindlin proteins remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of human full-length kindlin-3, which reveals a novel homotrimer state. Unlike kindlin-3 monomer, which is the major population in insect and mammalian cell expression systems, kindlin-3 trimer does not bind integrin β cytoplasmic tail as the integrin-binding pocket in the F3 subdomain of 1 protomer is occluded by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of another protomer, suggesting that kindlin-3 is auto-inhibited upon trimer formation. This is also supported by functional assays in which kindlin-3 knockout K562 erythroleukemia cells reconstituted with the mutant kindlin-3 containing trimer-disrupting mutations exhibited an increase in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibronectin compared with those reconstituted with wild-type kindlin-3. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of kindlin auto-inhibition that involves its homotrimer formation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_wp-lAqDT68" width="1" />

CRISPR-<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Cas9 (CRISPR-SaCas9) has been harnessed as an effective in vivo genome-editing tool to manipulate genomes. However, off-target effects remain a major bottleneck that precludes safe and reliable applications in genome editing. Here, we characterize the off-target effects of wild-type (WT) SaCas9 at single-nucleotide (single-nt) resolution and describe a directional screening system to identify novel SaCas9 variants with desired properties in human cells. Using this system, we identified enhanced-fidelity SaCas9 (efSaCas9) (variant Mut268 harboring the single mutation of N260D), which could effectively distinguish and reject single base-pair mismatches. We demonstrate dramatically reduced off-target effects (approximately 2- to 93-fold improvements) of Mut268 compared to WT using targeted deep-sequencing analyses. To understand the structural origin of the fidelity enhancement, we find that N260, located in the REC3 domain, orchestrates an extensive network of contacts between REC3 and the guide RNA-DNA heteroduplex. efSaCas9 can be broadly used in genome-editing applications that require high fidelity. Furthermore, this study provides a general strategy to rapidly evolve other desired CRISPR-Cas9 traits besides enhanced fidelity, to expand the utility of the CRISPR toolkit.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7DlnCXht8Ac" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Iron is essential for normal cellular function, however, excessive accumulation of iron in neural tissue has been implicated in both cortical and retinal diseases. The exact role of iron in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders remains incompletely understood. However, iron‐induced damage to the brain and retina is often attributed to the redox ability of iron to generate dangerous free radicals, which exacerbates local oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Iron chelators are compounds designed to scavenge labile iron, aiding to regulate iron bioavailability. Recently there has been growing interest in the application of chelating agents for treatment of diseases including neurodegenerative conditions, characterized by increased oxidative stress. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical evidence relating to the effectiveness of iron chelation therapy in conditions of iron dyshomeostasis linked to neurodegeneration in the brain and retina. The limitations as well as future opportunities iron chelation therapy are discussed.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants in <i>SCN3A </i>, encoding the voltage‐gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.3, cause severe childhood onset epilepsy and malformation of cortical development. Here, we define the spectrum of clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging features of <i>SCN3A </i>‐related neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were ascertained via an international collaborative network. We compared sodium channels containing wild‐type versus variant Nav1.3 subunits coexpressed with β1 and β2 subunits using whole‐cell voltage clamp electrophysiological recordings in a heterologous mammalian system (HEK‐293T cells).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 22 patients with pathogenic <i>SCN3A </i> variants, most had treatment‐resistant epilepsy beginning in the first year of life (16/21, 76%; median onset, 2 weeks), with severe or profound developmental delay (15/20, 75%). Many, but not all (15/19, 79%), exhibited malformations of cortical development. Pathogenic variants clustered in transmembrane segments 4 to 6 of domains II to IV. Most pathogenic missense variants tested (10/11, 91%) displayed gain of channel function, with increased persistent current and/or a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and all variants associated with malformation of cortical development exhibited gain of channel function. One variant (p.Ile1468Arg) exhibited mixed effects, with gain and partial loss of function. Two variants demonstrated loss of channel function.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study defines <i>SCN3A‐ </i>related neurodevelopmental disorder along a spectrum of severity, but typically including epilepsy and severe or profound developmental delay/intellectual disability. Malformations of cortical development are a characteristic feature of this unusual channelopathy syndrome, present in &gt;75% of affected individuals. Gain of function at the channel level in developing neurons is likely an important mechanism of disease pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intrathecal inflammation correlates with the grey matter damage since the early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS), but whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile can help to identify patients at risk of disease activity is still unclear.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated the association between CSF levels of 18 cytokines, previously found to be associated to grey matter damage, and the disease activity, among 99 patients with relapsing‐remitting MS, who underwent blinded clinical and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations for 4 years. Groups with evidence of disease activity (EDA) or no evidence of disease activity (NEDA; occurrence of relapses, new white matter lesions, and Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] change) were identified. Cortical lesions and the annualized cortical thinning were also evaluated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty‐one patients experienced EDA and, compared to the NEDA group, had at diagnosis higher CSF levels of CXCL13, CXCL12, IFNγ, TNF, sCD163, LIGHT, and APRIL (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, CXCL13 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35; <i>p </i> = 0.0002), LIGHT (HR = 1.22; <i>p </i> = 0.005) and APRIL (HR = 1.78; <i>p </i> = 0.0001) were the CSF molecules more strongly associated with the risk of EDA. The model, including CSF variables, predicted more accurately the occurrence of disease activity than the model with only clinical/MRI parameters (C‐index at 4 years = 71% vs 44%). Finally, higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (β = 4.7*10<sup>−4</sup>; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001), TNF (β = 3.1*10<sup>−3</sup>; <i>p </i> = 0.004), LIGHT (β = 2.6*10<sup>−4</sup>; <i>p </i> = 0.003), sCD163 (β = 4.3*10<sup>−3</sup>; <i>p </i> = 0.009), and TWEAK (β = 3.4*10<sup>−3</sup>; <i>p </i> = 0.024) were associated with more severe cortical thinning.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A specific CSF profile, mainly characterized by elevated levels of B‐cell related cytokines, distinguishes patients at high risk of disease activity and severe cortical damage. The CSF analysis may allow stratifications of patients at diagnosis for optimizing therapeutic approaches. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>In March 2020, we treated a cohort of 26 critically ill hospitalized SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients who underwent electroencephalography to assess unexplained altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or poor arousal and responsiveness. Of the 26 patients studied, 5 patients had electroencephalograms that showed periodic discharges consisting of high‐amplitude frontal monomorphic delta waves with absence of epileptic activity.

<p>Vision therapy in the form of ocular motor training is increasingly used to treat visual complaints, particularly in the setting of persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this review, we discuss the rationale behind this intervention and the evidence for its utility. Although the efficacy of exercises for primary convergence insufficiency is plausible and supported by data, there is not yet strong evidence of benefit for the post‐traumatic variant. It is not established that abnormalities in fixation, pursuit, and saccades in mTBI are the cause of post‐concussive symptoms, or that these abnormalities arise from ocular motor damage rather than being secondary effects of cognitive problems with attention or executive control. The few studies to date have significant methodological weaknesses. More substantial evidence is required before vision therapy can be accepted as a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with brain trauma. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There are no validated methods for predicting the timing of seizures. Using machine learning, we sought to forecast 24‐hour risk of self‐reported seizure from e‐diaries.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 5,419 patients on <a href="http://SeizureTracker.com" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">SeizureTracker.com</a> (including seizure count, type, and duration) were split into training (3,806 patients/1,665,215 patient‐days) and testing (1,613 patients/549,588 patient‐days) sets with no overlapping patients. An artificial intelligence (AI) program, consisting of recurrent networks followed by a multilayer perceptron (“deep learning” model), was trained to produce risk forecasts. Forecasts were made from a sliding window of 3‐month diary history for each day of each patient's diary. After training, the model parameters were held constant and the testing set was scored. A rate‐matched random (RMR) forecast was compared to the AI. Comparisons were made using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a measure of binary discrimination performance, and the Brier score, a measure of forecast calibration. The Brier skill score (BSS) measured the improvement of the AI Brier score compared to the benchmark RMR Brier score. Confidence intervals (CIs) on performance statistics were obtained via bootstrapping.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The AUC was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.85–0.88) for AI and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.81–0.85) for RMR, favoring AI (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). Overall (all patients combined), BSS was 0.27 (95% CI = 0.23–0.31), also favoring AI (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The AI produced a valid forecast superior to a chance forecaster, and provided meaningful forecasts in the majority of patients. Future studies will be needed to quantify the clinical value of these forecasts for patients. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Neur1 </i> and <i>Neur2 </i>, mouse homologs of the <i>Drosophila neur </i> gene, consist of two neuralized homology repeat domains and a RING domain. Both <i>Neur1 </i> and <i>Neur2 </i> are expressed in the whole adult brain and encode E3 ubiquitin ligases, which play a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathways. A previous study reported that overexpression of <i>Neur1 </i> enhances hippocampus‐dependent memory, whereas the role of <i>Neur2 </i> remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the respective roles of <i>Neur1 </i> and <i>Neur2 </i> in hippocampus‐dependent memory using three lines of genetically modified mice: <i>Neur1 </i> knock‐out, <i>Neur2 </i> knock‐out, and <i>Neur1 </i> and <i>Neur2 </i> double knock‐out (D‐KO). Our results showed that spatial memory was impaired when both <i>Neur1 </i> and <i>Neur2 </i> were deleted, but not in the individual knock‐out of either <i>Neur1 </i> or <i>Neur2 </i>. In addition, basal synaptic properties estimated by input–output relationships and paired‐pulse facilitation did not change, but a form of long‐term potentiation that requires protein synthesis was specifically impaired in the D‐KO mice. These results collectively suggest that <i>Neur1 </i> and <i>Neur2 </i> are crucially involved in hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>The C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 regulates its proteasomal degradation, with isoform 2 being more rapidly degraded. Fusion of the tail of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 to GFP also increases its proteasomal turnover.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ataxin‐3 is a deubiquitinase and polyglutamine disease protein whose cellular properties and functions are not entirely understood. Mutations in ataxin‐3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a neurodegenerative disorder that is a member of the polyglutamine family of diseases. Two major isoforms arise from alternative splicing of <i>ATXN3 </i> and are differently toxic <i>in vivo </i> as a result of faster proteasomal degradation of one isoform compared to the other. The isoforms vary only at their C‐termini, suggesting that the hydrophobic C‐terminus of the more quickly degraded form of ataxin‐3 (here referred to as isoform 2) functions as a degron—that is, a peptide sequence that expedites the degradation of its host protein. We explored this notion in this study and present evidence that: (a) the C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 signals its degradation in a proteasome‐dependent manner, (b) this effect from the C‐terminus of isoform 2 does not require the ubiquitination of ataxin‐3, and (c) the isolated C‐terminus of isoform 2 can enhance the degradation of an unrelated protein. According to our data, the C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 is a degron, increasing overall understanding of the cellular properties of the SCA3 protein.</p>

<p>LAMA2-related congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD; LAMA2-MD), also referred to as merosin deficient CMD (MDC1A), is a severe neonatal onset muscle disease caused by recessive mutations in the LAMA2 gene. LAMA2 encodes laminin α2, a subunit of the extracellular matrix (ECM) oligomer laminin 211. There are currently no treatments for MDC1A, and there is an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis. Zebrafish, due to their high degree of genetic conservation with humans, large clutch sizes, rapid development, and optical clarity, have emerged as an excellent model system for studying rare Mendelian diseases. They are particularly suitable as a model for muscular dystrophy because they contain at least one orthologue to all major human MD genes, have muscle that is similar to human muscle in structure and function, and manifest obvious and easily measured MD related phenotypes. In this review article, we present the existing zebrafish models of MDC1A, and discuss their contribution to the understanding of MDC1A pathomechanisms and therapy development.</p>

<p>The major aim of stroke therapies is to stimulate brain repair and to improve behavioral recuperation after cerebral ischemia. Despite remarkable advances in cell therapy for stroke, stem cell-based tissue replacement has not been achieved yet stimulating the search for alternative strategies for brain self-repair using the neurogenic zones of the brain, the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). However, during aging, the potential of the hippocampus and the SVZ to generate new neuronal precursors, declines. We hypothesized that electrically stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis in aged rats could increase the odds of brain self-repair and improve behavioral recuperation after focal ischemia. Following stroke in aged animals, the rats were subjected to two sessions of electrical non-convulsive stimulation using ear-clip electrodes, at 7- and 24 days after MCAO. Animal were sacrificed after 48 days. We report that electrical stimulation (ES) stimulation of post-stroke aged rats led to an improved functional recovery of spatial long-term memory (T-maze) but not on the rotating pole or the inclined plane, both tests requiring complex sensorimotor skills. Surprisingly, ES had a detrimental effect on the asymmetric sensorimotor deficit. Histologically, there was a robust increase in the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and SVZ of the infarcted hemisphere and the presence of a considerable number of neurons expressing tubulin beta III in the infarcted area. Among the gene that were unique to ES, we noted increases in the expression of seizure related 6 homolog like which is one of the physiological substrate of the β-secretase BACE1 involved in the pathophysiology of the Alzheimer’s disease and Igfbp3 and BDNF receptor mRNAs which has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect after cerebral ischemia. However, ES was associated with a long-term down regulation of cortical gene expression after stroke in aged rats suggesting that gene expression in the peri-infarcted cortical area may not be related to electrical stimulation induced-neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and hippocampus.</p>

<p>Similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) detects the changes of hemoglobin species inside the brain, but via differences in optical absorption. Within the near-infrared spectrum, light can penetrate biological tissues and be absorbed by chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. What makes fNIRS more advantageous is its portability and potential for long-term monitoring. This paper reviews the basic mechanisms of fNIRS and its current clinical applications, the limitations toward more widespread clinical usage of fNIRS, and current efforts to improve the temporal and spatial resolution of fNIRS toward robust clinical usage within subjects. Oligochannel fNIRS is adequate for estimating global cerebral function and it has become an important tool in the critical care setting for evaluating cerebral oxygenation and autoregulation in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury. When it comes to a more sophisticated utilization, spatial and temporal resolution becomes critical. Multichannel NIRS has improved the spatial resolution of fNIRS for brain mapping in certain task modalities, such as language mapping. However, averaging and group analysis are currently required, limiting its clinical use for monitoring and real-time event detection in individual subjects. Advances in signal processing have moved fNIRS toward individual clinical use for detecting certain types of seizures, assessing autonomic function and cortical spreading depression. However, its lack of accuracy and precision has been the major obstacle toward more sophisticated clinical use of fNIRS. The use of high-density whole head optode arrays, precise sensor locations relative to the head, anatomical co-registration, short-distance channels, and multi-dimensional signal processing can be combined to improve the sensitivity of fNIRS and increase its use as a wide-spread clinical tool for the robust assessment of brain function.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening neurodegenerative disease and mainly characterized by lack of sufficient dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although current treatments help to alleviate clinical symptoms, effective therapies preventing neuronal loss remain scarce. Tovophyllin A (TA), one of the xanthones extracted from Garcinia mangostana L. (GM), has recently been reported to play a beneficial role in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. In our research, we explored whether TA has protective effects on dopaminergic neurons in PD models. We found that TA significantly reduced apoptotic cell death in primary cortical neurons treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>) or paraquat (PQ) in the in vitro PD model. In an in vivo acute PD model induced by 1-methyl4-phenyl-1,2,3,5-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment, TA also attenuated the resulting behavioral dysfunctions and dopaminergic neuron loss. In the collected brain tissues, TA increased the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β, which may be related to TA-mediated dopaminergic neuronal protective effects. In summary, our results illustrated that TA is a powerful cytoprotective agent for dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP-induced PD model, suggesting TA as a possible therapeutic candidate for PD.</p>

Objectives<p>To investigate the bilateral hippocampal subfield volumetric differences in four types of mild dementia, namely typical Alzheimer’s disease (tAD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), semantic dementia (SD), and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), to assist differential diagnosis.</p>Methods<p>One hundred three participants, including 22 tAD, 34 SD (17 left SD and 17 right SD), 15 DLB, 12 PCA patients, and 20 normal controls (NC), were recruited. All subjects received standard neuropsychological assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented via Freesurfer. The study compared the volumetric differences and used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to estimate the efficacy of each hippocampal subfield to distinguish between groups. Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between memory recall scores and hippocampal subfield volumes.</p>Results<p>The hippocampal subfield atrophy varied in different groups: tAD, SD, and PCA patients had subregional atrophy in bilateral hippocampi compared to NC, and DLB patients showed preserved volumes; left SD patients suffered the most severe atrophy of the left hippocampus, and right SD patients were atrophied mostly in the right hippocampus. There was no significant difference in the volume of hippocampal subregions between tAD and PCA subjects, but the former tended to be atrophied more asymmetrically. ROC analysis showed that, for discrimination, the areas under the curve (AUC) of some subfields were larger than the total hippocampus, but none observed significant difference. In addition, immediate recall scores were correlated to left CA1, CA2/3, CA4/DG, subiculum, and presubiculum (p &lt; 0.05), and delayed recall scores were strongly related to bilateral CA2/3, CA4/DG, subiculum, and presubiculum (r = 0.38–0.52, p &lt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>Differential atrophy patterns in the bilateral hippocampal subfield volumes could serve the differential diagnosis in patients with different causes of mild dementia: left CA1 for tAD; left presubiculum for LSD; right CA4/DG, right presubiculum, and right subiculum for RSD; CA4/DG and right CA2/3 for DLB; right CA2/3 and right CA4/DG for PCA. Additionally, several hippocampal subfield volumes were significantly associated with memory scores, further highlighting the essential role of the hippocampus in memory decline.</p>

<p>Cyclooxygenases (COX) are enzymes catalyzing arachidonic acid into prostanoids. COX exists in three isoforms: COX-1, 2, and 3. COX-1 and COX-2 have been widely studied in order to explore and understand their involvement in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neuroinflammatory dementia. COX-2 was traditionally viewed to be expressed only under pathological conditions and to have detrimental effects in AD pathophysiology and neurodegeneration. However, an increasing number of reports point to much more complex roles of COX-2 in AD. Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been considered as a hub which integrates multiple signaling cascades, some of which are also involved in AD progression. COX-2 and mTOR are both involved in environmental sensing, growth, and metabolic processes of the cell. They are also known to act in cooperation in many different cancers and thus, their role together in normal cellular functions as well as AD has been explored in this review. Some of the therapeutic approaches targeting COX-2 and mTOR in AD and cancer are also discussed.</p>

<p>The interaction between brain damage and motor function is not yet fully understood in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Therefore, a semi-quantitative MRI (sqMRI) scale was used to explore whether identified brain lesions related to functional abilities and gait pathology in this population. A retrospective cohort of ambulatory children with spastic CP was selected [N = 104; 52 bilateral (bCP) and 52 unilateral (uCP)]. Extent and location-specific scores were defined according to the sqMRI scale guidelines. The gross motor function classification system (GMFCS), the gait profile score (GPS), GPSs per motion plane, gait variable scores (GVS) and multiple-joint (MJ) gait patterns were related to brain lesion scores. In all groups, the global total brain scores correlated to the GPS (total: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.404, p ≤ 0.001; bCP: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.335, p ≤ 0.05; uCP: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.493, p ≤ 0.001). The global total hemispheric scores correlated to the GMFCS (total: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.392, p ≤ 0.001; bCP: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.316, p ≤ 0.05; uCP: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.331, p ≤ 0.05). The laterality scores of the hemispheres in the total group correlated negatively to the GMFCS level (r<sub>s</sub> = −0.523, p ≤ 0.001) and the GVS-knee sagittal (r<sub>s</sub> = −0.311, p ≤ 0.01). Lesion location, for the total group demonstrated positive correlations between parietal lobe involvement and the GPS (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.321, p ≤ 0.001) and between periventricular layer damage and the GMFCS (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.348, p ≤ 0.001). Involvement of the anterior part of the corpus callosum (CC) was associated with the GVS-hip sagittal in all groups (total: r<sub>pb</sub> = 0.495, p ≤ 0.001; bCP: r<sub>pb</sub> = 0.357, p ≤ 0.05; uCP: r<sub>pb</sub> = 0.641, p ≤ 0.001). The global total hemispheric and laterality of the hemispheres scores differentiated between the minor and both the extension (p ≤ 0.001 and p ≤ 0.001) and flexion (p = 0.016 and p = 0.013, respectively) MJ patterns in the total group. Maximal periventricular involvement and CC intactness were associated with extension patterns (p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.001, respectively). Current findings demonstrated relationships between brain structure and motor function as well as pathological gait, in this cohort of children with CP. These results might facilitate the timely identification of gait pathology and, ultimately, guide individualized treatment planning of gait impairments in children with CP.</p>

<p>The magnocellular system has been implicated in the rapid processing of facial emotions, such as fear. Of the various anatomical possibilities, the retino-colliculo-pulvinar route to the amygdala is currently favored. However, it is not clear whether and when amygdala arousal activates the primary visual cortex (V1). Non-linear visual evoked potentials provide a well-accepted technique for examining temporal processing in the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in the visual cortex. Here, we investigated the relationship between facial emotion processing and the separable magnocellular (K2.1) and parvocellular (K2.2) components of the second-order non-linear multifocal visual evoked potential responses recorded from the occipital scalp (O<sub>Z</sub>). Stimuli comprised pseudorandom brightening/darkening of fearful, happy, neutral faces (or no face) with surround patches decorrelated from the central face-bearing patch. For the central patch, the spatial contrast of the faces was 30% while the modulation of the per-pixel brightening/darkening was uniformly 10% or 70%. From 14 neurotypical young adults, we found a significant interaction between emotion and contrast in the magnocellularly driven K2.1 peak amplitudes, with greater K2.1 amplitudes for fearful (vs. happy) faces at 70% temporal contrast condition. Taken together, our findings suggest that facial emotional information is present in early V1 processing as conveyed by the M pathway, and more activated for fearful as opposed to happy and neutral faces. An explanation is offered in terms of the contest between feedback and response gain modulation models.</p>

<p>Various methods have been employed to investigate different aspects of brain activity modulation related to the performance of a cycling task. In our study, we examined how functional connectivity and brain network efficiency varied during an endurance cycling task. For this purpose, we reconstructed EEG signals at source level: we computed current densities in 28 anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) through the eLORETA algorithm, and then we calculated the lagged coherence of the 28 current density signals to define the adjacency matrix. To quantify changes of functional network efficiency during an exhaustive cycling task, we computed three graph theoretical indices: local efficiency (LE), global efficiency (GE), and density (D) in two different frequency bands, Alpha and Beta bands, that indicate alertness processes and motor binding/fatigue, respectively. LE is a measure of functional segregation that quantifies the ability of a network to exchange information locally. GE is a measure of functional integration that quantifies the ability of a network to exchange information globally. D is a global measure of connectivity that describes the extent of connectivity in a network. This analysis was conducted for six different task intervals: pre-cycling; initial, intermediate, and final stages of cycling; and active recovery and passive recovery. Fourteen participants performed an incremental cycling task with simultaneous EEG recording and rated perceived exertion monitoring to detect the participants’ exhaustion. LE remained constant during the endurance cycling task in both bands. Therefore, we speculate that fatigue processes did not affect the segregated neural processing. We observed an increase of GE in the Alpha band only during cycling, which could be due to greater alertness processes and preparedness to stimuli during exercise. Conversely, although D did not change significantly over time in the Alpha band, its general reduction in the Beta bands during cycling could be interpreted within the framework of the neural efficiency hypothesis, which posits a reduced neural activity for expert/automated performances. We argue that the use of graph theoretical indices represents a clear methodological advancement in studying endurance performance.</p>

<p>Background and Aims: Cognitive impairment is one of the major complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and is closely associated with neuroinflammation. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect and reduce cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases, but its effects in SAH have been little studied. This study aimed to investigate the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on cognitive impairment after SAH and the possible underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Methods: Forty-eight male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: a sham group, a SAH group, and a SAH + NaHS (an H<sub>2</sub>S donor) group. The endovascular perforation technique was used to establish the experimental SAH model. NaHS was administered intraperitoneally. An active avoidance test (AAT) was performed to investigate cognitive function. The expression of TNF-α, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and NF-κB p65 in the hippocampus was measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The types of cells expressing TNF-α were detected by double immunofluorescence staining.</p><p>Results: Compared to that in the sham group, the learning and memory ability of rats in the SAH group was damaged. Furthermore, the expression of TNF-α, TLR4, and NF-κB p65 in the hippocampus was elevated in the SAH group (p &lt; 0.05). TNF-α was mainly expressed in activated microglia, which was consistent with the expression of TLR4. Treatment with NaHS significantly decreased the cognitive impairment of rats after SAH and simultaneously reduced the expression of TNF-α, TLR4, and NF-κB p65 and alleviated the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusions: The neuroinflammation reaction in microglia contributes to cognitive impairment after SAH. H<sub>2</sub>S reduced the cognitive impairment of rats after SAH by ameliorating neuroinflammation in microglia, potentially via the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.</p>

<p>A recurrent and devastating feature of addiction to a drug of abuse is its persistence, which is mediated by maladaptive long-term memories of the highly pleasurable experience initially associated with the consumption of the drug. We have recently found that members of the CPEB family of proteins (Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element-Binding Proteins) are involved in the maintenance of spatial memory. However, their possible role in the maintenance of memories that sustain addictive behavior has yet to be explored. Little is known about any of the mechanisms for maintaining memories for addictive behavior. To address the mechanisms whereby addictive behavior is maintained over time, we utilized a conditional transgenic mouse model expressing a dominant-negative version of CPEB1 that abolishes the activity in the forebrain of two of the four CPEB isoforms (CPEB1 and CPEB3). We found that, following cocaine administration, these dominant-negative (DN) CPEB mice showed a significant decrease, when compared to wild type (WT) mice, in both locomotor sensitizations and conditioned place preference (CPP), two indices of addictive behavior. Supporting these behavioral results, we also found a difference between WT and DN-CPEB1-3 mice in the cocaine-induced synaptic depression in the core of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc). Finally, we found that (1) CPEB is reduced in transgenic mice following cocaine injections and that (2) FosB, known for its contribution to establishing the addictive phenotype, when its expression in the striatum is increased by drug administration, is a novel target of CPEBs molecules. Thus, our study highlights how CPEB1 and CPEB3 act on target mRNAs to build the neuroadaptative implicit memory responses that lead to the development of the cocaine addictive phenotypes in mammals.</p>

<p>Parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons play a pivotal role in cognition and are known to be regulated developmentally and by ovarian hormones. The onset of puberty represents the end of a period of optimal learning when impairments in synaptic plasticity are observed in the CA1 hippocampus of female mice. Therefore, we tested whether the synaptic inhibitory current generated by PV+ interneurons is increased at puberty and contributes to these deficits in synaptic plasticity. To this end, the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) was recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques from CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampal slice before (PND 28–32) and after the onset of puberty in female mice (~PND 35–44, assessed by vaginal opening). sIPSC frequency and amplitude were significantly increased at puberty, but these measures were reduced by 1 μM DAMGO [1 μM, (D-Ala<sup>2</sup>, N-MePhe<sup>4</sup>, Gly-ol)-enkephalin], which silences PV+ activity via μ-opioid receptor targets. At puberty, dendritic branching of PV+ interneurons in GAD67-GFP mice was increased, while expression of the δ subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABAR) on these interneurons decreased. Both frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs were significantly increased in pre-pubertal mice with reduced δ expression, suggesting a possible mechanism. Theta burst induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), an in vitro model of learning, is impaired at puberty but was restored to optimal levels by DAMGO administration, implicating inhibition via PV+ interneurons as one cause. Administration of the neurosteroid/stress steroid THP (30 nM, 3α-OH, 5α-pregnan-20-one) had no effect on sIPSCs. These findings suggest that phasic inhibition generated by PV+ interneurons is increased at puberty when it contributes to impairments in synaptic plasticity. These results may have relevance for the changes in cognitive function reported during early adolescence.</p>

<p>Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a breathing disorder associated with cognitive impairment. However, the mechanisms leading to cognitive deficits in OSAHS remain uncertain. In this study, a mouse model of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) exposures were applied for simulating the deoxygenation-reoxygenation events occurring in OSAHS. The conventional adenosine A1 receptor gene (A1R) knockout mice and the A1R agonist CCPA- or antagonist DPCPX-administrated mice were utilized to determine the precise function of A1R signaling in the process of OSAHS-relevant cognitive impairment. We demonstrated that CIH induced morphological changes and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. Further, CIH blunted hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and resulted in learning/memory impairment. Disruption of adenosine A1R exacerbated morphological, cellular, and functional damage induced by CIH. In contrast, activation of adenosine A1R signaling reduced morphological changes and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, promoted LTP, and enhanced learning and memory. A1Rs may up-regulate protein kinase C (PKC) and its subtype PKC-ζ through the activation of Gα(i) improve spatial learning and memory disorder induced by CIH in mice. Taken together, A1R signaling plays a neuroprotective role in CIH-induced cognitive dysfunction and pathological changes in the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder causing neurosensory hearing loss and blindness from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Adaptive techniques such as braille, digital and optical magnifiers, mobility training, cochlear implants, or other assistive listening devices are indispensable for reducing disability. However, there is currently no treatment to reduce or arrest sensory cell degeneration. There are several classes of treatments for Usher syndrome being investigated. The present article reviews the progress this research has made towards delivering commercial options for patients with Usher syndrome.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-like dementia and pathology. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays a key role in the development of cognitive impairment in T2DM. Zonisamide (ZNS) was found to suppress ERS-induced neuronal cell damage in the experimental models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the protective effect of Zonisamide in the treatment of diabetes-related dementia is not determined. Here, we studied whether ZNS can attenuate cognitive impairments in T2DM mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) and received one intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to develop T2DM. After the 9-week diet, the mice were orally gavaged with ZNS or vehicle for 16 consecutive weeks. We found that ZNS improved spatial learning and memory ability and slightly attenuated hyperglycemia. In addition, the expression levels of synaptic-related proteins, such as postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin, were increased along with the activation of the cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) protein and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) both in the hippocampus and cortex of T2DM mice. Meanwhile, ZNS attenuated Aβ deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser-396/404, and also decreased the activity of Tau upstream kinases including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, ZNS also decreased the ERS hallmark protein levels. These data suggest that ZNS can efficiently prevent cognitive impairment and improve AD-like pathologies by attenuating ERS in T2DM mice.</p>

Mutations in <i>KCNC3</i>, which encodes the Kv3.3 K<sup>+</sup> channel, cause spinocerebellar ataxia 13 (SCA13). SCA13 exists in distinct forms with onset in infancy or adulthood. Using zebrafish, we tested the hypothesis that infant- and adult-onset mutations differentially affect the excitability and viability of Purkinje cells in vivo during cerebellar development. An infant-onset mutation dramatically and transiently increased Purkinje cell excitability, stunted process extension, impaired dendritic branching and synaptogenesis, and caused rapid cell death during cerebellar development. Reducing excitability increased early Purkinje cell survival. In contrast, an adult-onset mutation did not significantly alter basal tonic firing in Purkinje cells, but reduced excitability during evoked high frequency spiking. Purkinje cells expressing the adult-onset mutation matured normally and did not degenerate during cerebellar development. Our results suggest that differential changes in the excitability of cerebellar neurons contribute to the distinct ages of onset and timing of cerebellar degeneration in infant- and adult-onset SCA13.

Directly modulating the choice between homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) - two independent pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) - has the potential to improve the efficiency of gene targeting by CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we have developed a rapid and easy-to-score screening approach for identifying small molecules that affect the choice between the two DSB repair pathways. Using this tool, we identified a small molecule, farrerol, that promotes HR but does not affect NHEJ. Further mechanistic studies indicate that farrerol functions through stimulating the recruitment of RAD51 to DSB sites. Importantly, we demonstrated that farrerol effectively promotes precise targeted integration in human cells, mouse cells and mouse embryos at multiple genomic loci. In addition, treating cells with farrerol did not have any obvious negative effect on genomic stability. Moreover, farrerol significantly improved the knock-in efficiency in blastocysts, and the subsequently generated knock-in mice retained the capacity for germline transmission.

<p>by Dmytro Guzenko, Stephen K. Burley, Jose M. Duarte</p>

Detection of protein structure similarity is a central challenge in structural bioinformatics. Comparisons are usually performed at the polypeptide chain level, however the functional form of a protein within the cell is often an oligomer. This fact, together with recent growth of oligomeric structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), demands more efficient approaches to oligomeric assembly alignment/retrieval. Traditional methods use atom level information, which can be complicated by the presence of topological permutations within a polypeptide chain and/or subunit rearrangements. These challenges can be overcome by comparing electron density volumes directly. But, brute force alignment of 3D data is a compute intensive search problem. We developed a 3D Zernike moment normalization procedure to orient electron density volumes and assess similarity with unprecedented speed. Similarity searching with this approach enables real-time retrieval of proteins/protein assemblies resembling a target, from PDB or user input, together with resulting alignments (http://shape.rcsb.org).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9tGqaCG0_ig" width="1" />

<p>We engrafted RFP‐expressing astrocytes differentiated from hiPSCs into the cortex of immunodeficient mice neonatally. Nine months post engraftment, the human astrocytes in the superficial cortex developed into interlaminar astrocytes that mimicked the interlaminar astrocytes architecture of the adult human cortex. This chimeric mouse model will enable the study of human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in vivo.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes, a highly heterogeneous population of glial cells, serve as essential regulators of brain development and homeostasis. The heterogeneity of astrocyte populations underlies the diversity in their functions. In addition to the typical mammalian astrocyte architecture, the cerebral cortex of humans exhibits a radial distribution of interlaminar astrocytes in the supragranular layers. These primate‐specific interlaminar astrocytes are located in the superficial layer and project long processes traversing multiple layers of the cerebral cortex. However, due to the lack of accessible experimental models, their functional properties and their role in regulating neuronal circuits remain unclear. Here we modeled human interlaminar astrocytes in humanized glial chimeric mice by engrafting astrocytes differentiated from human‐induced pluripotent stem cells into the mouse cortex. This model provides a novel platform for understanding neuron‐glial interaction and its alterations in neurological diseases.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study addresses an important problem in neurology, distinguishing tremor and ataxia using quantitative methods. Specifically, we aimed to quantitatively separate dysmetria, a cardinal sign of ataxia, from tremor in essential tremor (ET).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In Experiment 1, we compared 19 participants diagnosed with ET undergoing thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS; ET<sub>DBS</sub>) to 19 healthy controls (HC). We quantified tremor during postural tasks using accelerometry and dysmetria with fast, reverse‐at‐target goal‐directed movements. To ensure that endpoint accuracy was unaffected by tremor, we quantified dysmetria in selected trials manifesting a smooth trajectory to the endpoint. Finally, we manipulated tremor amplitude by switching DBS ON and OFF to examine its effect on dysmetria. In Experiment 2, we compared 10 ET participants with 10 HC to determine whether we could identify and distinguish dysmetria from tremor in non‐DBS ET.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three findings suggest that we can quantify dysmetria independently of tremor in ET. First, ET<sub>DBS</sub> and ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC and dysmetria did not correlate with tremor (<i>R </i>
<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.01). Second, even for trials with tremor‐free trajectories to the target, ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC (<i>p &lt; </i> 0.01). Third, activating DBS reduced tremor (<i>p &lt; </i> 0.01) but had no effect on dysmetria (<i>p &gt; </i> 0.2).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We demonstrate that dysmetria can be quantified independently of tremor using fast, reverse‐at‐target goal‐directed movements. These results have important implications for the understanding of ET and other cerebellar and tremor disorders. Future research should examine the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying each symptom and characterize their independent contribution to disability. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Generating numbers has become an almost inevitable task associated studies of the morphology of the nervous system. Numbers serve a desire for clarity and objectivity in the presentation of results and are a prerequisite for the statistical evaluation of experimental outcomes. Clarity, objectivity and statistics make demands on the quality of the numbers that are not met by many methods. This review provides a refresher of problems associated with generating numbers that describe the nervous system in terms of the volumes, surfaces, lengths and numbers of its components. An important aim is to provide comprehensible descriptions of the methods that address these problems. Collectively known as design‐based stereology, these methods share two features critical to their application. First, they are firmly based in mathematics and its proofs. Second and critically underemphasized, an understanding of their mathematical background is not necessary for their informed and productive application. Understanding and applying estimators of volume, surface, length or number does not require more of an organizational mastermind than an immunohistochemical protocol. And when it comes to calculations, square roots are the gravest challenges to overcome. Sampling strategies that are combined with stereological probes are efficient and allow a rational assessment if the numbers that have been generated are “good enough”. Much may be unfamiliar, but very little is difficult. These methods can no longer be scapegoats for discrepant results but faithfully produce numbers on the material that is assessed. They also faithfully reflect problems that associated with the histological material and the anatomically informed decisions needed to generate numbers that are not only valid in theory. It is within reach to generate practically useful numbers that must integrate with qualitative knowledge to understand the function of neural systems.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dysregulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is often linked to the neurobiology of depression, though the presence and type of this dysregulation is not a consistent finding. Meanwhile, significant sex differences exist regarding depression and the HPA axis. Animal models of depression simulate certain aspects of the human disease and aim to advance our knowledge regarding its neurobiology and discover new antidepressant treatments. Most animal models of depression induce a depressive‐like phenotype taking advantage of stressful experimental conditions, that also increase corticosterone, the main stress hormone in rodents. In this review we present inconsistent results in male and female rodents regarding the interaction between the depressive‐like behavioral phenotype and corticosterone. In commonly used models, the female depressive‐like phenotype in rodents seems significantly less dependent on the stress hormone corticosterone, whereas the male behavioral response is more evident and associates with variations of corticosterone. Further research and clarification of this sex‐dependent interaction will have significant ramifications on the improvement of the validity of animal models of depression.</p>

<p>The human cingulate cortex (CC), included in the paralimbic cortex, participates in emotion, visceral responses, attention, cognition, and social behaviors. The CC has spindle-shaped/fusiform cell body neurons in its layer V, the von Economo neurons (VENs). VENs have further developed in primates, and the characterization of human VENs can benefit from the detailed descriptions of the shape of dendrites and spines. Here, we advance this issue and studied VENs in the anterior and midcingulate cortex from four neurologically normal adult subjects. We used the thionin technique and the adapted “single-section” Golgi method for light microscopy. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were carried out for the visualization of Golgi-impregnated VENs’ cell body, ascending and descending dendrites, and collateral branches. We also looked for the presence, density, and shape of spines from proximal to distal dendrites. These neurons have a similar aspect for the soma, but features of spiny dendrites evidenced a morphological heterogeneity of CC VENs. Only for the description of this continuum of shapes, we labeled the most common feature as VEN 1, which has main dendritic shafts but few branches and sparse spines. VEN 2 shows an intermediate aspect, whereas VEN 3 displays the most profuse dendritic ramification and more spines with varied shapes from proximal to distal branches. Morphometric data exemplify the dendritic features of these cells. The heterogeneity of the dendritic architecture and spines suggests additional functional implications for the synaptic and information processing in VENs in integrated networks of normal and, possibly, neurological/psychiatric conditions involving the human CC.</p>

<p>Yoga is becoming increasingly popular worldwide, with several implicated physical and mental benefits. Here we provide a comprehensive and critical review of the research generated from the existing neuroimaging literature in studies of yoga practitioners. We reviewed 34 international peer-reviewed neuroimaging studies of yoga using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT): 11 morphological and 26 functional studies, including three studies that were classified as both morphological and functional. Consistent findings include increased gray matter volume in the insula and hippocampus, increased activation of prefrontal cortical regions, and functional connectivity changes mainly within the default mode network. There is quite some variability in the neuroimaging findings that partially reflects different yoga styles and approaches, as well as sample size limitations. Direct comparator groups such as physical activity are scarcely used so far. Finally, hypotheses on the underlying neurobiology derived from the imaging findings are discussed in the light of the potential beneficial effects of yoga.</p>

<p>Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) instigate an autosomal dominant form of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite the neuropathological heterogeneity observed in LRRK2-PD, accumulating evidence suggests that alpha-synuclein and tau pathology are observed in a vast majority of cases. Intriguingly, the presence of protein aggregates spans both LRRK2-PD and idiopathic disease, supportive of a common pathologic mechanism. Thus, it is important to consider how LRRK2 mutations give rise to such pathology, and whether targeting LRRK2 might modify the accumulation, transmission, or toxicity of protein aggregates. Likewise, it is not clear how LRRK2 mutations drive PD pathogenesis, and whether protein aggregates are implicated in LRRK2-dependent neurodegeneration. While animal models have been instrumental in furthering our understanding of a potential interaction between LRRK2 and protein aggregation, the biology is far from clear. We aim to provide a thoughtful overview of the evidence linking LRRK2 to protein aggregation in animal models.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) comprise a broad range of progressive neurological disorders with multifactorial etiology contributing to disease pathophysiology. Evidence of the microbiome involvement in the gut-brain axis urges the interest in understanding metabolic interactions between the microbiota and host physiology in NDDs. Systems Biology offers a holistic integrative approach to study the interplay between the different biologic systems as part of a whole, and may elucidate the host–microbiome interactions in NDDs. We reviewed direct and indirect pathways through which the microbiota can modulate the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis, and explored the evidence of microbial dysbiosis in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. As the gut microbiota being strongly affected by diet, the potential approaches to targeting the human microbiota through diet for the stimulation of neuroprotective microbial-metabolites secretion were described. We explored the potential of Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to infer microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions and to identify the microbiome contribution to disease development or prevention. Finally, a systemic approach based on GEMs and ‘omics integration, that would allow the design of sustainable personalized anti-inflammatory diets in NDDs prevention, through the modulation of gut microbiota was described.</p>

<p>Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent chromosomal abnormality that causes intellectual disability, resulting from the presence of an extra complete or segment of chromosome 21 (HSA21). In addition, trisomy of HSA21 contributes to altered energy metabolism that appears to be a strong determinant in the development of pathological phenotypes associated with DS. Alterations include, among others, mitochondrial defects, increased oxidative stress levels, impaired glucose, and lipid metabolism, finally resulting in reduced energy production and cellular dysfunctions. These molecular defects seem to account for a high incidence of metabolic disorders, i.e., diabetes and/or obesity, as well as a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in DS. A dysregulation of the insulin signaling with reduced downstream pathways represents a common pathophysiological aspect in the development of both peripheral and central alterations leading to diabetes/obesity and AD. This is further strengthened by evidence showing that the molecular mechanisms responsible for such alterations appear to be similar between peripheral organs and brain. Considering that DS subjects are at high risk to develop either peripheral or brain metabolic defects, this review will discuss current knowledge about the link between trisomy of HSA21 and defects of insulin and insulin-related pathways in DS. Drawing the molecular signature underlying these processes in DS is a key challenge to identify novel drug targets and set up new prevention strategies aimed to reduce the impact of metabolic disorders and cognitive decline.</p>

Background<p>The primary motor cortex (M1) is a critical node in Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related motor circuitry; however, the functional roles of its subregions are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated changes in the functional connectivity patterns of M1 subregions and their relationships to improved clinical symptoms following levodopa administration.</p>Methods<p>Thirty-six PD patients and 37 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. A formal levodopa challenge test was conducted in the PD group, and the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS-III) was assessed before (off state) and 1 h after administration of levodopa (on state). The PD group underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in both off and on states, whereas the HC group was scanned once. We used the Human Brainnetome Atlas template to subdivide M1 into twelve regions of interest (ROIs). Functional connectivity (FC) was compared between PD on and off states [paired t-test, voxel-level p &lt; 0.001, cluster-level p &lt; 0.05, Gaussian random field (GRF) correction] and between patients and HC (two-sample t-test voxel-level p &lt; 0.001, cluster-level p &lt; 0.05). Correlations between ΔFC (differences in FC between PD off and on states) and clinical symptom improvements were examined.</p>Results<p>There was decreased FC between the right caudal dorsolateral area 6 and the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), the right upper limb region and the left medial dorsal thalamus (mdTHA), as well as increased FC between the left tongue and larynx region and the left medial frontal gyrus. ΔFC between the right caudal dorsolateral area 6 and ACC was positively correlated with improvements in UPDRS-III total scores as well as the rigidity (item 22) and bradykinesia (items 23–26 and 31) subscores. ΔFC between the right upper limb region and left thalamus was positively correlated with improvements in the left upper limb tremor (items 20c and 21b) and postural tremor (item 21b) subscores.</p>Conclusions<p>Our results reveal novel information regarding the underlying mechanisms in the motor circuits in the M1 and a promising way to explore the internal function of the M1 in PD patients. Notably, M1 is a potential therapeutic target in PD, and the exploration of its subregions provides a basis and a source of new insights for clinical intervention and precise drug treatment.</p>

<p>Ross syndrome (RS) is a rare peripheral autonomic system disorder characterized by tonic pupil, hyporeflexia, and segmental anhidrosis. Neuropathological studies show that RS results from the selective cholinergic nerve degeneration. However, the cause and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show α-synuclein accumulation in the autonomic nerve terminals in the lesser curvature of stomach of patients with RS. In addition, immunohistochemical findings demonstrate that a dominant degeneration of cholinergic fibers is exhibited in patients with RS, while main degeneration of adrenergic fibers is demonstrated in patients with pure autonomic failure in their gastrointestinal and urinary system. Our study suggests that RS belongs to α-synucleinopathies. Moreover, our findings indicate that adrenergic nerves and cholinergic nerves are not equally damaged in different types of pure autonomic dysfunctions.</p>

<p>With the rapid development of machine learning techniques, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is becoming increasingly popular in the field of neuroimaging data analysis. Several software packages have been developed to facilitate its application in neuroimaging studies. As most of these software packages are based on command lines, researchers are required to learn how to program, which has greatly limited the use of MVPA for researchers without programming skills. Moreover, lacking a graphical user interface (GUI) also hinders the standardization of the application of MVPA in neuroimaging studies and, consequently, the replication of previous studies or comparisons of results between different studies. Therefore, we developed a GUI-based toolkit for MVPA of neuroimaging data: MVPANI (MVPA for Neuroimaging). Compared with other existing software packages, MVPANI has several advantages. First, MVPANI has a GUI and is, thus, more friendly for non-programmers. Second, MVPANI offers a variety of machine learning algorithms with the flexibility of parameter modification so that researchers can test different algorithms and tune parameters to identify the most suitable algorithms and parameters for their own data. Third, MVPANI also offers the function of data fusion at two levels (feature level or decision level) to utilize complementary information contained in different measures obtained from multimodal neuroimaging techniques. In this paper, we introduce this toolkit and provide four examples to demonstrate its usage, including (1) classification between patients and controls, (2) identification of brain areas containing discriminating information, (3) prediction of clinical scores, and (4) multimodal data fusion.</p>

<p>Characterization of cortical activation patterns during movement of the upper extremity in healthy adults is helpful in understanding recovery mechanisms following neurological disorders. This study explores cortical activation patterns associated with movements of the shoulder and fingers in healthy adults using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twelve healthy right-handed participants were recruited. Two motor tasks (shoulder abduction and finger extension) with two different trial lengths (10 s and 20 s) were performed in a sitting position at a rate of 0.5 Hz. The hemodynamic response, as indicated by oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR), over both hemispheres was acquired using a 54-channel fNIRS system. We found a generalized bilateral cortical activation during both motor tasks with greater activation in the contralateral compared to the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. Particularly in the more medial part of the contralateral hemisphere, significant higher activation was found during the shoulder compared to finger movements. Furthermore, cortical activation patterns are affected not only by motor tasks but also by trial lengths. HbO is more sensitive to detect cortical activation during finger movements in longer trials, while HbR is a better surrogate to capture active areas during shoulder movement in shorter trials. Based on these findings, reporting both HbO and HbR is strongly recommended for future fNIRS studies, and trial lengths should be taken into account when designing experiments and explaining results. Our findings demonstrating distinct cortical activation patterns associated with shoulder and finger movements in healthy adults provide a foundation for future research to study recovery mechanisms following neurological disorders.</p>

<p>The frequency-following response (FFR) is an auditory evoked potential (AEP) that follows the periodic characteristics of a sound. Despite being a widely studied biosignal in auditory neuroscience, the neural underpinnings of the FFR are still unclear. Traditionally, FFR was associated with subcortical activity, but recent evidence suggested cortical contributions which may be dependent on the stimulus frequency. We combined electroencephalography (EEG) with an inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol, the continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), to disentangle the cortical contribution to the FFR elicited to stimuli of high and low frequency. We recorded FFR to the syllable /ba/ at two fundamental frequencies (Low: 113 Hz; High: 317 Hz) in healthy participants. FFR, cortical potentials, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) were recorded before and after real and sham cTBS in the right primary auditory cortex. Results showed that cTBS did not produce a significant change in the FFR recorded, in any of the frequencies. No effect was observed in the ABR and cortical potentials, despite the latter known contributions from the auditory cortex. Possible reasons behind the negative results include compensatory mechanisms from the non-targeted areas, intraindividual variability of the cTBS effectiveness, and the particular location of our target area, the primary auditory cortex.</p>

<p>Knowledge of oscillatory entrainment and its fundamental role in cognitive and behavioral processing has increasingly been applied to research in the field of reading and developmental dyslexia. Growing evidence indicates that oscillatory entrainment to theta frequency spoken language in the auditory domain, along with cross-frequency theta-gamma coupling, support phonological processing (i.e., cognitive encoding of linguistic knowledge gathered from speech) which is required for reading. This theory is called the temporal sampling framework (TSF) and can extend to developmental dyslexia, such that inadequate temporal sampling of speech-sounds in people with dyslexia results in poor theta oscillatory entrainment in the auditory domain, and thus a phonological processing deficit which hinders reading ability. We suggest that inadequate theta oscillations in the visual domain might account for the many magno-dorsal processing, oculomotor control and visual deficits seen in developmental dyslexia. We propose two possible models of a magno-dorsal visual correlate to the auditory TSF: (1) A direct correlate that involves “bottom-up” magnocellular oscillatory entrainment of the visual domain that occurs when magnocellular populations phase lock to theta frequency fixations during reading and (2) an inverse correlate whereby attending to text triggers “top-down” low gamma signals from higher-order visual processing areas, thereby organizing magnocellular populations to synchronize to a theta frequency to drive the temporal control of oculomotor movements and capturing of letter images at a higher frequency.</p>

<p>The storage of temporally precise spike patterns can be realized by a single neuron. A spiking neural network (SNN) model is utilized to demonstrate the ability to precisely recall a spike pattern after presenting a single input. We show by using a simulation study that the temporal properties of input patterns can be transformed into spatial patterns of local dendritic spikes. The localization of time-points of spikes is facilitated by phase-shift of the subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (SMO) in the dendritic branches, which modifies their excitability. In reference to the points in time of the arriving input, the dendritic spikes are triggered in different branches. To store spatially distributed patterns, two unsupervised learning mechanisms are utilized. Either synaptic weights to the branches, spatial representation of the temporal input pattern, are enhanced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) or the oscillation power of SMOs in spiking branches is increased by dendritic spikes. For retrieval, spike bursts activate stored spatiotemporal patterns in dendritic branches, which reactivate the original somatic spike patterns. The simulation of the prototypical model demonstrates the principle, how linking time to space enables the storage of temporal features of an input. Plausibility, advantages, and some variations of the proposed model are also discussed.</p>

In 2008, we reported the clinical features of a novel de novo seven-octapeptide repeat insertion (7-OPRI) mutation coupled with codon 129 methionine (M) homozygosity in the PrP gene of a 19-year-old man presenting with psychosis and atypical dementia, and 16-year survival. Here, we describe the histopathological and PrP molecular properties in the autopsied brain of this patient. Histopathological examination revealed widespread brain atrophy, focal spongiform degeneration (SD), cortical PrP plaques, and elongated PrP formations in the cerebellum. Overall, these histopathological features resemble those described in a Belgian pedigree with 7-OPRI mutation except for the presence of PrP plaques in our case, which are morphologically different from the multicore plaques described in some OPRI mutations and in Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. The comparative characterization of the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble PrP in our patient and in sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) revealed distinct molecular signatures. Proteinase K digestion of the pathogenic, disease-associated PrP (PrP<sup>D</sup>) revealed PrP<sup>D</sup> type 1 in the cerebral cortex and mixed PrP<sup>D</sup> types 1 and 2 in the cerebellum. Altogether, the present study outlines the importance of assessing the phenotypical and PrP biochemical properties of these rare conditions, thereby widening the spectrum of the phenotypic heterogeneity of the 7-OPRI insertion mutations. Further studies are needed to determine whether distinct conformers of PrP<sup>D</sup> are associated with two major clinico-histopathological phenotypes in prion disease with 7-OPRI.</p>

Objective<p>To investigate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with cognitive training for treatment of cognitive symptoms in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A secondary objective was to analyze associations between brain plasticity and cognitive effects of treatment.</p>Methods<p>In this randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter clinical trial, 34 patients with AD were assigned to three experimental groups receiving 30 daily sessions of combinatory intervention. Participants in the real/real group (n = 16) received 10 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered separately to each of six cortical regions, interleaved with computerized cognitive training. Participants in the sham rTMS group (n = 18) received sham rTMS combined with either real (sham/real group, n = 10) or sham (sham/sham group, n = 8) cognitive training. Effects of treatment on neuropsychological (primary outcome) and neurophysiological function were compared between the 3 treatment groups. These, as well as imaging measures of brain atrophy, were compared at baseline to 14 healthy controls (HC).</p>Results<p>At baseline, patients with AD had worse cognition, cerebral atrophy, and TMS measures of cortico-motor reactivity, excitability, and plasticity than HC. The real/real group showed significant cognitive improvement compared to the sham/sham, but not the real/sham group. TMS-induced plasticity at baseline was predictive of post-intervention changes in cognition, and was modified across treatment, in association with changes of cognition.</p>Interpretation<p>Combined rTMS and cognitive training may improve the cognitive status of AD patients, with TMS-induced cortical plasticity at baseline serving as predictor of therapeutic outcome for this intervention, and potential mechanism of action.</p>Clinical Trial Registration<p>www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01504958.</p>

C1ql3 protein and its receptor Bai3 are involved in synaptic organization and function. In this issue of Neuron, Wang et al. (2020) report that both are essential for synaptic function between the anterior olfactory nucleus and the olfactory bulb and for the generation, but not recall, of associative olfactory memories determining food preference in mice.

In this issue of Neuron, Orr et al.

Past this tipping point, disease onset progresses rapidly.

Lists of species underpin many fields of human endeavour, but there are currently no universally accepted principles for deciding which biological species should be accepted when there are alternative taxonomic treatments (and, by extension, which scientific names should be applied to those species). As improvements in information technology make it easier to communicate, access, and aggregate biodiversity information, there is a need for a framework that helps taxonomists and the users of taxonomy decide which taxa and names should be used by society whilst continuing to encourage taxonomic research that leads to new species discoveries, new knowledge of species relationships, and the refinement of existing species concepts. Here, we present 10 principles that can underpin such a governance framework, namely (i) the species list must be based on science and free from nontaxonomic considerations and interference, (ii) governance of the species list must aim for community support and use, (iii) all decisions about list composition must be transparent, (iv) the governance of validated lists of species is separate from the governance of the names of taxa, (v) governance of lists of accepted species must not constrain academic freedom, (vi) the set of criteria considered sufficient to recognise species boundaries may appropriately vary between different taxonomic groups but should be consistent when possible, (vii) a global list must balance conflicting needs for currency and stability by having archived versions, (viii) contributors need appropriate recognition, (ix) list content should be traceable, and (x) a global listing process needs both to encompass global diversity and to accommodate local knowledge of that diversity. We conclude by outlining issues that must be resolved if such a system of taxonomic list governance and a unified list of accepted scientific names generated are to be universally adopted.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GAaxDpNEoVM" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglial cells (resident macrophages) feature rapid activation in CNS disease and can acquire multiple phenotypes exerting neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. The functional impact of surveying (“resting”) microglia on neural excitability and neurotransmission in physiology is widely unknown, however. We addressed this issue in male rat hippocampal slice cultures (in situ) by pharmacological microglial ablation within days and by characterizing neuronal gamma‐band oscillations (30–70 Hz) that are highly sensitive to neuromodulators and disturbances in ion and energy regulation. Gamma oscillations support action potential timing and synaptic plasticity, associate with higher brain functions like perception and memory, and require precise communication between excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons. The slice cultures featured well‐preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture and parvalbumin‐positive interneuron networks, microglia with ramified morphology, and low basal levels of IL‐6, TNF‐α, and nitric oxide (NO). Stimulation of slice cultures with the pro‐inflammatory cytokine IFN‐γ or bacterial LPS serving as positive controls for microglial reactivity induced MHC‐II expression and increased cytokine and NO release. Chronic exposure of slice cultures to liposome‐encapsulated clodronate reduced the microglial cell population by about 96%, whereas neuronal structures, astrocyte GFAP expression, and basal levels of cytokines and NO were unchanged. Notably, the properties of gamma oscillations reflecting frequency, number and synchronization of synapse activity were regular after microglial depletion. Also, electrical stimulus‐induced transients of the extracellular potassium concentration ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) reflecting cellular K<sup>+</sup> efflux, clearance and buffering were unchanged. This suggests that nonreactive microglia are dispensable for neuronal homeostasis and neuromodulation underlying network signaling and rhythm generation in cortical tissue.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative condition. The disease involves the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Among late‐onset, familial forms of Parkinson are cases with mutations in the PARK17 locus encoding the vacuolar protein sorting 35 (Vps35), a subunit of the retromer complex. The retromer complex is composed of a heterotrimeric protein core (Vps26‐Vps35‐Vps29). The best‐known role of retromer is the retrieval of cargoes from endosomes to the Golgi complex or the plasma membrane. However, recent literature indicates that retromer performs roles associated with lysosomal and mitochondrial functions and degradative pathways such as autophagy. A common point mutation affecting the retromer subunit Vps35 is D620N, which has been linked to the alterations in the aforementioned cellular processes as well as with neurodegeneration. Here, we review the main aspects of the malfunction of the retromer complex and its implications for PD pathology. Besides, we highlight several controversies still awaiting clarification.</p>

<p>“Stem cell tourism,” the practice of offering unproven cellular preparations to patients as approved therapy, is rising in neurology. Currently, the experiences of patients and reported complications from these procedures are unknown in the US. We evaluate academic neurologists' experiences with stem cell tourism and assess perceived competency on discussing this topic with patients. We found a lack of neurologist preparedness to discuss stem cell therapies with patients and an alarming list of unreported complications from these unregulated procedures. We also identified an urgent need for neurologist education and the creation of a national registry for reporting patient complications resulting from experimental stem cell interventions.</p>

<p>Children localize sounds using binaural cues when navigating everyday auditory environments. While sensitivity to binaural cues reaches maturity by 8–10 years of age, large individual variability has been observed in the just-noticeable-difference (JND) thresholds for interaural time difference (ITD) among children in this age range. To understand the development of binaural sensitivity beyond JND thresholds, the “looking-while-listening” paradigm was adapted in this study to reveal the real-time decision-making behavior during ITD processing. Children ages 8–14 years with normal hearing (NH) and a group of young NH adults were tested. This novel paradigm combined eye gaze tracking with behavioral psychoacoustics to estimate ITD JNDs in a two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task. Results from simultaneous eye gaze recordings during ITD processing suggested that children had adult-like ITD JNDs, but they demonstrated immature decision-making strategies. While the time course of arriving at the initial fixation and final decision in providing a judgment of the ITD direction was similar, children exhibited more uncertainty than adults during decision-making. Specifically, children made more fixation changes, particularly when tested using small ITD magnitudes, between the target and non-target response options prior to finalizing a judgment. These findings suggest that, while children may exhibit adult-like sensitivity to ITDs, their eye gaze behavior reveals that the processing of this binaural cue is still developing through late childhood.</p>

<p>Contrastive analysis has been widely employed in the search for the electrophysiological neural correlates of consciousness. However, despite its clear logic, it has been argued that it may not succeed in isolating neural processes solely involved in the emergence of perceptual awareness. In fact, data from contrastive analysis would be contaminated by potential confounding factors reflecting distinct, though related, processes either preceding or following the conscious perception. At present, the ERP components representing the proper correlates of perceptual awareness still remain to be identified among those correlating with awareness (i.e., Visual Awareness Negativity, VAN and Late Positivity, LP). In order to dissociate visual awareness from post-perceptual confounds specifically related to decision making, we manipulated the response criterion, which affects how a percept is translated into a decision. In particular, while performing an orientation discrimination task, participants were asked to shift their response criterion across sessions. As a consequence, the resulting modulation should concern the ERP component(s) not exclusively reflecting mechanisms regulating the subjective conscious experience itself but rather the processes accompanying it. Electrophysiological results showed that N1 and P3 were sensitive to the response criterion adopted by participants. Additionally, the more the participants shifted their response criterion, the bigger the ERP modulation was; this was consequently indicative of the critical role of these components in the decision-making processes regardless of awareness level. When considering data independently from the response criterion, the aware vs. unaware contrast showed that both VAN and LP were significant. Crucially, the LP component was also modulated by the interaction of awareness and response criterion, while VAN results to be unaffected. In agreement with previous literature, these findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that VAN tracks the emergence of visual awareness by encoding the conscious percept, whereas LP reflects the contribution from post-perceptual processes related to response requirements. This excludes a direct functional role of this later component in giving rise to perceptual awareness.</p>

<p>Being able to replicate real experiments with computational simulations is a unique opportunity to refine and validate models with experimental data and redesign the experiments based on simulations. However, since it is technically demanding to model all components of an experiment, traditional approaches to modeling reduce the experimental setups as much as possible. In this study, our goal is to replicate all the relevant features of an experiment on motor control and motor rehabilitation after stroke. To this aim, we propose an approach that allows continuous integration of new experimental data into a computational modeling framework. First, results show that we could reproduce experimental object displacement with high accuracy via the simulated embodiment in the virtual world by feeding a spinal cord model with experimental registration of the cortical activity. Second, by using computational models of multiple granularities, our preliminary results show the possibility of simulating several features of the brain after stroke, from the local alteration in neuronal activity to long-range connectivity remodeling. Finally, strategies are proposed to merge the two pipelines. We further suggest that additional models could be integrated into the framework thanks to the versatility of the proposed approach, thus allowing many researchers to achieve continuously improved experimental design.</p>

<p>Organisms must constantly adapt to changes in their environment to survive. It is thought that neuromodulators such as serotonin enable sensory neurons to better process input encountered during different behavioral contexts. Here, we investigated how serotonergic innervation affects neural and behavioral responses to behaviorally relevant envelope stimuli in the weakly electric fish species Apteronotus albifrons. Under baseline conditions, we found that exogenous serotonin application within the electrosensory lateral line lobe increased sensory neuron excitability, thereby promoting burst firing. We found that serotonin enhanced the responses to envelope stimuli of pyramidal cells within the lateral segment of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) by increasing sensitivity, with the increase more pronounced for stimuli with higher temporal frequencies (i.e., &gt;0.2 Hz). Such increases in neural sensitivity were due to increased burst firing. At the organismal level, bilateral serotonin application within the ELL lateral segment enhanced behavioral responses to sensory input through increases in sensitivity. Similar to what was observed for neural responses, increases in behavioral sensitivity were more pronounced for higher (i.e., &gt;0.2 Hz) temporal frequencies. Surprisingly, a comparison between our results and previous ones obtained in the closely related species A. leptorhynchus revealed that, while serotonin application gave rise to similar effects on neural excitability and responses to sensory input, serotonin application also gave rise to marked differences in behavior. Specifically, behavioral responses in A. leptorhynchus were increased primarily for lower (i.e., ≤0.2 Hz) rather than for higher temporal frequencies. Thus, our results strongly suggest that there are marked differences in how sensory neural responses are processed downstream to give rise to behavior across both species. This is even though previous results have shown that the behavioral responses of both species to envelope stimuli were identical when serotonin is not applied.</p>

Background<p>Objective motor ratings and subjective motor complaints are both widely used in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the objective basis to the self-perceived mobility quality is still not well elucidated.</p>Purposes<p>We aimed to figure out the relevancy between the UPDRS motor scores and PDQ39 mobility sub-scores, and further explore whether physician-assessed motor dysfunctions and patients-reported mobility deficits have some shared mechanisms.</p>Methods<p>49 patients with PD who completed the PDQ39 scale were retrospectively included. The relevancy between mobility quality and UPDRS scores was assessed, as well as the related presynaptic dopaminergic binding (<sup>11</sup>C-CFT) and glucose metabolism (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) in this dual-tracer PET imaging study.</p>Results<p>Modest correlation was found between UPDRS motor score and the PDQ39 mobility sub-score (r = 0.440, p = 0.002). No correlation was found between PDQ39 mobility SI and the dopaminergic lesions in putamen; however, the strict correlation was found with the UPDRS motor scores. In terms of global PD related pattern (PDRP) scores, the two motor scores both correlated strictly. In the further regional metabolism exploration, cerebellum correlated positively with PDQ39 mobility sub-scores, and the frontal and parietal regions mainly correlated negatively with the motor quality scores.</p>Conclusion<p>UPDRS motor scores and PDQ39 mobility scores were only modestly correlated. The mechanisms involved under mobility quality were beyond dopaminergic deficiency, including motor related cerebellum hyper-metabolism and non-motor related frontal hypo-metabolism. Conclusively, the self-reported mobility experience may have the neurophysiological basis related to both motor and non-motor manifestations in PD.</p>

<p>Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (mMCAi) is a serious complication of cerebral infarction usually associated with poor patient prognosis. In this retrospective study, we analyzed clinical information as well as non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) data from patients with cerebral infarction in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory acquired within 24 h from symptoms onset. Then, we aimed to develop a model based on the radiomics signature to predict the development of mMCAi in cerebral infarction patients. Patients were divided randomly into training (n = 87) and validation (n = 39) sets. A total of 396 texture features were extracted from each NCCT image from the 126 patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis was used to reduce the feature dimension and construct an accurate radiomics signature based on the remaining texture features. Subsequently, we developed a model based on the radiomics signature and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) based on NCCT to predict mMCAi. Our prediction model showed a good predictive performance with an AUC of 0.917 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.863–0.972] and 0.913 [95% CI, 0.795–1] in the training and validation sets, respectively. Additionally, the decision curve analysis (DCA) validated the clinical efficacy of the combined risk factors of radiomics signature and ASPECTS based on NCCT in the prediction of mMCAi development in patients with acute stroke across a wide range of threshold probabilities. Our research indicates that radiomics signature can be an instrumental tool to predict the risk of mMCAi.</p>

<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a complicated clinical syndrome, which is caused by several kinds of cerebrovascular disorders, with high morbidity, disability and mortality rate. In recent years, several studies have shown that early brain injury (EBI) is an important factor leading to the poor prognosis of SAH. A major cause of EBI has been attributed that hematoma components invade into the brain parenchyma, resulting in neuronal cell death. Therefore, the clearance of hematoma components is essential in the clinical outcome of patients after SAH. Here, in the review, we provide a summary of the current known hematoma components clearance mechanisms and simultaneously propose a new hypothesis for hematoma components clearance.</p>

<p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The central pathophysiological mechanisms by which repetitive cranial injury results in the neurodegeneration of CTE are poorly understood. Current well-established working models emphasize a central role for trauma-induced excessive phosphorylation and accumulation of insoluble tangles of Tau protein. In this review, we summarize recent data from preclinical animal models of CTE where a series of candidate treatments have been carefully evaluated, including kinase inhibitors, antibody therapy, and anti-inflammatory therapies. We discuss the overall translational potential of these approaches and provide recommendations for future bench-to-bedside treatment strategies.</p>

Introduction<p>Recent studies explored promising new quantitative methods to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This paper analyzes the correlation of two EEG parameters, Brain Symmetry Index (BSI) and Laterality Coefficient (LC), with established functional scales for the stroke assessment.</p>Methods<p>Thirty-two healthy subjects and thirty-six stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis were recruited for this study. The stroke patients where subdivided in three groups according to the stroke location: Cortical, Subcortical, and Cortical + Subcortical. The participants performed assessment visits to record the EEG in the resting state and perform functional tests using rehabilitation scales. Then, stroke patients performed 25 sessions using a motor-imagery based Brain Computer Interface system (BCI). BSI was calculated with the EEG data in resting state and LC was calculated with the Event-Related Synchronization maps.</p>Results<p>The results of this study demonstrated significant differences in the BSI between the healthy group and Subcortical group (P = 0.001), and also between the healthy and Cortical+Subcortical group (P = 0.019). No significant differences were found between the healthy group and the Cortical group (P = 0.505). Furthermore, the BSI analysis in the healthy group based on gender showed statistical differences (P = 0.027). In the stroke group, the correlation between the BSI and the functional state of the upper extremity assessed by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) was also significant, ρ = −0.430 and P = 0.046. The correlation between the BSI and the FMA-Lower extremity was not significant (ρ = −0.063, P = 0.852). Similarly, the LC calculated in the alpha band has significative correlation with FMA of upper extremity (ρ = −0.623 and P &lt; 0.001) and FMA of lower extremity (ρ = −0.509 and P = 0.026). Other important significant correlations between LC and functional scales were observed. In addition, the patients showed an improvement in the FMA-upper extremity after the BCI therapy (ΔFMA = 1 median [IQR: 0–8], P = 0.002).</p>Conclusion<p>The quantitative EEG tools used here may help support our understanding of stroke and how the brain changes during rehabilitation therapy. These tools can help identify changes in EEG biomarkers and parameters during therapy that might lead to improved therapy methods and functional prognoses.</p>

Unfortunately, many of these micro-implants have not been adopted due to issues of signal loss, deterioration, and host response to the device. While glial scar characterization is critical to better understand the mechanisms that affect device functionality or tissue viability, analysis is frequently hindered by immunohistochemical tissue processing methods that result in device shattering and tissue tearing artifacts. Devices are commonly removed prior to sectioning, which can itself disturb the quality of the study. In this methods implementation study, we use the label free, optical sectioning method of second harmonic generation (SHG) to examine brain slices of various implanted intracortical electrodes and demonstrate collagen fiber distribution not found in normal brain tissue. SHG can easily be used in conjunction with multiphoton microscopy to allow direct intrinsic visualization of collagen-containing glial scars on the surface of cortically implanted electrode probes without imposing the physical strain of tissue sectioning methods required for other high resolution light microscopy modalities. Identification and future measurements of these collagen fibers may be useful in predicting host immune response and device signal fidelity.</p>

<p>Physiologically detailed models of neural networks are an important tool for studying how biophysical mechanisms impact neural information processing. An important, fundamental step in constructing such a model is determining where neurons are placed and how they connect to each other, based on known anatomical properties and constraints given by experimental data. Here we present an open-source software tool, pycabnn, that is dedicated to generating an anatomical model, which serves as the basis of a full network model. In pycabnn, we implemented efficient algorithms for generating physiologically realistic cell positions and for determining connectivity based on extended geometrical structures such as axonal and dendritic morphology. We demonstrate the capabilities and performance of pycabnn by using an example, a network model of the cerebellar granular layer, which requires generating more than half a million cells and computing their mutual connectivity. We show that pycabnn is efficient enough to carry out all the required tasks on a laptop computer within reasonable runtime, although it can also run in a parallel computing environment. Written purely in Python with limited external dependencies, pycabnn is easy to use and extend, and it can be a useful tool for computational neural network studies in the future.</p>

<p>Cerebral lesions may cause degeneration and neuroplastic reorganization in both the ipsi- and the contralesional hemisphere, presumably creating an imbalance of primarily inhibitory interhemispheric influences produced via transcallosal pathways. The two hemispheres are thought to mutually hamper neuroplastic reorganization of the other hemisphere. The results of preceding degeneration and neuroplastic reorganization of white matter may be reflected by Diffusion Tensor Imaging-derived diffusivity parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA). In this study, we applied Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to contrast the white matter status of the contralesional hemisphere of young lesioned brains with and without contralateral influences by comparing patients after hemispherotomy to those who had not undergone neurosurgery. DTI was applied to 43 healthy controls (26 females, mean age ± SD: 25.07 ± 11.33 years) and two groups of in total 51 epilepsy patients with comparable juvenile brain lesions (32 females, mean age ± SD: 25.69 ± 12.77 years) either after hemispherotomy (30 of 51 patients) or without neurosurgery (21 of 51 patients), respectively. FA values were compared between these groups using the unbiased tract-based spatial statistics approach. A voxel-wise ANCOVA controlling for age at scan yielded significant group differences in FA. A post hoc t-test between hemispherotomy patients and healthy controls revealed widespread supra-threshold voxels in the contralesional hemisphere of hemispherotomy patients indicating comparatively higher FA values (p &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected). The non-surgery group, in contrast, showed extensive supra-threshold voxels indicating lower FA values in the contralesional hemisphere as compared to healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected). Whereas lower FA values are suggestive of pronounced contralesional degeneration in the non-surgery group, higher FA values in the hemispherotomy group may be interpreted as a result of preceding plastic remodeling. We conclude that, whether juvenile brain lesions are associated with contralesional degeneration or reorganization partly depends on the ipsilesional hemisphere. Contralesional reorganization as observed in hemispherotomy patients was most likely enabled by the complete neurosurgical deafferentation of the ipsilesional hemisphere and, thereby, the disinhibition of the neuroplastic potential of the contralesional hemisphere. The main argument of this study is that hemispherotomy may be seen as a major plastic stimulus and as a prerequisite for contralesional neuroplastic remodeling in patients with juvenile brain lesions.</p>

<p>Adolescence is the time of onset of many psychiatric disorders. Half of pediatric patients present with comorbid psychiatric disorders that complicate both their medical and psychiatric care. Currently, diagnosis and treatment decisions are based on symptoms. The field urgently needs brain-based diagnosis and personalized care. Neuroimaging can shed light on how aberrations in brain circuits might underlie psychiatric disorders and their development in adolescents. In this perspective article, we summarize recent MRI literature that provides insights into development of psychiatric disorders in adolescents. We specifically focus on studies of brain structural and functional connectivity. Ninety-six included studies demonstrate the potential of MRI to assess psychiatrically relevant constructs, diagnose psychiatric disorders, predict their development or predict response to treatment. Limitations of the included studies are discussed, and recommendations for future research are offered. We also present a vision for the role that neuroimaging may play in pediatrics and primary care in the future: a routine neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric imaging (NPPI) protocol for adolescent patients, which would include a 30-min brain scan, a quality control and safety read of the scan, followed by computer-based calculation of the structural and functional brain network metrics that can be compared to the normative data by the pediatrician. We also perform a cost-benefit analysis to support this vision and provide a roadmap of the steps required for this vision to be implemented.</p>

<p>Although acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are widely expressed in the central nervous system, their distribution and roles in axonal growth cones remain unclear. In this study, we examined ASIC localization and function in the axonal growth cones of cultured immature hippocampal neurons. Our immunocytochemical data showed that native and overexpressed ASIC1a and ASIC2a are both localized in growth cones of cultured young hippocampal neurons. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological assay results were utilized to validate their function. The calcium imaging test results indicated that the ASICs (primarily ASIC1a) present in growth cones mediate calcium influx despite the addition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels antagonists and the depletion of intracellular calcium stores. The electrophysiological tests results suggested that a rapid decrease in extracellular pH at the growth cones of voltage-clamped neurons elicits inward currents that were blocked by bath application of the ASIC antagonist amiloride, showing that the ASICs expressed at growth cones are functional. The subsequent immuno-colocalization test results demonstrated that ASIC1a and ASIC2a are both colocalized with Neurofilament-H and Bassoon in mature hippocampal neurons. This finding demonstrated that after reaching maturity, ASIC1a and ASIC2a are both distributed in axons and the presynaptic membrane. Our data reveal the distribution of functional ASICs in growth cones of immature hippocampal neurons and the presence of ASICs in the axons and presynaptic membrane of mature hippocampal neurons, indicating a possible role for ASICs in axonal guidance, synapse formation and neurotransmitter release.</p>

<p>Signaling from central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages is critical to activate microglia and cause tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). We combined laser microdissection with high-throughput real time RT-PCR to investigate separately the CNS exogenous and endogenous inflammatory components in postmortem brain tissue of progressive MS cases. A previous analysis of immune infiltrates isolated from the white matter (WM) and the meninges revealed predominant expression of genes involved in antiviral and cytotoxic immunity, including IFNγ and TNF. Here, we assessed the expression of 71 genes linked to IFN and TNF signaling and microglia/macrophage activation in the parenchyma surrounding perivascular cuffs at different stages of WM lesion evolution and in gray matter (GM) lesions underlying meningeal infiltrates. WM and GM from non-neurological subjects were used as controls. Transcriptional changes in the WM indicate activation of a classical IFNγ-induced macrophage defense response already in the normal-appearing WM, amplification of detrimental (proinflammatory/pro-oxidant) and protective (anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant) responses in actively demyelinating WM lesions and persistence of these dual features at the border of chronic active WM lesions. Transcriptional changes in chronic subpial GM lesions indicate skewing toward a proinflammatory microglia phenotype. TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) mediating TNF neuroprotective functions was one of the genes upregulated in the MS WM. Using immunohistochemistry we show that TNFR2 is highly expressed in activated microglia in the normal-appearing WM, at the border of chronic active WM lesions, and in foamy macrophages in actively demyelinating WM and GM lesions. In lysolecithin-treated mouse cerebellar slices, a model of demyelination and remyelination, TNFR2 RNA and soluble protein increased immediately after toxin-induced demyelination along with transcripts for microglia/macrophage-derived pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. TNFR2 and IL10 RNA and soluble TNFR2 protein remained elevated during remyelination. Furthermore, myelin basic protein expression was increased after selective activation of TNFR2 with an agonistic antibody. This study highlights the key role of cytotoxic adaptive immunity in driving detrimental microglia activation and the concomitant healing response. It also shows that TNFR2 is an early marker of microglia activation and promotes myelin synthesis, suggesting that microglial TNFR2 activation can be exploited therapeutically to stimulate CNS repair.</p>

<p>Inflammation and dysregulation of the immune system are hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases. An activated immune response is considered to be the cause of myelin breakdown in demyelinating disorders. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), myelin can be degraded in an autophagy-dependent manner directly by Schwann cells or by macrophages, which are modulated by T-lymphocytes. Here, we show that the NF-κB activator Pleckstrin homology containing family member 5 (Plekhg5) is involved in the regulation of both Schwann cell autophagy and recruitment of T-lymphocytes in peripheral nerves during motoneuron disease. Plekhg5-deficient mice show defective axon/Schwann cell units characterized by myelin infoldings in peripheral nerves. Even at late stages, Plekhg5-deficient mice do not show any signs of demyelination and inflammation. Using RNAseq, we identified a transcriptional signature for an impaired immune response in sciatic nerves, which manifested in a reduced number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. These findings identify Plekhg5 as a promising target to impede myelin breakdown in demyelinating PNS disorders.</p>

<p>Small molecule RNAs (microRNAs) are a kind of endogenous, stable, and noncoding RNA molecule that can regulate the expression of target genes such as DJ-1 at the posttranscriptional level. This study aimed to detect the expression of salivary microRNAs and to discover their value as a salivary potential biomarker for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Through a case-control study, RT-qPCR technology was used to detect the expression of miR-874 and miR-145-3p in the saliva of 30 PD patients and 30 healthy volunteers. Then we compared the differences in the expression levels of salivary miR-874 and miR-145-3p between the PD group and the control group and analyzed the correlation between the expression of salivary miR-874 and miR-145-3p in terms of age, gender, disease condition, and disease course. We found that salivary miR-874 and miR-145-3p were both positively expressed in the PD group and control group, and their expression in the PD group was higher than that in the control group. The expression of salivary miRNA-874 and miR-145-3p had no clear correlation to age, gender, total RNA concentrations in saliva, the score of UPDRSII, UPDRSIII, olfactory test scale, MMSE, MoCA, Hohn–Yahr stage and disease course. In conclusion, in the PD group and the control group with positive expression, the expression levels of miR-874 and miR-145-3p in the PD group were higher than those in the control group. The detection of miR-874 and miR-145-3p expression in saliva can be used as an auxiliary biomarker for PD.</p>

<p>Like other sensory systems, olfactory function deteriorates with age. Epidemiological studies have revealed that the incidence of olfactory dysfunction increases at the age of 60 and older and males are more affected than females. Moreover, smoking, heavy alcohol use, sinonasal diseases, and Down’s syndrome are associated with an increased incidence of olfactory dysfunction. Although the pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction in humans remains largely unknown, studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated that both the peripheral and central olfactory nervous systems are affected by aging. Aged olfactory neuroepithelium in the nasal cavity shows the loss of mature olfactory neurons, replacement of olfactory neuroepithelium by respiratory epithelium, and a decrease in basal cell proliferation both in the normal state and after injury. In the central olfactory pathway, a decrease in the turnover of interneurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) and reduced activity in the olfactory cortex under olfactory stimulation is observed. Recently, the association between olfactory impairment and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), has gained attention. Evidence-based pharmacotherapy to suppress or improve age-related olfactory dysfunction has not yet been established, but preliminary results suggest that olfactory training using odorants may be useful to improve some aspects of age-related olfactory impairment.</p>

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the CNS driven by the inflammatory activity of peripheral immune cells recruited to the CNS and by CNS-resident glial cells. MS pathogenesis has been linked to both genetic and environmental factors. In addition, the commensal flora have been shown to modulate immune processes relevant to MS pathogenesis. We discuss the effects of the gut microbiota on T cells and glial cells, and their relevance for the control of inflammation and neurodegeneration in MS.

Liu et al. show that the mRNA encoding the XBP-1 transcription factor has an unexpected second function in C. elegans. Cytoplasmic cleavage of xbp-1 mRNA activates a ncRNA sequestered within the mRNA. This ncRNA is critical for axon regeneration and acts independently of the protein-coding function of the xbp-1 mRNA.

Zhang et al. find that mutp53 enhances Hsp90α secretion and blocking eHsp90α function attenuates the oncogenic activities of p53 mutant tumors. RCP is identified as a downstream effector in mutp53-induced Hsp90α vesicular trafficking and exosome-mediated secretion.

<p>by Thuy T. T. Le, Frederick R. Adler</p>

The benefits of mammography screening have been controversial, with conflicting findings from various studies. We hypothesize that unmeasured heterogeneity in tumor aggressiveness underlies these conflicting results. Based on published data from the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS), we develop and parameterize an individual-based mechanistic model for breast cancer incidence and mortality that tracks five stages of breast cancer progression and incorporates the effects of age on breast cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. The model accurately reproduces the reported outcomes of the CNBSS. By varying parameters, we predict that the benefits of mammography depend on the effectiveness of cancer treatment and tumor aggressiveness. In particular, patients with the most rapidly growing or potentially largest tumors have the highest benefit and least harm from the screening, with only a relatively small effect of age. However, the model predicts that confining mammography to populations with a high risk of acquiring breast cancer increases the screening benefit only slightly compared with the full population.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iwECpl0IUfU" width="1" />

<p>by Konstantin Butenko, Christian Bahls, Max Schröder, Rüdiger Köhling, Ursula van Rienen</p>

In this study, we propose a new open-source simulation platform that comprises computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering tools for highly automated evaluation of electric field distribution and neural activation during Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). It will be shown how a Volume Conductor Model (VCM) is constructed and examined using Python-controlled algorithms for generation, discretization and adaptive mesh refinement of the computational domain, as well as for incorporation of heterogeneous and anisotropic properties of the tissue and allocation of neuron models. The utilization of the platform is facilitated by a collection of predefined input setups and quick visualization routines. The accuracy of a VCM, created and optimized by the platform, was estimated by comparison with a commercial software. The results demonstrate no significant deviation between the models in the electric potential distribution. A qualitative estimation of different physics for the VCM shows an agreement with previous computational studies. The proposed computational platform is suitable for an accurate estimation of electric fields during DBS in scientific modeling studies. In future, we intend to acquire SDA and EMA approval. Successful incorporation of open-source software, controlled by in-house developed algorithms, provides a highly automated solution. The platform allows for optimization and uncertainty quantification (UQ) studies, while employment of the open-source software facilitates accessibility and reproducibility of simulations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5rDfN6strgA" width="1" />

<p>by Madison S. Krieger, Carson E. Denison, Thayer L. Anderson, Martin A. Nowak, Alison L. Hill</p>

Antibiotic-resistant infections are a growing threat to human health, but basic features of the eco-evolutionary dynamics remain unexplained. Most prominently, there is no clear mechanism for the long-term coexistence of both drug-sensitive and resistant strains at intermediate levels, a ubiquitous pattern seen in surveillance data. Here we show that accounting for structured or spatially-heterogeneous host populations and variability in antibiotic consumption can lead to persistent coexistence over a wide range of treatment coverages, drug efficacies, costs of resistance, and mixing patterns. Moreover, this mechanism can explain other puzzling spatiotemporal features of drug-resistance epidemiology that have received less attention, such as large differences in the prevalence of resistance between geographical regions with similar antibiotic consumption or that neighbor one another. We find that the same amount of antibiotic use can lead to very different levels of resistance depending on how treatment is distributed in a transmission network. We also identify parameter regimes in which population structure alone cannot support coexistence, suggesting the need for other mechanisms to explain the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Our analysis identifies key features of host population structure that can be used to assess resistance risk and highlights the need to include spatial or demographic heterogeneity in models to guide resistance management.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sjGsAf0MFFI" width="1" />

<p>by Elisa Benincà, Thomas Hagenaars, Gert Jan Boender, Jan van de Kassteele, Michiel van Boven</p>

Transmission of infectious diseases between immobile hosts (e.g., plants, farms) is strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of hosts and the distance-dependent probability of transmission. As the interplay between these factors is poorly understood, we use spatial process and transmission modelling to investigate how epidemic size is shaped by host clustering and spatial range of transmission. We find that for a given degree of clustering and individual-level infectivity, the probability that an epidemic occurs after an introduction is generally higher if transmission is predominantly local. However, local transmission also impedes transfer of the infection to new clusters. A consequence is that the total number of infections is maximal if the range of transmission is intermediate. In highly clustered populations, the infection dynamics is strongly determined by the probability of transmission between clusters of hosts, whereby local clusters act as multiplier of infection. We show that in such populations, a metapopulation model sometimes provides a good approximation of the total epidemic size, using probabilities of local extinction, the final size of infections in local clusters, and probabilities of cluster-to-cluster transmission. As a real-world example we analyse the case of avian influenza transmission between poultry farms in the Netherlands.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nzqmtT4CCng" width="1" />

<p>by Philippe Carmona, Sylvain Gandon</p>

Many infectious diseases exhibit seasonal dynamics driven by periodic fluctuations of the environment. Predicting the risk of pathogen emergence at different points in time is key for the development of effective public health strategies. Here we study the impact of seasonality on the probability of emergence of directly transmitted pathogens under different epidemiological scenarios. We show that when the period of the fluctuation is large relative to the duration of the infection, the probability of emergence varies dramatically with the time at which the pathogen is introduced in the host population. In particular, we identify a new effect of seasonality (the <i>winter is coming</i> effect) where the probability of emergence is vanishingly small even though pathogen transmission is high. We use this theoretical framework to compare the impact of different preventive control strategies on the average probability of emergence. We show that, when pathogen eradication is not attainable, the optimal strategy is to act intensively in a narrow time interval. Interestingly, the optimal control strategy is not always the strategy minimizing <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, the basic reproduction ratio of the pathogen. This theoretical framework is extended to study the probability of emergence of vector borne diseases in seasonal environments and we show how it can be used to improve risk maps of Zika virus emergence.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MHzONXOaTOA" width="1" />

<p>by Tom L. Kaufmann, Ulrich S. Schwarz</p>

Recent experiments with super-resolution live cell microscopy revealed that nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments are much more dynamic than formerly appreciated, often showing plastic processes such as splitting, concatenation and stacking. Here we combine sequence information, electrostatics and elasticity theory to demonstrate that the parallel staggers at 14.3, 43.2 and 72 nm have a strong tendency to splay their heads away from the minifilament, thus potentially initiating the diverse processes seen in live cells. In contrast, the straight antiparallel stagger with an overlap of 43 nm is very stable and likely initiates minifilament nucleation. Using stochastic dynamics in a newly defined energy landscape, we predict that the optimal parallel staggers between the myosin rods are obtained by a trial-and-error process in which two rods attach and re-attach at different staggers by rolling and zipping motion. The experimentally observed staggers emerge as the configurations with the largest contact times. We find that contact times increase from isoforms C to B to A, that A-B-heterodimers are surprisingly stable and that myosin 18A should incorporate into mixed filaments with a small stagger. Our findings suggest that nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments in the cell are first formed by isoform A and then convert to mixed A-B-filaments, as observed experimentally.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bc6Z8M3rImk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25841?af=R">The distinct traits of the UNC13A polymorphism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The rs12608932 single nucleotide polymorphism in <i>UNC13A </i> is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) susceptibility, and may underlie differences in treatment response. We aimed to characterize the clinical, cognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging phenotype of <i>UNC13A </i> in ALS patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 2,216 ALS patients without a <i>C9orf72 </i> mutation to identify clinical characteristics associated with the <i>UNC13A </i> polymorphism. A subcohort of 428 ALS patients was used to study cognitive and behavioral profiles, and 375 patients to study neuroimaging characteristics. Associations were analyzed under an additive genetic model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genotyping rs12608932 resulted in 854 A/A, 988 A/C and 374 C/C genotypes. The C allele was associated with a higher age at symptom onset (median years A/A 63.5, A/C 65.6, C/C 65.5, p&lt;0.001), more frequent bulbar onset (A/A 29.6%, A/C 31.8%, C/C 43.1%, p&lt;0.001), higher incidences of ALS‐FTD (A/A 4.3%, A/C 5.2%, C/C 9.5%, p=0.003), lower forced vital capacity at diagnosis (median percentage A/A 92.0, A/C 90.0, C/C 86.5, p&lt;0.001), and a shorter survival (median in months A/A 33.3, A.C 30.7, C/C 26.6, p&lt;0.001). <i>UNC13A </i> was associated with lower scores on ALS‐specific cognition tests (means A/A 79.5, A/C 78.1, C/C 76.6, p=0.037) and more frequent behavioral disturbances (A/A 16.7%, A/C 24.4% C/C 27.7%, p=0.045). Thinner left inferior temporal and right fusiform cortex were associated with the <i>UNC13A </i> SNP (p=0.045 and p=0.036).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Phenotypical distinctions associated with <i>UNC13A </i> make it an important factor to take into account in clinical trial design, studies on cognition and behavior, and prognostic counselling.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sex steroid hormones such as 17β‐estradiol (estradiol) regulate neuronal function by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), including ERα and GPER1, and through differential production via the enzyme aromatase. ERs and aromatase are expressed across the nervous system, including in the striatal brain regions. These regions, comprising the nucleus accumbens core, shell, and caudate‐putamen, are instrumental for a wide‐range of functions and disorders that show sex differences in phenotype and/or incidence. Sex‐specific estrogen action is an integral component for generating these sex differences. A distinctive feature of the striatal regions is that in adulthood neurons exclusively express membrane but not nuclear ERs. This long‐standing finding dominates models of estrogen action in striatal regions. However, the developmental etiology of ER and aromatase cellular expression in female and male striatum is unknown. This omission in knowledge is important to address, as developmental stage influences cellular estrogenic mechanisms. Thus, ERα, GPER1, and aromatase cellular immunoreactivity was assessed in perinatal, pre‐pubertal, and adult female and male rats. We tested the hypothesis that ERα, GPER1, and aromatase exhibits sex, region, and age‐specific differences, including nuclear expression. ERα exhibits nuclear expression in all three striatal regions before adulthood and disappears in a region‐ and sex‐specific time‐course. Cellular GPER1 expression decreases during development in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course, resulting in extranuclear expression by adulthood. Somatic aromatase expression presents at pre‐puberty and increases by adulthood in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course. These data indicate that developmental period exerts critical sex‐specific influences on striatal cellular estrogenic mechanisms.</p>

<p>Light sheet microcopy is used to map frequency along the basilar membrane within intact cochleae, retaining spatial orientation and relationships with internal and external structural landmarks. Three‐dimensional measures of how frequency domains relate to one another gives insight into how the geometric organization of the cochlea may influence its physiology.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) provides a rapid and complete three‐dimensional image of the cochlea. The method retains anatomical relationships ‐ on a micron scale ‐ between internal structures such as hair cells, basilar membrane and modiolus with external surface structures such as the round and oval windows. Immunolabeled hair cells were used to visualize the spiraling basilar membrane in the intact cochlea without time intensive dissections or additional histological processing; yet material prepared for LSFM could be re‐hydrated, the basilar membrane dissected out and re‐imaged at higher resolution with the confocal microscope. In immersion‐fixed material, details of the cochlear vasculature were seen throughout the cochlea. Hair cell counts (both inner and outer) as well as frequency maps of the basilar membrane were comparable to those obtained by other methods, but with the added dimension of depth. The material provided measures of angular, linear and vector distance between characteristic frequency regions along the basilar membrane. Thus, LSFM provides a unique ability to rapidly image the entire cochlea in a manner applicable to model and interpret physiological results. Furthermore, the three‐dimensional organization of the cochlea can be studied at the organ and cellular level with LSFM, and this same material can be taken to the confocal microscope for detailed analysis at the subcellular level.</p>

<p>The identification of progression in multiple sclerosis is typically retrospective. Given the profound burden of progressive multiple sclerosis, and the recent development of effective treatments for these patients, there is a need to establish measures capable of identifying progressive multiple sclerosis early in the disease course. Starting from recent pathological findings, this review assesses the state of the art of potential measures able to predict progressive multiple sclerosis. Future promising biomarkers that might shed light on mechanisms of progression are also discussed. Finally, expansion of the concept of progressive multiple sclerosis, by including an assessment of cognition, patient‐reported outcomes, and comorbidities, is considered. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A great diversity of adaptations is found among animals with compound eyes and even closely related taxa can show variation in their light‐adaptation strategies. A prime example of a visual system evolved to function in specific light environments is the fiddler crab, used widely as a model to research aspects of crustacean vision and neural pathways. However, questions remain regarding how their eyes respond to the changes in brightness spanning many orders of magnitude, associated with their habitat and ecology. The fiddler crab <i>Afruca tangeri </i> forages at low tide on tropical and semi‐tropical mudflats, under bright sunlight and on moonless nights, suggesting that their eyes undergo effective light adaptation. Using synchrotron X‐ray tomography, light and transmission electron microscopy and in vivo ophthalmoscopy, we describe the ultrastructural changes in the eye between day and night. Dark adaptation at dusk triggered extensive widening of the rhabdoms and crystalline cone tips. This doubled the ommatidial acceptance angles and increased microvillar surface area for light capture in the rhabdom, theoretically boosting optical sensitivity 7.4 times. During daytime, only partial dark‐adaptation was achieved and rhabdoms remained narrow, indicating strong circadian control on the process. Bright light did not evoke changes in screening pigment distributions, suggesting a structural inability to adapt rapidly to the light level fluctuations frequently experienced when entering their burrow to escape predators. This should enable fiddler crabs to shelter for several minutes without undergoing significant dark‐adaptation, their vision remaining effectively adapted for predator detection when surfacing again in bright light.</p>

<p>Phytocannabinoids are psychotropic substances ofcannabis with the ability to bind endocannabinoid (eCB) receptors that regulate synaptic activity in the central nervous system (CNS). Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are synthetic analogs of Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC), the psychotropic compound of cannabis, acting as agonists of eCB receptor CB<sub>1</sub>. SC is an easily available and popular alternative to cannabis, and their molecular structure is always changing, increasing the hazard for the general population. The popularity of cannabis and its derivatives may lead, and often does, to a child’s exposure to cannabis both in utero and through breastfeeding by a drug-consuming mother. Prenatal exposure to cannabis has been associated with an altered rate of mental development and significant changes in nervous system functioning. However, the understanding of mechanisms of its action on developing the human CNS is still lacking. We investigated the effect of continuous exposure to cannabinoids on developing human neurons, mimicking the prenatal exposure by drug-consuming mother. Two human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) lines were induced to differentiate into neuronal cells and exposed for 37 days to cannabidiol (CBD), Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC, and two SCs, THJ-018 and EG-018. Both Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC and SC, at 10 μM, promote precocious neuronal and glial differentiation, while CBD at the same concentration is neurotoxic. Neurons exposed to Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC and SC show abnormal functioning of voltage-gated calcium channels when stimulated by extracellular potassium. In sum, all studied substances have a profound impact on the developing neurons, highlighting the importance of thorough research on the impact of prenatal exposure to natural and SC.</p>

<p>Many studies have revealed the structural or functional brain changes induced by occupational factors. However, it remains largely unknown how occupation-related connectivity shapes the brain. In this paper, we denote occupational neuroplasticity as the neuroplasticity that takes place to satisfy the occupational requirements by extensively professional training and to accommodate the long-term, professional work of daily life, and a critical review of occupational neuroplasticity related to the changes in brain structure and functional networks has been primarily presented. Furthermore, meta-analysis revealed a neurophysiological mechanism of occupational neuroplasticity caused by professional experience. This meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies showed that experts displayed stronger activation in the left precentral gyrus [Brodmann area (BA)6], left middle frontal gyrus (BA6), and right inferior frontal gyrus (BA9) than novices, while meta-analysis of structural studies suggested that experts had a greater gray matter volume in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (BA22) and right putamen than novices. Together, these findings not only expand the current understanding of the common neurophysiological basis of occupational neuroplasticity across different occupations and highlight some possible targets for neural modulation of occupational neuroplasticity but also provide a new perspective for occupational science research.</p>

<p>Introduction: To evaluate the current utilization and challenges in fully implementing the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment in Asia and Oceania.</p><p>Methods: We conducted a medical literature search to identify DBS research performed by investigators with a primary affiliation in Asian and Oceania countries between March 1, 2013, and March 1, 2019, followed by an international survey-based study. Additionally, we obtained added information regarding the DBS challenges and opportunities from the technology/industry perspective within China and Japan. We also described the current situation of DBS in India.</p><p>Results: Most publications (390/494; 78.95%) in the English language originated from East Asia. In West Asia, Turkey, Israel, and Iran accounted for most DBS publications. We found no publications from the remaining 35 Asian countries. Lack of community referrals to tertiary centers was identified as the most common limitation for the widespread use of DBS in Asia (68.97%). In China, despite an increasing number of centers performing DBS surgeries, most of them accomplished less than 10 cases per year. In contrast, the number of DBS cases in Japan has been decreasing. Centers offering DBS surgeries as well as corresponding fellowship training in India are limited.</p><p>Conclusion: Appropriate referrals, access, infrastructure, and the presence of full multidisciplinary DBS teams are common limitations of DBS in Asia. Most centers in China, Japan, and India performed less than 10 cases per year and a future study is expected to address the impact on quality in centers performing such few cases.</p>

<p>Age-associated impairment of spatial learning and memory (AISLM) presents substantial challenges to our health and society. Increasing evidence has indicated that embryonic exposure to inflammation accelerates the AISLM, and this can be attributable, at least partly, to changed synaptic plasticity associated with the activities of various proteins. However, it is still uncertain whether social psychological factors affect this AISLM and/or the expression of synaptic protein-associated genes. Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) are two synaptic proteins closely related to cognitive functions. In this study, pregnant CD-1 mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50 μg/kg) or normal saline at days 15–17 of gestation, and half of the offspring of each group were then subjected to stress for 28 days in adolescence. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to separately evaluate spatial learning and memory at 3 and 15 months of age, while western blotting and RNAscope assays were used to measure the protein and mRNA levels of Arc and Syt1 in the hippocampus. The results showed that, at 15 months of age, control mice had worse cognitive ability and higher protein and mRNA levels of Arc and Syt1 than their younger counterparts. Embryonic exposure to inflammation or exposure to stress in adolescence aggravated the AISLM, as well as the age-related increase in Arc and Syt1 expression. Moreover, the hippocampal protein and mRNA levels of Arc and Syt1 were significantly correlated with the performance in the learning and memory periods of the MWM test, especially in the mice that had suffered adverse insults in early life. Our findings indicated that prenatal exposure to inflammation or stress exposure in adolescence exacerbated the AISLM and age-related upregulation of Arc and Syt1 expression, and these effects were linked to cognitive impairments in CD-1 mice exposed to adverse factors in early life.</p>

<p>Delta opioid receptor agonist potency and efficacy are enhanced chronic neuropathic pain states. Activation of these receptors produces negative reinforcement in pain animals, demonstrating the importance of this receptor in its ability to modulate the tonic aversive component of pain. Neuropathic pain engages enkephalin circuits that when blocked exaggerates the affective component of pain. One of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increased activity of delta opioid receptors is trafficking of receptors to cell membranes of deep dorsal horn spinal neurons. Finally, presynaptic and postsynaptic delta opioid receptors modulate thermal and mechanical nociception, respectively.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonists alleviate nociceptive behaviors in various chronic pain models, including neuropathic pain, while having minimal effect on sensory thresholds in the absence of injury. The mechanisms underlying nerve injury‐induced enhancement of DOR function are unclear. We used a peripheral nerve injury (PNI) model of neuropathic pain to assess changes in the function and localization of DORs in mice and rats. Intrathecal administration of DOR agonists reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. The dose‐dependent thermal antinociceptive effects of DOR agonists were shifted to the left in PNI rats. Administration of DOR agonists produced a conditioned place preference in PNI, but not in sham, animals, whereas the DOR antagonist naltrindole produced a place aversion in PNI, but not in sham, mice, suggesting the engagement of endogenous DOR activity in suppressing pain associated with the injury. GTPγS autoradiography revealed an increase in DOR function in the dorsal spinal cord, ipsilateral to PNI. Immunogold electron microscopy and <i>in vivo </i> fluorescent agonist assays were used to assess changes in the ultrastructural localization of DORs in the spinal dorsal horn. In shams, DORs were primarily localized within intracellular compartments. PNI significantly increased the cell surface expression of DORs within lamina IV‐V dendritic profiles. Using neonatal capsaicin treatment, we identified that DOR agonist‐induced thermal antinociception was mediated via receptors expressed on primary afferent sensory neurons but did not alter mechanical thresholds. These data reveal that the regulation of DORs following PNI and suggest the importance of endogenous activation of DORs in regulating chronic pain states.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>lrrk2 </i>) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. Difficulty in elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms resulting from disease‐associated Lrrk2 variants stems from the complexity of Lrrk2 function and activities. Lrrk2 contains multiple protein–protein interacting domains, a GTPase domain, and a kinase domain. Lrrk2 is implicated in many cellular processes including vesicular trafficking, autophagy, cytoskeleton dynamics, and Wnt signaling. Here, we generated a zebrafish <i>lrrk2 </i> allelic series to study the requirements for Lrrk2 during development and to dissect the importance of its various domains. The alleles are predicted to encode proteins that either lack all functional domains (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu304</sup>) </i>, the GTPase, and kinase domains (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu71</sup> 
</i>) or the kinase domain (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu96</sup> 
</i>). All three <i>lrrk2 </i> mutants are viable, morphologically normal, and display wild‐type‐like locomotion. Because Lrrk2 modulates Wnt signaling in some contexts, we assessed Wnt signaling in all three mutant lines. Analysis of Wnt signaling by studying the expression of target genes using whole mount RNA <i>in situ </i> hybridization and a transgenic Wnt reporter revealed wild‐type domains of Wnt activity in each of the mutants. However, we found that Wnt pathway activation is attenuated in <i>lrrk2<sup>sbu304/sbu304</sup> 
</i>, which lacks both scaffolding and catalytic domains, but not in the other alleles during late embryogenesis. This supports a model in which Lrrk2 scaffolding functions are key to a context‐dependent role in promoting canonical Wnt signaling.</p>

Salient findings include the identification of glutamatergic output from the parabrachial nucleus to the rostral entorhinal cortex and lateral superior colliculus, plus an absence of <i>Foxp2 </i> or <i>Pdyn </i> output to the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and amygdala.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is a complex structure located at the junction of the midbrain and hindbrain. Its neurons have diverse genetic profiles and influence a variety of homeostatic functions. While its cytoarchitecture and overall efferent projections are known, we lack comprehensive information on the projection patterns of specific neuronal subtypes in the PB. In this study, we compared the projection patterns of glutamatergic neurons here with a subpopulation expressing the transcription factor <i>Foxp2 </i> and a further subpopulation expressing the neuropeptide <i>Pdyn </i>. To do this, we injected an AAV into the PB region to deliver a Cre‐dependent anterograde tracer (synaptophysin‐mCherry) in three different strains of Cre‐driver mice. We then analyzed 147 neuroanatomical regions for labeled boutons in every brain (n = 11). Overall, glutamatergic neurons in the PB region project to a wide variety of sites in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, diencephalon, and brainstem. <i>Foxp2 </i> and <i>Pdyn </i> subpopulations project heavily to the hypothalamus, but not to the cortex, basal forebrain, or amygdala. Among the few differences between <i>Foxp2 </i> and <i>Pdyn </i> cases was a notable lack of <i>Pdyn </i> projections to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Our results indicate that genetic identity determines connectivity (and therefore, function), providing a framework for mapping all PB output projections based on the genetic identity of its neurons. Using genetic markers to systematically classify PB neurons and their efferent projections will enhance the translation of research findings from experimental animals to humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence deep learning system with that of expert neuro‐ophthalmologists in classifying optic disc appearance.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of two expert neuro‐ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly‐presented images without clinical information. Area‐under‐the‐receiver‐operating‐characteristic‐curve, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The system correctly classified 678/800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675/800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641/800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded area‐under‐the‐receiver‐operating‐characteristic‐curves of 0.97 (CI 95%, 0.96 ‐ 0.98), 0.96 (CI 95%, 0.94 ‐ 0.97) and 0.89 (CI 95%, 0.87 ‐ 0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema and other disc abnormalities, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the system's classification of optic discs were similar or better than the two experts. Inter‐grader agreement at the eye level was 0.71 (CI 95%, 0.67‐0.76) between Expert 1 and Expert 2, 0.72 (CI 95%, 0.68‐0.76) between the system and Expert 1, and 0.65 (CI 95%, 0.61‐0.70) between the system and Expert 2.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The performance of this deep learning system at classifying optic disc abnormalities was at least as good as two expert neuro‐ophthalmologists. Future prospective studies are needed to validate this system as a diagnostic aid in relevant clinical settings.</p>

<p>Microglia structural reorganization, and altered neuroimmune signaling, are implicated in pathological adaptations that promote excessive drinking. Here we used Iba1 immunohistochemistry, high‐resolution confocal microscopy, and digital reconstruction analyses of Iba1‐positive microglia in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats during withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, rats injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and an ethanol‐naïve (air)‐exposed group. We found that CIE and LPS led to dichotomous alterations in microglia structural complexity in the PL cortex that were largely absent in the NAc. These findings add to a growing body of literature pointing towards altered microglia structural complexity, and presumably function, in ethanol‐induced adaptations in the brain.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence has linked pathological changes associated with chronic alcohol exposure to neuroimmune signaling mediated by microglia. Prior characterization of the microglial structure–function relationship demonstrates that alterations in activity states occur concomitantly with reorganization of cellular architecture. Accordingly, gaining a better understanding of microglial morphological changes associated with ethanol exposure will provide valuable insight into how neuroimmune signaling may contribute to ethanol‐induced reshaping of neuronal function. Here we have used Iba1‐staining combined with high‐resolution confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction to examine microglial structure in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in male Long‐Evans rats. Rats were either sacrificed at peak withdrawal following 15 days of exposure to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) or 24 hr after two consecutive injections of the immune activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS), each separated by 24 hr. LPS exposure resulted in dramatic structural reorganization of microglia in the PL cortex, including increased soma volume, overall cellular volume, and branching complexity. In comparison, CIE exposure was associated with a subtle increase in somatic volume and differential effects on microglia processes, which were largely absent in the NAc. These data reveal that microglial activation following a neuroimmune challenge with LPS or exposure to chronic alcohol exhibits distinct morphometric profiles and brain region‐dependent specificity.</p>

<p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is widely associated with deficits in implicit emotion regulation. Recently, adaptive fMRI neurofeedback (A-NF) has been developed as a methodology that offers a unique probe of brain networks that mediate implicit emotion regulation and their impairment in PTSD. We designed an A-NF paradigm in which difficulty of an emotional conflict task (i.e., embedding trauma distractors onto a neutral target stimulus) was controlled by a whole-brain classifier trained to differentiate attention to the trauma distractor vs. target. We exploited this methodology to test whether PTSD was associated with: (1) an altered brain state that differentiates attention towards vs. away from trauma cues; and (2) an altered ability to use concurrent feedback about brain states during an implicit emotion regulation task. Adult women with a current diagnosis of PTSD (n = 10) and healthy control (n = 9) women participated in this task during 3T fMRI. During two initial non-feedback runs used to train a whole-brain classifier, we observed: (1) poorer attention performance in PTSD; and (2) a linear relationship between brain state discrimination and attention performance, which was significantly attenuated among the PTSD group when the task contained trauma cues. During the A-NF phase, the PTSD group demonstrated poorer ability to regulate brain states as per attention instructions, and this poorer ability was related to PTSD symptom severity. Further, PTSD was associated with the heightened encoding of feedback in the insula and hippocampus. These results suggest a novel understanding of whole-brain states and their regulation that underlie emotion regulation deficits in PTSD.</p>

<p>Techniques that allow the manipulation of specific neural circuits have greatly increased in the past few years. DREADDs (Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) provide an elegant way to manipulate individual brain structures and/or neural circuits, including neuromodulatory pathways. Considerable efforts have been made to increase cell-type specificity of DREADD expression while decreasing possible limitations due to multiple viral vectors injections. In line with this, a retrograde canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector carrying a Cre-dependent DREADD cassette has been recently developed. In combination with Cre-driver transgenic animals, the vector allows one to target neuromodulatory pathways with cell-type specificity. In the present study, we specifically targeted catecholaminergic pathways by injecting the vector in knock-in rat line containing Cre recombinase cassette under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. We assessed the efficacy of infection of the nigrostriatal pathway and the catecholaminergic pathways ascending to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and found cell-type-specific DREADD expression.</p>

<p>Background: In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuronal degeneration is associated with gliosis and infiltration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which participate in neuroinflammation. Defects at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) facilitate PBMCs migration towards the central nervous system (CNS) and in particular CD4+ T cells have been found in areas severely affected in AD. However, the role of T cells, once they migrate into the CNS, is not well defined. CD4+ cells interact with astrocytes able to release several factors and cytokines that can modulate T cell polarization; similarly, astrocytic properties are modulated after interaction with T cells.</p><p>Methods: In in vitro models, astrocytes were primed with β-amyloid (Aβ; 2.5 μM, 5 h) and then co-cultured with magnetically isolated CD4+ cells. Cytokines expression was evaluated both in co-cultured CD4+ cells and astrocytes. The effects of this crosstalk were further evaluated by co-culturing CD4+ cells with the neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cell line and astrocytes with endothelial cells.</p><p>Results: The pattern of cytokines and trophic factors expressed by CD4+ cells were strongly modulated in the presence of Aβ-primed astrocytes. Specifically, the percentage of IL-4+ and IFNγ+ CD4+ cells was significantly increased and reduced, respectively. Further, increased BDNF mRNA levels were observed in CD4+ cells. When SH-SY5Y cells were co-cultured with astrocyte-conditioned CD4+ cells and exposed to Aβ, the reduction of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin was prevented with a BDNF-dependent mechanism. In astrocytes co-cultured with CD4+ cells, reduced mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and VEGF were observed. This was paralleled by the prevention of the reduction of claudin-5 when astrocytes were co-cultured with endothelial cells.</p><p>Conclusion: Following Aβ exposure, there exists reciprocal crosstalk between infiltrating peripheral cells and astrocytes that in turn affects not only endothelial function and thus BBB properties, but also neuronal behavior. Since astrocytes are the first cells that lymphocytes interact with and are among the principal players in neuroinflammation occurring in AD, understanding this crosstalk may disclose new potential targets of intervention in the treatment of neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Modulating cortical excitability based on a stimulus’ relevance to the task at hand is a component of sensory gating, and serves to protect higher cortical centers from being overwhelmed with irrelevant information (McIlroy et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2005; Wasaka et al., 2005). This study examined relevancy-based modulation of cortical excitability, and corresponding behavioral responses, in the face of distracting stimuli in participants with and without a history of concussion (mean age 22 ± 3 SD years; most recent concussion 39.1 ± 30 SD months). Participants were required to make a scaled motor response to the amplitudes of visual and tactile stimuli presented individually or concurrently. Task relevance was manipulated, and stimuli were occasionally presented with irrelevant distractors. Electroencephalography (EEG) and task accuracy data were collected from participants with and without a history of concussion. The somatosensory-evoked N70 event-related potential (ERP) was significantly modulated by task relevance in the control group but not in those with a history of concussion, and there was a significantly greater cost to task accuracy in the concussion history group when relevant stimuli were presented with an irrelevant distractor. This study demonstrated that relevancy-based modulation of electrophysiological responses and behavioral correlates of sensory gating differ in people with and without a history of concussion, even after patients were symptom-free and considered recovered from their injuries.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain detectable by highly invasive in vivo brain imaging or in post-mortem tissues. A non-invasive and inexpensive screening method is needed for early diagnosis of asymptomatic AD patients. The shared developmental origin and similarities with the brain make the retina a suitable surrogate tissue to assess Aβ load in AD. Using curcumin, a FluoroProbe that binds to Aβ, we labeled and measured the retinal fluorescence in vivo and compared with the immunohistochemical measurements of the brain and retinal Aβ load in the APP/PS1 mouse model. In vivo retinal images were acquired every 2 months using custom fluorescence scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (fSLO) after tail vein injections of curcumin in individual mice followed longitudinally from ages 5 to 19 months. At the same time points, 1–2 mice from the same cohort were sacrificed and immunohistochemistry was performed on their brain and retinal tissues. Results demonstrated cortical and retinal Aβ immunoreactivity were significantly greater in Tg than WT groups. Age-related increase in retinal Aβ immunoreactivity was greater in Tg than WT groups. Retinal Aβ immunoreactivity was present in the inner retinal layers and consisted of small speck-like extracellular deposits and intracellular labeling in the cytoplasm of a subset of retinal ganglion cells. In vivo retinal fluorescence with curcumin injection was significantly greater in older mice (11–19 months) than younger mice (5–9 months) in both Tg and WT groups. In vivo retinal fluorescence with curcumin injection was significantly greater in Tg than WT in older mice (ages 11–19 months). Finally, and most importantly, the correlation between in vivo retinal fluorescence with curcumin injection and Aβ immunoreactivity in the cortex was stronger in Tg compared to WT groups. Our data reveal that retina and brain of APP/PS1 Tg mice increasingly express Aβ with age. In vivo retinal fluorescence with curcumin correlated strongly with cortical Aβ immunohistochemistry in Tg mice. These findings suggest that using in vivo fSLO imaging of AD-susceptible retina may be a useful, non-invasive method of detecting Aβ in the retina as a surrogate indicator of Aβ load in the brain.</p>

<p>Background: A shift towards the dynamic measurement of physiologic resilience and improved technology incorporated into experimental paradigms in aging research is producing high-resolution data. Identifying the most appropriate analysis method for this type of data is a challenge. In this work, the functional principal component analysis (fPCA) was employed to demonstrate a data-driven approach to the analysis of high-resolution data in aging research.</p><p>Methods: Cerebral oxygenation during standing was measured in a large cohort [The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA)]. FPCA was performed on tissue saturation index (TSI) data. A regression analysis was then conducted with the functional principal component (fPC) scores as the explanatory variables and transition time as the response.</p><p>Results: The mean ± SD age of the analysis sample was 64 ± 8 years. Females made up 54% of the sample and overall, 43% had tertiary education. The first PC explained 96% of the variance in cerebral oxygenation upon standing and was related to a baseline shift. Subsequent components described the recovery to before-stand levels (fPC2), drop magnitude and initial recovery (fPC3 and fPC4) as well as a temporal shift in the location of the minimum TSI value (fPC5). Transition time was associated with components describing the magnitude and timing of the nadir.</p><p>Conclusions: Application of fPCA showed utility in reducing a large amount of data to a small number of parameters which summarize the inter-participant variation in TSI upon standing. A demonstration of principal component regression was provided to allow for continued use and development of data-driven approaches to high-resolution data analysis in aging research.</p>

<p>People with Down syndrome often exhibit deficiencies in wayfinding activities, particularly route learning (e.g., Courbois et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2014; Farran et al., 2015). Evidence concerning more sophisticated survey learning has been sparse. In the research reported here, two experiments are reported that evaluated survey learning of youth with DS and typically developing children (TD) matched on mental age. In Experiment 1, participants learned two overlapping routes consisting of three turns each through a virtual environment depicting 9 square city blocks. Following acquisition, they were tested on multiple measures of survey knowledge: finding a shortcut, identifying the direction of landmarks not currently visible from their location in the environment, and recognizing a bird’s-eye representation of the overall environment. Under these conditions, which should provide relatively optimal opportunities for survey learning, the participants with DS performed comparably to TD participants matched on non-verbal ability on all of our measures of survey learning. Hence, we concluded that people with DS can acquire some survey knowledge when tasked with learning a small environment and given the opportunity to do so. In Experiment 2, the experimenter navigated participants through a large, relatively complex, virtual environment along a circuitous path, beginning and ending at a target landmark. Then, the participants were placed at a pre-specified location in the environment that they had viewed previously and instructed to navigate to the same target (a door) using the shortest possible path from their current location. They completed the task three times: once after being shown the environment one time, once after three exposures, and once after five exposures. Results indicated that the participants with DS exhibited significantly less skill at identifying the shortcut than did the TD participants, with differences emerging as the number of exposures increased. Participants with DS were also less able to recall landmarks at the end of the experiment. Overall, however, the performance of both groups was relatively poor in both experiments – with the performance of participants with DS being worse as conditions became less optimal. These results were discussed in terms of underlying mechanisms that may account for variations in survey learning as environmental complexity increases.</p>

<p>Modern operational environments can place significant demands on a service member's cognitive resources, increasing the risk of errors or mishaps due to overburden. The ability to monitor cognitive burden and associated performance within operational environments is critical to improving mission readiness. As a key step toward a field-ready system, we developed a simulated marksmanship scenario with an embedded working memory task in an immersive virtual reality environment. As participants performed the marksmanship task, they were instructed to remember numbered targets and recall the sequence of those targets at the end of the trial. Low and high cognitive load conditions were defined as the recall of three- and six-digit strings, respectively. Physiological and behavioral signals recorded included speech, heart rate, breathing rate, and body movement. These features were input into a random forest classifier that significantly discriminated between the low- and high-cognitive load conditions (AUC = 0.94). Behavioral features of gait were the most informative, followed by features of speech. We also showed the capability to predict performance on the digit recall (AUC = 0.71) and marksmanship (AUC = 0.58) tasks. The experimental framework can be leveraged in future studies to quantify the interaction of other types of stressors and their impact on operational cognitive and physical performance.</p>

<p>The cholinergic potentiation of visual conditioning enhances visual acuity and discrimination of the trained stimulus. To determine if this also induces long-term plastic changes on cortical maps and connectivity in the visual cortex and higher associative areas, mesoscopic calcium imaging was performed in head-fixed awake GCaMP6s adult mice before and after conditioning. The conditioned stimulus (0.03 cpd, 30°, 100% contrast, 1 Hz-drifting gratings) was presented 10 min daily for a week. Saline or Donepezil (DPZ, 0.3 mg/kg, s.c.), a cholinesterase inhibitor that potentiates cholinergic transmission, were injected prior to each conditioning session and compared to a sham-conditioned group. Cortical maps of resting state and evoked response to the monocular presentation of conditioned or non-conditioned stimulus (30°, 50 and 75% contrast; 90°, 50, 75, and 100% contrast) were established. Amplitude, duration, and latency of the peak response, as well as size of activation were measured in the primary visual cortex (V1), secondary visual areas (AL, A, AM, PM, LM, RL), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and higher cortical areas. Visual stimulation increased calcium signaling in all primary and secondary visual areas, the RSC, but no other cortices. There were no significant effects of sham-conditioning or conditioning alone, but DPZ treatment during conditioning significantly decreased the integrated neuronal activity of superficial layers evoked by the conditioned stimulus in V1, AL, PM, and LM. The activity of downstream cortical areas was not changed. The size of the activated area was decreased in V1 and PM, and the signal-to-noise ratio was decreased in AL and PM. Interestingly, signal correlation was seen only between V1, the ventral visual pathway, and the RSC, and was decreased by DPZ administration. The resting state activity was slightly correlated and rarely affected by treatments, except between binocular and monocular V1 in both hemispheres. In conclusion, cholinergic potentiation of visual conditioning induced change in visual processing in the superficial cortical layers. This effect might be a key mechanism in the establishment of the fine cortical tuning in response to the conditioned visual stimulus.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke causes brain tissue damage and may release central nervous system (CNS)-specific peptides to the periphery. Neural antigen presentation in the lymphoid tissue could prime immune cells and result in adaptive immune response. However, autoimmune responses against neural antigens are not commonly uncovered after stroke. We studied the brain tissue of nine fatal stroke cases and the blood of a cohort of 13 patients and 11 controls. Flow cytometry carried out in three of the brain samples showed CD8 and CD4 T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the ventricles in the patient deceased 1 day poststroke, T cells with an activated phenotype in the CSF of the patient that died at day 6, and T cells in the ischemic brain tissue in the patient deceased 140 days after stroke onset. Immunohistochemistry showed higher T cell numbers in the core of the lesion of the patient deceased 18 days post-stroke than in the patients deceased from 1 to 5 days post-stroke. In blood samples, we studied whether lymphocytes were primed in the periphery against neural antigens at sequential times (on admission, day 5, and day 90) after stroke. T lymphocytes of stroke patients produced IFN-γ and TNF-α and responded to MBP peptides by increasing their production of TNF-α and IL-10 at admission, but not at later time points. In contrast, IL-4 producing T cells showed progressive increases. Higher percentages of TNF-α producing T lymphocytes at admission were independently associated with poorer outcomes at 90 days. However, we did not detect T cell responses to neural-antigen stimulation 90 days post-stroke. Altogether the results suggest acute T cell priming in the periphery in acute stroke, T cell trafficking from the CSF to the ischemic brain tissue, and the existence of active mechanisms preventing autoreactivity.</p>

<p>Aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) regulates general aging and lifespan. However, the contribution of IGF-1 to age-related AD pathology and progression is highly controversial. Based on our previous work, AβPP/PS1 double transgenic mice, which express human mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS-1), demonstrated a decrease in brain IGF-1 levels when they were crossed with IGF-1 deficient Ames dwarf mice (df/df). Subsequently, a reduction in gliosis, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition, and Aβ<sub>1–40/42</sub> concentrations were observed in this mouse model. This supported the hypothesis that IGF-1 may contribute to the progression of the disease. To assess the role of IGF-1 in AD, 9–10-month-old male littermate control wild type and AβPP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into two treatment groups including control vehicle (DMSO) and picropodophyllin (PPP), a selective, competitive, and reversible IGF-1R inhibitor. The brain penetrant inhibitor was given ip. at 1 mg/kg/day. Mice were sacrificed after 7 days of daily injection and the brains, spleens, and livers were collected to quantify histologic and biochemical changes. The PPP-treated AβPP/PS1 mice demonstrated attenuated insoluble Aβ<sub>1–40/42</sub>. Additionally, an attenuation in microgliosis and protein p-tyrosine levels was observed due to drug treatment in the hippocampus. Our data suggest IGF-1R signaling is associated with disease progression in this mouse model. More importantly, modulation of the brain IGF-1R signaling pathway, even at mid-life, was enough to attenuate aspects of the disease phenotype. This suggests that small molecule therapy targeting the IGF-1R pathway may be viable for late-stage disease treatment.</p>

<p>Adiponectin, a cytokine secreted by mature adipocytes, proves to be neuroprotective. We have previously reported that running triggers adiponectin up-regulation which subsequently promotes generation of hippocampal neurons and thereby alleviates depression-like behaviors in non-stressed mice. However, under the stressing condition, whether adiponectin could still exert antidepressant-like effects following exercise remained unexplored. In this study, by means of repeated corticosterone injections to mimic stress insult and voluntary wheel running as physical exercise intervention, we examined whether exercise-elicited antidepressive effects might involve adiponectin’s regulation on hippocampal neurogenesis and dendritic plasticity in stressed mice. Here we show that repeated injections of corticosterone inhibited hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired dendritic morphology of neurons in the dentate gyrus of both wild-type and adiponectin-knockout mice comparably, which subsequently evoked depression-like behaviors. Voluntary wheel running attenuated corticosterone-suppressed neurogenesis and enhanced dendritic plasticity in the hippocampus, ultimately reducing depression-like behaviors in wild-type, but not adiponectin-knockout mice. We further demonstrate that such proneurogenic effects were potentially achieved through activation of the AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) pathway. Our study provides the first evidence that adiponectin signaling is essential for physical exercise-triggered effects on stress-elicited depression by retaining the normal proliferation of neural progenitors and dendritic morphology of neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, which may depend on activation of the AMPK pathway.</p>

<p>After an injury to the central nervous system (CNS), functional recovery is limited by the inability of severed axons to regenerate and form functional connections with appropriate target neurons beyond the injury. Despite tremendous advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of axon growth, and of the inhibitory factors in the injured CNS that prevent it, disappointingly little progress has been made in restoring function to human patients with CNS injuries, such as spinal cord injury (SCI), through regenerative therapies. Clearly, the large number of overlapping neuron-intrinsic and -extrinsic growth-inhibitory factors attenuates the benefit of neutralizing any one target. More daunting is the distances human axons would have to regenerate to reach some threshold number of target neurons, e.g., those that occupy one complete spinal segment, compared to the distances required in most experimental models, such as mice and rats. However, the difficulties inherent in studying mechanisms of axon regeneration in the mature CNS in vivo have caused researchers to rely heavily on extrapolation from studies of axon regeneration in peripheral nerve, or of growth cone-mediated axon development in vitro and in vivo. Unfortunately, evidence from several animal models, including the transected lamprey spinal cord, has suggested important differences between regeneration of mature CNS axons and growth of axons in peripheral nerve, or during embryonic development. Specifically, long-distance regeneration of severed axons may not involve the actin-myosin molecular motors that guide embryonic growth cones in developing axons. Rather, non-growth cone-mediated axon elongation may be required to propel injured axons in the mature CNS. If so, it may be necessary to use other experimental models to promote regeneration that is sufficient to contact a critical number of target neurons distal to a CNS lesion. This review examines the cytoskeletal underpinnings of axon growth, focusing on the elongating axon tip, to gain insights into how CNS axons respond to injury, and how this might affect the development of regenerative therapies for SCI and other CNS injuries.</p>

<p>We have developed a deep learning-based computer algorithm to recognize and predict retinal differentiation in stem cell-derived organoids based on bright-field imaging. The three-dimensional “organoid” approach for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSC) into retinal and other neural tissues has become a major in vitro strategy to recapitulate development. We decided to develop a universal, robust, and non-invasive method to assess retinal differentiation that would not require chemical probes or reporter gene expression. We hypothesized that basic-contrast bright-field (BF) images contain sufficient information on tissue specification, and it is possible to extract this data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Retina-specific Rx-green fluorescent protein mouse embryonic reporter stem cells have been used for all of the differentiation experiments in this work. The BF images of organoids have been taken on day 5 and fluorescent on day 9. To train the CNN, we utilized a transfer learning approach: ImageNet pre-trained ResNet50v2, VGG19, Xception, and DenseNet121 CNNs had been trained on labeled BF images of the organoids, divided into two categories (retina and non-retina), based on the fluorescent reporter gene expression. The best-performing classifier with ResNet50v2 architecture showed a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve score of 0.91 on a test dataset. A comparison of the best-performing CNN with the human-based classifier showed that the CNN algorithm performs better than the expert in predicting organoid fate (84% vs. 67 ± 6% of correct predictions, respectively), confirming our original hypothesis. Overall, we have demonstrated that the computer algorithm can successfully recognize and predict retinal differentiation in organoids before the onset of reporter gene expression. This is the first demonstration of CNN’s ability to classify stem cell-derived tissue in vitro.</p>

<p>Lipids play a major role for several brain functions, including cognition and memory. There is a series of work on individual lipids showing involvement in memory mechanisms, a concise lipidome was not reported so far. Moreover, there is no evidence for age-related memory decline and there is only work on brain of young vs. aging animals. Aging animals, however, are not a homogeneous group with respect to memory impairments, thus animals with impaired and unimpaired memory can be discriminated. Following recent studies of hippocampal lipid profiles and hypothalamus controlled hormone profiles, the aim of this study was to compare hypothalamic, lipidomic changes in male Sprague-Dawley rats between young (YM), old impaired (OMI) and old unimpaired (OMU) males. Grouping criterions for aged rats were evaluated by testing them in a spatial memory task, the hole-board. YMs were also tested. Subsequently brains were removed, dissected and hypothalami were kept at −80°C until sample preparation and analysis on liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Significant differences in the amounts of a series of lipids from several classes could be detected between young and aged and between OMI and OMU. A large number of lipids were increased in OMI and a smaller number in OMU as compared to young rats. Differences of lipid ratios (log2 of ratio) between OMI and OMU consisted of glycerophosphocholines (aPC 36:2 and 36:3; PC 34:0, 36:1, 36:3 and 40:2); Glycerophosphoethanolamines (aPE 34:2, 38:5 and 40:5; LPE 18:1, 20:1, 20:4, 22:4 and 22:6; PE36:1 and 38:4); glycerophosphoserines (PS 36:1, 40:4, and 40:6); triacylglycerol TG 52:4; ceramide Cer 17:2 and sphingomyelin SM 20:0. Thus, hypothalamic lipid profiles across different lipid classes discriminate aged male animals into OMU and OMI. The underlying mechanisms may be related to different functional networks of lipids in memory mechanisms and differences in metabolic processes. The study underlines the importance of lipidomics in the pathophysiology of age-related cognitive decline. The necessity of evaluating the cognitive status of aged subjects by behavioral tests results in more specific detection of critical lipids in memory decline, on which now can be focused in subsequent memory studies in animals and humans.</p>

<p>Cognitive impairment is a key clinical feature of ischemic leukoaraiosis (ILA); however, the underlying neurobiological mechanism is still unclear. ILA has been associated with widespread gray and white matter (WM) damage mainly located in cortical-cortical and cortico-subcortical pathways. A total of 36 patients with ILA (Fazekas rating score ≥2) and 31 healthy controls (HCs) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments (covering four cognitive domains, i.e., information processing speed, episodic memory, executive and visuospatial function) and resting-state functional MRI scans. Graph theory-based analyses were employed to explore the topological organization of the brain connectome in ILA patients, and we further sought to explore the associations of connectome-based metrics and neuropsychological performances. An efficient small-world architecture in the functional brain connectome was observed in the ILA and control groups. Moreover, compared with the HCs, the ILA patients showed increased path length and decreased network efficiency (i.e., global and local efficiency) in their functional brain networks. Further network-based statistic (NBS) analysis revealed a functional-disconnected network in ILA, which is comprised of functional connections linking different brain modules (i.e., default mode, frontoparietal, ventral attention and limbic systems) and connections within single modules (i.e., ventral attention and limbic systems). Intriguingly, the abnormal network metrics correlated with cognitive deficits in ILA patients. Therefore, our findings provide further evidence to support the concept that ILA pathologies could disrupt brain connections, impairing network functioning, and cognition via a “disconnection syndrome.”</p>

<p>by Joe Hilton, Matt J. Keeling</p>

The 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/45RPAuJPLbM" width="1" />

<p>by Julia Berezutskaya, Zachary V. Freudenburg, Umut Güçlü, Marcel A. J. van Gerven, Nick F. Ramsey</p>

Understanding how the human brain processes auditory input remains a challenge. Traditionally, a distinction between lower- and higher-level sound features is made, but their definition depends on a specific theoretical framework and might not match the neural representation of sound. Here, we postulate that constructing a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features, could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses. We collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film. The raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses. The model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well to a second dataset, where new participants watched a different film. The extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions. Specifically, several features encoded speech-related acoustic properties with some features exhibiting shorter latency profiles (associated with responses in posterior perisylvian cortex) and others exhibiting longer latency profiles (associated with responses in anterior perisylvian cortex). Our results support and extend the current view on speech perception by demonstrating the presence of temporal hierarchies in the perisylvian cortex and involvement of cortical sites outside of this region during audiovisual speech perception.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JUwl69lnZ0w" width="1" />

<p>by August George, Paola Bisignano, John M. Rosenberg, Michael Grabe, Daniel M. Zuckerman</p>

Motivated by growing evidence for pathway heterogeneity and alternative functions of molecular machines, we demonstrate a computational approach for investigating two questions: (1) Are there multiple mechanisms (state-space pathways) by which a machine can perform a given function, such as cotransport across a membrane? (2) How can additional functionality, such as proofreading/error-correction, be built into machine function using standard biochemical processes? Answers to these questions will aid both the understanding of molecular-scale cell biology and the design of synthetic machines. Focusing on transport in this initial study, we sample a variety of mechanisms by employing Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo. Trial moves adjust transition rates among an automatically generated set of conformational and binding states while maintaining fidelity to thermodynamic principles and a user-supplied fitness/functionality goal. Each accepted move generates a new model. The simulations yield both single and mixed reaction pathways for cotransport in a simple environment with a single substrate along with a driving ion. In a “competitive” environment including an additional decoy substrate, several qualitatively distinct reaction pathways are found which are capable of extremely high discrimination coupled to a leak of the driving ion, akin to proofreading. The array of functional models would be difficult to find by intuition alone in the complex state-spaces of interest.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TeY6FGZX6lk" width="1" />

<p>by Alex C. Ferris, Richard O. J. H. Stutt, David Godding, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>

Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a rapidly spreading viral disease that affects a major food security crop in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there are several proposed management interventions to minimize loss in infected fields. Field-scale data comparing the effectiveness of these interventions individually and in combination are limited and expensive to collect. Using a stochastic epidemiological model for the spread and management of CBSD in individual fields, we simulate the effectiveness of a range of management interventions. Specifically we compare the removal of diseased plants by roguing, preferential selection of planting material, deployment of virus-free ‘clean seed’ and pesticide on crop yield and disease status of individual fields with varying levels of whitefly density crops under low and high disease pressure. We examine management interventions for sustainable production of planting material in clean seed systems and how to improve survey protocols to identify the presence of CBSD in a field or quantify the within-field prevalence of CBSD. We also propose guidelines for practical, actionable recommendations for the deployment of management strategies in regions of sub-Saharan Africa under different disease and whitefly pressure.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZRfC7c2MJxM" width="1" />

<p>by Paola Bisignano, Michael A. Lee, August George, Daniel M. Zuckerman, Michael Grabe, John M. Rosenberg</p>

Membrane transport is generally thought to occur via an alternating access mechanism in which the transporter adopts at least two states, accessible from two different sides of the membrane to exchange substrates from the extracellular environment and the cytoplasm or from the cytoplasm and the intracellular matrix of the organelles (only in eukaryotes). In recent years, a number of high resolution structures have supported this general framework for a wide class of transport molecules, although additional states along the transport pathway are emerging as critically important. Given that substrate binding is often weak in order to enhance overall transport rates, there exists the distinct possibility that transporters may transport the incorrect substrate. This is certainly the case for many pharmaceutical compounds that are absorbed in the gut or cross the blood brain barrier through endogenous transporters. Docking studies on the bacterial sugar transporter vSGLT reveal that many highly toxic compounds are compatible with binding to the orthosteric site, further motivating the selective pressure for additional modes of selectivity. Motivated by recent work in which we observed failed substrate delivery in a molecular dynamics simulation where the energized ion still goes down its concentration gradient, we hypothesize that some transporters evolved to harness this ‘slip’ mechanism to increase substrate selectivity and reduce the uptake of toxic molecules. Here, we test this idea by constructing and exploring a kinetic transport model that includes a slip pathway. While slip reduces the overall productive flux, when coupled with a second toxic molecule that is more prone to slippage, the overall substrate selectivity dramatically increases, suppressing the accumulation of the incorrect compound. We show that the mathematical framework for increased substrate selectivity in our model is analogous to the classic proofreading mechanism originally proposed for tRNA synthase; however, because the transport cycle is reversible we identified conditions in which the selectivity is essentially infinite and incorrect substrates are exported from the cell in a ‘detoxification’ mode. The cellular consequences of proofreading and membrane slippage are discussed as well as the impact on future drug development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pU4pRk9DLoQ" width="1" />

In the absence of any task, both the brain and spinal cord exhibit spontaneous intrinsic activity organised in a set of functionally relevant neural networks. However, whether such resting-state networks (RSNs) are interconnected across the brain and spinal cord is unclear. Here, we used a unique scanning protocol to acquire functional images of both brain and cervical spinal cord (CSC) simultaneously and examined their spatiotemporal correspondence in humans. We show that the brain and spinal cord activities are strongly correlated during rest periods, and specific spinal cord regions are functionally linked to consistently reported brain sensorimotor RSNs. The functional organisation of these networks follows well-established anatomical principles, including the contralateral correspondence between the spinal hemicords and brain hemispheres as well as sensory versus motor segregation of neural pathways along the brain–spinal cord axis. Thus, our findings reveal a unified functional organisation of sensorimotor networks in the entire central nervous system (CNS) at rest.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bCceWAgAYm4" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25811?af=R">Evolution of Alzheimer's Disease Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers in Early Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We analyzed the longitudinal profile of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in early Parkinson's disease (PD) compared with healthy controls (HCs) and tested baseline CSF biomarkers for prediction of clinical decline in PD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Amyloid‐β 1 to 42 (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), total tau (t‐tau) and phosphorylated tau (p‐tau) at the threonine 181 position were measured using the high‐precision Roche Elecsys electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in all available CSF samples from longitudinally studied patients with PD (n = 416) and HCs (n = 192) followed for up to 3 years in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Longitudinal CSF and clinical data were analyzed with linear‐mixed effects models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found patients with PD had lower CSF t‐tau (median = 157.7 pg/mL; range = 80.9–467.0); p‐tau (median = 13.4 pg/mL; range = 8.0–40.1), and Aβ<sub>42</sub> (median = 846.2 pg/mL; range = 238.8–3,707.0) than HCs at baseline (CSF t‐tau median = 173.5 pg/mL; range = 82.0–580.8; p‐tau median = 15.4 pg/mL; range = 8.1–73.6; and Aβ<sub>42</sub> median = 926.5 pg/mL; range = 239.1–3,297.0; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.05–0.001) and a moderate‐to‐strong correlation among these biomarkers in both patients with PD and HCs (Rho = 0.50–0.97; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). Of the patients with PD, 31.5% had pathologically low levels of CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> at baseline and these patients with PD had lower p‐tau levels (median = 10.8 pg/mL; range = 8.0–32.8) compared with 27.7% of HCs with pathologically low CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> (CSF p‐tau median = 12.8 pg/mL; range 8.2–73.6; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.03)<sub>.</sub> In longitudinal CSF analysis, we found patients with PD had greater decline in CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> (mean difference = −41.83 pg/mL; <i>p </i> = 0.03) and CSF p‐tau (mean difference = −0.38 pg/mL; <i>p </i> = 0.03) at year 3 compared with HCs. Baseline CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> values predicted small but measurable decline on cognitive, autonomic, and motor function in early PD.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest baseline CSF AD biomarkers may have prognostic value in early PD and that the dynamic change of these markers, although modest over a 3‐year period, suggest biomarker profiles in PD may deviate from healthy aging. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>
