              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13360">Symbolic dynamics of joint brain states during dyadic coordination</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.13360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to investigate the brain mechanisms that support coordination of behavior between individuals. Brain states in single individuals defined by the patterns of functional connectivity between brain regions are used to create joint symbolic representations of the evolution of brain states in two or more individuals performing a task together. These symbolic dynamics can be analyzed to reveal aspects of the dynamics of joint brain states that are related to coordination or other interactive behaviors. We apply this approach to simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) data from pairs of subjects engaged in two different modes of finger-tapping coordination tasks (synchronization and syncopation) under different interaction conditions (Uncoupled, Leader-Follower, and Mutual) to explore the neural mechanisms of multi-person motor coordination. Our results reveal that the dyads exhibit mostly the same joint symbols in different interaction conditions - the most important differences are reflected in the symbolic dynamics. Recurrence analysis shows that interaction influences the dwell time in specific joint symbols and the structure of joint symbol sequences (motif length). In synchronization, increasing feedback promotes stability with longer dwell times and motif length. In syncopation, Leader-Follower interactions enhance stability (increase dwell time and motif length), but Mutual feedback dramatically reduces stability. Network analysis reveals distinct topological changes with task and feedback. In synchronization, stronger coupling stabilizes a few states restricting the pattern of flow between states, preserving a core-periphery structure of the joint brain states. In syncopation, a more distributed flow amongst a larger set of joint brain states reduces the dominance of core joint brain states.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04928">Triple equivalence for the emergence of biological intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.04928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterising the intelligence of biological organisms is challenging. This work considers intelligent algorithms developed evolutionarily within neural systems. Mathematical analyses unveil a natural equivalence between canonical neural networks, variational Bayesian inference under a class of partially observable Markov decision processes, and differentiable Turing machines, by showing that they minimise the shared Helmholtz energy. Consequently, canonical neural networks can biologically plausibly equip Turing machines and conduct variational Bayesian inferences of external Turing machines in the environment. Applying Helmholtz energy minimisation at the species level facilitates deriving active Bayesian model selection inherent in natural selection, resulting in the emergence of adaptive algorithms. In particular, canonical neural networks with two mental actions can separately memorise transition mappings of multiple external Turing machines to form a universal machine. These propositions were corroborated by numerical simulations of algorithm implementation and neural network evolution. These notions offer a universal characterisation of biological intelligence emerging from evolution in terms of Bayesian model selection and belief updating.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01564">Semialgebraic Neural Networks: From roots to representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.01564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many numerical algorithms in scientific computing -- particularly in areas like numerical linear algebra, PDE simulation, and inverse problems -- produce outputs that can be represented by semialgebraic functions; that is, the graph of the computed function can be described by finitely many polynomial equalities and inequalities. In this work, we introduce Semialgebraic Neural Networks (SANNs), a neural network architecture capable of representing any bounded semialgebraic function, and computing such functions up to the accuracy of a numerical ODE solver chosen by the programmer. Conceptually, we encode the graph of the learned function as the kernel of a piecewise polynomial selected from a class of functions whose roots can be evaluated using a particular homotopy continuation method. We show by construction that the SANN architecture is able to execute this continuation method, thus evaluating the learned semialgebraic function. Furthermore, the architecture can exactly represent even discontinuous semialgebraic functions by executing a continuation method on each connected component of the target function. Lastly, we provide example applications of these networks and show they can be trained with traditional deep-learning techniques.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01725">Subject Specific Deep Learning Model for Motor Imagery Direction Decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.01725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hemispheric strokes impair motor control in contralateral body parts, necessitating effective rehabilitation strategies. Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) promote neuroplasticity, aiding the recovery of motor functions. While deep learning has shown promise in decoding MI actions for stroke rehabilitation, existing studies largely focus on bilateral MI actions and are limited to offline evaluations. Decoding directional information from unilateral MI, however, offers a more natural control interface with greater degrees of freedom but remains challenging due to spatially overlapping neural activity. This work proposes a novel deep learning framework for online decoding of binary directional MI signals from the dominant hand of 20 healthy subjects. The proposed method employs EEGNet-based convolutional filters to extract temporal and spatial features. The EEGNet model is enhanced by Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers that rank the electrode importance and feature maps. A subject-independent model is initially trained using calibration data from multiple subjects and fine-tuned for subject-specific adaptation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using subject-specific online session data. The proposed method achieved an average right vs left binary direction decoding accuracy of 58.7 +\- 8% for unilateral MI tasks, outperforming the existing deep learning models. Additionally, the SE-layer ranking offers insights into electrode contribution, enabling potential subject-specific BCI optimization. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in advancing MI-BCI applications for a more natural and effective control of BCI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15021">Event-based backpropagation on the neuromorphic platform SpiNNaker2</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.15021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to replicate the brain's capabilities for energy efficient and parallel information processing, promising a solution to the increasing demand for faster and more efficient computational systems. Efficient training of neural networks on neuromorphic hardware requires the development of training algorithms that retain the sparsity of spike-based communication during training. Here, we report on the first implementation of event-based backpropagation on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic hardware platform. We use EventProp, an algorithm for event-based backpropagation in spiking neural networks (SNNs), to compute exact gradients using sparse communication of error signals between neurons. Our implementation computes multi-layer networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons using discretized versions of the differential equations and their adjoints, and uses event packets to transmit spikes and error signals between network layers. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of batch-parallelized, on-chip training of SNNs using the Yin Yang dataset, and provide an off-chip implementation for efficient prototyping, hyper-parameter search, and hybrid training methods.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The evolution of digital technology enhances the broadening of a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s intellectual growth. Research points out that implementing innovative applications of the digital world improves human social, cognitive, and metacognitive behavior. Artificial intelligence chatbots are yet another innovative human-made construct. These are forms of software that simulate human conversation, understand and process user input, and provide personalized responses. Executive function includes a set of higher mental processes necessary for formulating, planning, and achieving a goal. The present study aims to investigate executive function reinforcement through artificial intelligence chatbots, outlining potentials, limitations, and future research suggestions. Specifically, the study examined three research questions: the use of conversational chatbots in executive functioning training, their impact on executive-cognitive skills, and the duration of any improvements. Methods: The assessment of the existing literature was implemented using the systematic review method, according to the PRISMA 2020 Principles. The avalanche search method was employed to conduct a source search in the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and complementary Google Scholar. This systematic review included studies from 2021 to the present using experimental, observational, or mixed methods. It included studies using AI-based chatbots or conversationalists to support executive functions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, memory, attention, cognitive load, and behavioral changes. In addition, this study included general populations with specific neurological conditions, all peer-reviewed, written in English, and with full-text access. However, the study excluded studies before 2021, the literature reviews, systematic reviews, non-AI-based chatbots or conversationalists, studies not targeting the range of executive skills and abilities, studies not written in English, and studies without open access. The criteria aligned with the study objectives, ensuring a focus on AI chatbots and the impact of conversational agents on executive function. The initial collection totaled n = 115 articles; however, the eligibility requirements led to the final selection of n = 10 studies. Results: The findings of the studies suggested positive effects of using AI chatbots to enhance and improve executive skills. Although, several limitations were identified, making it still difficult to generalize and reproduce their effects. Conclusions: AI chatbots are an innovative artificial intelligence tool that can function as a digital assistant for learning and expanding executive skills, contributing to the cognitive, metacognitive, and social development of the individual. However, its use in executive skills training is at a primary stage. The findings highlighted the need for a unified framework for reference and future studies, better study designs, diverse populations, larger sample sizes of participants, and longitudinal studies that observe the long-term effects of their use.</p>

">An Enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder-Based Normative Model for Neuroimaging Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Normative modelling in neuroimaging provides a powerful framework for quantifying individual deviations from expected brain measures as a function of relevant covariates. While most established approaches have focused on analysing distinct variables in isolation, there is a growing need for deep learning-based methods capable of handling multiple response variables simultaneously. Conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) have previously been applied in this context; however, existing inference methods still face challenges in providing reliable probabilistic predictions. In this study, we introduce an enhanced cVAE-based framework for normative modelling of neuroimaging data. Our key contribution is the development of a novel inference method that integrates latent space sampling and bootstrapping. This method directly leverages the generative nature of cVAEs to estimate the conditional distributions of brain measures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes as a test case for developing, testing, and validating the model. Our dataset includes 8,551 normotensive and 18,180 hypertensive participants from the UK Biobank. We evaluated our method against three well-established and popular normative modelling techniques, including Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS), Multivariate Fractional Polynomial Regression (MFPR), and Hierarchical Bayesian Regression (HBR). Our results indicate that the proposed cVAE-based framework achieves comparable performance across various metrics, while capturing individual deviations that correlate with the severity of hypertension. The model is particularly well-suited for high-dimensional, non-linear data, making it a robust tool for assessing individual deviations in brain structure. This enhanced normative modelling architecture paves the way for more nuanced and reliable assessments of brain health, with potential implications for personalised medicine and early detection of neurological disorders.

">Spectral acoustic contributions to musical pleasure are dynamically shaped by autonomic neural inputs</a></h4>

              
                Most people enjoy music and often use music to regulate their emotions. Although pleasure derived from music-listening has been shown to be mediated by dopaminergic signals in the mesolimbic reward network, its relationship with physiology is still poorly understood. Here, we introduced time-warped representational similarity analysis (twRSA) to directly map dynamic representations of multiple modalities across variable-duration stimuli. Our method revealed that although time-varying spectral and tonal acoustic features predicted changes in autonomic neural responses (measured via cardiac, pupil, and respiratory activity) during music-listening, only a small subset was in fact relevant to listeners' on-line pleasure ratings. Despite that, we identified a weak mediation effect of physiology on shaping musical pleasure. Our results thus indicate that whilst musical pleasure may be embodied in bodily responses, the mapping between subjective experience and physiology is likely one-to-many--in line with psychological construction theories of emotion--and not one-to-one as is commonly assumed in classical basic emotion theories.

">Lack of ADAP1/Centaurin-α1 Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment and Neuropathological Hallmarks in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                ArfGAP, with dual PH domain-containing protein 1/Centaurin-(ADAP1/CentA1), is a brain-enriched and highly conserved Arf6 GTPase-activating and Ras-anchoring protein. CentA1 is involved in dendritic outgrowth and arborization, synaptogenesis, and axonal polarization by regulating the actin cytoskeleton dynamics. An increased level of CentA1 and its association with amyloid plaques in the human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain suggest a role for this protein in AD progression. To understand the role of CentA1 in neurodegeneration, we crossbred CentA1 KO mice with the J20 mouse model of AD. We evaluated the behavioral and neuropathological hallmarks of AD and the gene expression profiles in J20 and J20 crossed with CentA1 KO mice (J20 x CentA1 KO) to determine the impact of eliminating CentA1 expression on AD-related phenotypes. Spatial memory assessed by the Morris Water Maze test showed significant impairment in J20 mice, which was rescued in J20 x CentA1 KO. Moreover, neuropathological hallmarks of AD, such as deposits of amyloid plaques and neuroinflammation, were significantly reduced in J20 x CentA1 KO. To identify potential mediators of AD phenotype rescue, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between genotypes. We found that changes in the gene profile by deletion of CentA1 from J20 (J20 x CentA1 KO vs J20) were anti-correlated with changes caused by APP overexpression (J20 vs WT), consistent with the rescues of J20 phenotypes by CentA1 KO. In summary, our data indicate that CentA1 is required for the progression of AD phenotypes and that targeting CentA1 signaling at mitochondria might have therapeutic potential for AD prevention or treatment.

">Manipulating Environmental Affordances via Intrinsic Measurement: Evidence from Sensorimotor Brain Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                According to the view of ecological psychology, affordances are perceived directly through the interaction between the observer and the environment, and thus body scaled. Considering the actions from different object agent distances, Tosoni and colleagues have provided a conceptual distinction concerning two types of affordances: macro affordances (also called environmental affordance) and micro affordances. Both of these two types of affordances have been investigated in psychological research since the beginning of this century. However, most of the environmental affordances have not yet been manipulated with a body-scaled setting in the prior research protocol. Inspired by the intrinsic measurement introduced by ecological psychologist Warren (1984) and focusing on environmental affordances, the present study adapted the task of Djebbara et al. (2019) by defining transitional affordance as the body-door height ratios. The current results from subjective data, EEG data and behavioral data showed that affordance can be manipulated intrinsically and covaried with agents' experience, perception and motor interaction. The perception of environmental affordances was based on intrinsic optical information for the relationship between environmental properties and capacities of the observer's own action system. It thus provides empirical support for the need to link ecological psychology and neuro-architecture in experimental protocols.

">C. elegans interprets dietary quality through context-dependent serotonergic modulation</a></h4>

              
                Animals sense their metabolic needs to guide foraging decisions using neuronal pathways that are only partly understood. Here, we systematically investigate how foraging in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is influenced by its bacterial diet, E. coli. By screening C. elegans behavior on 3983 E. coli knockout strains, we identified 22 E. coli metabolic mutants that are aversive to C. elegans in a long-term foraging assay. These include the global metabolic regulator CRP and genes affecting cysteine synthesis, vitamin B6 synthesis, and iron uptake. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with feeding in many animals, allows C. elegans to distinguish wild-type E. coli from these mediocre diets through bidirectional signaling. Serotonin produced by the ADF serotonergic neurons supports attraction to wild-type E. coli with the serotonin receptor genes ser-4 and ser-5, whereas serotonin produced by the NSM serotonergic neurons differentially drives aversion to two mediocre diets through four serotonin receptor genes, ser-1, ser-7, mod-1, and lgc-50. Serotonin receptors act in multiple target neurons, including octopamine-producing neurons that suppress aversion across all diets. In addition, dopamine promotes aversion, in part by inhibiting octopaminergic neurons. These results reveal interactions between neuromodulatory circuits in the context-dependent evaluation of dietary quality.

">Representational drift reflects ongoing balancing of stochastic changes by Hebbian learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidence indicates that even under stable environmental and behavioural conditions responses to sensory stimuli undergo continuous reformatting over the course of days, a condition described as representational drift. However, the processes underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Examining the dynamics of signal and noise correlations among neuron pairs in chronic calcium imaging experiments in the mouse auditory cortex, we investigate how activity-dependent, Hebbian-like plasticity, and activity-independent, stochastic synaptic processes contribute to representational drift. We found that signal correlations predict future noise correlations, suggesting that stimulus-induced co-activation leads to increased effective connectivity between neuron pairs. Moreover, simple linear network models were able to account for the observed temporal dependencies between signal and noise correlations, but only if both Hebbian-like plasticity and stochastic changes of either inputs or recurrent synapses contribute to representational drift. In conclusion, our findings suggest that continuous sensory input-driven Hebbian-like plasticity can balance ongoing stochastic synaptic changes, thereby preventing the network's functional degradation.

">Misspelled-word reading modulates late cortical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Literate humans can effortlessly interpret tens of thousands of words, even when the words are sometimes written incorrectly. This phenomenon suggests a flexible nature of reading that can endure a certain amount of noise. In this study, we investigated where and when brain responses diverged for conditions where misspelled words were resolved as real words or not. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to track the cortical activity as the participants read words with different degrees of misspelling that were perceived to range from real words to complete pseudowords, as confirmed by their behavioral responses. In particular, we were interested in how lexical information survives (or not) along the uncertainty spectrum, and how the corresponding brain activation patterns evolve spatiotemporally. We identified three brain regions that were notably modulated by misspellings: left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT), superior temporal cortex (ST), and precentral cortex (pC). This suggests that resolving misspelled words into stored concepts involves an interplay between orthographic, semantic, and phonological processing. Temporally, these regions showed fairly late and sustained responses selectively to misspelled words. Specifically, an increasing level of misspelling increased the response in ST from 300 ms after stimulus onset; a functionally fairly similar but weaker effect was observed in pC. In vOT, misspelled words were sharply distinguished from real words notably later, after 700 ms. A linear mixed effects (LME) analysis further showed that pronounced and long-lasting misspelling effects appeared first in ST and then in pC, with shorter-lasting activation also observed in vOT. We conclude that reading misspelled words engages brain areas typically associated with language processing, but in a manner that cannot be interpreted merely as a rapid feedforward mechanism. Instead, feedback interactions likely contribute to the late effects observed during misspelled-word reading.

	<p>Background: In neuroscience research about functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), accurate inter-subject image registration is the basis for effective statistical analysis. Traditional fMRI registration methods are usually based on high-resolution structural MRI with clear anatomical structure features. However, this registration method based on structural information cannot achieve accurate functional consistency between subjects since the functional regions do not necessarily correspond to anatomical structures. In recent years, fMRI registration methods based on functional information have emerged, which usually ignore the importance of structural MRI information. Methods: In this study, we proposed a non-rigid cycle consistent bidirectional network with Transformer for unsupervised deformable functional MRI registration. The work achieves fMRI registration through structural MRI registration, and functional information is introduced to improve registration performance. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional registration network that implements forward and reverse registration between image pairs and apply Transformer in the registration network to establish remote spatial mapping between image voxels. Functional and structural information are integrated by introducing the local functional connectivity pattern, the local functional connectivity features of the whole brain are extracted as functional information. The proposed registration method was experimented on real fMRI datasets, and qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the quality of the registration method were implemented on the test dataset using relevant evaluation metrics. We implemented group ICA analysis in brain functional networks after registration. Functional consistency was evaluated on the resulting t-maps. Results: Compared with non-learning-based methods (Affine, Syn) and learning-based methods (Transmorph-tiny, Cyclemorph, VoxelMorph x2), our method improves the peak t-value of t-maps on DMN, VN, CEN, and SMN to 18.7, 16.5, 16.6, and 17.3 and the mean number of suprathreshold voxels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, t &amp;amp;gt; 5.01) on the four networks to 2596.25, and there is an average improvement in peak t-value of 23.79%, 12.74%, 12.27%, 7.32%, and 5.43%. Conclusions: The experimental results show that the registration method of this study improves the structural and functional consistency between fMRI with superior registration performance.</p>

	<p>BACKGROUND: Maximal safe resection is the objective of most neuro-oncological operations. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) may guide the surgeon to improve the extent of safe resection. There is limited evidence comparing the impact of iMRI on the rates of further resection between tumour types. AIM: To investigate the impact of iMRI on the rate of further resection following visualisation of residual tumour. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study identified all intracranial tumour operations performed in the 1.5 T iMRI machine of a single centre (2007&amp;amp;ndash;2023). Patients were identified using SurgiNet and were grouped according to their histopathological diagnosis in accordance with the WHO 2021 classification. The primary outcome was the rate of reoperation due to iMRI visualisation of residual tumours. RESULTS: A total of 574 cases were identified, including 152 low-grade gliomas (LGG), 108 high-grade gliomas (HGG), 194 pituitary neuroendocrine tumours (PitNETs), 15 metastases, and 6 meningiomas. Further resection following iMRI visualisation occurred in 45% of LGG cases, 47% of HGG cases, 29% of PitNET cases, and no meningioma or metastasis cases. Chi-square analysis showed that the rate of further resection after iMRI use across 2018&amp;amp;ndash;2023 was significantly higher than that across 2007&amp;amp;ndash;2012 (46% versus 33%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative MRI for guiding further resection was most useful in cases of LGG and HGG, possibly reflecting the difficulty of differentiating these tumour types from normal brain tissue. In addition, there was increased reliance on iMRI over time, which may represent our surgeons becoming accustomed to its use.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the depletion of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies highlight the gut-liver-brain (GLB) axis and its role in PD pathogenesis. The GLB axis forms a dynamic network facilitating bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and central nervous system. Dysregulation within this axis, encompassing gut dysbiosis and microbial metabolites, is emerging as a critical factor influencing PD progression. Our understanding of PD was traditionally centered on neurodegenerative processes within the brain. However, examining PD through the lens of the GLB axis provides new insights. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), kynurenine, serotonin, bile acids, indoles, and dopamine, which are integral to PD pathogenesis by modulation of the GLB axis. Our extensive research included a comprehensive literature review and database searches utilizing resources such as gutMGene and gutMDisorder. These databases have been instrumental in identifying specific microbes and their metabolites, shedding light on the intricate relationship between the GLB axis and PD. This review consolidates existing knowledge and underscores the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions based on the GLB axis and its components, which offer new avenues for future PD research and treatment strategies. While the GLB axis is not a novel concept, this review is the first to focus specifically on its role in PD, highlighting the importance of integrating the liver and microbial metabolites as central players in the PD puzzle.</p>

                Neuronal hyperexcitability in the cortex and hippocampus represents an early event in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a recent study, Blankenship and colleagues reported that in a mouse of AD, ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons are also hyperexcitable, and this hyperexcitability is due to casein kinase 2 (CK2)-dependent SK channel dysfunction, adding new insights into the underlying mechanisms of aberrant neuronal properties in AD.

">Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveals time-dependent and cell-type-specific effects of psilocybin on gene expression</a></h4>

              
                There is growing interest to investigate classic psychedelics as potential therapeutics for mental illnesses. Previous studies have demonstrated that one dose of psilocybin leads to persisting neural and behavioral changes. The durability of psilocybin's effects suggests that there are likely alterations of gene expression at the transcriptional level. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the dorsal medial frontal cortex of male and female mice. Samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 24, or 72 hours after psilocybin or ketamine administration and from control animals. At baseline, major excitatory and GABAergic cell types selectively express particular serotonin receptor transcripts. The psilocybin-evoked differentially expressed genes in excitatory neurons were involved in synaptic plasticity, which were distinct from genes enriched in GABAergic neurons that contribute to mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. The effect of psilocybin on gene expression was time-dependent, including an early phase at 1-2 hours followed by a late phase at 72 hours of transcriptional response after administration. Ketamine administration produced transcriptional changes that show a high degree of correlation to those induced by psilocybin. Collectively, the results reveal that psilocybin produces time-dependent and cell-type specific changes in gene expression in the medial frontal cortex, which may underpin the drug's long-term effects on neural circuits and behavior.

">EXPLORING SOCIAL COGNITION DECLINE ACROSS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SEVERITY: INSIGHTS FROM A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</a></h4>

              
                The detection of subtle behavioral signs in early stages of Alzheimers Disease (AD) is of great importance to start clinical investigation. Memory and reasoning problems are usually more commonly reported by relatives than those associated with Social Cognition (SC). This study focusing on deficits in SC as a behavioral marker of Alzheimers Disease (AD) investigated: (1) selective impairments in SC domains according to stage of disease; (2) if impairments were better explained by nonsocial cognitive dysfunctions. Sixty-five elderly distributed into groups according to the Mini-Mental State Examination (Healthy, Mild cognitive impairment, Mild-AD, Moderate-AD) participated in the study. All underwent the Edinburgh Social Cognition Test (ESCoT), which investigates the cognitive and affective domains of Theory of Mind, as well as interpersonal and intrapersonal understanding of social norms. The nonsocial cognitive battery included traditional tests of episodic memory, executive functions, verbal fluency and language comprehension. Mediation analysis was performed to understand the influence of nonsocial cognitive skills in SC impairment among groups. Results revealed prominent losses in SC in moderate AD regardless of memory-skills. Theory of mind was a crucial link between social and nonsocial cognitive abilities. Executive functioning, verbal fluency and language comprehension mediated group-related cognitive decline's effects on SC impairment. These findings underscore the complex interplay between cognitive domains in AD and suggest that selective impairments of SC highlight is as potential a marker for tracking the progression of the disease.

">Zero-phase-delay connectivity increases the reliability, concordance with structure, and prognostic ability of functional connectivity metrics</a></h4>

              
                Zero-phase-delay synchrony between the activity of distant neural populations has been robustly observed. Nevertheless, contemporary electroencephalography and magnetencephalography functional connectivity analyses typically exclude zero-phase-delay functional connections, assuming that they are predominantly artefactual. However, the effects of excluding them on the performance of functional connectivity metrics as potential biomarkers are unknown. Here, we showed that most cortico-cortical functional connections occur with zero- or near-zero phase-delay, even where such connectivity was unlikely to be artefactual. Including, rather than excluding, zero-phase-delay connectivity increased the reliability, concordance with structural connectivity, and predictive validity (for longitudinal changes in cognition) of functional connectivity metrics. We found that excluding zero-phase-delay connections penalised functional connectivity strength between the strongest structurally connected regions: stronger structural connections led to functional connections with phase-delays closer to zero, mediated by a shorter signal propagation time. Our findings challenge generally accepted assumptions that zero-phase-exclusive methods are superior to zero-phase-inclusive methods.

">Altered brain-ventricle coupling modes over Alzheimer's disease progression detected with fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The origins of resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) signal fluctuations remain debated. Recent evidence shows coupling between global cortical rsfMRI signals and cerebrospinal fluid inflow in the fourth ventricle, increasing during sleep and decreasing with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, potentially reflecting brain clearance mechanisms. However, the existence of more complex brain-ventricle coupling modes and their relationship to cognitive decline remains unexplored. Analyzing 599 minimally-preprocessed rsfMRI scans from 163 elderly participants across the AD spectrum, we identified distinct brain-ventricle coupling modes that differentiate across groups and correlate with cognitive scores. Beyond the known anti-phase coupling between global brain signals and ventricles - more frequent in cognitively normal controls - we discovered additional modes where specific brain areas temporarily align with ventricle signals. At the cortical level, these modes form canonical resting-state networks, such as the Default Mode Network, which occurs less in AD or the Frontoparietal Network, which correlates positively with memory scores. The direct link between ventricle and brain signals challenges the common practice of removing CSF components from rsfMRI analyses and questions the origin of cortical signal fluctuations forming functional networks, which may reflect region-specific fluid inflow patterns. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between brain clearance mechanisms and network dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Early Noise Exposure and Changes in Medial Olivocochlear Strength Alters Auditory Pathway Development</a></h4>

              
                Periodic spontaneous activity is a key feature of developing sensory systems, essential for the formation and refinement of neural circuits. Before the onset of hearing in altricial mammals, cochlear inner hair cells exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that activates primary afferents to propagate into the central nervous system. This activity, modulated by the medial olivocochlear efferent feedback via 910 nicotinic cholinergic receptors present in inner hair cells, is crucial for auditory system maturation. In this study, we examined the impact of sound exposure at levels below those causing hair cell damage during the critical developmental period by using genetically modified mice - 9 knockout and 9 knock-in models - with either absent or enhanced cholinergic activity. We further assessed how varying levels of medial olivocochlear feedback interact with early-age noise exposure to affect auditory development. Our findings reveal that both increased and absent olivocochlear activity result in altered auditory sensitivity at the onset of hearing and affect ribbon synapse number and morphology. Additionally, early exposure to loud noise caused long lasting changes in the inner ear of wild-type and 9 knockout mice, underscoring the heightened vulnerability during early development. In contrast, mice with enhanced cholinergic activity were protected from these changes. Overall, this work highlights the critical role of medial olivocochlear modulation in proper auditory system development and indicates that early noise exposure can interfere with normal cochlear maturation, resulting in pronounced long-term effects.

">Short-Term Arcade-Action Video Gaming Enhances Working Memory Precision</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Action video games are increasingly recognized for their potential to enhance cognitive capacities, including working memory (WM). However, most studies require extensive training or prior gaming experience. We examined whether a single, short-term session of Snail Mail, an arcade-action video game, could boost WM precision compared to a passive control condition. Method: Thirty six healthy adults (18 34 years) were randomly assigned to either play Snail Mail (Intervention) or watch episodes of Shaun the Sheep (Control) for 30 minutes. Two participants were excluded for unstable performance, yielding a final sample of 34. Participants completed a face emotion recognition memory task before and after the intervention, wherein the absolute error served as the primary metric of WM precision. A mixture model further characterized memory precision, and random guessing. Results: The Intervention group showed a significant reduction in absolute error from pre test to posttest, whereas the Control group exhibited a negative effect size, indicating worsened posttest performance. Mixture model results revealed a significant increase in precision for the Intervention group. Conclusion: These findings indicate that a 30 minute arcade-action game session can meaningfully enhance WM precision, highlighting the feasibility of brief, targeted gaming interventions. Future research should explore longer-term outcomes, generalizability to other cognitive tasks, and optimal intervention protocols for sustained benefits

">Antidepressants promote developmental-like plasticity through remodeling of extracellular matrix</a></h4>

              
                Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Fluoxetine (Flx) are widely used to treat mood and anxiety disorders. Despite decades of use, the molecular logic by which they modulate stress-related behaviors remain poorly understood. Here we show that Flx reactivates a developmental-like plasticity program in the dentate gyrus (DG) by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the hippocampus post-Flx revealed robust transcriptomic reprogramming in the DG, with mature granule cells adopting a juvenile-like transcriptional profile, including upregulation of the developmental gene Sox11. This was accompanied by increased BDNF signaling and enhanced structural remodeling in the mossy fiber pathway. Flx remodeled perisynaptic nets, a novel ECM structures in the DG, and targeted ECM degradation around granule cells reactivated SOX11. Flx treatment mitigated stress-induced fear generalization, and this was phenocopied by direct degradation of ECM in the DG. These findings identify ECM remodeling as a molecular substrate for Flx's effects, linking induction of a developmental-like plasticity program and rejuvenation of mature granule cells to improvements in stress-induced overgeneralization.

">Emergence of a contrast-invariant representation of naturalistic texture in macaque visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory stimuli vary across a variety of dimensions, like contrast, orientation, or texture. The brain must rely on population representations to disentangle changes in one dimension from changes in another. To understand how the visual system might extract separable stimulus representations, we recorded multiunit neuronal responses to texture images varying along two dimensions: contrast, a property represented as early as the retina, and naturalistic statistical structure, a property that modulates neuronal responses in V2 and V4, but not in V1. We measured how sites in these 3 cortical areas responded to variation in both dimensions. Contrast modulated responses in all areas. In V2 and V4, the presence of naturalistic structure both modulated responses and increased contrast sensitivity. Tuning for naturalistic structure was strongest in V4; tuning in both dimensions was most heterogeneous in V4. We measured how well populations in each area could support the linear readout of both dimensions. Populations in V2 and V4 could support the linear readout of naturalistic structure, but only in V4 did we find evidence for a robust representation that was contrast-invariant.

">Circadian Rhythms are Disrupted in Patients and Preclinical Models of Machado-Joseph Disease</a></h4>

              
                Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is caused by an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, leading to the expression of a mutant ataxin-3 (mutATXN3) protein. MJD patients exhibit a wide range of clinical symptoms, including motor incoordination. Emerging evidence highlights circadian rhythm disruptions as early indicators and potential risk factors for the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Circadian rhythms are regulated by internal clocks, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) acting as the master pacemaker to synchronize timing across the behavioural and physiological functions. While sleep disturbances have been observed in MJD, the role of clock regulation in its pathophysiology remains largely unexplored in spinocerebellar ataxias. This study aimed to investigate circadian rhythms, characterize associated disruptions, and uncover the mechanisms underlying clock dysregulation in patients and preclinical models of MJD. Circadian activity in MJD patients was assessed over two weeks using actigraphy, while in a YAC-MJD transgenic mouse model, circadian rhythms were examined through: (a) wheel-running experiments; (b) telemetry-based monitoring of core body temperature; (c) immunohistochemical analysis of the neuropeptides arginine vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the SCN and paraventricular nucleus (PVN); and (d) RT-qPCR evaluation of clock gene expression in the cerebellum. The impact of mutATXN3 on clock mechanisms was further investigated using Bmal1/Per2-luciferase reporters. MJD patients exhibited a progressive decline in robustness of behavioural rhythms, demonstrated by negative correlations between the circadian function index, rest-activity fragmentation, and sleep efficiency with MJD clinical scales. YAC-MJD mice exhibited reduced activity levels, increased behavioural fragmentation, and required three additional days to re-entrain after a jet lag protocol, compared to controls. Disrupted core body temperature rhythms were observed, including a phase advance and elevated temperature at the onset of the active period. Furthermore, transgenic mice showed reduced levels of VIP and AVP in the SCN and PVN, and decreased clock gene expression in the cerebellum. Lastly, we found new mechanistic evidence that WT ATXN3 activates the promoters of Bmal1 and Per2, whereas mutATXN3 loses the capacity to drive Per2 upon polyglutamine expansion. Overall, our findings indicate that central clock dysfunction in MJD is associated with impaired clock gene expression and disruptions in activity and temperature rhythms. This study provides the first robust evidence of circadian rhythm dysregulation and underlying mechanisms in MJD, paving the way for the identification of new biomarkers and the development of novel circadian-based interventions to tackle MJD and possibly other spinocerebellar ataxias.

">Convergent state-control of endogenous opioid analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Pain is a dynamic and nonlinear experience shaped by injury and contextual factors, including expectations of future pain or relief. While mu opioid receptors are central to the analgesic effects of opioid drugs, the endogenous opioid neurocircuitry underlying pain and placebo analgesia remains poorly understood. The ventrolateral column of the posterior periaqueductal gray is a critical hub for nociception and endogenous analgesia mediated by opioid signaling. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the cell-type identities, the sub-second neural dynamics involved in pain modulation, the role of endogenous peptide neuromodulators, and the contextual factors influencing these processes. Using spatial mapping with single-nuclei RNA sequencing of pain-active neurons projecting to distinct long-range brain targets, alongside cell type-specific and activity-dependent genetic tools for in vivo optical recordings and modulation of neural activity and opioid peptide release, we identified a functional dichotomy in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Neurons expressing mu opioid receptors encode active nociceptive states, whereas enkephalin-releasing neurons drive pain relief during recovery from injury, in response to learned fear predictions, and during placebo analgesia. Finally, by leveraging the functional effects of placebo analgesia, we used direct optogenetic activation of vlPAG enkephalin neurons to drive opioid peptide release, resulting in a robust reduction in pain. These findings show that diverse need states converge on a shared midbrain circuit that releases endogenous opioids with high spatiotemporal precision to suppress nociceptive activity and promote analgesia.

">Neuronal LAG3 facilitates pathogenic α-synuclein neuron-to-neuron propagation</a></h4>

              
                Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) is a key receptor involved in the propagation of pathological proteins in Parkinson disease (PD). This study investigates the role of neuronal LAG3 in mediating the binding, uptake, and propagation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) preformed fibrils (PFFs). Using neuronal LAG3 conditional knockout mice and human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons, we demonstrate that LAG3 expression is critical for pathogenic aSyn propagation. Our results show that the absence of neuronal LAG3 significantly reduces aSyn pathology, alleviates motor dysfunction, and inhibits neurodegeneration in vivo. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that aSyn PFFs induce pronounced neuronal hyperactivity in wild-type (WT) neurons, increasing firing rates in cell-attached and whole-cell configurations, and reducing miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. In contrast, neurons lacking LAG3 resisted these electrophysiological effects. Moreover, treatment with an anti-human LAG3 antibody in human DA neurons inhibited aSyn PFFs binding and uptake, preventing pathology propagation. These findings confirm the essential function of neuronal LAG3 in mediating aSyn propagation and associated disruptions, identifying LAG3 as a potential therapeutic target for PD and related alpha-synucleinopathies.

">TSPO-PET Reveals Higher Inflammation in White Matter Disrupted by Paramagnetic Rim Lesions in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To explore whether the inflammatory activity is higher in white matter (WM) tracts disrupted by paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and if inflammation in PRL-disrupted WM tracts is associated with disability in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Forty-four MS patients and 16 healthy controls were included. 18 kDa-translocator protein positron emission tomography (TSPO-PET) with the 11C-PK11195 radioligand was used to measure the neuroinflammatory activity. The Network Modification Tool was used to identify WM tracts disrupted by PRLs and non-PRLs that were delineated on MRI. The Expanded Disability Status Scale was used to measure disability. Results: MS patients had higher inflammatory activity in whole brain WM compared to healthy controls (p=0.001). Compared to patients without PRLs, patients with PRLs exhibited higher levels of inflammatory activity in the WM tracts disrupted by any type of lesions (p=0.02) or PRLs (p=0.004). In patients with at least one PRL, inflammatory activity was higher in WM tracts highly disrupted by PRLs compared to WM tracts highly disrupted by non-PRLs (p=0.009). Elevated inflammatory activity in highly disrupted WM tracts was associated with increased disability in patients with PRL (p=0.03), but not in patients without PRL (p=0.2). Interpretation: This study suggests that patients with PRLs may exhibit more diffuse WM inflammation in addition to higher inflammation along WM tracts disrupted by PRLs compared to non-PRLs, which could contribute to larger lesion volumes and faster disability progression. Imaging PRLs may serve to identify patients with both focal and diffuse inflammation, guiding therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing inflammation and preventing progressive disability in MS.

">Linking neural population formatting to function</a></h4>

              
                Animals capable of complex behaviors tend to have more distinct brain areas than simpler organisms, and artificial networks that perform many tasks tend to self-organize into modules (1-3). This suggests that different brain areas serve distinct functions supporting complex behavior. However, a common observation is that essentially anything that an animal senses, knows, or does can be decoded from neural activity in any brain area (4-6). If everything is everywhere, why have distinct areas? Here we show that the function of a brain area is more related to how different types of information are combined (formatted) in neural representations than merely whether that information is present. We compared two brain areas: the middle temporal area (MT), which is important for visual motion perception (7, 8), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which is linked to decision-making and reward expectation (9,10)). When monkeys based decisions on a combination of motion and reward information, both types of information were present in both areas. However, they were formatted differently: in MT, they were encoded separably, while in dlPFC, they were represented jointly in ways that reflected the monkeys' decision-making. A recurrent neural network (RNN) model that mirrored the information formatting in MT and dlPFC predicted that manipulating activity in these areas would differently affect decision-making. Consistent with model predictions, electrically stimulating MT biased choices midway between the visual motion stimulus and the preferred direction of the stimulated units (11), while stimulating dlPFC produced 'winner-take-all' decisions that sometimes reflected the visual motion stimulus and sometimes reflected the preference of the stimulated units, but never in between. These results are consistent with the tantalizing possibility that a modular structure enables complex behavior by flexibly reformatting information to accomplish behavioral goals.

">DANCE: An open-source analysis pipeline and low-cost hardware to quantify aggression and courtship in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying animal behaviors is pivotal for identifying the underlying neuronal and genetic mechanisms. Computational approaches have enabled automated analysis of complex behaviors such as aggression and courtship in Drosophila. However, existing approaches rely on rigid, rule-based algorithms and expensive hardware, limiting sensitivity to behavioral variations and accessibility. Here, we describe the DANCE (Drosophila Aggression and Courtship Evaluator), a low-cost, open-source platform combining machine learning-based classifiers and inexpensive hardware to quantify aggression and courtship. DANCE consists of six novel behavioral classifiers trained using a supervised machine learning algorithm. DANCE classifiers outperform existing rule-based algorithms by capturing dynamic behavioral variations. DANCE hardware is constructed using repurposed medicine blister packs and acrylic sheets, with recordings performed using smartphones, making it affordable and accessible. Benchmarking demonstrated that DANCE hardware performs comparably to sophisticated, high-cost setups. We validated DANCE in diverse contexts, including social isolation versus enrichment that modulate aggression and courtship, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of neuropeptide Dsk, and optogenetic silencing of dopaminergic neurons which promoted aggression. DANCE provides a cost-effective and portable solution for studying Drosophila behaviors in resource-limited settings or closer to natural habitats. Its accessibility and robust performance democratizes behavioral neuroscience, enabling rapid screening of genes and neuronal circuits underlying complex social behaviors.

	<p>Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent, chronic, and severe neuropsychiatric disorder that leads to illness-related disability. Despite the availability of several treatments, many OCD patients respond inadequately, because the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear, necessitating the establishment of many animal models, particularly mouse models, to elucidate disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies better. Although the development of animal models is ongoing, there remain many comprehensive summaries and updates in recent research, hampering efforts to develop novel treatments and enhance existing interventions. This review summarizes the phenotypes of several commonly used models and mechanistic insights from transgenic models of OCD, such as knockout mouse models. In addition, we present the advantages and limitations of these models and discuss their future in helping further understand the pathophysiology and advanced treatment. Here, we highlight current frontline treatment approaches for OCD, including neuromodulation and surgical interventions, and propose potential future directions. By studying gene mutations and observing phenotypes from available OCD animal models, researchers have classified the molecular signatures of each model reminiscent of changes in brain areas and neural pathways, with the hope of guiding the future selection of the most appropriate models for specific research in the OCD field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: There is growing interest in neuroscience-informed education, as well as neuroscience-derived strategies that maximise learning. Studies on neuroscience literacy and neuromyths, i.e., understandings or misconceptions about the brain, have primarily focused on their prevalence in educators, and few studies have examined their impact on students&amp;amp;rsquo; study habits or academic performance. Methods: To address this gap, we surveyed 576 university students in different academic programmes to investigate the relationship between neuromyths and academic outcomes in university students. In this quantitative, cross-sectional study design, we used a validated neuroscience knowledge survey and the Revised Two-factor Study Process (R-SPQ-2F) Questionnaire. We also inquired about students&amp;amp;rsquo; interest in, exposure to, and awareness of neuroscience, as well as their academic grades. Results: Students showed significant awareness of and interest in neuroscience; this was highest among students in health science programmes and lowest among students in computer and engineering programmes. The most common sources of general neuroscience knowledge were internet articles. Higher neuroscience literacy was associated with higher interest in neuroscience and having taken more neuroscience courses. Neuromyth scores were also better among those with higher neuroscience literacy scores. Higher neuroscience literacy scores were significantly associated with higher grades, higher surface strategy scores, and lower surface motive study habits. Conclusions: Our study sheds light on the variations in foundational neuroscience literacy among students in different academic programmes. It also provides insight into how this foundation affects academic performance and study habits. This insight may help guide educational policymakers to adopt neuroscience-based strategies that may be beneficial for learning.</p>

                <p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) are known to contribute to both protective and pronociceptive processes. However, their contribution to neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) needs further investigation. In a recent study utilizing TrkB<sup>F616A</sup> mice, it was shown that systemic pharmacogenetic inhibition of TrkB signaling with 1NM-PP1 (1NMP) immediately after SCI delayed the onset of pain hypersensitivity, implicating maladaptive TrkB signaling in pain after SCI. To examine potential neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral outcome, patch-clamp recording was performed in small-diameter dissociated thoracic (T) dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons to evaluate TrkB signaling in uninjured mice and after T10 contusion SCI. Bath-applied 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a selective TrkB agonist, induced a robust inward current in neurons from uninjured mice, which was attenuated by 1NMP treatment. SCI also decreased 7,8-DHF-induced current while increasing the latency to its peak amplitude. Western blot revealed a concomitant decrease in TrkB expression in DRGs adjacent to the spinal lesion. Analyses of cellular and membrane properties showed that SCI increased neuronal excitability, evident by an increase in resting membrane potential and the number of spiking neurons. However, SCI did not increase spontaneous firing in DRG neurons. These results suggest that SCI induced changes in TrkB activation in DRG neurons even though these alterations are likely not contributing to pain hypersensitivity by nociceptor hyperexcitability. Overall, this reveals complex interactions involving TrkB signaling and provides an opportunity to investigate other, presumably peripheral, mechanisms by which TrkB contributes to pain hypersensitivity after SCI.</p>

                <p>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a well-known antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke by inhibiting pyroptosis, a programmed cell death associated with inflammation. This study investigates the impact of HCQ on ischemic stroke pathology using both in vivo and in vitro models. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were treated with HCQ. Neurological deficits, infarct volume, and the expression of pyroptosis markers were evaluated. The results demonstrated that HCQ significantly improved motor function and reduced infarct volume in the MCAO mouse model. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and oxygen&ndash;glucose deprivation (OGD) were treated with HCQ. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that HCQ effectively suppressed the expression of pyroptosis markers GSDMD and NLRP3 in both in vivo and in vitro models. These findings suggest that HCQ mitigates ischemic stroke damage by inhibiting pyroptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HCQ exerts its neuroprotective effects, offering a promising new avenue for developing safe, cost-effective, and widely applicable stroke treatments. The potential of HCQ to modulate neuroinflammatory pathways presents a significant advancement in ischemic stroke therapy, emphasizing the importance of targeting pyroptosis in stroke management and the broader implications for treating neuroinflammatory conditions.</p>

                This paper presents a study of congruence relations on autometrized algebras. We demonstrate that in a normal autometrized algebra, which satisfies certain conditions, the set of all congruence relations forms a complete sublattice within the set of all equivalence relations. Furthermore, we investigate the property that a congruence-permutable autometrized algebra is also congruence-modular. We also explore several fundamental properties related to congruence relations. Additionally, we introduce the kernel of a homomorphism and establish that it is a congruence relation. Lastly, we examine the homomorphism, isomorphism, and correspondence theorems of autometrized algebra using the concept of congruence.

                Background Termites are a major insect pest affecting agricultural production and woody materials. They cause severe devastation in the ecosystem, and lead to bare soil. This phenomenon causes the soil to become difficult to plow, which in turn leads to a reduction in the productivity of crops. It can cause 100 % yield losses based on crop types, level of the damage, and size of its populations. To manage this pest, different management options have been evaluated in Ethiopia. While insecticide usage is the dominant option, less attention has been given to Entomopathogenic Nematode (EPN) based management options. Therefore, this research was initiated to screen locally collected EPN isolates and evaluate promising isolates under field conditions on maize crop. Methods 37 EPN isolates were screened under laboratory condition, while two isolates were evaluated at field condition. The screening of EPN isolates was laid out in a completely randomized design, and the field evaluation used a completely randomized block design, and treatments were replicated thrice. Mortality of insect, damaged root, stem, cob, damage severity, foraging termites, and yield of the crop data were collected. Results The study indicated that all screened EPN isolates caused mortality on termites under laboratory conditions. The isolates achieved complete mortality of the insect pest within 12 days of exposure. The finding indicated that AEH and S#50 were the more pathogenic and virulent isolates on termites under laboratory conditions and taken to field study. The S#50 isolate was most pathogenic and reduced the infestation and severity of the insect pest on the maize crop under field conditions. Conclusions This result showed that the entomopathogenic nematode isolates have the potential to manage subterranean termites in the maize field. Future studies should be based on collection of local isolates and develop a full package for the virulent isolates.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-21/v1?src=rss">Assessing psychogenic health risks through the days between death and birth in the individual annual cycle [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The "birthday effect" refers to increased mortality around birthdays, although evidence remains mixed, with some studies even indicating reduced mortality. While the effect has a minimal impact on overall mortality, lacks prevention potential, and faces methodological challenges, it offers seminal insights into psychogenic health effects. Methods Major causes of death were analyzed using data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (1987-2022), excluding leap years and cases with imputed dates. The relationship between day of birth and death was assessed using a Poisson count model with overdispersion, and mortality rates (MRs) per 100,000 deaths per year were calculated for ±182 days around birthdays. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) compared these periods to a reference period. Cluster analyses explored mortality rate patterns across age and diagnostic groups. Age was not adjusted for in the Poisson model to avoid zero inflation, with bias from age-related mortality changes assessed separately through sensitivity analyses. Results In the analysis of 1,702,865 deaths over 27 years, an eight percent increase in birthday mortality was observed, equivalent to 22 additional deaths per 100,000 deaths per year. There were 889 excess deaths in the 28 days after the birthday compared to 206 in the 28 days before. Excess birthday mortality was particularly pronounced in men, unmarried individuals, and those with religious affiliations. In individuals aged 85 and older, a pre-birthday dip followed by post-birthday mortality excess was noted. Cardiovascular causes, suicides, and accidents had the highest birthday-related mortality, while diabetes, respiratory diseases, and other conditions showed varied pre- and post-birthday patterns. Conclusions Administrative and age-related biases were ruled out, suggesting the birthday effect is psychogenic. While behavior-linked causes like suicides and accidents had clear birthday patterns, other main causes of death also showed birthday-period effects. Further research, including psychometric and biomarker studies, is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

                <p>by Magnus Pirovino, Christian Iseli, Joseph A. Curran, Bernard Conrad</p>

Catalysis and specifically autocatalysis are the quintessential building blocks of life. Yet, although autocatalytic networks are necessary, they are not sufficient for the emergence of life-like properties, such as replication and adaptation. The ultimate and potentially fatal threat faced by molecular replicators is parasitism; if the polymerase error rate exceeds a critical threshold, even the fittest molecular species will disappear. Here we have developed an autocatalytic RNA early life mathematical network model based on enzyme kinetics, specifically the steady-state approximation. We confirm previous models showing that these second-order autocatalytic cycles are sustainable, provided there is a sufficient nucleotide pool. However, molecular parasites become untenable unless they sequentially degenerate to hyperparasites (i.e. parasites of parasites). Parasite resistance–a parasite-specific host response decreasing parasite fitness–is acquired gradually, and eventually involves an increased binding affinity of hyperparasites for parasites. Our model is supported at three levels; firstly, ribozyme polymerases display Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics and comply with the steady-state approximation. Secondly, ribozyme polymerases are capable of sustainable auto-amplification and of surmounting the fatal error threshold. Thirdly, with growing sequence divergence of host and parasite catalysts, the probability of self-binding is expected to increase and the trend towards cross-reactivity to diminish. Our model predicts that primordial host-RNA populations evolved via an arms race towards a host-parasite-hyperparasite catalyst trio that conferred parasite resistance within an RNA replicator niche. While molecular parasites have traditionally been viewed as a nuisance, our model argues for their integration into the host habitat rather than their separation. It adds another mechanism–with biochemical precision–by which parasitism can be tamed and offers an attractive explanation for the universal coexistence of catalyst trios within prokaryotes and the virosphere, heralding the birth of a primitive molecular immunity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Monoallelic variants in the transient receptor potential melastatin-related type 3 gene (<i>TRPM3</i>) have been associated with neurodevelopmental manifestations, but knowledge on the clinical manifestations and treatment options is limited. We characterized the clinical spectrum, highlighting particularly the epilepsy phenotype, and the effect of treatments.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed retrospectively the phenotypes and genotypes of 43 individuals with <i>TRPM3</i> variants, acquired from GeneMatcher and collaborations (n = 21), and through a systematic literature search (n = 22). We included all patients with a pathogenic <i>TRPM3</i> variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median age at the time of the study was 10 years, with a preponderance of girls (60%) versus boys (40%). Frequent findings were developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (93%), global or axial hypotonia (77%), ocular involvement (70%), musculoskeletal anomalies (65%), and dysmorphic features (58%). Epilepsy was diagnosed in 31 patients (72%), classified in all as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with or without spike wave activation in sleep (DEE/DEE-SWAS). Patients with the variant p.Val1002Met (n = 24) significantly more often had developmental delay and epilepsy. The most effective anti-seizure medication was primidone. All treated patients showed an improvement in seizure frequency, motor and speech development, and/or learning capability with this drug.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Developmental delay/intellectual disability and epilepsy are dominant phenotypic features in patients with <i>TRPM3</i> variants. Given that epilepsy can negatively impact development, screening for awake and sleep electroencephalogram abnormalities and other manifestations are essential to offer early intervention. The TRPM3 channel blocker primidone has shown promising effects and should be considered in every child with a <i>TRPM3</i> gain-of-function variant. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Sonneratia caseolaris, has been widely utilized by the Indonesian. S. caseolaris leaves contain various active compounds, contributing to their popularity in the treatment of various diseases. Mangrove leaves are also known to exhibit very high antioxidant activity. This study aims to assess the antioxidant activity of S . caseolaris leaves extracted using different solvents. The resulting extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) techniques. Methods Analysis of total flavonoids, total phenols, identification of active compounds with Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and bioinformatics were also carried out to obtain temporary conclusions about the antioxidant activity of S. caseolaris leaf extract. Results The results indicated that S. caseolaris leaves extracted with methanol and distilled water exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The analysis of total flavonoids and total phenols yielded results consistent with the antioxidant activity tests. LC-HRMS results identified three compounds in all S. caseolaris leaf extracts with antioxidant activity, namely TEMPO, Choline, and Betaine. TEMPO demonstrated a higher antioxidant activity than Choline and Betaine, as indicated by the binding affinity values in the bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions It is evident that S. caseolaris leaf extracts has the potential to serve as an effective antioxidant agent. Further research is needed to confirm how the potential compounds in S. caseolaris leaf water extracts interact with the target protein Keap1. This research aims to utilize S. caseolaris as active components in food products, thereby enhancing antioxidant consumption among consumers.

                Background Neurodegeneration due to neurotoxicity is one of the phenomena in temporal lobe epilepsy. Experimentally, hippocampal excitotoxicity process can occur due to kainic acid exposure, especially in the CA3 area. Neuronal death, astrocyte reactivity and increased calcium also occur in hippocampal excitotoxicity, but few studies have investigated immediate effect after kainic acid exposure. The organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC) is a useful model for studying the neurodegeneration process, but there are still many protocol differences. In this study, minor modifications were made in the OHSC protocol. Methods OHSC was obtained from three healthy wild type Wistar rats aged P10. Healthy culture slices were obtained and lasted up to 10 days in vitro (DIV 10). Bath application of kainic acid for 48 hours in DIV 10 followed by observation of its initial effects on neurons, astrocytes, and calcium via the expression of MAP2, GFAP, and intracellular calcium imaging, subsequently. Results After 48 h of kainic acid administration, there was a significant increase in intracellular calcium intensity (p = 0.006 < α), accompanied by a significant decrease in MAP2 (p = 0.003 < α) and GFAP (p = 0.010 < α) expression. Conclusion These findings suggest early neuronal and astrocyte damage at the initial onset of hippocampal injury. This implies that astrocyte damage occurs early before an increase in GFAP that characterizes reactive astrogliosis found in other studies. Damage to neurons and astrocytes may be associated with increased intracellular calcium. It is necessary to develop further research regarding regulation of calcium, MAP2, and GFAP at a spatial time after exposure to kainic acid and strategies to reduce damage caused by excitotoxicity.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the healthcare ecosystem, but further research is needed to understand how it can enhance healthcare capabilities. This study analyzes the literature on AI and healthcare capability using the PRISMA approach, applying specific search keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The findings indicate that AI benefits the healthcare ecosystem, significantly influences health outcomes, and transforms medical practices. However, there is limited literature and a lack of understanding regarding how AI enhances healthcare capabilities. Most studies date from 2019, suggesting that COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of AI systems in healthcare. This research contributes theoretically by developing a framework that clarifies AI’s role in enhancing healthcare capabilities, serving as a foundational model for future studies. It identifies critical gaps in the literature, especially in the Global South, and encourages exploration in under-researched areas where healthcare professionals can benefit from AI. Additionally, it bridges the gap between AI and healthcare, enriching interdisciplinary dialogue relevant to emerging economies facing financial constraints. Practically, the study provides actionable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers in the Global South on leveraging AI to improve service delivery. It sets the stage for empirical research, promoting the testing and refinement of the proposed framework in resource-limited contexts, while raising awareness among healthcare staff, managers, and technology developers about AI’s role in healthcare.

                Background The work experience of seafarers differs significantly from other land-based occupations due to several factors, particularly remoteness and the restricted work environment. This study seeks to examine the impact of burnout and health impairment in the maritime industry, using the Job Demand-Resources theory as a framework. Methods To investigate these phenomena, an online questionnaire was sent to 239 Italian seafarers (94.6% men, Mage = 39.44, SD = 12.8). We tested a mediated Structural Equation Model (SEM) aimed at predicting negative health outcomes. Results The results show that burnout plays a mediating role between job demands (such as workload and cognitive strain) and resources (such as social support and transformational leadership), influencing variables related to health impairment (such as sleep quality and physical well-being). Furthermore, the findings highlight the direct influence of occupational resources on seafarers’ health. Conclusions The discussion highlights the urgent need for more research in the field of organisational psychology in the maritime industry and the discrepancies between these findings, which are consistent with the existing maritime literature, and other studies that do not include seafarers in their sample groups.

                Background and aim This quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a mixture of 0.5% deltamethrin, 0.75% S-bio-allethrin, and 10% piperonyl butoxide (DAP) in eliminating Aedes mosquitoes in 10 areas of a high-risk district for dengue fever. Methods Susceptibility tests for Aedes against deltamethrin (1:1.000) Aedes) were conducted between October 2022 and December 2022. Data analysis using descriptive statistics was presented with frequency percentage, average, standard deviation, median, at 25 and 75 percentiles, and inferential statistics to compare mean differences within and between groups using independent t-test statistics. Results The results showed that these isolates were susceptible to deltamethrin. The mortality difference rate between DAP indoors was significantly more effective than 0.5% deltamethrin at 0.05 (p-value=0.04). The mortality difference rate between the mortality rate of DAP outdoors was statistically significantly greater than 0.5% deltamethrin at a level of 0.05 (p-value<0.001). The mortality difference means of Aedes caused by DAP indoors and outdoors were statistically different at 0.05 (p-value<0.001), and it was found that the effectiveness of 0.5% deltamethrin in eliminating indoors was greater than outdoors by 70.1 (95% CI = 63.78-76.41). Conclusion Combining DAP effectively eliminated Aedes mosquitoes in indoor and outdoor environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-16/v1?src=rss">Artificial Intelligence in the Prediction of Stone-Free Status in Urinary Stone Disease Treated with Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases worldwide. One of the most common therapy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), has a high failure rate. The failure rate can be significantly reduced by identifying the candidates most likely to benefit from ESWL, for example, by using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Decision tree analysis (DTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) represent a few of the machine learning approaches employed to forecast the stone-free outcome following ESWL. Methods 219 studies were searched through six electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, Proquest, SCOPUS). We employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and adhered to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD). To evaluate the potential bias in all the studies, we utilized the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Results 41,484 patients from 11 studies were included. The ML models highlight varying levels of diagnostic precision, with sensitivity spanning from 35-96%, and specificity ranging from 63-98.4%, and area under the curve falling between 0.49-0.96. It is shown in this study that the accuracy of RF and DTA in predicting stone-free status is superior than ANN. Conclusion ML is a comparable predictive method to statistical analysis in predicting stone-free status. Random forest method and DTA are superior MLs compared to ANN. Stone size, density, and 3D texture analysis are the most important variables to be considered in the ML models and should be included in the models to ensure accuracy of stone-free status prediction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-15/v1?src=rss">Concurrent stunting among under-five children in Egypt [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Stunting still represents a major public health problem in Egypt, impacting around one-third of children under five and leading to a 2-3% drop in Gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, this study examined the trends in the prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among children aged 0-23 months, 24-59 months and 0-59 months in Egypt. Methods The study used combined data from the 2005, 2008, and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS), with a total sample of 39,857 children aged 0-59 months. A multilevel logistic regression that adjusts for sampling weights and clustering was performed to analyse the factors associated with stunting among children in Egypt. Results The prevalence of stunting was 24.8% in children aged 0-23 months, 24.3% in children aged 24-59 months, and 24.5 % in children aged 0-59 months. After controlling for potential confounders, the common factors associated with stunting in three age groups were mothers with primary education and mothers who did not have an antenatal care (ANC) visit during pregnancy. Maternal short stature (height < 155 cm) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in three age groups compared to mothers taller than 160 cm. Conclusion Addressing the causes of stunting in Egypt necessitates sectoral collaboration, including health, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, and social protection, with the implementation of targeted interventions focusing on children born to short mothers. Interventions must be accessible for families with low socioeconomic status, focusing on improved healthcare access, parent education, and infant and young child feeding practices. A systematic nutrition monitoring framework that enables routine data collection on nutritional outcomes to monitor and improve child health is recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88287">Why the brown ghost chirps at night</a></h4>

              
                Since the pioneering work by Moeller, Szabo, and Bullock, weakly electric fish have served as a valuable model for investigating spatial and social cognitive abilities in a vertebrate taxon usually less accessible than mammals or other terrestrial vertebrates. These fish, through their electric organ, generate low-intensity electric fields to navigate and interact with conspecifics, even in complete darkness. The brown ghost knifefish is appealing as a study subject due to a rich electric ‘vocabulary’, made by individually variable and sex-specific electric signals. These are mainly characterized by brief frequency modulations of the oscillating dipole moment continuously generated by their electric organ, and are known as chirps. Different types of chirps are believed to convey specific and behaviorally salient information, serving as behavioral readouts for different internal states during behavioral observations. Despite the success of this model in neuroethology over the past seven decades, the code to decipher their electric communication remains unknown. To this aim, in this study we re-evaluate the correlations between signals and behavior offering an alternative, and possibly complementary, explanation for why these freshwater bottom dwellers emit electric chirps. By uncovering correlations among chirping, electric field geometry, and detectability in enriched environments, we present evidence for a previously unexplored role of chirps as specialized self-directed signals, enhancing conspecific electrolocation during social encounters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95267">Nicotine enhances the stemness and tumorigenicity in intestinal stem cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signal pathway</a></h4>

              
                Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100455">The Drosophila hematopoietic niche assembles through collective cell migration controlled by neighbor tissues and Slit-Robo signaling</a></h4>

              
                Niches are often found in specific positions in tissues relative to the stem cells they support. Consistency of niche position suggests that placement is important for niche function. However, the complexity of most niches has precluded a thorough understanding of how their proper placement is established. To address this, we investigated the formation of a genetically tractable niche, the <i>Drosophila</i> Posterior Signaling Center (PSC), the assembly of which had not been previously explored. This niche controls hematopoietic progenitors of the lymph gland (LG). PSC cells were previously shown to be specified laterally in the embryo, but ultimately reside dorsally, at the LG posterior. Here, using live-imaging, we show that PSC cells migrate as a tight collective and associate with multiple tissues during their trajectory to the LG posterior. We find that Slit emanating from two extrinsic sources, visceral mesoderm and cardioblasts, is required for the PSC to remain a collective, and for its attachment to cardioblasts during migration. Without proper Slit-Robo signaling, PSC cells disperse, form aberrant contacts, and ultimately fail to reach their stereotypical position near progenitors. Our work characterizes a novel example of niche formation and identifies an extrinsic signaling relay that controls precise niche positioning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91422">Diversity in Notch ligand-receptor signaling interactions</a></h4>

              
                The Notch signaling pathway uses families of ligands and receptors to transmit signals to nearby cells. These components are expressed in diverse combinations in different cell types, interact in a many-to-many fashion, both within the same cell (in cis) and between cells (in trans), and their interactions are modulated by Fringe glycosyltransferases. A fundamental question is how the strength of Notch signaling depends on which pathway components are expressed, at what levels, and in which cells. Here, we used a quantitative, bottom-up, cell-based approach to systematically characterize trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation signaling efficiencies across a range of ligand and Fringe expression levels in Chinese hamster and mouse cell lines. Each ligand (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) and receptor variant (Notch1 and Notch2) analyzed here exhibited a unique profile of interactions, Fringe dependence, and signaling outcomes. All four ligands were able to bind receptors in cis and in trans, and all ligands trans-activated both receptors, although Jag1-Notch1 signaling was substantially weaker than other ligand-receptor combinations. Cis-interactions were predominantly inhibitory, with the exception of the Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 pairs, which exhibited cis-activation stronger than trans-activation. Lfng strengthened Delta-mediated trans-activation and weakened Jagged-mediated trans-activation for both receptors. Finally, cis-ligands showed diverse cis-inhibition strengths, which depended on the identity of the trans-ligand as well as the receptor. The map of receptor-ligand-Fringe interaction outcomes revealed here should help guide rational perturbation and control of the Notch pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101032">Capsular Polysaccharide Restrains Type VI Secretion in Acinetobacter baumannii</a></h4>

              
                The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a sophisticated, contact-dependent nanomachine involved in interbacterial competition. To function effectively, the T6SS must penetrate the membranes of both attacker and target bacteria. Structures associated with the cell envelope, like polysaccharides chains, can therefore introduce spatial separation and steric hindrance, potentially affecting the efficacy of the T6SS. In this study, we examined how the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> affects T6SS's antibacterial function. Our findings show that the CPS confers resistance against T6SS-mediated assaults from rival bacteria. Notably, under typical growth conditions, the presence of the surface-bound capsule also reduces the efficacy of the bacterium's own T6SS. This T6SS impairment is further enhanced when CPS is overproduced due to genetic modifications or antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bacterium adjusts the level of the T6SS inner tube protein Hcp according to its secretion capacity, by initiating a degradation process involving the ClpXP protease. Collectively, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between T6SS and CPS and how they respond swiftly to environmental challenges.

">Valence-dependent sensory-rhythmic neural entrainment modulates cortico-subcortical dynamics, attention, and memory</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that sensory rhythmic stimulation can enhance executive functions by synchronizing, entraining, oscillations within higher-order cortical networks. However, whether this entrainment extends to subcortical structures and shapes human behavior remains unclear. In a first experiment, we used intracranial EEG recordings in epileptic patients during a visual search task. While neutral stimulation induced moderate entrainment, we demonstrated that 5 Hz negative-valence stimulation can significantly entrain theta oscillations in a widespread task-related cortico-subcortical network, with increased synchrony in the ventral visual stream, the hippocampus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In a second behavioral experiment in healthy individuals, visual search performance improved under both stimulation conditions, but memory for target images, assessed through an additional recognition task, was significantly enhanced after negative stimulation. These findings unravel the role of valence in modulating subcortical brain activity and behaviors through rhythmic sensory stimulation and pave the way for its further application in clinical intervention.

">Human iPSC-based coculture model reveals neuroinflammatory crosstalk between microglia and astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microglia and astrocytes have been implicated as central mediators of neuroinflammatory processes in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods: We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), or interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results: Microglia-astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-/IL-1{beta} elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions: Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.

">Transcriptomic analysis of repeat expansion-ataxias uncovers distinct non-neuronal cell type-specific signatures of disease across the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Hereditary ataxias are a heterogeneous group of neurogenetic conditions characterised by the clinical syndrome of progressive loss of coordination from neurodegeneration of the cerebellum. A commonality across the most prevalent ataxias is the underlying disease mechanism secondary to expansions of short tandem DNA repeats. There is currently an incomplete understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these repeat expansion disorders, a core feature of which revolves around RNA-dysregulation. In this study, we used both bulk and single nuclear RNA-sequencing to study post-mortem brain tissue of human donors with a range of repeat-expansion ataxias to reveal further mechanistic insights. We compared post-mortem paired cerebellar and frontal cortex tissue bulk RNA-sequencing data from 23 ataxia patients and 22 sex-, age-matched controls from two brain banks (spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7, SCA17, Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), and 7 cases with unknown molecular diagnoses). We analysed bulk RNA-sequencing data for transcript usage, differential and cell-type-specific expression to transcriptomically profile these diseases. We also generated single nuclear RNA-sequencing data of the cerebellum from donors with SCA1, SCA2, SCA6 and FRDA to decipher changes in cell type proportions in the disease state. Using this approach, we found that: (i) despite the commonalities in the genetics of ataxia, there were components of their transcriptional signatures which were distinct; (ii) there were extensive transcriptional changes evident not only in the cerebellum but also the frontal cortex in ataxia cases; (iii) activation of immune and inflammatory pathways, as well as involvement of non-neuronal cell types was a feature of all ataxias to a lesser or greater extent. This study provides a novel resource to understand the mechanisms of disease in ataxia. Furthermore, taken together, these results highlight immune pathways and the role of non-neuronal cell types as early and potentially important therapeutic targets. These findings provide a map of transcriptomic changes in ataxia to further understanding of the underlying pathogenesis.

">Visual field specializations in mouse dLGN</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits throughout the visual system process features differently depending on where they appear in the visual field. While such location-specific processing exists in retina and in superior colliculus, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is thought to lack this specialization. Here, we show systematic visual field biases in dLGN's representation of spatial frequency, orientation, direction, and temporal frequency. Using axon-localized calcium indicators and widefield imaging, we discovered that dLGN boutons show systematic gradients in feature selectivity across the visual cortex (V1), while its retinal inputs lack such gradients for these features. Selective disruption of V1 feedback to dLGN perturbed gradient structure and magnitude. These results suggest that dLGN circuits transform uniformly distributed retinal feature inputs into spatially-biased representations along with cortical feedback. dLGN feature biases would allow a functional stream to detect ethologically salient visual inputs.

">GABAB receptor-mediated potentiation of ventral medial habenula glutamatergic transmission in GABAergic and glutamatergic interpeduncular nucleus neurons</a></h4>

              
                The medial habenula (MHb)-interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) pathway plays an important role in information transferring between the forebrain and the midbrain. The MHb-IPN pathway has been implicated in the regulation of fear behavior and nicotine addiction. The synapses between the ventral MHb and the IPN show a unique property, i.e., an enhancement of synaptic transmission upon activation of GABAB receptors. This GABAB receptor-mediated potentiation of ventral MHb-IPN synaptic transmission has been implicated in regulating fear memory. Although IPN is known to contain parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) GABAergic neurons and vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3)-expressing neurons, it is unknown how GABAB receptor activation affects ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission onto these three subtypes of IPN neurons. Our studies show robust glutamatergic connectivity from ventral MHb to PV and SST neurons in the IPN, while the ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission in IPN VGLUT3 neurons is weak. Although activation of GABAB receptors produces a robust potentiation of ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission in PV neurons, we observed a modest effect in IPN SST neurons. Despite the diminished basal synaptic transmission between ventral MHb and IPN VGLUT3 neurons, activation of GABAB receptors causes transient conversion of non-responding ventral MHb synapses into active synapses in some IPN VGLUT3 neurons. Thus, our results show strong ventral MHb connectivity to GABAergic IPN neurons compared to VGLUT3-expressing IPN neurons. Furthermore, GABAB receptor activation produces a differential effect on ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission onto PV, SST, and VGLUT3 neurons in the IPN.

">Selective attention network in naturalistic auditory scenes is object and scene specific</a></h4>

              
                Everyday auditory scenes often contain overlapping sound objects, requiring selective attention to isolate relevant objects from irrelevant background objects. This study examined how selective attention shapes neural representations of naturalistic sound scenes in the auditory cortex (AC). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded brain activity from participants (n = 20) as they attended to a designated object in scenes comprising three overlapping sounds. Scenes were constructed in two manners: one where each object belonged to a different category (speech, animal, instrument) and another where all objects were from the same category. Attending to speech consistently enhanced activations in lateral AC subfields, while attention to animal and instrument sounds preferentially modulated medial subfields, supporting models where attention modulates feature-selective neural gain in AC. Remarkably, however, spatial pattern analysis revealed that the attended object dominated the AC activation patterns of the entire scene in a manner depending on both object type and scene composition: When the objects of the scene belonged to different categories, attended objects dominated fields processing higher-level category-specific features. In contrast, when all scene objects shared the same category, dominance shifted to fields processing low-level acoustic features. Thus, attention seems to dynamically prioritize the features offering maximal contrast within a given context, emphasizing object-specific patterns in feature-similar scenes and category-level patterns in feature-diverse scenes. Our results support models where top-down signals not only modulate gain but also affect several steps of auditory scene decomposition and analysis - influencing stream segregation and gating of higher-level processing in a contextual manner, adapting to specific auditory environments.

">Discovery of Isobavachin, a natural flavonoid, as an Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) structure corrector for Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by extensive neurodegeneration and consequent severe memory loss. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, with its pathological effects linked to structural instability and altered interactions with lipids and other important disease proteins including amyloid beta (A{beta}) and tau ({tau}). Therefore, correcting and stabilizing the ApoE4 structure has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating its detrimental effects. In this study, we investigated naturally occurring bioavailable flavonoids as ApoE4 stabilizers, focusing on their potential to modulate ApoE4 structure and function. Comprehensive investigation of a focused database using our integrated computational and experimental screening protocol led to the identification of Isobavachin as a potential corrector and stabilizer of ApoE4 structure. In addition, a few other bioavailable flavonoids with similar stabilizing properties were identified, albeit to a much lesser extent as compared to Isobavachin. The findings support the therapeutic potential of flavonoids as ApoE4 modulators and highlight Isobavachin as a lead candidate for further preclinical evaluation. These results provide new insights into the pharmacological targeting of ApoE4 and open avenues for the development of flavonoid-based, ApoE-directed therapies for AD.

">Facilitation of Cav3.2 channel gating in pain pathways reveals a novel mechanism of serum-induced hyperalgesia</a></h4>

              
                The CaV3.2 isoform of T-type voltage-gated calcium channels plays a crucial role in regulating the excitability of nociceptive neurons; the endogenous molecules that modulate its activity, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we used serum proteomics and patch-clamp physiology to discover a novel peptide albumin (1-26) that facilitates channel gating by chelating trace metals that tonically inhibit CaV3.2 via H191 residue. Importantly, serum also potently modulated T-currents in human and rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. In vivo pain studies revealed that injections of serum and albumin (1-26) peptide resulted in robust mechanical and heat hypersensitivity. This hypersensitivity was abolished with a T-channel inhibitor, in CaV3.2 null mice and in CaV3.2 H191Q knock-in mice. The discovery of endogenous chelators of trace metals in the serum deepens our understanding of the role of CaV3.2 channels in neuronal hyperexcitability and may facilitate the design of novel analgesics with unique mechanisms of action.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The p48 MW HPC is a novel low-profile flow diverter covered by a hydrophilic polymer coating with antithrombogenic properties, which may reduce ischemic complications and enable a single antiplatelet therapy after insertion of the stent. In this single-center experience, we describe the efficacy of this device, focusing on the illustration of different therapeutic indications and the outcome in various clinical settings with regard to vessel anatomy, bleeding state, and aneurysm configuration. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our database for all patients being treated with a p48 MW HPC flow diverter between February 2019 and July 2021. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated according to the O&amp;amp;rsquo;Kelly&amp;amp;ndash;Marotta (OKM) scale in the last digital subtraction angiography (DSA) follow-up. Information on complications and medications were collected from our medical records. In addition, to illustrate different indications and clinical settings, we present six of these cases in closer detail. Results: 18 aneurysms in 14 patients were treated with the p48 MW HPC flow diverter and in one case with an additional Derivo device. Periprocedural events occurred in 28.6% of the treated patients, which were all successfully resolved within the same session. Follow-up examination information was available for 67% of patients, of which 75% showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm and 83.3% showed a favorable occlusion result (OKM C-D). Two patients with ruptured aneurysms received a single antiplatelet therapy with ASA without thrombotic complications, at least in the short term. New braid deformation patterns were observed in 16.6% at the follow-up examination, but none with subsequent clinical significance. Conclusions: The p48 MW HPC is safe and effective in the treatment of a wide spectrum of differently configurated, ruptured, and unruptured aneurysms. Single antiplatelet therapy might be an option in selected cases.</p>

	<p>Background: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor deficits and non-motor symptoms, such as depression, which are associated with dopaminergic loss and &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein aggregation in the brain. Objectives: This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of a hydroalcoholic extract of the purple fruit of Eugenia uniflora (PFEU) on motor ability and depressive-like behaviors in a PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in female Wistar rats. Methods: Rats received intranasal administration of MPTP or vehicle, followed by 14 days of oral administration of PFEU (300 or 2000 mg/kg, administered once daily) or vehicle. Depressive-like behavior was assessed using the splash and forced swimming tests, while motor ability was evaluated using the rotarod and open field tests. On day 15, hippocampal tissue was collected for immunoreactivity analysis. Results: MPTP treatment induced depressive-like behavior, which was significantly reversed by PFEU, as evidenced by increased grooming and decreased immobility. No motor coordination or locomotion deficits were observed. Furthermore, PFEU treatment prevented the MPTP-induced increase in hippocampal &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein, p-p53, and Bax while restoring Bcl-2 levels, suggesting neuroprotective effects through the modulation of apoptotic pathways and &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein. Conclusions: These findings support PFEU&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential as a neuroprotective agent for MPTP-induced depressive-like behavior in female rats, highlighting its molecular mechanisms.</p>

                Stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING1) is an immune adaptor protein which promotes innate immune defense mechanisms against pathogens. To enhance our understanding of STING1-associated disease, it is essential to make high-performing antibodies accessible to the scientific community. This study aims to improve reliability of STING1 research as we have characterized sixteen STING1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Higher education is experiencing an increase in students with disabilities, necessitating considering their interests and well-being when preparing educational services. Students with disabilities make up one of the most significant minority groups among students in terms of diversity. Aims This study explored the experiences of students with disabilities at a university in the United Arab Emirates. It also aimed to understand students with disabilities’ social and academic experiences and the factors affecting their university persistence. Methods We used a descriptive qualitative research approach to understand how students with disabilities experience the phenomenon under study. Twenty-five students participated, chosen via purposeful sampling. The data was collected using semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed using content analysis. Results We found four themes that emerged from this study: (1) perceptions about the university, (2) socialization and integration, (3) barriers to the university journey, and (4) support for the journey. Conclusion We found that students with disabilities indicated positive and negative perspectives and experiences. We recommend modifying the physical, social, and educational environments to support the education of students with disabilities. Future studies should employ a more varied sample and include academics and students to collect different perspectives while stressing the students’ experiences.

                This policy brief examines the key factors influencing entrepreneurial success in Lebanon, focusing on gender dynamics, socio-cultural barriers, and systemic challenges. Entrepreneurship plays a critical role in Lebanon’s economic growth, innovation, and job creation, yet local entrepreneurs face significant obstacles. These challenges, including high operational costs, political instability, and gender-based discrimination, are compounded by limited access to resources such as funding, networks, and mentorship, particularly for women. The brief draws on data from the MENA Entrepreneurship and Labour Market Survey (MELMS) to provide insights into Lebanon’s entrepreneurial landscape. Based on the findings, this brief highlights the urgent need for targeted policy interventions aimed at enhancing the entrepreneurial ecosystem and addressing gender inequities. The recommendations include increasing awareness of support services, improving access to financial resources, fostering innovation through tech hubs and R&D incentives, and promoting a more inclusive entrepreneurial culture. To address gender-specific barriers, the brief proposes expanding training and mentorship programs tailored for women, along with targeted outreach efforts to bridge the gap in access to information. Strengthening Lebanon’s entrepreneurial ecosystem through public-private partnerships, international collaborations, and leveraging the Lebanese diaspora is also critical for driving economic resilience. The proposed recommendations call for the establishment of a National Entrepreneurship Strategy that integrates public institutions, NGOs, and private sector initiatives to foster sustainable growth. By creating a more supportive environment for entrepreneurs, Lebanon can unlock its entrepreneurial potential, driving long-term innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness. This brief aims to inform policymakers, donors, and stakeholders of strategic interventions that can contribute to Lebanon’s economic revitalisation.

                Background This study examines the Arabic semi-prepositional contronym /warā’a/ in the Holy Quran, which conveys the dual meanings of ‘behind’ and ‘in front of.’ By employing cognitive linguistic frameworks—Prototype Theory, Image Schema Theory, Conceptual Metaphor Theory, and Frame Semantics—the research investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying the term’s semantic versatility. Methods An in-depth cognitive linguistic analysis was conducted, supported by collocational analysis to explore how /warā’a/ is interpreted in diverse contexts. The study analyzed both prototypical spatial meanings and their metaphorical extensions, focusing on semantic priming and contextual interpretation. Results The findings reveal that the prototypical spatial meaning of /warā’a/ (‘behind’) dynamically extends to metaphorical and temporal contexts, encompassing ideas of concealment, control, deliberate ignorance, future anticipation, and other nuanced interpretations. The research highlights the role of semantic priming in shaping contextual meanings and offers actionable insights for translation accuracy in religious texts. Conclusions This study fills gaps in existing research by providing a detailed exploration of /warā’a/’s semantic complexity. It bridges theoretical insights and practical applications, offering innovative strategies for linguistics and translation studies. Future research directions include cross-linguistic studies of contronyms, psycholinguistic experiments on contradictory meanings, and culturally-informed cognitive-semantic translation strategies. This work contributes significantly to Arabic linguistics and cognitive translation studies.

                Background Anti-viral therapy is not routinely recommended for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in patients who have persistently elevated serum HBV DNA level (>2000 IU/mL), normal alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and without significant liver fibrosis, defining the indeterminate phase. The objective of the study is to identify the factors associated with the progression of liver fibrosis in chronic HBV infected patients in the indeterminate phase. Methods This is cross-sectional study, conducted in Infectious Disease and Hepato-gastroenterology departments of Farhat Hached university hospital, between January 2008 and January 2022. We have included the Ag HBs (+) patients initially not treated, presenting at the time of the initial evaluation: a viral load> 2,000 IU/L for at least six months, normal ALAT (<40UI) and a fibrosis score F0 and/or F1 (in liverbiopsy or FibroScan). Univariate and logisticreg ression analysis were performed to identify the factors associated with liver fibrosis progression. Results In total, 97 patients were included, with a median age of 32.9± 9.1 years, and a female predominance (sex ratio M/F=0.64). Progression of fibrosis was observed in 16 patients (16.5%) with a mean delay of 70.9±41.1 months. In the univariate analysis, factors associated with progression of fibrosis were the presence of comorbidities (p=0.001), the high initial viral load (p=0.004), the appearance of cytolysis (p=0.001) and the increase in viral load (p=0.002), during follow-up. The AUROC of the initial viral load was 0.664 (95%CI: 0.500-0.820). An intial viral load at 8090 UI/l was associated with the progression of fibrosis with a sensibility of 70.3% and specificity of 63%. Conclusion Factors associated with progression of fibrosis in the indeterminate phase of chronic HBV infection were the presence of comorbidities, and changes of ALAT during follow-up. This leads us to consider extending the therapeutic indications to this group of patients.

Results Of 77 AP receiving education, there was significant (p < 0.001) improvement in the perceptions/practices towards temperature regulation (44.55 ± 23.94 vs. 25.94 ± 21.36), glucose homeostasis (46.27 ± 18.83 vs. 18.60 ± 17.50), maintaining asepsis (67.05 ± 17.53 vs. 39.35 ± 16.85), supporting airway (47.73 ± 25.39), circulation (85.26 ± 23.27 vs. 48.45 ± 25.10), along with ambulance equipment availability/usage postintervention. Of 53 neonates studied post intervention, there was a significant reduction in hypothermia (17% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.001), hypoglycemia (16.9% vs. 38.7%, p=0.010), and prolonged capillary refill time (71.7% vs. 46.8%, p=0.042), improvement in the use of intravenous fluids (69.8% vs. 29%, p <0.001), a reduction in growth from umbilical swabs (15.1% vs. 42%, p=0.002) and duration of NICU stay (p = 0.001). Conclusions After educational intervention there was significant improvement in the perceptions and practices of ‘108’ ambulance personnel towards transporting neonates and a significant decrease in hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and duration of NICU stay with improvement in maintenance of circulation and asepsis in neonates.

                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly affects the respiratory tract, but different organs may be involved including the kidney. Data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of AKI complicating critical forms of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective descriptive case/control monocentric study conducted in a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital over a period of 18 months. Results We enrolled 144 patients, with a mean age of 58±13 years old and a male predominance (sex-ratio: 1.25). Forty-one (28%) developed AKI within a median of 4 days (Q1: 3, Q3: 8.5) after hospitalization. It was staged KDIGO class 3, in about half of the cases. Thirteen patients underwent renal replacement therapy and renal function improved in seven cases. Diabetes (OR: 6.07; 95% CI: (1,30-28,4); p: 0.022), nephrotoxic antibiotics (OR: 21; 95% CI: (3,2-146); p: 0.002), and shock (OR: 12.21; 95% CI: (2.87-51.85); p: 0.031,) were the three independent risk factors of AKI onset. Mortality was significantly higher in AKI group (HR:12; 95% CI: (5.81-18.18); p:0.041) but AKI didn’t appear to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome. In fact, age > 53 years (p: 0.018), septic shock complicating hospital acquired infection (p: 0.003) and mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) were the three prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The incidence of AKI was high in this study and associated to an increased mortality. Diabetes, use of nephrotoxic antibiotics and shock contributed significantly to its occurrence. This underlines the importance of rationalizing antibiotic prescription and providing adequate management of patients with hemodynamic instability in order to prevent consequent AKI.

                Objective To compare iodine density (ID) and contrast-enhanced attenuation value (CEAV) from dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLSCT) scans of lymphomatous, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA), and normal cervical lymph nodes. Methods Data including ID and CEAV were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent DLSCT of the neck between January 2020 and August 2023. Results from each group (lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal) were compared and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic curve. Results 129 cervical lymph nodes were collected from patients who met the inclusion criteria (50, 41, and 38 nodes from the lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal group, respectively). The mean ID of lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal nodes was 1.01±0.27, 1.36±0.28, and 1.45±0.29 mg/mL, respectively. Comparing lymphomatous nodes with metastatic SCCA nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.002) and CEAV (p<0.001). Similarly, when comparing lymphomatous nodes with normal nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.001) and CEAV (p<0.001). The optimal ID cut-off value for distinguishing between lymphomatous and metastatic SCCA nodes was 1.175 mg/ml (specificity of 84.2%, sensitivity 77.8%, AUC 0.788, P = 0.003). The optimal CEAV cut-off value was 77.5 HU (specificity 88.9%, sensitivity 78.9%, AUC 0.851, P<0.001). Conclusions The ID and CEAV measurements from DLSCT were significantly different between lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal lymph nodes. These findings indicate that DLSCT can be used to distinguish between these conditions in the diagnosis of cervical lymph nodes.

                Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

                Background Synthetic data’s utility in benchmark studies depends on its ability to closely mimic real-world conditions and reproduce results obtained from experimental data. Building on Nearing et al.’s study (1), who assessed 14 differential abundance tests using 38 experimental 16S rRNA datasets in a case-control design, we are generating synthetic datasets that mimic the experimental data to verify their findings. We will employ statistical tests to rigorously assess the similarity between synthetic and experimental data and to validate the conclusions on the performance of these tests drawn by Nearing et al. (1). This protocol adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines, demonstrating how established reporting frameworks can support robust, transparent, and unbiased study planning. Methods We replicate Nearing et al.’s (1) methodology, incorporating synthetic data simulated using two distinct tools, mirroring the 38 experimental datasets. Equivalence tests will be conducted on a non-redundant subset of 46 data characteristics comparing synthetic and experimental data, complemented by principal component analysis for overall similarity assessment. The 14 differential abundance tests will be applied to synthetic and experimental datasets, evaluating the consistency of significant feature identification and the number of significant features per tool. Correlation analysis and multiple regression will explore how differences between synthetic and experimental data characteristics may affect the results. Conclusions Synthetic data enables the validation of findings through controlled experiments. We assess how well synthetic data replicates experimental data, try to validate previous findings with the most recent versions of the DA methods and delineate the strengths and limitations of synthetic data in benchmark studies. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first computational benchmark study to systematically incorporate synthetic data for validating differential abundance methods while strictly adhering to a pre-specified study protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, contributing to transparency, reproducibility, and unbiased research.

                The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) is a modulator of lipid metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCD1 plays in health and disease can provide novel insides in therapeutic targets, a process that would be facilitated by the availability of high-quality antibodies. Here we have characterized nine SCD1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Liver diseases cause nearly 2 million deaths worldwide each year, with approximately 1 million deaths from cirrhosis complications and another 1 million from viral hepatitis and liver cancer, according to WHO estimates. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the primary curative option, boasting success rates of 85% in the first year and 75% at five years post-transplant. Despite high costs, LT is considered cost-effective, especially for younger patients with active work years remaining. However, post-transplant complications, particularly intrahepatic cholestasis, present notable challenges. This complication arises from factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, infections, immunological rejection, and surgical complications, all contributing to impaired bile flow and liver damage. Current medical therapies for post-LT cholestasis are limited, with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) frequently used, despite questionable efficacy. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist approved by the FDA for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has shown potential benefits in reducing elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Given its significant effects on liver health, OCA may offer therapeutic value in managing post-transplant cholestasis and improving graft survival. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate OCA’s efficacy compared to UDCA in reducing cholestatic injury and enhancing graft function post-LT. The primary outcomes will focus on a 15% reduction in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline one month. Secondary outcomes include molecular markers, biliary complications, graft rejection, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Results are anticipated to demonstrate that OCA could improve graft survival, reduce complications, and enhance quality of life, potentially setting a new standard in post-LT care if found beneficial.

                <p>by Shoutik Mukherjee, Behtash Babadi, Shihab Shamma</p>

Characterizing neuronal responses to natural stimuli remains a central goal in sensory neuroscience. In auditory cortical neurons, the stimulus selectivity of elicited spiking activity is summarized by a spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) that relates neuronal responses to the stimulus spectrogram. Though effective in characterizing primary auditory cortical responses, STRFs of non-primary auditory neurons can be quite intricate, reflecting their mixed selectivity. The complexity of non-primary STRFs hence impedes understanding how acoustic stimulus representations are transformed along the auditory pathway. Here, we focus on the relationship between ferret primary auditory cortex (A1) and a secondary region, dorsal posterior ectosylvian gyrus (PEG). We propose estimating receptive fields in PEG with respect to a well-established high-dimensional computational model of primary-cortical stimulus representations. These “cortical receptive fields” (CortRF) are estimated greedily to identify the salient primary-cortical features modulating spiking responses and in turn related to corresponding spectrotemporal features. Hence, they provide biologically plausible hierarchical decompositions of STRFs in PEG. Such CortRF analysis was applied to PEG neuronal responses to speech and temporally orthogonal ripple combination (TORC) stimuli and, for comparison, to A1 neuronal responses. CortRFs of PEG neurons captured their selectivity to more complex spectrotemporal features than A1 neurons; moreover, CortRF models were more predictive of PEG (but not A1) responses to speech. Our results thus suggest that secondary-cortical stimulus representations can be computed as sparse combinations of primary-cortical features that facilitate encoding natural stimuli. Thus, by adding the primary-cortical representation, we can account for PEG single-unit responses to natural sounds better than bypassing it and considering as input the auditory spectrogram. These results confirm with explicit details the presumed hierarchical organization of the auditory cortex.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) after a long latent period in a fraction of infected individuals. These HTLV-1-infected cells typically have phenotypes similar to that of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, but the cell status is not well understood. To extract the inherent information of HTLV-1-infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, we integratively analyzed the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data of the infected cells. Compared to CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from healthy donors, we found anomalous chromatin accessibility in HTLV-1infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells derived from ATL cases in terms of location and sample-to-sample fluctuations in open chromatin regions. Further, by focusing on systematically selected genes near the open chromatin regions, we quantified the difference between the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in ATL cases and healthy CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in terms of the correlation between the chromatin structures and the gene expressions. Based on a further analysis of chromatin accessibility, we detected <i>TLL1</i> (Tolloid Like 1) as one of the key genes that exhibit unique gene expressions in ATL cases. A luciferase assay indicated that TLL1 has an isoform-dependent regulatory effect on TGF-<i>β</i>. Overall, this study provides results about the status of HTLV-1-infected cells, which are qualitatively consistent across the different scales of chromatin accessibility, transcription, and immunophenotype.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1066/v2?src=rss">Role, function, and expectations of research funding committees: Perspectives from committee members [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee members’ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Aim This quantitative study aimed to develop and evaluate instruments to measure responsible tourism behavior with high academic standards. Methods Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were employed to test the model’s fit with the empirical data. The sample consists of 550 Generation Y tourists selected through multistage quota random sampling. The instruments were created by the researchers to consist of 45 items, each rated on a 6-point scale. Results The analysis results supported all three hypotheses, with the instruments showing an average reliability of .812. The EFA results indicated that 12 items met the criteria, derived from three main components: environmental (four items), social and cultural (four items), and economic (four items). These components explain 62.118% of the variance in responsible tourism behavior. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis results show that the model fits the empirical data well, with indices meeting the standard criteria: χ2 = 52.790, df = 45, p-value = .198, RMSEA = .034, CFI = .979, TLI = .969, SRMA = .054. Conclusioin In conclusion, the researchers suggest using responsible tourism behavior measurement instruments experimentally to create social indices or to further study causal factors and effects.

                Background The search for efficient treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has highlighted the potential of plant-based therapeutic compounds and eco-friendly processes for producing selenium nanoparticles. This study investigates the antidiabetic potential of Moringa oleifera-mediated biogenic selenium nanoparticles (MO-SeNPs) in diabetic rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced with diabetes via a high-fat diet for 2 weeks followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at 45 mg/kg body weight (BW). The rats were divided into five groups: normal, diabetic control, metformin at 100 mg/kg/BW, and two groups treated with oral administration of MO-SeNPs at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg body weight for 28 days. Food and water intake as well as fasting blood glucose and body weight were measured weekly. After the treatment period, rats were sacrificed, and blood and liver samples were harvested for further analysis. Results MO-SeNPs treatment significantly reduced blood glucose levels (p < 0.05) and restored insulin resistance, with lower dose demonstrating better glycaemic control than larger dose. MO-SeNPs also increased hepatic antioxidant enzyme activity, including GSH-Px, CAT, and T-SOD, which neutralise oxidative stress. MO-SeNPs also improves cardiovascular health by raising HDL and lowering LDL. MO-SeNPs showed hepatoprotective benefits by lowering inflammatory markers such TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, and AGEs, and reduced lipid peroxidation. Diabetes raises inflammatory indicators, causing liver damage and other problems. The reduction in these indicators shows MO-SeNPs reduce liver inflammation and protect the liver. The normalisation of liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP) showed improved liver function. Conclusions The findings suggest that the green synthesis of SeNPs using Moringa oleifera offers a viable alternative for diabetes treatment, highlighting its potential to enhance glycemic control and improve overall metabolic health.

                One of the most common benign lesions is dentigerous cyst, which is commonly associated with unerupted tooth crowns. Dentigerous cysts in infants may manifest as swelling or a firm mass in the oral cavity. Such cysts arise from dental follicles, and their development can lead to dental complications such as tooth displacement, root resorption of the adjacent teeth, or infection if not treated carefully. Enucleation is the method of choice for the treatment of such lesions. In the current case report, a rare age presented with 1 a old patient was referred to oral and maxillofacial clinics. In the case of right facial swelling and pain for five days ago, intra- and extra-oral examinations were performed. Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated a well-defined expansile lytic lesion, and parents consented and agreed to proceed with the surgery option. Enucleation was performed surgically, and the patient was followed up for up to 8 months. Significant improvement was noted, with no further complications or recorded complaints.

                Huntingtin encodes a 3144 amino acid protein, with a polyglutamine repeat tract at the N-terminus. Expansion of this repeat tract above a pathogenic threshold of 36 repeats is the causative mutation of Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons. Here we have characterized twenty Huntingtin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background The major component of patchouli oil, patchouli alcohol, is used as fixative and has antimicrobial activity. The function of other components, such as α-guaiene, remains unknown. Therefore, this study reports the antifungal activity of α-guaiene isolated from patchouli oil against for pathogenic fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans ATCC 7102, Microsporum gypseum ATCC 14683, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes ATCC 16404. Methods The material from fraction (249°C-254°C) had the highest α-guaiene. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined using the microdilution technique to evaluate antifungal activity, with n-hexane and medium serving as negative controls, and ketoconazole and fluconazole serving as positive controls. Results The results showed that the MIC value was determined at 45%, 50% for C. albicans, 55%, 60% for A. niger, 50%, 60% for M. gypseum, and 95%, 100% for T. mentagrophytes, respectively. Positive and medium controls demonstrated no microbial growth, whereas negative and growth controls revealed the presence of microorganisms. Fungus resistance to α-guaiene T. mentagrophytes exhibited the highest MIC value. Conclusions Overall, this study reveals that α-guaiene is a promising agent effective against the studied pathogenic fungi.

                Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts wet biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword “liquefaction” emerges as the most popular term in these publications.

                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concurrent illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs and classified based on the severity from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Based on the severity, most pDDIs belong to the ‘moderate’ category (40.07%). Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in identifying and preventing DDIs early, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

     alt="Hippocampal Lesions in Male Rats Produce Retrograde Memory Loss for Over-Trained Spatial Memory but Do Not Impact Appetitive-Contextual Memory: Implications for Theories of Memory Organization in the Mammalian Brain"/>
<p>A general summary of the experimental design and results of the present experiments.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Evidence suggests that hippocampal (HPC) disruption following learning produces retrograde amnesia on a range of tasks. Many of these tasks do not require HPC function in the anterograde direction suggesting that, in the intact brain, the HPC is actively involved during all forms of learning. However, prior work has also demonstrated double dissociations of HPC and amygdala function, which is inconsistent with this view. Here, we aim to understand this discrepancy by assessing the effects of neurotoxic lesions of the HPC on anterograde and retrograde amnesia for conditioned place preference (CPP). This task is dependent on a network centered on the basolateral amygdala and not the HPC. The results show that extensive HPC damage had no impact on the acquisition or expression of CPP. One explanation for this result is that the task requires multiple, distributed training sessions for conditioning to emerge, and it has been proposed that this parameter may eliminate the need for HPC to support memory. To test this, we completed experiments to probe place learning in the Morris water task, which is thought to always require HPC function, but implemented an over-training procedure before HPC damage. We found that rats were severely impaired suggesting that this task parameter does not always allow non-HPC networks to support learning. Finally, an experiment was designed to test whether memories acquired by distinct memory networks on the same days, within hours of one another, would be linked in HPC. The results showed that they remained independent of one another.</p>

                Licón-Muñoz et al. built a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing-based microenvironment landscape of the tumor mass and the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) of 15 patients with GBM. They identify a mesenchymal signature and tumor-supportive microglia that establish cell-to-cell interactions with tumor cells in the SVZ through IL-1β/IL-1RAcP and Wnt-5a/Frizzled-3, representing potential targets for GBM treatment.

                CD4 T cell priming by dendritic cells is defective in the tumor-draining lymph node. Bandola-Simon et al. show that cDC2s in the tumor-draining lymph node retain large amounts of the CLIP “placeholder” peptide in the MHC-II peptide binding groove, thereby diminishing their ability to present antigens and impairing anti-tumor responses.

                Mutte and Barendse et al. developed a search strategy to accurately identify bacterial DNA repair proteins. This enabled systematic analyses of their taxonomic distribution, co-occurrence, genomic clustering, and co-occurrence with bacterial immune systems, offering an updated perspective on the distribution of DNA repair systems and their connection to immune systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99798">Opposing roles for Bmp signalling during the development of electrosensory lateral line organs</a></h4>

              
                The lateral line system enables fishes and aquatic-stage amphibians to detect local water movement via mechanosensory hair cells in neuromasts, and many species to detect weak electric fields via electroreceptors (modified hair cells) in ampullary organs. Both neuromasts and ampullary organs develop from lateral line placodes, but the molecular mechanisms underpinning ampullary organ formation are understudied relative to neuromasts. This is because the ancestral lineages of zebrafish (teleosts) and <i>Xenopus</i> (frogs) independently lost electroreception. We identified <i>Bmp5</i> as a promising candidate via differential RNA-seq in an electroreceptive ray-finned fish, the Mississippi paddlefish (<i>Polyodon spathula</i>; Modrell et al., 2017, <i>eLife</i> 6: e24197). In an experimentally tractable relative, the sterlet sturgeon (<i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>), we found that <i>Bmp5</i> and four other Bmp pathway genes are expressed in the developing lateral line, and that Bmp signalling is active. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis targeting <i>Bmp5</i> in G0-injected sterlet embryos resulted in fewer ampullary organs. Conversely, when Bmp signalling was inhibited by DMH1 treatment shortly before the formation of ampullary organ primordia, supernumerary ampullary organs developed. These data suggest that Bmp5 promotes ampullary organ development, whereas Bmp signalling via another ligand(s) prevents their overproduction. Taken together, this demonstrates opposing roles for Bmp signalling during ampullary organ formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96743">The co-receptor Tetraspanin12 directly captures Norrin to promote ligand-specific β-catenin signaling</a></h4>

              
                Wnt/β-catenin signaling directs animal development and tissue renewal in a tightly controlled, cell- and tissue-specific manner. In the mammalian central nervous system, the atypical ligand Norrin controls angiogenesis and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and blood-retina barrier through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Like Wnt, Norrin activates signaling by binding and heterodimerizing the receptors Frizzled (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6), leading to membrane recruitment of the intracellular transducer Dishevelled (Dvl) and ultimately stabilizing the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin. Unlike Wnt, the cystine knot ligand Norrin only signals through Fzd4 and additionally requires the co-receptor Tetraspanin12 (Tspan12); however, the mechanism underlying Tspan12-mediated signal enhancement is unclear. It has been proposed that Tspan12 integrates into the Norrin-Fzd4 complex to enhance Norrin-Fzd4 affinity or otherwise allosterically modulate Fzd4 signaling. Here, we measure direct, high-affinity binding between purified Norrin and Tspan12 in a lipid environment and use AlphaFold models to interrogate this interaction interface. We find that Tspan12 and Fzd4 can simultaneously bind Norrin and that a pre-formed Tspan12/Fzd4 heterodimer, as well as cells co-expressing Tspan12 and Fzd4, more efficiently capture low concentrations of Norrin than Fzd4 alone. We also show that Tspan12 competes with both heparan sulfate proteoglycans and LRP6 for Norrin binding and that Tspan12 does not impact Fzd4-Dvl affinity in the presence or absence of Norrin. Our findings suggest that Tspan12 does not allosterically enhance Fzd4 binding to Norrin or Dvl, but instead functions to directly capture Norrin upstream of signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100427">Magnesium modulates phospholipid metabolism to promote bacterial phenotypic resistance to antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                Non-inheritable antibiotic or phenotypic resistance ensures bacterial survival during antibiotic treatment. However, exogenous factors promoting phenotypic resistance are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> are recalcitrant to killing by a broad spectrum of antibiotics under high magnesium. Functional metabolomics demonstrated that magnesium modulates fatty acid biosynthesis by increasing saturated fatty acid biosynthesis while decreasing unsaturated fatty acid production. Exogenous supplementation of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids increased and decreased bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics, respectively, confirming the role of fatty acids in antibiotic resistance. Functional lipidomics revealed that glycerophospholipid metabolism is the major metabolic pathway remodeled by magnesium, where phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is reduced and phosphatidylglycerol production is increased. This process alters membrane composition, increasing membrane polarization, and decreasing permeability and fluidity, thereby reducing antibiotic uptake by <i>V. alginolyticus</i>. These findings suggest the presence of a previously unrecognized metabolic mechanism by which bacteria escape antibiotic killing through the use of an environmental factor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97017">The nanoscale organization of the Nipah virus fusion protein informs new membrane fusion mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Paramyxovirus membrane fusion requires an attachment protein for receptor binding and a fusion protein for membrane fusion triggering. Nipah virus (NiV) attachment protein (G) binds to ephrinB2 or -B3 receptors, and fusion protein (F) mediates membrane fusion. NiV-F is a class I fusion protein and is activated by endosomal cleavage. The crystal structure of a soluble GCN4-decorated NiV-F shows a hexamer-of-trimer assembly. Here, we used single-molecule localization microscopy to quantify the NiV-F distribution and organization on cell and virus-like particle membranes at a nanometer precision. We found that NiV-F on biological membranes forms distinctive clusters that are independent of endosomal cleavage or expression levels. The sequestration of NiV-F into dense clusters favors membrane fusion triggering. The nano-distribution and organization of NiV-F are susceptible to mutations at the hexamer-of-trimer interface, and the putative oligomerization motif on the transmembrane domain. We also show that NiV-F nanoclusters are maintained by NiV-F–AP-2 interactions and the clathrin coat assembly. We propose that the organization of NiV-F into nanoclusters facilitates membrane fusion triggering by a mixed population of NiV-F molecules with varied degrees of cleavage and opportunities for interacting with the NiV-G/receptor complex. These observations provide insights into the in situ organization and activation mechanisms of the NiV fusion machinery.

">Independent regulation of memory and emotion by selective retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Selective retrieval of a target memory often triggers inhibitory control to reduce competition from related traces, a process that induces forgetting of the competing content. It is unknown, however, whether inhibition during selective retrieval specifically targets a competitor's episodic representation or instead extends to its affective components. Here we report evidence in humans that selective retrieval of a neutral memory not only diminishes access to the mnemonic content of unpleasant competing memories, but also alters their emotional character. Memory and emotion suppression effects were accompanied by reduced neural activation and weakened representational patterns unique to competing memories in the VTC and amygdala respectively, in an independent fashion. Selective retrieval engaged the left VLPFC, which decreased in activity over repeated retrievals of the same memory, as competition from the unpleasant scene was resolved. This left VLPFC region colocalizes with key prefrontal regions engaged during cognitive reappraisal, suggesting that selective retrieval's impact on affective responses may contribute to reappraisal's benefits. These findings indicate that inhibitory control during selective retrieval affects both mnemonic and affective representations, providing a novel mechanistic basis for a well-known emotion regulation practice.

	<p>Background: The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characteristic of difficulties in social communication and interaction has been previously associated with elevated anxiety and the degree of mental effort required to understand and respond to social cues. These associations have implications for the mental health of autistic youth, but they are usually based on correlational statistics between measures of anxiety and social interaction demands that are collected in formal psychological testing settings. Another index of mental effort that has been found to correlate with anxious arousal is gamma wave activity, which is measured via EEG. Methods: To compare data from both of these indicators of mental effort and anxiety, a two-stage study was conducted using (1) standardized test data and (2) in vivo EEG data in a low-demand social setting. Results: As well as significant associations between social cognition and anxiety from standardized scales, there were also meaningful relationships between social cognition and gamma wave activity. Conclusions: Because gamma wave activity represents the highest level of cognitive complexity for brain activity, is an index of hypervigilance under threatening conditions, and has been associated with anxiety in autistic youth, these findings suggest that even low-level demand social interaction settings may initiate high-level anxiety-related behaviour in autistic youth.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Studies on executive functions in child sex offenders relate their findings to the presence of pedophilia, but they are not able to distinguish between paraphilia and abuse. It is therefore this lack of a distinction that leads us to complement the existing information. Thus, the purpose of this review is to find all available evidence on the neurocognitive and neuroanatomical differences in executive functions among pedophilic and non-pedophilic child sex offenders, and non-offender pedophiles. Methods: The present review, in accordance with the PRISMA statement, ran a systematic search of three databases (Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest). This search identified 5697 potential articles, but only 16 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe, using a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample. Results: The results showed alterations in frontal, temporal and parietal structures related to executive functions (e.g., response inhibition) in child sexual offenders, regardless of the presence of pedophilia. Conclusions: In summary, there are differences in brain structure underlying executive functions related to child sexual abuse, but not to pedophilia as such.</p>

                <p>Brain oscillations in the alpha-band (8&ndash;14&nbsp;Hz) have been linked to specific processes in attention and perception. In particular, decreases in posterior alpha-amplitude are thought to reflect activation of perceptually relevant brain areas for target engagement, while alpha-amplitude increases have been associated with inhibition for distractor suppression. Traditionally, these alpha-changes have been viewed as two facets of the same process. However, recent evidence calls for revisiting this interpretation. Here, we recorded MEG/EEG in 32 participants (19 females) during covert visuospatial attention shifts (spatial cues) and two control conditions (neutral cue, no-attention cue), while tracking fixational eye movements. In disagreement with a single, perceptually relevant alpha-process, we found the typical alpha-modulations contra- and ipsilateral to the attention focus to be triple dissociated in their timing, topography, and spectral features: Ipsilateral alpha-increases occurred early, over occipital sensors, at a high alpha-frequency (10&ndash;14&nbsp;Hz) and were expressed during spatial attention (alpha spatial cue &gt; neutral cue). In contrast, contralateral alpha-decreases occurred later, over parietal sensors, at a lower alpha-frequency (7&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) and were associated with attention deployment in general (alpha spatial and neutral cue &lt; no-attention cue). Additionally, the lateralized early alpha-increases but not alpha-decreases during spatial attention coincided in time with directionally biased microsaccades. Overall, this suggests that the attention-related early alpha-increases and late alpha-decreases reflect distinct, likely reflexive versus endogenously controlled attention mechanisms. We conclude that there is more than one perceptually relevant posterior alpha-oscillation, which need to be dissociated for a detailed account of their roles in perception and attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e1017242024?rss=1">Nonresolving Neuroinflammation Regulates Axon Regeneration in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) lesions retain increased densities of microglia and macrophages. In acute SCI, macrophages induce growth cone collapse and facilitate axon retraction away from lesion boundaries. Little is known about the role of sustained inflammation in chronic SCI or whether chronic inflammation affects regeneration. We used the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor, PLX-5622, to deplete microglia and macrophages months after complete crush SCI in female mice. Transcriptional analyses revealed a significant inflammatory depletion within chronic SCI lesions after PLX-5622 treatment. Both transcriptional analyses and immunohistochemistry revealed that Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells repopulate to predepleted densities after treatment removal. Neuronal-enriched transcripts were significantly elevated in mice after inflammatory repopulation, but no significant effects were observed with inflammatory depletion alone. Axon densities also significantly increased within the lesion after PLX-5622 treatment and after repopulation. To better examine the effect of chronic inflammation on axon regeneration, we tested PLX-5622 treatment in neuronal-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) knock-out (PTEN-KO) mice. PTEN-KO was delivered using spinal injections of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg's). PTEN-KO did not further increase axon densities within the lesion beyond the effects induced by PLX-5622. Axons that grew within the lesion were histologically identified as 5-HT<sup>+</sup> and CGRP<sup>+</sup>, both of which are not robustly transduced by AAVrg's. Our work identified that increased macrophage/microglial densities in the chronic SCI environment may be actively retained by homeostatic mechanisms likely affiliated with a sustained elevated expression of CSF1 and other chemokines. Finally, we identify a novel role of sustained inflammation as a prospective barrier to axon regeneration in chronic SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e1473242024?rss=1">Optogenetic Control of Dopamine Receptor 2 Reveals a Novel Aspect of Dopaminergic Neurotransmission in Motor Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a crucial role in motor function through the coordination of dopamine receptor (DRD) subtypes, such as DRD1 and DRD2, thus the functional imbalance of these receptors can lead to Parkinson's disease. However, due to the complexity of dopaminergic circuits in the brain, it is limited to investigating the individual functions of each DRD subtype in specific brain regions. Here, we developed a light-responsive chimeric DRD2, OptoDRD2, which can selectively activate DRD2-like signaling pathways with spatiotemporal resolution. OptoDRD2 was designed to include the light-sensitive component of rhodopsin and the intracellular signaling domain of DRD2. Upon illumination with blue light, OptoDRD2 triggered DRD2-like signaling pathways, such as G&alpha;i/o subtype recruitment, a decrease in cAMP levels, and ERK phosphorylation. To explore unknown roles of DRD2 in glutamatergic cell populations of basal ganglia circuitry, OptoDRD2 was genetically expressed in excitatory neurons in lateral globus pallidus (LGP) of the male mouse brain. The optogenetic stimulation of OptoDRD2 in the LGP region affected a wide range of locomotion-related parameters, such as increased frequency of movement and decreased immobility time, resulting in the facilitation of motor function of living male mice. Therefore, our findings indicate a potentially novel role for DRD2 in the excitatory neurons of the LGP region, suggesting that OptoDRD2 can be a valuable tool enabling the investigation of unknown roles of DRD2 at specific cell types or brain regions.</p>

                <p>The homeostatic regulation of pulmonary ventilation, and ultimately arterial PCO<SUB>2</SUB>, depends on interactions between respiratory chemoreflexes and arousal state. The ventilatory response to CO<SUB>2</SUB> is triggered by neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) that function as sensors of central pH, which can be identified in adulthood by the expression of Phox2b and neuromedin B. Here, we examine the dynamic response of genetically defined RTN neurons to hypercapnia and arousal state in freely behaving adult male and female mice using the calcium indicator jGCaMP7 and fiber photometry. We found that hypercapnia vigorously activates RTN neurons with a low CO<SUB>2</SUB> recruitment threshold and with response kinetics that match respiratory activity whereas hypoxia had little effect. RTN activity increased transiently during wakefulness and respiratory-related arousals and rose persistently during rapid eye movement sleep, and their CO<SUB>2</SUB> response persisted under anesthesia. Complementary studies using inhibitory optogenetics show that RTN activity supports eupneic breathing under anesthesia as well as during states of high arousal, but their activity is redundant for voluntary breathing patterns. Collectively, this study demonstrates that CO<SUB>2</SUB>-activated RTN neurons are exquisitely sensitive to the arousal state, which determines their contribution to alveolar ventilation in relation to arterial PCO<SUB>2</SUB>.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e1940232024?rss=1">Revealing the Spatial Pattern of Brain Hemodynamic Sensitivity to Healthy Aging through Sparse Dynamic Causal Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Age-related changes in the BOLD response could reflect neurovascular coupling modifications rather than simply impairments in neural functioning. In this study, we propose the use of a sparse dynamic causal model (sDCM) to decouple neuronal and vascular factors in the BOLD signal, with the aim of characterizing the whole-brain spatial pattern of hemodynamic sensitivity to healthy aging, as well as to test the role of hemodynamic features as independent predictors in an age-classification model. sDCM was applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of a cohort of 126 healthy individuals in a wide age range (31 females), providing reliable estimates of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) for each subject and each region of interest. Then, some features characterizing each HRF curve were extracted and used to fit a multivariate logistic regression model predicting the age class of each individual. Ultimately, we tested the final predictive model on an independent dataset of 338 healthy subjects (173 females) selected from the Human Connectome Project in Aging and Development cohorts. Our results entail the spatial heterogeneity of the age effects on the hemodynamic component, since its impact resulted to be strongly region- and population-specific, discouraging any space-invariant&ndash;corrective procedures that attempt to correct for vascular factors when carrying out functional studies involving groups with different ages. Moreover, we demonstrated that a strong interaction exists between certain right-hemisphere hemodynamic features and age, further supporting the essential role of the hemodynamic factor as independent predictor of biological aging, rather than a simple confounding variable.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e2284232024?rss=1">Early Neural Development of Social Interaction Perception: Evidence from Voxel-Wise Encoding in Young Children and Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>From a young age, children have advanced social perceptual and reasoning abilities. However, the neural development of these abilities is still poorly understood. To address this gap, we used fMRI data collected while 122 3&ndash;12-year-old children (64 females) and 33 adults (20 females) watched an engaging and socially rich movie to investigate how the cortical basis of social processing changes throughout development. We labeled the movie with visual and social features, including motion energy, presence of a face and a social interaction, theory of mind (ToM) events, valence, and arousal. Using a voxel-wise encoding model trained on these features, we found that models based on visual (motion energy) and social (faces, social interaction, ToM, valence, and arousal) features can both predict brain activity in children as young as 3&nbsp;years old across the cortex, with particularly high predictivity in motion-selective middle temporal region and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Furthermore, models based on individual social features showed that while there may be some development throughout childhood, social interaction information in the STS is present in children as young as 3&nbsp;years old and appears adult-like by age 7. The current study, for the first time, links neural activity in children to predefined social features in a narrative movie and suggests social interaction perception is supported by early developing neural responses in the STS.</p>

                <p>Learning occurs across multiple timescales, with fast learning crucial for adapting to sudden environmental changes, and slow learning beneficial for extracting robust knowledge from multiple events. Here, we asked if miscalibrated fast vs slow learning can lead to maladaptive decision-making in individuals with problem gambling. We recruited participants with problem gambling (PG; N = 20; 9 female and 11 male) and a recreational gambling control group without any symptoms associated with PG (N = 20; 10 female and 10 male) from the community in Los Angeles, CA. Participants performed a decision-making task involving reward-learning and loss-avoidance while being scanned with fMRI. Using computational model fitting, we found that individuals in the PG group showed evidence for an excessive dependence on slow timescales and a reduced reliance on fast timescales during learning. fMRI data implicated the putamen, an area associated with habit, and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in slow loss-value encoding, with significantly more robust encoding in medial PFC in the PG group compared to controls. The PG group also exhibited stronger loss prediction error encoding in the insular cortex. These findings suggest that individuals with PG have an impaired ability to adjust their predictions following losses, manifested by a stronger influence of slow value learning. This impairment could contribute to the behavioral inflexibility of problem gamblers, particularly the persistence in gambling behavior typically observed in those individuals after incurring loss outcomes.</p>

                <p>Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy has regenerative potentials to treat various pathological conditions including neurological diseases. MSCs isolated from various organs can differentiate into specific cell types to repair organ damages. However, their paracrine mechanisms are predicted to predominantly mediate their immunomodulatory, proangiogenic, and regenerative properties. While preclinical studies highlight the significant potential of MSC therapy in mitigating neurological damage from stroke and traumatic brain injury, the variability in clinical trial outcomes may stem from the inherent heterogeneity of somatic MSCs. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an ideal alternative resource for the unlimited expansion and biomanufacturing of MSCs. Thus, we investigated how iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) influence properties of iPSC-derived neurons. Our findings demonstrate that the secretome from iMSCs possesses neurotrophic effects, improving neuronal survival and promoting neuronal outgrowth and synaptic activity in vitro. Additionally, the iMSCs enhance metabolic activity via mitochondrial respiration in neurons, both in vitro and in mouse models. Glycolytic pathways also increased following the administration of iMSC secretome to iPSC-derived neurons. Consistently, in vivo experiments showed that intravenous administration of iMSCs compensated for the elevated energetic demand in male mice with irradiation-induced brain injury by restoring synaptic metabolic activity during acute brain damage. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging also detected an increase in brain glucose uptake following iMSC administration. Together, our results highlight the potential of iMSC-based therapy in treating neuronal damage in various neurological disorders, while paving the way for future research and potential clinical applications of iMSCs in regenerative medicine.</p>

                <p>Although the therapeutic potential of microRNA-mediated gene regulation has been investigated, its precise functional regulatory mechanism in neuropathic pain remains incompletely understood. In this study, we elucidate that miR-216a-3p serves as a critical noncoding RNA involved in the modulation of trigeminal-mediated neuropathic pain. By conducting RNA-seq and qPCR analysis, we observed a notable decrease of miR-216a-3p in the injured trigeminal ganglia (TG) of male rats. Intra-TG administration of miR-216a-3p agomir or lentiviral-mediated overexpression of miR-216a-3p specifically in sensory neurons of injured TGs alleviated established neuropathic pain behaviors, while downregulation of miR-216a-3p (pharmacologically or genetically) in naive rats induced pain behaviors. Moreover, nerve injury significantly elevated the histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels in the ipsilateral TG, thereby suppressing the SRY-box TF 10 (SOX10) binding to the <I>miR-216a-3p</I> promoter and resulting in the reduction of miR-216a-3p. Inhibiting the enzymes responsible for catalyzing H3K27me3 restored the nerve injury-induced reduction in miR-216a-3p expression and markedly ameliorated neuropathic pain behaviors. Furthermore, miR-216a-3p targeted stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), and the decreased miR-216a-3p associated with neuropathic pain caused a significant upregulation in the protein abundance of STIM1. Conversely, overexpression of miR-216a-3p in the injured TG suppressed the upregulation of STIM1 expression and reversed the mechanical allodynia. Together, the mechanistic understanding of H3K27me3-dependent SOX10/miR-216a-3p/STIM1 signaling axial in sensory neurons may facilitate the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain management.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e0659242024?rss=1">Role of the Medial Posterior Parietal Cortex in Orchestrating Attention and Reaching</a></h4>

              
                <p>The interplay between attention, alertness, and motor planning is crucial for our manual interactions. To investigate the neural bases of this interaction and challenge the views that attention cannot be disentangled from motor planning, we instructed human volunteers of both sexes to plan and execute reaching movements while attending to the target, while attending elsewhere, or without constraining attention. We recorded reaction times to reach initiation and pupil diameter and interfered with the functions of the medial posterior parietal cortex (mPPC) with online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the causal role of this cortical region in the interplay between spatial attention and reaching. We found that mPPC plays a key role in the spatial association of reach planning and covert attention. Moreover, we have found that alertness, measured by pupil size, is a good predictor of the promptness of reach initiation only if we plan a reach to attended targets, and mPPC is causally involved in this coupling. Different from previous understanding, we suggest that mPPC is neither involved in reach planning per se, nor in sustained covert attention in the absence of a reach plan, but it is specifically involved in attention functional to reaching.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e0695242024?rss=1">Intracranial Voltage Profiles from Untangled Human Deep Sources Reveal Multisource Composition and Source Allocation Bias</a></h4>

              
                <p>Intracranial potentials are used as functional biomarkers of neural networks. As potentials spread away from the source populations, they become mixed in the recordings. In humans, interindividual differences in the gyral architecture of the cortex pose an additional challenge, as functional areas vary in location and extent. We used source separation techniques to disentangle mixing potentials obtained by exploratory deep arrays implanted in epileptic patients of either sex to gain access to the number, location, relative contribution, and dynamics of coactive sources. The unique spatial profiles of separated generators made it possible to discern dozens of independent cortical areas for each patient, whose stability maintained even during seizure, enabling the follow up of activity for days and across states. Through matching these profiles to MRI, we associated each with limited portions of sulci and gyri and determined the local or remote origin of the corresponding sources. We also plotted source-specific 3D coverage across arrays. In average, individual recording sites are contributed to by 3&ndash;5 local and distant generators from areas up to several centimeters apart. During seizure, 13&ndash;85% of generators were involved, and a few appeared anew. Significant bias in location assignment using raw potentials is revealed, including numerous false positives when determining the site of origin of a seizure. This is not amended by bipolar montage, which introduce additional errors of its own. In this way, source disentangling reveals the multisource nature and far intracranial spread of potentials in humans, while efficiently addressing patient-specific anatomofunctional cortical divergence.</p>
