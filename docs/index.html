              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15478">Geometry of color perception. Part 1: Structures and metrics of a homogeneous color space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first half of a two-part paper dealing with the geometry of color perception. Here we analyze in detail the seminal 1974 work by H.L. Resnikoff, who showed that there are only two possible geometric structures and Riemannian metrics on the perceived color space P compatible with the set of Schr\"odinger's axioms completed with the hypothesis of homogeneity. We recast Resnikoff's model into a more modern colorimetric setting, provide a much simpler proof of the main result of the original paper and motivate the need of psychophysical experiments to confute or confirm the linearity of background transformations, which act transitively on P. Finally, we show that the Riemannian metrics singled out by Resnikoff through an axiom on invariance under background transformations are not compatibles with the crispening effect, thus motivating the need of further research about perceptual color metrics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15906">Restricted Repetitive Behaviors in Adolescent Males with Autism: Volatility in Brain Functional Connectivities</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies subtypes of restricted, repetitive and stereotypical behaviors (RRBs) in adolescent males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the viewpoint of the dynamics of brain functional connectivities (FCs). Data from the ABIDE-II repository and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) metrics are used to form two ASD groups with tightly controlled demographics; one comprises subjects with scores above threshold for the self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) subscale, and the other subjects with scores below threshold for SIBs, but above threshold for at least one of the other subscales (stereotyped, compulsive, ritualistic, insistence on sameness, restricted interests). The dynamics of the coherence for FCs across distinct frequency bands are compared against matched controls, using a novel volatility measure computed in time-frequency space. We find statistically significant differences, on average, in the volatility of a relatively small set of FCs, most mapping to either the default mode network or the cerebellum, in the mid- and high-frequency bands, and yielding higher volatility in subjects with high levels of SIBs. Results suggest a distinct underlying profile for SIBs involving multiple brain regions associated with rewards and emotions processing. The work contributes to the identification of neural substrates potentially underlying behavioral subtypes, and may help target interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15288">Magnetic Field-dependent Isotope Effect Supports Radical Pair Mechanism in Tubulin Polymerization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak magnetic fields and isotopes have been shown to influence biological processes; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly because the corresponding interaction energies are far below thermal energies, making classical explanations challenging or impossible. Microtubules, dynamic cytoskeletal fibers, offer an ideal system to test weak magnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity to magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this study, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how nuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining interactions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields. Our experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect, which can be explained via a radical pair mechanism, explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties rather than isotopic mass differences. This nuclear spin-driven isotope effect is notably enhanced under an applied weak magnetic field of approximately 3 mT. Our theoretical model based on radical pairs achieves quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. These results establish a direct connection between quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing new insights into how weak magnetic fields influence cellular and biomolecular functions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15665">Brain states analysis of EEG predicts multiple sclerosis and mirrors disease duration and burden</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.15665v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.

                arXiv:2502.05814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel topological framework for analyzing functional brain signals using time-frequency analysis. By integrating persistent homology with time-frequency representations, we capture multi-scale topological features that characterize the dynamic behavior of brain activity. This approach identifies 0D (connected components) and 1D (loops) topological structures in the signal's time-frequency domain, enabling robust extraction of features invariant to noise and temporal misalignments. The proposed method is demonstrated on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, showcasing its ability to discern critical topological patterns and provide insights into functional connectivity. This topological approach opens new avenues for analyzing complex brain signals, offering potential applications in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19001">Cross-domain Fiber Cluster Shape Analysis for Language Performance Cognitive Score Prediction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.19001v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00035">EEG Right & Left Voluntary Hand Movement-based Virtual Brain-Computer Interfacing Keyboard Using Hybrid Deep Learning Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.00035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), offer promising solutions for assisting individuals with motor disabilities. However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15672">Comparative Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms for Energy-Aware Production Scheduling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy transition is driving rapid growth in renewable energy generation, creating the need to balance energy supply and demand with energy price awareness. One such approach for manufacturers to balance their energy demand with available energy is energyaware production planning. Through energy-aware production planning, manufacturers can align their energy demand with dynamic grid conditions, supporting renewable energy integration while benefiting from lower prices and reduced emissions. Energy-aware production planning can be modeled as a multi-criteria scheduling problem, where the objectives extend beyond traditional metrics like makespan or required workers to also include minimizing energy costs and emissions. Due to market dynamics and the NP-hard multi-objective nature of the problem, evolutionary algorithms are widely used for energy-aware scheduling. However, existing research focuses on the design and analysis of single algorithms, with limited comparisons between different approaches. In this study, we adapt NSGA-III, HypE, and $\theta$-DEA as memetic metaheuristics for energy-aware scheduling to minimize makespan, energy costs, emissions, and the number of workers, within a real-time energy market context. These adapted metaheuristics present different approaches for environmental selection. In a comparative analysis, we explore differences in solution efficiency and quality across various scenarios which are based on benchmark instances from the literature and real-world energy market data. Additionally, we estimate upper bounds on the distance between objective values obtained with our memetic metaheuristics and reference sets obtained via an exact solver.

                arXiv:2504.15371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neuromorphic event cameras have overwhelming advantages in temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, the event cameras output asynchronous, sparse, and irregular events, which are not compatible with mainstream computer vision and deep learning methods. Various methods have been proposed to solve this issue but at the cost of long preprocessing procedures, losing temporal resolutions, or being incompatible with massively parallel computation. Inspired by the great success of the word to vector, we summarize the similarities between words and events, then propose the first event to vector (event2vec) representation. We validate event2vec on classifying the ASL-DVS dataset, showing impressive parameter efficiency, accuracy, and speed than previous graph/image/voxel-based representations. Beyond task performance, the most attractive advantage of event2vec is that it aligns events to the domain of natural language processing, showing the promising prospect of integrating events into large language and multimodal models. Our codes, models, and training logs are available at https://github.com/fangwei123456/event2vec.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005">CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.16005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.

                arXiv:2504.16020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AlphaGrad, a memory-efficient, conditionally stateless optimizer addressing the memory overhead and hyperparameter complexity of adaptive methods like Adam. AlphaGrad enforces scale invariance via tensor-wise L2 gradient normalization followed by a smooth hyperbolic tangent transformation, $g' = \tanh(\alpha \cdot \tilde{g})$, controlled by a single steepness parameter $\alpha$. Our contributions include: (1) the AlphaGrad algorithm formulation; (2) a formal non-convex convergence analysis guaranteeing stationarity; (3) extensive empirical evaluation on diverse RL benchmarks (DQN, TD3, PPO). Compared to Adam, AlphaGrad demonstrates a highly context-dependent performance profile. While exhibiting instability in off-policy DQN, it provides enhanced training stability with competitive results in TD3 (requiring careful $\alpha$ tuning) and achieves substantially superior performance in on-policy PPO. These results underscore the critical importance of empirical $\alpha$ selection, revealing strong interactions between the optimizer's dynamics and the underlying RL algorithm. AlphaGrad presents a compelling alternative optimizer for memory-constrained scenarios and shows significant promise for on-policy learning regimes where its stability and efficiency advantages can be particularly impactful.

                arXiv:2501.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving fast and reliable temporal signal encoding is crucial for low-power, always-on systems. While current spike-based encoding algorithms rely on complex networks or precise timing references, simple and robust encoding models can be obtained by leveraging the intrinsic properties of analog hardware substrates. We propose an encoding framework inspired by biological principles that leverages intrinsic neuronal variability to robustly encode continuous stimuli into spatio-temporal patterns, using at most one spike per neuron. The encoder has low model complexity, relying on a shallow network of heterogeneous neurons. It relies on an internal time reference, allowing for continuous processing. Moreover, stimulus parameters can be linearly decoded from the spiking patterns, granting fast information retrieval. Our approach, validated on both analog neuromorphic hardware and simulation, demonstrates high robustness to noise, spike jitter, and reduced heterogeneity. Consistently with biological observations, we observed the spontaneous emergence of patterns with stereotyped spiking order. The proposed encoding scheme facilitates fast, robust and continuous information processing, making it well-suited for low-power, low-latency processing of temporal data on analog neuromorphic substrates.

">Auditory Brainstem Development in Autism: From Childhood Hypo-Responsivity to Adult Hyper-Reactivity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by sensory disruptions, including auditory processing differences, which can significantly impact social, emotional, and cognitive development. This study investigates auditory brainstem development in Autistic children and adults using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and acoustic startle responses (ASRs), two key measures of auditory processing. We hypothesize that early hypo-responsivity in children, measured with ABRs, may lead to compensatory neural adaptations, resulting in hyper-reactivity in adulthood, measured by ASRs. Methods: The study included 40 Autistic children, 57 non-Autistic children, 20 Autistic adults, and 21 non-Autistic adults. Participants underwent peripheral hearing screening, ABR testing at slow and fast click-rates, and ASR measurements. ABR wave and ASR latencies and amplitudes were analyzed. Statistical analyses included mixed-model ANOVAs and Spearmans correlations to examine group differences and associations with age. Results: Autistic children exhibited increased ABR wave latencies and reduced amplitudes, indicating slower neurotransmission and reduced neural responsivity in the ascending auditory pathway. In contrast, Autistic adults showed normalized ABR latencies but increased ASR magnitude, suggesting hyper-reactivity to auditory stimuli. Age-related correlations revealed that ABR latencies increased with age in non-Autistic participants, while ASR magnitude was negatively correlated with age in non-Autistic participants. The associations were significantly different between groups. Conclusion: The findings support the hypothesis that Autistic children experience auditory brainstem hypo-responsivity, which may normalize in adulthood but lead to maladaptive hyper-reactivity. These results highlight the role of early auditory disruptions in shaping long-term sensory processing and reactivity in Autism, emphasizing the need for further research into the neural mechanisms underlying these differences.

">Synaptic Encoding of Time in Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                The processing of temporally-extended sequences of stimuli critically relies on Working Memory (WM). Yet, how WM supports the encoding and retrieval of novel sequences is unknown. Existing theories rely on associative learning driven by repetitions and are, thus, unable to explain how people can reproduce novel sequences of stimuli immediately. Here, we propose that detailed temporal information about a novel sequence can be rapidly stored in WM by short-term synaptic plasticity over multiple time scales. To substantiate this proposal, we extend our previously-proposed synaptic theory of WM to include synaptic augmentation, besides more short-lived depression and facilitation, consistently with experimental observations. The long time scales associated with augmentation naturally lead to the emergence of a temporal gradient in the synaptic efficacies, which can be used to immediately replay, at normal speed or in a time-compressed way, novel sequences. The theory is consistent with behavioral and neurophysiological observations.

">Transcriptomes of higher order thalamic nuclei in obsessive compulsive disorder</a></h4>

              
                Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric illness associated with altered function in cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits. In this pilot study, we examined differential RNA expression in the thalamus using postmortem human brain tissue samples from 11 subjects with OCD and 10 unaffected subjects. We individually dissected the mediodorsal magnocellular, mediodorsal parvocellular, and ventral anterior nuclei, which participate in orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate CSTC circuits most frequently associated with OCD, and the posterior ventrolateral nucleus, which participates in premotor and motor circuits that are increasingly implicated in OCD. Preselected GABAergic, glutamatergic and ion channel genes were analyzed via qPCR. Two genes required for GABA synthesis and release, GAD1 and SLC32A1, were found to be downregulated in OCD subjects across all nuclei, and potassium channel KCNN3 was upregulated. In parallel, we performed an exploratory total RNAseq differential expression analysis. We identified few (12 - 52) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each nucleus, and only one DEG in a pooled analysis of all nuclei. No DEGs were significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Investigation by model selection indicated that OCD diagnosis was not a useful factor in modelling gene expression in our dataset. OCD was also not associated with any modules of co-expressed genes identified using weighted gene correlation network analysis. Overall, we found minimal evidence of differential RNA expression in these thalamic nuclei in OCD. These findings contrast with our previous work including many of the same subjects where we found widespread differential mRNA expression in the orbitofrontal cortex and striatum in OCD.

">Face-, color-, and word-specific patches in the human orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) contains multiple category-specific areas, organized along posterior-to-anterior and medial-to-lateral axes. However, the role of regions beyond the VOTC in category-specific processing remains less explored. Here, we report the presence of face-, color- and word-specific patches in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and systematically describe their location, activity amplitude, category selectivity, representational content, and functional connectivity. We compare these features with those of corresponding VOTC category-specific patches. Our findings reveal that face- and color-specific patches in the OFC follow a similar medial-lateral organization to those in the VOTC and form continuous functional gradients with VOTC patches. These results suggest that the OFC contains a topographic organization similar to, but at a higher hierarchical level than, the VOTC object categorization system.

First, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that the superior parietal lobule (SPL) responds significantly more to scene stimuli than to face and object stimuli across two sets of stimuli (i.e. dynamic and static), confirming its scene selectivity. Second, we found that the SPL, like the OPA, processes two kinds of information necessary for visually guided navigation: first-person perspective motion and sense (left/right) information in scenes. Third, resting-state fMRI data revealed that SPL is preferentially connected to OPA, compared to other scene-selective regions, indicating that SPL and OPA are part of the same system. Fourth, analysis of previously published fMRI data showed that SPL, like OPA, responds significantly more while participants perform a visually guided navigation task compared to both a scene categorization task and a baseline task, further supporting our hypothesis in an independent dataset. Taken together, these findings indicate the existence of a new scene-selective region for visually guided navigation and raise interesting questions about the precise role that SPL, compared to OPA, may play within visually guided navigation.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Theoretical proposals and empirical findings both highlight the relevance of theta brain oscillations in human spatial navigation. However, whilst the general assumption is that the relevant theta band activity is purely oscillatory, most empirical studies fail to disentangle oscillatory episodes from wide band activity. In addition, experimental approaches often rely on averaged activity across trials and subjects, disregarding moment-to-moment fluctuations in theta activity, contingent on key aspects of the task. Here, we used novel oscillation detection approaches to investigate the dynamics of theta and alpha episodes in human subjects performing a spatial navigation task in a virtual reality environment, resolved at single-trial level. The results suggest that bouts of frontal theta oscillatory activity are related to task difficulty and access to previously encoded information, across different timescales. Parietal alpha episodes, instead, seem to anticipate successful navigational decisions and could be related to shifts in internal attention.</span>

Cultured neural networks <i>in vitro</i> have demonstrated the biocomputing capability to recognize patterns. However, the underlying mechanisms behind information processing and pattern recognition remain less understood. Here, we developed an <i>in vitro</i> neural network integrated with microelectrode arrays (MEAs) to explore the network’s classification capability and elucidate the mechanisms underlying this classification. After applying different stimulation patterns using MEAs, the network exhibited structural alterations and distinct electrical responses that recognized various stimulation patterns. Alongside the reshaping of network structures, repeated training increased recognition accuracy for each stimulation pattern. Additionally, it was reported for the first time that spontaneous networks after stimulation are more closely related to the structures of evoked networks. This work provides new insights into the structural changes underlying information processing and contributes to our understanding of how cultured neural networks respond to different patterns.

The role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in cognition is a frequently studied yet highly debated topic in neuroscience. Most authors agree that the dACC is involved in either cognitive control (e.g., voluntary inhibition of automatic responses) or monitoring (e.g., comparing expectations with outcomes, detecting errors, tracking surprise). A consensus on which theoretical perspective best explains dACC contribution to behaviour is still lacking, as two distinct sets of studies report dACC activation in tasks requiring surprise tracking for performance monitoring and cognitive control without involving surprise monitoring, respectively. This creates a theoretical impasse, as no single current account can reconcile these findings. Here we propose a novel hypothesis on dACC function that integrates both the monitoring and the cognitive control perspectives in a unifying, meta-Reinforcement Learning framework, in which cognitive control is optimized by meta-learning based on tracking Bayesian surprise. We tested the quantitative predictions from our theory in three different functional neuroimaging experiments at the basis of the current theory crisis. We show that the meta-Reinforcement Learning perspective successfully captures all the neuroimaging results by predicting both cognitive control and monitoring functions, proposing a solution to the theory crisis about dACC function within an integrative framework. In sum, our results suggest that dACC function can be framed as a meta-learning optimisation of cognitive control, providing an integrative perspective on its roles in cognitive control, surprise tracking, and performance monitoring.

Accurate prediction of molecular properties is a key component of Artificial Intelligence-driven Drug Design (AIDD). Despite significant progress in improving these predictive models, balancing accuracy with computational complexity remains a challenge. Molecular topological and geometric features provide rich spatial information, crucial for improving prediction accuracy, but their extraction typically increases model complexity. To address this, we propose TGF-M (Topology-augmented Geometric Features for Molecular Property Prediction), a novel predictive model that optimizes feature extraction to enhance information capture and improve model accuracy, and reduces model complexity to lower computational cost. This approach enhances the model’s ability to leverage both topological and geometric features without unnecessary complexity. On the re-segmented PCQM4Mv2 dataset, TGF-M performs remarkably, achieving a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0647 in the HOMO-LUMO gap prediction task with only 6.4M parameters. Compared to two recent state-of-the-art models evaluated within a unified validation framework, TGF-M demonstrates comparable performance with less than one-tenth of the parameters. We conducted an in-depth analysis of TGF-M’s chemical interpretability. The results further validate the method’s effectiveness in leveraging complex molecular topology and geometry during model learning, underscoring its potential and advantages. The trained models and source code of TGF-M are publicly available at https://github.com/TiAW-Go/TGF-M.

The modular and hierarchical organization of the brain is believed to support the coexistence of segregated (specialization) and integrated (binding) information processes. A relevant question is yet to understand how such architecture naturally emerges and is sustained over time, given the plastic nature of the brain’s wiring. Following evidences that the sensory cortices organize into assemblies under selective stimuli, it has been shown that stable neuronal assemblies can emerge due to targeted stimulation, embedding various forms of synaptic plasticity in presence of homeostatic and/or control mechanisms. Here, we show that simple spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules, based only on pre- and post-synaptic spike times, can also lead to the stable encoding of memories in the absence of any control mechanism. We develop a model of spiking neurons, trained by stimuli targeting different sub-populations. The model satisfies some biologically plausible features: (i) it contains excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian STDP; (ii) neither the neuronal activity nor the synaptic weights are frozen after the learning phase. Instead, the neurons are allowed to fire spontaneously while synaptic plasticity remains active. We find that only the combination of two inhibitory STDP sub-populations allows for the formation of stable modules in the network, with each sub-population playing a distinctive role. The Hebbian sub-population controls for the firing activity, while the anti-Hebbian neurons promote pattern selectivity. After the learning phase, the network settles into an asynchronous irregular resting-state. This post-learning activity is associated with spontaneous memory recalls which turn out to be fundamental for the long-term consolidation of the learned memories. Due to its simplicity, the introduced model can represent a test-bed for further investigations on the role played by STDP on memory storing and maintenance.

                <p>by Jack Stein, D’Artagnan Greene, Flavio Fenton, Yohannes Shiferaw</p>

Early-after depolarizations (EADs) are changes in the action potential plateau that can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. At the cellular level, these oscillations are irregular and change from beat to beat due to the sensitivity of voltage repolarization to subcellular stochastic processes. However, the behavior of EADs in tissue, where cells are strongly coupled by gap junctions, is less understood. In this study, we develop a computational model of EADs caused by a reduction in the rate of calcium-induced inactivation of the L-type calcium channel. We find that, as inactivation decreases EADs occur with durations varying randomly from beat to beat. In cardiac tissue, however, gap junction coupling between cells dampens these fluctuations, and it is unclear what dictates the formation of EADs. In this study we show that EADs in cardiac tissue can be modeled by the deterministic limit of a stochastic single-cell model. Analysis of this deterministic model reveals that EADs emerge in tissue after an abrupt transition to alternans, where large populations of cells suddenly synchronize, causing EADs on every other beat. We analyze this transition and show that it is due to a discontinuous bifurcation that leads to a large change in the action potential duration in response to very small changes in pacing rate. We further demonstrate that this transition is highly arrhythmogenic, as the sudden onset of EADs on alternate beats in cardiac tissue promotes conduction block and reentry. Our results highlight the importance of EAD alternans in arrhythmogenesis and suggests that ectopic beats may not be required.

Human Werner syndrome (adult progeria, a well-established model of human aging) is caused by mutations in the Werner syndrome (WRN) gene. However, the expression patterns and functions of WRN in natural aging remain poorly understood. Despite the link between WRN deficiencies and progeria, our analyses of human colon tissues, mouse crypts, and <i>Drosophila</i> midguts revealed that WRN expression does not decrease but rather increases in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) with aging. Mechanistically, we found that the <i>Drosophila</i> WRN homologue (WRNexo) binds to Heat shock 70-kDa protein cognate 3 (Hsc70-3/Bip) to regulate the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR<sup>ER</sup>). Activation of the WRNexo-mediated UPR<sup>ER</sup> in ISCs is required for ISC proliferation during injury repair. However, persistent DNA damage during aging leads to chronic upregulation of WRNexo in ISCs, where excessive WRNexo-induced ER stress drives age-associated gut hyperplasia in <i>Drosophila</i>. This study reveals how elevated WRNexo contributes to stem cell aging, providing new insights into organ aging and the pathogenesis of age-related diseases, such as colon cancer.

                <p>by Carolin Mundinger, Nora K. E. Schulz, Pragya Singh, Steven Janz, Maximilian Schurig, Jacob Seidemann, Joachim Kurtz, Caroline Müller, Holger Schielzeth, Vanessa T. von Kortzfleisch, S. Helene Richter</p>

The reproducibility of studies involving insect species is an underexplored area in the broader discussion about poor reproducibility in science. Our study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic multi-laboratory investigation into the reproducibility of ecological studies on insect behavior. We implemented a 3 × 3 experimental design, incorporating three study sites, and three independent experiments on three insect species from different orders: the turnip sawfly (<i>Athalia rosae</i>, Hymenoptera), the meadow grasshopper (<i>Pseudochorthippus parallelus</i>, Orthoptera), and the red flour beetle (<i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, Coleoptera). Using random-effect meta-analysis, we compared the consistency and accuracy of treatment effects on insect behavioral traits across replicate experiments. We successfully reproduced the overall statistical treatment effect in 83% of the replicate experiments, but overall effect size replication was achieved in only 66% of the replicates. Thus, though demonstrating sufficient reproducibility in some measures, this study also provides the first experimental evidence for cases of poor reproducibility in insect experiments. Our findings further show that reasons causing poor reproducibility established in rodent research also hold for other study organisms and research questions. We believe that a rethinking of current best practices is required to face reproducibility issues in insect studies but also across disciplines. Specifically, we advocate for adopting open research practices and the implementation of methodological strategies that reduce bias and problems arising from over-standardization. With respect to the latter, the introduction of systematic variation through multi-laboratory or heterogenized designs may contribute to improved reproducibility in studies involving any living organisms.

                Objective To develop and test the psychometric properties of the Thai version of the Impact and Burden of Care Scale for Caregivers of Persons with Schizophrenia and Co-occurring Methamphetamine Use (TIBSCSM). Methods This pilot study involved 142 caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use. Sample adequacy was assessed using the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) method, while Bartlett’s test evaluated the item correlation matrix. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify underlying factors. Results The 32-item TIBSCSM showed convergent validity correlations with two quality-of-life measures. The KMO value was 0.90, and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity yielded χ2 = 5248.5, df = 496, p < 0.001. The Content Validity Index (CVI) was 1, indicating high internal consistency reliability (α = 0.90). EFA identified four constructs: physical function, self-esteem, role and social enjoyment, and relationship satisfaction. The model exhibited strong reliability and validity, with an average variance extracted (AVE) of 0.948 and composite reliability (CR) of 0.987, accounting for 64.90% of the variance. Conclusion The TIBSCSM scale provides valuable insights for psychiatric nurses and mental health teams to measure the impact and burden experienced by caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use. It is particularly useful for nursing, research, education, and clinical practice, especially in addressing the caregiver burdens exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implication for nursing and research The TIBSCSM, developed in the Thai context, can facilitate studies evaluating variations in caregiver impact across different settings.

                Background Amidst the global escalation of COVID-19, nurses have confronted the dual challenge of exposure to infection and the duty to provide patient care, leading to some moral dilemmas. This study aims to investigate the dilemmas, occupational and psychological distresses and professional rewards experienced by nurses working in COVID-19 wards and explore their nature and interrelation. Methods This qualitative descriptive study employed semi-structured interviews to gather data on the experiences of nurses who worked in COVID-19 wards. The study spanned from January 2022 to March 2023. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze interview transcripts. Results The study involved 12 participants (8 women and 4 men). Their experience ranged from four-21 years. The group included six staff nurses, three deputy head nurses, and three head nurses, totaling six head nurses in managerial positions. No significant changes were observed in weekly working hours pre- and post-COVID-19. Analysis of the interviews revealed that nurses working in COVID-19 wards experienced conflicts related to the risk of infection at work, role execution, organizational challenges, and interpersonal relationships. Concurrently, they also reported finding rewards in their work and in building connections with others. Conclusions This study revealed that nurses experienced distress related to COVID-19-related job challenges, leading to a sense of mistrust towards their organizations. However, working in COVID-19 wards also brought a renewed sense of job fulfillment, particularly through interactions with individuals they had not previously encountered. These experiences are illustrative of the dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in balancing the distress and rewards inherent in their roles.

<p>The need for pragmatic clinical trials evaluating therapeutic interventions in patients with neurological disease is continually increasing due to availability of multiple therapeutic interventions (comparative effectiveness), multifaceted approaches (multiple concurrent synergistic therapeutic interventions), and gaps in trial-specific and real-world population outcomes. Several designs for pragmatic trials are available, including individual randomized trials with pragmatic characteristics, cluster-randomized and non-randomized trials, and observational prospective cohort studies. Cluster trials may have parallel cluster and crossover (unidirectional, bidirectional, and alternating crossover) designs. There are unique aspects of consenting and data collection leveraging existing registries, electronic health records (EHRs), and claims data that make pragmatic trials most suited to study the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with neurological diseases in real-world settings.

                Background Widespread adoption of a westernized diet represents a major lifestyle change characterized by substantially higher sodium consumption and lower potassium intake, which is related to cardiovascular morbidity. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis over published studies in accordance with quantifying the dietary intake of sodium and potassium of the universal population across the world. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were used to find research that pronounced 24-hour urinary sodium or potassium excretion (reference period: 2014–2021). The effect size was estimated using the fixed-effect model; sub-group analysis become accomplished to determine urinary sodium and potassium excretion disaggregated by geographical location. Publication bias became evaluated the usage of graphical funnel plot. Data analysis was performed using STATA 16. Results Forty-three studies (n= 62,940) qualified the selection criteria. The mean urinary excretion of sodium and potassium was 156.73 mmol/24h [95% confidence interval (CI), 148.98–164.47] and 48.89 mmol/24 h (95% CI, 43.61–54.17), respectively; the mean urinary sodium/potassium ratio was 3.68 (95% CI, 2.96–4.40). Conclusions This updated systematic review highlights excessively high dietary intake of sodium and low intake of potassium at the community level in most parts of the world. The urinary Na/K ratio exceeded the level recommended by the WHO guidelines.

                Background Maxillofacial prosthetic materials exhibit a range of qualities that vary considerably, including the hardness and stiffness of alloys and polymers, as well as the flexibility of elastomers and soft polymers. Silicone elastomers are the primary materials employed for maxillofacial prostheses due to their physical properties, which allow for adaptation to the movement of soft tissue. They also exhibit exceptional tensile and tear strength across a broad temperature range. Silicone elastomers can be classified according to the vulcanization process: High-temperature vulcanization (HTV) silicones, and Room temperature vulcanization (RTV) silicones. The addition of nanoparticle enhances thermal and tear strength of maxillofacial silicon. This study estimates the influence of addition tantalum oxide nanoparticle on thermal conductivity and tear strength after addition on maxillofacial silicone. Method Tantalum oxide nanoparticles were added into VST-50F platinum silicone elastomer at two weight percentages: 1wt% and 1.5wt%. 60 specimens were prepared and classified into two groups: one control group for each property and two experimental groups. All collected data underwent statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, with significance set at p < 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test and Bartlett’s test were employed to assess the normality and homogeneity of the data, respectively. Result The one-way ANOVA test found a very significant difference between all groups, while Bonferroni’s test revealed a highly significant difference between the control and experimental groups. Thermal conductivity test found no significant difference between the 1wt% and 1.5wt% groups, however the tear strength test was highly significant. Conclusions The addition tantalum oxide nano particles improve tear strength and thermal conductivity.

                Background Drinking water of the right and approved quality is a basic requirement for the development of any civilization. According to SDG 6 it is crucial to provide every citizen with equitable water quality and quantity. Methods The study area is the smart city of Bhubaneswar with 67 wards and three zones: the north zone, south-west zone, and south-east zone with around 12.4 lakhs population. To maintain the water quality in the supply pipeline in this city, which is always assumed to be safe, it needs to be examined within certain time intervals to check the contamination. In this context, studies on water quality parameters in the supply pipeline network from different anticipated vulnerable areas have been collected for testing. In this context, water samples were collected from areas near industries, market complexes, educational institutions, and construction sites of each ward of Bhubaneswar. Nearly 10 water quality parameters were tested and analyzed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index method. This method takes input of all the parameters and provides the overall water quality index value, which classifies the water in different grades like excellent, good, poor, and very poor quality. Results According to the WHO (2011) guidelines, the study found that there is a deviation in the parameters like 10.78% in pH, 19.48% in dissolved oxygen, 43.88% in conductivity, and 22.95% in hardness from the standard limit, but the overall water quality index indicates the water is not in the poor and very poor range. Also, water quality index values identify that the water in the south-east zone is excellent compared to the north and south-west zones. The reason for the slight deterioration is due to the underground cable works, road works and also some areas where the old pipeline system is still existing due to personal encroachment of people as per Public health Engineering department.

                Background Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, characterized by progressive optic neuropathy and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Although lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the mainstay of glaucoma management, many patients continue to experience vision loss, underscoring the need for adjunctive neuroprotective approaches. In Ayurveda, Rasayana therapies are believed to slow degenerative processes. One such intervention is a Rasayana Formulation (RF) comprising three oral preparations; Rasayana Churna (RC), Saptamrita Lauha (SL), and Yashada Bhasma (YB). Additionally, topical Arka (distilled extract) of Shigru Pallava (SP) has been used traditionally for glaucoma and may have an IOP-lowering effect. Methods This is an open-label, two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial with a 2:3 (control: intervention) allocation ratio. A total of 50 previously or newly diagnosed POAG patients (IOP < 30 mmHg) are planned for enrollment. The control group receives the conventional standard of care alone, whereas the intervention group receives standard care plus RF (2.5 g, taken orally twice daily) and SP eye drops (1 drop, four times daily), administered for 90 days with a further 90-day follow-up. Primary outcomes include changes in optic nerve function measured by visual field indices (mean deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD), visual field index (VFI)) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, while secondary outcomes include IOP changes. Results Participant recruitment and data collection are ongoing. Final outcomes will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals. Conclusions If shown to be effective, the combined RF and SP eye drops could enhance neuroprotection and further control IOP in POAG, thereby addressing a significant need in current glaucoma therapy. This trial may provide a foundation for larger-scale investigations into integrative treatments for glaucoma management. Trial Registration Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) no.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1528/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Rare Bilateral Double Profunda Femoris Artery Variation: Clinical Implications and Considerations [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The profunda femoris artery (PFA) is the largest branch of the femoral artery supplying the thigh. The study reports a rare occurrence of bilateral double profunda artery in a male cadaver, aiming to inform surgeons of such variations to avoid complications during surgical interventions. Methods This study was conducted during routine dissections using 5-10% formalin-fixed lower limbs of a male cadaver at the Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, UAE Results In the right lower limb, two profunda femoris artery (PFA) branches arise from the common femoral artery (CFA) 5 cm from the inguinal ligament, one laterally and one posteromedially. The medial (MCFA) and lateral circumflex (LCFA) arteries branch from these PFAs respectively. The femoral nerve is anterior to the lateral PFA and LCFA and lateral to the posteromedial PFA. The obturator nerve runs posterior to the posteromedial PFA. In the left lower limb, two PFAs originate from the CFA, 2.5 and 5 cm from the inguinal ligament, lateral and posterior to the CFA, respectively. The LCFA stems from the upper lateral PFA, while the medial MCFA arises from the CFA. The femoral nerve lies anterior to both the PFA and LCFA. The obturator nerve is posterior to the MCFA. The femoral vein crosses over the MCFA and the lower posterior PFA, distal to the MCFA origin. Conclusion This report enriches understanding of PFA anatomy and its variations, emphasizing the importance of tailored surgical approaches to minimize risks and ensure procedure success.

                Background Polygamy remains a significant marital institution in Uganda, where multilingualism intersects with family structure, gender roles, and social status. While legal and health implications of polygamous unions have been studied, little attention has been paid to the role of language in shaping intra-household dynamics. This study investigates how linguistic diversity within Ugandan polygamous marriages reflects and constructs social hierarchies, emotional relationships, and marital strategies. Methods This qualitative research analyzes 200 anonymized micro-narratives collected between 2023 and 2024 via the SIDINL Newsletters platform, spanning 20 Ugandan languages. Narrative analysis, sociolinguistic analysis, and discourse analysis were employed to examine language use in polygamous households. Stories were gathered from husbands, co-wives, children, and in-laws, transcribed, translated, and coded for themes such as hierarchy, emotional tone, and language switching. Results Linguistic choices, such as honorifics, metaphors, and strategic code-switching, consistently signaled status, emotional positioning, and power dynamics within polygamous families. Multilingualism was used not only to navigate household conflict and intimacy but also as a tool for forming polygamous unions, particularly in urban, border, or migratory contexts. Regional storytelling patterns revealed culturally specific framings of polygamy: moral and spiritual in the West, inheritance-based in the North, pragmatic in the East, and justice-oriented in the West Nile. Selective multilingualism emerged as a strategy where language fluency influenced marriage decisions and access to social capital. Conclusions Language functions as both a social instrument and a strategic resource in Ugandan polygamous marriages. It actively shapes family hierarchies, emotional dynamics, and mobility. Recognizing the role of language in household organization is essential for understanding marital structures in multilingual societies. These findings highlight the need for culturally grounded, linguistically sensitive approaches in both research and policy design.

                Background ELIXIR is a pan-European public-funded research infrastructure dedicated to life science data. As such, it must demonstrate public value to its funders and stakeholders. We present methods to inventory research publications linked to ELIXIR that have received funding and support, as well as related citation metrics, used as performance metrics for these audiences. Methods To overcome challenges inherent in ELIXIR’s distributed structure, and the fact that those publishing ELIXIR-supported work are typically working part-time on ELIXIR matters, a semi-automated approach, consisting of text-mining followed by manual curation, is presented. A country-level case study (ELIXIR Italy) refines and expands the methods, notably by introducing more granularity in the curation process (e.g. considering all national-level grants, examining affiliations to report publication per institute) and by additionally looking at the scientific impact of the resources developed and operated by the Italian Node of ELIXIR. Results Overall, the methods described in this article have shown to: (1) be repeatable with acceptable levels of accuracy and consistency (notably across curators); (2) require reasonable effort in terms of curation of monthly ‘harvests’ of publications (obtained by text-mining); and (3) to be well-adapted to ELIXIR’s distributed nature. Conclusions Concrete examples are provided of downstream uses of the inventoried publications and their citations, both for ELIXIR as a whole and for the Italian case study. Limitations of the methods are discussed, particularly the challenges associated with using an ‘Open literature’ database (Europe PMC) for the text-mining, and the constraints related to curation capacity. The methods, along with the valuable lessons learned during their development, are sufficiently generic and pragmatic enough to be readily adapted by other similar research infrastructures.

                Background Chronic non-specific neck pain is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders affecting work and lifestyle. Physiotherapy techniques, such as stretching and strength training, have beneficial effects on neck pain. Telerehabilitation exercise programmes could readily address the growing concern of patient adherence to home-based exercise programmes, while being time- and cost-effective. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of telerehabilitation exercise intervention in females with chronic non-specific neck pain by measuring the pain score, disability index, cervical range of motion (CROM), cervical muscle endurance, and patient adherence. Methods In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 31 females (mean age 22.7 ± 2.1 years) were given a 6-week home-based exercise programme based on their assigned group: telerehabilitation (TR) – online software or conventional (CG) – exercise manual. Baseline measurements were collected using the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain), Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire, CROM using the CROM instrument, and cervical muscle endurance through the Craniocervical Flexion Test (CCFT), and repeated after six weeks, in addition to adherence. SPSS version 26.0 was used for all statistical analyses. Results Based on mixed model ANOVA measures (0 week and 6 weeks), within-group comparisons for both groups showed statistical significance in favour of the exercise programme, for all variables (p<0.05). Telerehabilitation group showed significantly more increase in cervical rotation ROM R (0.006) and L (0.03) post-exercise programme, and longer duration of treatment session (0.02) as compared to conventional group. Between-group comparisons showed no significant differences for all other variables. Conclusions Based on our findings, both groups showed significant improvement in neck pain, disability, cervical ROM, and cervical muscle endurance; however, no group was found superior to the other in this regard. While both groups showed good adherence to the frequency of sessions, telerehabilitation exhibited better adherence to the duration of the exercise sessions.

                Background With advancements in new technologies, unstructured data can be extracted from the virtual world. Identifying the relationship between cyberspace and real space in order to evaluate urban spaces is valuable. Instagram social media, with its facilities, is in the category of the mentioned data sources. Users can impact a specific place in real space. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and measure the popularity of the urban space of Tehran Book Garden based on the #book garden and the location of active users on Instagram. The question is the impact of the #book garden on the popularity of this urban space. Methods First, the required data on Instagram were extracted through the application programming interface (API) and analyzed through networking on geographical maps. Next, by discovering that a certain part of the urban area has irregular networking based on the #book garden, the most active area was measured. Results and Conclusions Finally, with interpolation calculation, a zoning map of the #book garden effectiveness was produced. The location of the Book Garden is an effective area and cultural, scientific, and artistic area, which is introduced as a hidden layer. This study developed a new, innovative, and reliable method for measuring the attractiveness of urban spaces that can be used as a pattern in other studies.

                Abstract Background Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomas, are the most common benign tumors in reproductive-aged individuals. Although they may remain asymptomatic, they can occasionally lead to acute complications, including sudden hemorrhage. Spontaneous hemoperitoneum due to fibroids is extremely rare and can be life threatening. Case Presentation We report the case of a 48-year-old multiparous woman with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and hypovolemic shock. An emergency computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large hemoperitoneum and a uterine mass measuring 10 cm. Emergency laparotomy revealed a pedunculated fundal fibroid with an actively bleeding superficial vein. Myomectomy was performed, followed by hemostatic control and abdominal washout. The patient required blood transfusion and recovered well without further complications. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a benign leiomyoma. Conclusion Hemoperitoneum due to rupture of a superficial vein overlying a fibroid is an exceedingly uncommon but serious condition demanding prompt diagnosis and surgical management. Clinicians should consider this condition in patients with an acute abdomen and hypovolemic shock, especially in those with known fibroids. Early detection and timely surgical intervention are vital for achieving favorable outcomes.

                Background The challenge of understanding the factors that influence the acceptance of new technologies persists worldwide, impacting policymaking for technologies that could benefit society but still lack acceptance. Research has shown that perceived risk and familiarity affect the acceptance of technological risks and that these perceptions vary across cultural contexts. Anshin-kan (a sense of security), a concept linked to safety, fear, and anxiety, may also influence people’s perceptions of technology. However, the correlations among anshin-kan , familiarity, and technology acceptance remain unclear. Additionally, how these relationships vary according to cultural background and technology type remains undefined. This study examines the relationships among anshin-kan , familiarity, and acceptance of 50 scientific technologies across three countries known for their differing levels of technology acceptance and implementation: Brazil, China, and Japan. Methods We surveyed 120 participants (35 Brazilian, 43 Chinese, 28 Japanese, and 14 from other countries) to evaluate 50 scientific technology-related words. The variables evaluated were anshin-kan , familiarity, and acceptance. We investigated the nature of the relationship between variables using a bivariate Kendall’s tau correlation analysis. Differences in the evaluations regarding nationality, gender, age, and specialization field were analysed using a one-way analysis of variance. Results Although anshin-kan and familiarity were positively correlated with technology acceptance, the strength of these relationships differed by country and technology type. The average evaluations did not show significant differences for nationality, age, and specialization field; however, considering gender, men evaluated technologies with higher anshin-kan and familiarity than women. Conclusions This study contributes to the understanding of cross-cultural differences in technology adoption by highlighting the importance of considering anshin-kan in a cross-country analysis. However, the causes of variations in correlations across different technologies and countries remain unclear. In addition, anshin-kan involves multiple factors that should be considered in future studies.

                The co-infection of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) and hydatid disease is rare. Diagnosis and treatment of this co-infection may be challenging as both diseases present with overlapping clinical manifestations, especially in war zones where the health system is destroyed. We are reporting a 45-year-old female police officer transferred to Sinnar Sudan due to ongoing conflict. She was admitted with chronic cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. The preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary TB was made based on chest X-ray examination and sputum analysis. Further imaging showed cystic lesions in both the liver and the lungs, and thus a diagnosis of Echinococcosis was made. Surgical intervention was done successfully followed by the courses of Albendazole and anti-TB medication. The clinical condition of the patient improved, with the disappearance of all symptoms. This case represents the diagnostic dilemma of dual infections in the areas of their endemicity because of the symptomatology overlap that might occur and result in an erroneous diagnosis. It does demand an appropriate diagnostic approach, thus, with advanced imaging applications, and once more, emphasizes the interdisciplinary attitude in its treatment for the best possible result.

                A recent study by González et al. provides causal evidence that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is crucial for rats to maintain persistence in reward-seeking behaviors across both information- and effort-based choice tasks, highlighting a fundamental and unified role of the ACC in goal-directed decision-making.

                Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a critical role in endocytosis, trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. In 2010, BIN1 gene was reported as a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which shifted the focus on its physiological and pathophysiological roles in the brain (at a time when data available were scarce). In this review, we discuss the multiple cerebral roles of BIN1, especially in regulating synaptic function, and the strong link between BIN1 and tau pathology, supported by recent evidence ranging from genetic and clinical/postmortem observations to molecular interactions.

By combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses, they identified specific NOS2high neutrophils and MMP12+ MDMs in CGD pulmonary granulomas and proposed MIF and Morrbid as potential therapeutic targets for CGD treatment.

                Sanchez-Alvarez et al. report that ER anchoring to non-centrosomal microtubules is regulated by PERK translation suppression activity to both enable ER architecture remodeling during stress and modulate back microtubule dynamics by determining their stability. This mechanism thus couples cell polarization and protrusiveness with ER homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101967">In silico screening by AlphaFold2 program revealed the potential binding partners of nuage-localizing proteins and piRNA-related proteins</a></h4>

              
                Protein–protein interactions are fundamental to understanding the molecular functions and regulation of proteins. Despite the availability of extensive databases, many interactions remain uncharacterized due to the labor-intensive nature of experimental validation. In this study, we utilized the AlphaFold2 program to predict interactions among proteins localized in the nuage, a germline-specific non-membrane organelle essential for piRNA biogenesis in <i>Drosophila</i>. We screened 20 nuage proteins for 1:1 interactions and predicted dimer structures. Among these, five represented novel interaction candidates. Three pairs, including Spn-E_Squ, were verified by co-immunoprecipitation. Disruption of the salt bridges at the Spn-E_Squ interface confirmed their functional importance, underscoring the predictive model’s accuracy. We extended our analysis to include interactions between three representative nuage components—Vas, Squ, and Tej—and approximately 430 oogenesis-related proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation verified interactions for three pairs: Mei-W68_Squ, CSN3_Squ, and Pka-C1_Tej. Furthermore, we screened the majority of <i>Drosophila</i> proteins (~12,000) for potential interaction with the Piwi protein, a central player in the piRNA pathway, identifying 164 pairs as potential binding partners. This in silico approach not only efficiently identifies potential interaction partners but also significantly bridges the gap by facilitating the integration of bioinformatics and experimental biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94999">Modeling collective behavior in groups of mice housed under semi-naturalistic conditions</a></h4>

              
                In social behavior research, the focus often remains on animal dyads, limiting the understanding of complex interactions. Recent trends favor naturalistic setups, offering unique insights into intricate social behaviors. Social behavior stems from chance, individual preferences, and group dynamics, necessitating high-resolution quantitative measurements and statistical modeling. This study leverages the Eco-HAB system, an automated experimental setup that employs radiofrequency identification tracking to observe naturally formed mouse cohorts in a controlled yet naturalistic setting, and uses statistical inference models to decipher rules governing the collective dynamics of groups of 10–15 individuals. Applying maximum entropy models on the coarse-grained co-localization patterns of mice unveils social rules in mouse hordes, quantifying sociability through pairwise interactions within groups, the impact of individual versus social preferences, and the effects of considering interaction structures among three animals instead of two. Reproducing co-localization patterns of individual mice reveals stability over time, with the statistics of the inferred interaction strength capturing social structure. By separating interactions from individual preferences, the study demonstrates that altering neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex – the brain structure crucial for sociability – does not eliminate signatures of social interactions, but makes the transmission of social information between mice more challenging. The study demonstrates how the joint probability distribution of the mice positions can be used to quantify sociability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97165">MicroRNA-26b protects against MASH development in mice and can be efficiently targeted with lipid nanoparticles</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is increasing, urging more research into the underlying mechanisms. MicroRNA-26b (<i>Mir26b</i>) might play a role in several MASH-related pathways. Therefore, we aimed to determine the role of <i>Mir26b</i> in MASH and its therapeutic potential using <i>Mir26b</i> mimic-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). <i>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></i>, <i>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Lyz2<sup>cre</sup>Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice, and respective controls were fed a Western-type diet to induce MASH. Plasma and liver samples were characterized regarding lipid metabolism, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis. Additionally, <i>Mir26b</i> mimic-loaded LNPs were injected in <i>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice to rescue the phenotype and key results were validated in human precision-cut liver slices. Finally, kinase profiling was used to elucidate underlying mechanisms. <i>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice showed increased hepatic lipid levels, coinciding with increased expression of scavenger receptor a and platelet glycoprotein 4. Similar effects were found in mice lacking myeloid-specific <i>Mir26b</i>. Additionally, hepatic TNF and IL-6 levels and amount of infiltrated macrophages were increased in <i>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Moreover, <i>Tgfb</i> expression was increased by the <i>Mir26b</i> deficiency, leading to more hepatic fibrosis. A murine treatment model with <i>Mir26b</i> mimic-loaded LNPs reduced hepatic lipids, rescuing the observed phenotype. Kinase profiling identified increased inflammatory signaling upon <i>Mir26b</i> deficiency, which was rescued by LNP treatment. Finally, <i>Mir26b</i> mimic-loaded LNPs also reduced inflammation in human precision-cut liver slices. Overall, our study demonstrates that the detrimental effects of <i>Mir26b</i> deficiency in MASH can be rescued by LNP treatment. This novel discovery leads to more insight into MASH development, opening doors to potential new treatment options using LNP technology.

                Cichlid fishes inhabiting the East African Great Lakes, Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika, are textbook examples of parallel evolution, as they have acquired similar traits independently in each of the three lakes during the process of adaptive radiation. In particular, ‘hypertrophied lip’ has been highlighted as a prominent example of parallel evolution. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted an integrated comparative analysis between the hypertrophied and normal lips of cichlids across three lakes based on histology, proteomics, and transcriptomics. Histological and proteomic analyses revealed that the hypertrophied lips were characterized by enlargement of the proteoglycan-rich layer, in which versican and periostin proteins were abundant. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of extracellular matrix-related genes, including collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, was higher in hypertrophied lips, regardless of their phylogenetic relationships. In addition, the genes in Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in promoting proteoglycan expression, was highly expressed in both the juvenile and adult stages of hypertrophied lips. Our comprehensive analyses showed that hypertrophied lips of the three different phylogenetic origins can be explained by similar proteomic and transcriptomic profiles, which may provide important clues into the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic parallelisms in East African cichlids.

                Multisensory object discrimination is essential in everyday life, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we trained rats to perform a two-alternative forced-choice task using both auditory and visual cues. Our findings reveal that multisensory perceptual learning actively engages auditory cortex (AC) neurons in both visual and audiovisual processing. Importantly, many audiovisual neurons in the AC exhibited experience-dependent associations between their visual and auditory preferences, displaying a unique integration model. This model employed selective multisensory enhancement for the auditory-visual pairing guiding the contralateral choice, which correlated with improved multisensory discrimination. Furthermore, AC neurons effectively distinguished whether a preferred auditory stimulus was paired with its associated visual stimulus using this distinct integrative mechanism. Our results highlight the capability of sensory cortices to develop sophisticated integrative strategies, adapting to task demands to enhance multisensory discrimination abilities.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100532">Re-focusing visual working memory during expected and unexpected memory tests</a></h4>

              
                A classic distinction from the domain of external attention is that between anticipatory orienting and subsequent re-orienting of attention to unexpected events. Whether and how humans also re-orient attention ‘in mind’ following expected and unexpected working-memory tests remains elusive. We leveraged spatial modulations in neural activity and gaze to isolate re-orienting within the spatial layout of visual working memory following central memory tests of certain, expected, or unexpected mnemonic content. Besides internal orienting after predictive cues, we unveil a second stage of internal attentional deployment following both expected and unexpected memory tests. Following expected tests, internal attentional deployment was not contingent on prior orienting, suggesting an additional verification – ‘double checking’ – in memory. Following unexpected tests, re-focusing of alternative memory content was prolonged. This brings attentional re-orienting to the domain of working memory and underscores how memory tests can invoke either a verification or a revision of our internal focus.

">Wearable, High-Density, Time-Domain Diffuse Optical Tomography Array for Functional Neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                Noninvasive functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), are essential tools for understanding brain activity and cognition for various neurological and mental health conditions. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution, its limited temporal resolution and costly large-form-factor restricts its accessibility and practicality for many applications. In contrast, EEG is more affordable and portable but has limited spatial resolution. In the present study, we overcome the limitations of existing neuroimaging technologies with the development of Micro-DOT, a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system capable of high-density, time-domain diffuse optical tomography (HD-TD-DOT). Micro-DOT tackles the tradeoff between form factor and spatial resolution that has been a longstanding issue with existing fNIRS systems through the use of a unique hardware architecture that arrays HD-TD-DOT-capable electronics directly at the tissue surface. This is made possible with complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) source-detector chiplets that contain all the electronics and optics necessary for HD-TD-DOT operation, and can be mounted on flexible polyimide packaging with a very minimal footprint. Pairing these hardware innovations with an advanced volumetric reconstruction software, Micro-DOT achieves in-plane spatial resolution, depth resolution, and localization accuracy comparable to fMRI, while maintaining the wearable form factor and portability of EEG, making it a viable stand-alone system for measuring subject-specific brain activation.

                The YOTO (You Only Think Once) dataset presents a human electroencephalography (EEG) resource for exploring multisensory perception and mental imagery. The study enrolled 26 participants who performed tasks involving both unimodal and multimodal stimuli. Researchers collected high-resolution EEG signals at a 1000 Hz sampling rate to capture fine-grained neural activity related to internal mental representations. The dataset includes resting-state and task-based recordings, which permits direct comparisons between spontaneous brain activity and controlled mental imagery. The protocol incorporated visual, auditory, and combined cues to investigate the integration of multiple sensory channels, and participants provided self-reported vividness ratings that indicate subjective perceptual strength. The YOTO dataset addresses challenges in mental imagery research by offering a systematic and standardized platform with rigorous artifact rejection methods. Technical validation involved event-related potentials (ERPs) and power spectral density (PSD) analyses, which demonstrated the reliability of the data and confirmed distinct neural responses across stimuli. This dataset aims to foster studies on neural decoding, perception, and cognitive modeling, and it is publicly accessible for researchers who seek to advance multimodal mental imagery research and related applications.

">Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, and Retatrutide Attenuate the Interoceptive Effects of Alcohol in Male and Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a major public health challenge, yet effective pharmacotherapies are limited. As such, there is growing interest in repurposing medications with novel mechanisms of action. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, originally developed for type 2 diabetes, have emerged as promising candidates due to effects on intake regulation and reward processing. GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide, reduce alcohol intake and relapse-like behaviors in rodent and non-human primate models, and a recent clinical trial found that semaglutide decreased alcohol craving and drinking in adults with AUD. Modulation of the subjective/interoceptive effects of alcohol may contribute to the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Objectives: This study used operant drug discrimination in male and female rats to assess how acute and repeated semaglutide treatment affects the discriminative stimulus (interoceptive) effects of alcohol. We hypothesized that GLP-1 receptor activation would disrupt these interoceptive effects. We also evaluated acute treatment with tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1/gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) receptor agonist, and retatrutide, a triple GIP/GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist, to determine whether broader receptor activity would differentially influence the subjective effects of alcohol. Results: Acute administration of semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide each attenuated alcohol discrimination, suggesting modulation of subjective alcohol effects. Repeated semaglutide maintained efficacy across the 15-day treatment period; alcohol discrimination returned to control levels three days after treatment cessation. Conclusions: Building on prior work with GLP-1 receptor agonists, these results provide important context for interpreting clinical observations of reduced drinking behavior among individuals receiving this class of therapeutics.

">How Acting Jointly Differs from Acting Side-by-Side: A Dual EEG Study</a></h4>

              
                The distinction between acting jointly and acting side by side permeates our daily lives and is crucial for understanding the evolution and development of human sociality. While acting in parallel involves agents pursuing individual goals, acting jointly requires them to share a collective goal. Here, we used a dual electroencephalography (EEG) approach to explore the neural dynamics underlying joint and parallel action preparation. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from 20 dyads while they had to transport an object in a video game, either jointly or in parallel, or individually. Both conditions were carefully matched for coordination demands and performance complexity, as confirmed by equal success rates. Our results revealed a distinctive pattern swap in ERPs during action preparation. In the early preparation phase, ERPs showed significantly higher amplitude during joint action than parallel action. This pattern reversed in the late preparation phase, with significantly reduced ERP amplitude in the joint compared to parallel action. Notably, the decrease in late ERPs correlated with higher reaction time (RT) variability in partners but not with participants' own RT variability. The dynamic swap in neural activity suggests that different cognitive processes operate at distinct stages of action preparation. While initially sharing a collective goal may impose cognitive costs (reflected in higher early ERPs), this is offset by facilitated late action preparation, likely due to enhanced predictability of partners' actions

">On-Body Measure of Reaction Time Correlates With Intoxication Level</a></h4>

              
                Excessive alcohol use has profound effects on individual health and healthcare systems worldwide. Despite this, there is currently no system or device that can detect robustly the physiologic and functional effects of alcohol-based impairment in real-world conditions.  A practical, on-body, device capable of rapidly and accurately determining the functional capacity of an individual to drive, before they can start the ignition of the automobile, is required. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of acute alcohol intoxication on premotor time (PMT) and reaction time (RT), both highly sensitive of individual cognition, as evaluated by the Pison Technology wrist-worn wearable. Nineteen participants were included in the study, 14 subjects who consumed alcohol sufficient to raise blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.12% within a 30-minute period and 5 controls who did not consume alcohol. Changes in reaction time data were correlated with blood alcohol levels as measured by breathalyzer testing, identifying a statistically significant difference between those participants under the legal limit and those over the legal limit. Both group and individual analyses confirmed that as the BAC increased in subjects, the PMT also increased. The PMT also decreased as the BAC returned to levels under the legal intoxication threshold (0.08%). A significant effect of BAC levels on changes in PMT at the p < 0.05 level for two conditions. This study demonstrated the first use case of an on-body, neuro-physiological sensor capable of detecting sensitive changes of reaction time, in real time, that serves as an easy-to-measure proxy for blood alcohol content and impairment.

">Region-specific mechanosensation in Drosophila postural control behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The relation between regional morphological features derived from the bilaterian body plan and the fundamental behaviours necessary to extract utility from such structures is not well understood. Here we use the Drosophila larva to investigate this problem focusing on the mapping of the regional stimuli that trigger an adaptive and evolutionarily conserved behaviour termed self-righting: a postural control system that allows the animal to restore its natural position if turned upside-down. Through the development of new methodologies that allow regionally-restricted mechanical stimulation and region-specific neuronal optogenetics, we find that multidendritic sensory neuron inhibition in anterior areas (thoracic/anterior abdominal) has a profound effect on self-righting performance, whilst inhibition of posterior sensory elements (mid and posterior abdomen) produces no effects. Using a deep neural network automated tracking method to examine how neuronal inhibition impacted different subcomponents of the self-righting sequence we learned that inhibition of anterior sensory neurons increases head casting behaviour, and that this is strongly correlated with abnormally long self-righting times. To explore the mechanistic bases of our behavioural observations, we considered the hypothesis that the Hox genes, well known for their roles in axial developmental patterning, might play a role in the functional specification of multidendritic sensory neurons along the body axis. Molecular expression analysis of FACS-sorted neural populations, fluorescent immunolabelling and neuron-specific knock-down experiments demonstrated that normal sensory neuron expression of the Hox genes Antennapedia and abdominal-b is necessary for self-righting in the Drosophila larva. Altogether, our work shows that region-specific mechanosensory processes mediated by multidendritic sensory neurons and instructed via Hox gene inputs are essential for self-righting, providing a link between regional structural features and an adaptive and widely evolutionarily conserved postural control behaviour.

">Charting the transition from in vitro gliogenesis to the in vivo maturation of transplanted human glial progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Neither rodent models nor in vitro studies of human cells adequately describe the molecular ontogeny of human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs). Here, we used scRNA-seq together with scATAC-Seq and CUT&TAG assessment of chromatin availability to track the in vitro genesis and in vivo differentiation of hGPCs from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). In vitro, the hGPC pool comprised 4 transcriptionally-distinct subpopulations, each associated with a distinct pattern of chromatin accessibility and histone modification of stage-dependent genes. After the neonatal transplant of these cells into myelin-deficient shiverer mice, they differentiated further as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. A combination of gene co-expression, motif enrichment, cell-trajectory, and cell-cell interaction analyses revealed that the host environment potentiated the context-dependent differentiation of the hGPCs, via their activation of distinct gene regulatory networks. Together, these data chart the process by which human PSC-derived GPCs are generated in vitro and diversify in vivo to mature as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.

">Connectome-based brain fingerprints predict early cognitive decline in Parkinson's patients with minor hallucinations</a></h4>

              
                Individual variability in connectome organization offers a unique framework for capturing patient-specific alterations and advancing personalized models in medicine. Minor hallucinations (MH) affect up to 40% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and are early indicators of cognitive decline and dementia, hence crucial for early intervention. While previous studies focused on group-level differences, connectome-based brain fingerprinting enables deeper, individualized analysis of neural change. Applying this approach to PD patients with and without MH using resting-state fMRI, we show that each patient exhibited unique brain fingerprint, revealing rich quantifiable personalized features with medical relevance. MH-patients showed a loss of subject-specific features in brain networks linked to cognitive health, while somatosensory regions - typically less distinctive - became more prominent, emphasizing their role in MH pathogenesis. These differences enabled to identify - in an entirely data driven manner - patient-specific networks linked to early subclinical cognitive alterations, as well differential spatial fingerprinting organization linked to cortical densities of neurotransmitters. These findings reveal a distinct, patient-specific connectomic signature that differentiates PD patients with MH, uncovering early neural markers for precision medicine in PD.

">Access to emotional memories: Evidence for a vagal route to boost memory retrieval using non-invasive taVNS</a></h4>

              
                Remembering emotionally significant events is critical for the organisms' behavior and survival. While the mechanisms underlying formation of such memories are well understood and closely linked to the vagus nerve and the brain's arousal system, less is known about its contribution to memory retrieval. The current study tested whether non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) applied during a long-term recognition memory task influenced retrieval of unpleasant and neutral scenes that have been incidentally encoded one week earlier. Results showed that taVNS, compared to a sham condition, selectively enhanced the recollection of unpleasant images. Despite a modest effect size (d = 0.33), these findings provide first human evidence for a direct link of the vagus nerve in emotional memory retrieval, thus extending current theoretical models of emotional memory retrieval and opening a new pathway for memory modulation and non-invasive therapeutic interventions.

">Neuropathological hallmarks during the chronic phase of ischemic stroke in mice and humans</a></h4>

              
                Background: Improvements in acute stroke treatment, including endovascular thrombectomy and critical care management, have increased survival rates post-stroke. However, stroke remains a leading cause of long-term disability and many survivors have significant neurological and cognitive deficits. Despite this, the chronic neurological sequelae and underlying secondary injury mechanisms induced by ischemic stroke remain understudied. Methods: This study examined long-term neurobehavioral recovery and neuropathology at 2- and 6- months post-stroke in young (12-week-old) male C57Bl/6 mice after a 60-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery. Behavioral testing included the open field test (OFT), novel object recognition test (NORT), fear conditioning (FC), nesting activity, and tail suspension. Post-mortem brain samples from patients with chronic ischemic stroke were also assessed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess demyelination (MBP), neuronal apoptosis (TUNEL), and A{beta}42 in human brains. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to assess microglial phenotypes, the chronic neuroimmune landscape, and to evaluate senescent-like phenotypes (SA-{beta}Gal and lipofuscin). Transcriptomic profiling was performed using RNA isolated from the ipsilateral hemisphere in stroke mice. Results: Experimental stroke caused progressive cognitive and motor decline up to 6 months post-MCAO. IHC and flow cytometric analyses revealed a significant increase in TUNEL-positive neurons, cortical and hippocampal gliosis, white matter degradation, senescent cell accumulation, and altered microglial function. IHC analysis of postmortem human brains shows significantly increased levels of microgliosis, senescent cells and amyloid burden. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that pathways involving apoptosis, microglial activation and the complement pathway were chronically upregulated after stroke. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that ischemic stroke induces a non-resolving microglial response and accelerated inflamm-aging in the brain, evidenced by premature senescence and elevated production of cytokines within the chronic infarct microenvironment. Senescent-like phenotypes and chronic neurodegenerative disease signatures may contribute to the progressive worsening of cognitive function post-stroke. These results suggest that chronic, ongoing neurodegeneration occurs late after stroke, even in younger mice. Mitigating these detrimental changes may offer viable targets for delayed treatment strategies for stroke.

">Feedforward Extraction of Behaviorally Significant Information by Neocortical Columns</a></h4>

              
                Neurons throughout the neocortex exhibit selective sensitivity to particular features of sensory input patterns. According to the prevailing views, cortical strategy is to choose features that exhibit predictable relationship to their spatial and/or temporal context. Such contextually predictable features likely make explicit the causal factors operating in the environment and thus they are likely to have perceptual/behavioral utility. The known details of functional architecture of cortical columns suggest that cortical extraction of such features is a modular nonlinear operation, in which the input layer, layer 4, performs initial nonlinear input transform generating proto-features, followed by their linear integration into output features by the basal dendrites of pyramidal cells in the upper layers. Tuning of pyramidal cells to contextually predictable features is guided by the contextual inputs their apical dendrites receive from other cortical columns via long-range horizontal or feedback connections. Our implementation of this strategy in a model of prototypical V1 cortical column, trained on natural images, reveals the presence of a limited number of contextually predictable orthogonal basis features in the image patterns appearing in the column's receptive field. Upper-layer cells generate an overcomplete Hadamard-like representation of these basis features: i.e., each cell carries information about all basis features, but with each basis feature contributing either positively or negatively in the pattern unique to that cell. In tuning selectively to contextually predictable features, upper layers perform selective filtering of the information they receive from layer 4, emphasizing information about orderly aspects of the sensed environment and downplaying local, likely to be insignificant or distracting, information. Altogether, the upper-layer output preserves fine discrimination capabilities while acquiring novel higher-order categorization abilities to cluster together input patterns that are different but, in some way, environmentally related. We find that to be fully effective, our feature tuning operation requires collective participation of cells across 7 minicolumns, together making up a functionally defined 150um diameter "mesocolumn." Similarly to real V1 cortex, 80% of model upper-layer cells acquire complex-cell receptive field properties while 20% acquire simple-cell properties. Overall, the design of the model and its emergent properties are fully consistent with the known properties of cortical organization. Thus, in conclusion, our feature-extracting circuit might capture the core operation performed by cortical columns in their feedforward extraction of perceptually and behaviorally significant information.

">Postnatal development of the dentate gyrus vascular niche</a></h4>

              
                Lifelong neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus supports cognitive and emotional functions in most adult mammals. The subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG contains dense vasculature where neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) reside in close proximity to local capillaries. This arrangement likely supports NSPCs by providing access to oxygen, circulating molecules, and endothelial-derived factors. While SGZ vessel density and NSPC association with vessels are well established in adulthood, when these niche attributes emerge in development remains unclear. Here, we show that while blood vessel density in the SGZ remained stable from initial layer formation (2 weeks of age) into young adulthood (9 weeks of age) in male and female mice, the average distance from NSPC somas to the nearest blood vessel decreased progressively over postnatal development. This finding was accompanied by a symmetrical compression of proliferating cells within the SGZ, and a gradual shift of quiescent neural stem cell somas towards the granule cell layer of the DG. Our findings imply that the DG neurogenic vascular niche continues to refine postnatally, suggesting that the NSPC vascular niche has a unique functional role in supporting mature adult neurogenesis.

">Enhanced reward coding and condition-independent dynamics in optogenetically identified corticostriatal neurons in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia are considered to be the site where cortical sensorimotor and dopaminergic reward information interact to potentiate and select actions. This had led to the assumption that cortical inputs to the basal ganglia encode sensorimotor states rather than reward or choice signals. We tested this hypothesis by studying the coding properties of neurons in the frontal eye field of monkeys that were optogenetically identified as being connected to the basal ganglia. We found that neurons already contained information about expected rewards and selected actions. Further, the reward and condition-independent modulations were stronger in connected neurons than in other neurons in the same area. These findings indicate that reward, choice, and sensorimotor information are integrated already in the inputs to the basal ganglia, implying that the basal ganglia play a role in manipulating rather than generating reward and choice signals.

">Task dependent cortico-cerebellar responses to delayed visual movement feedback</a></h4>

              
                Forward models in the brain issue predictions of sensory movement consequences that can establish self-other distinction through comparison with actual feedback. But forward models can also be updated by sensory prediction errors, as in sensorimotor adaptation. Disentangling the neuronal correlates of processes related to sensorimotor incongruence detection from those related to adaptation can be challenging. Here, we approached this challenge with a novel, virtual reality based hand-target tracking task that allowed us to manipulate the behavioral relevance of delayed visual movement feedback, while recording hemodynamic brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed continuous right hand grasping movements to track a target oscillation with either their real, unseen hand or with a glove-controlled virtual hand. The movements of the virtual hand were delayed in a roving oddball fashion. Therefore, tracking with the virtual hand (VH task) required visuomotor adaptation, whereas tracking with the real hand (RH task) required ignoring visuomotor delays. VH > RH task execution produced stronger activity in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the bilateral extrastriate visual cortex. Delays correlated with activity in several regions, prominently including right temporoparietal regions, in both tasks. Crucially, the cerebellum showed a stronger delay dependent activation, and increased functional connectivity with the PPC, in the VH > RH task. Delay changes and errors correlated with activity in the anterior insulae (AI), and more strongly so in the VH>RH task. Thus, the instructed behavioral relevance of delayed visual movement feedback enhanced responses of the cerebellum and PPC, and their communication, likely for visuomotor adaptation. In contrast, temporoparietal regions compared predicted and actual visual movement feedback irrespective of its behavioral relevance, while the AI signaled visual mismatches particularly when these were behaviorally relevant.

">Combinative protein expression of immediate early genesc-Fos, Arc, and Npas4 along aversive- and reward-related neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) is critical for memory formation and has been widely used to identify the neural substrate of memory traces, termed memory engram cells. However, the types of IEG have been relatively not distinguished in identifying engram cells, as there is limited knowledge about the extent to which different types of IEGs are selectively or concurrently involved in the formation of memory engram. To address this question, we investigated the combinative expression of c-Fos, Arc, and Npas4 proteins using immunohistochemistry following aversive and rewarding experiences across subregions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Using an automated cell detection algorithm, we found that expression patterns of c-Fos, Npas4, and Arc varied across different brain areas, with a higher increase of IEG expressing cells in the PFC and posterior BLA than in the DG. The combinative expression patterns, along with their learning-induced changes, also differed across brain areas; the co-expression of IEGs increased in the PFC and BLA following learning whereas the increase was less pronounced in the DG and RSC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different area-to-area functional connectivity networks were extracted by different IEGs. These findings provide insights into how different IEGs and their combinations identify engram cells, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional significance of IEG-tagged memory engram cells.

">Interactions between the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial striatum, and dorsal hippocampus that support rat category learning</a></h4>

              
                Categorization creates memory representations that are efficient, generalizable, and robust to noise. Multiple brain regions have been implicated in categorization, including the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus; however, few studies have examined how these regions interact during category learning. We recorded neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and dorsal hippocampus (HPC) while rats learned to categorize distributions of visual stimuli. We found a learning-related shift in contributions from the PFC (with DMS to PFC theta (4-10Hz) interactions) to the HPC (with HPC to DMS and bidirectional PFC-HPC theta interactions). Decision-making depended on DMS and HPC spiking, as well as the PFC to HPC to DMS pathway. Our results provide a framework that characterizes how the PFC-DMS-HPC network interacts during category learning. This is informative for multiple neurological disorders that affect category learning, including Parkinson's Disease, autism, and dementia.

">Cognitive Mode Detectable with Task-Based fMRI: Default Mode B (DMB)</a></h4>

              
                In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI, and here we focus on Default Mode B (DMB), a task-negative and late-trial peaking cognitive mode. The BOLD signal configurations associated with DMB are modulated by a range of tasks, and here we present eight. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing DMB from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with DMB over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to DMB as follows: (1) In Flight, (2) Medial Temporal Dots, (3) Snowman Nose, (4) Angel Wings, and (5) Tripod. Evidence for DMB was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes induced by the following tasks: working memory, spatial capacity, semantic association, evidence integration, Raven's matrices, autobiographical event simulation, meditation and social perception. It was observed that deactivations in DMB were sensitive to cognitive load during attention to specific features of the external environment, based on evidence from working memory, spatial capacity, semantic association, evidence integration, and Raven's matrices. It was also observed that activations in DMB involved a cognitive process for engaging in mental projection into self-relevant social narratives, based on evidence from autobiographical event simulation, meditation, and social perception. Future research may explore DMB activation over a wider range of tasks in larger samples.

">Single Cell Landscape of Sex-specific Drivers of Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background Sex differences in Alzheimers disease (AD) have been documented for decades, and many sex-specific molecular contributors to AD have been discovered through bulk omics analysis of brain tissues. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) at single cell resolution provides an opportunity to characterize transcript associations with AD in a cell type-specific matter. Here, we investigated sex-specific gene expression associations with neuropathology and cognitive manifestation of AD (endophenotypes) leveraging a large single-nucleus transcriptomic dataset consisting of 1.64 million nuclei from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue of 424 unique donors from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP; AD Knowledge Portal syn2580853). Methods ROS/MAP single-nucleus RNAseq data (snRNA-seq) were processed through a rigorous pipeline. In total, eight major cell types from DLPFC were identified from this dataset. We first performed sex-stratified and sex-interaction association analyses by fitting negative binomial mixed models in relation to {beta}-amyloid load (A{beta}), paired helical filament (PHF) tau tangle density (tau), global cognitive performance at last visit, and longitudinal cognitive trajectory. We then conducted gene set enrichment analysis to identify functional signaling pathways enriched for sex-specific associations. Lastly, we compared differential gene expression patterns and intercellular communication profiles between sexes and diagnostic groups among major cell types. For replication, sex-specific associations were examined using snRNA-seq derived from DLPFC tissue-derived of an independent set of 84 donors from The Seattle Alzheimers Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD) study. Results 68% of the ROS/MAP participants were females, and 52% were diagnosed with AD dementia. We first two new disease vulnerable cell subpopulations including arterial smooth muscle cells (aSMC) within vascular niche and excitatory neuron subtype 3 (Exc.3). Then we identified 2,660 sex-specific associations involving 2,110 genes for A{beta} (51%), tau (21%), and cognitive performance (29%). Most (60%) female-specific associations were for A{beta}, and most (49%) male-specific associations were for tau. The vast majority (93%) of female protective associations were from neurons, and most (76%) of female risk associations were from glial cells. Nine of the female-specific associations involving eight unique genes were replicated from SEA-AD cohort, including ADGRV1 and OR3A3 with A{beta}, IFI27L1, LYRM1, STAP2, and TSTD2 with tau, PDYN with global cognition, and TMEM50B with longitudinal cognitive decline. All replicated associations except TMEM50B were observed in neurons. Furthermore, the preponderance of protective female-specific associations in neurons was also recapitulated in the SEA-AD cohort. Sex-specific gene associations were enriched for genes in the immune, inflammation, and damage-related stress response pathways, and microglia presented the most sex-specific enriched pathways. Finally, we identified six ITGB1-mediated microglia-specific incoming signals that may play a role in female-specific risk for {beta}-amyloid accumulation. Conclusion Our study highlights the transcriptome-wide single cell landscape of sex-specific molecular associations with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline. We provide a comprehensive atlas of sex-specific transcript associations, differential expression, signaling pathway, and cell-cell communication network changes in each major DLPFC cell type, while identifying and replicating several female-specific gene associations in neurons to help direct future mechanistic studies.

">Machine Learning-Driven fMRI Analysis for Objective Craving Prediction</a></h4>

              
                Background Craving is a fundamental aspect of substance use disorder (SUD), traditionally assessed through subjective self-report measures. To develop more objective assessments, we created a brain-based marker to predict craving based on machine learning approaches using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) drug cue reactivity data from 69 participants with methamphetamine use disorders. Methods To predict craving intensity, our analysis demonstrated that utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression outperformed other models in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Employing a 5-fold cross-validation strategy with a 20% holdout set, we established the reliability of the model. Additionally, the model successfully classified high and low craving levels and distinguished cue types (neutral vs. drug) based on fMRI data. Results The model achieved an RMSE of 0.983+/- 0.026 (standard deviation), with strong generalization evidenced by an out-of-sample RMSE of 0.985 and statistical significance (p < 0.026; effect size = 0.715; statistical power = 0.639). Key neurobiological signatures included the Parahippocampal Gyrus, Superior Temporal Gyrus, Medioventral Occipital Cortex, and Amygdala (positively associated with craving), as well as the Inferior Temporal Gyrus (negatively associated). Classification of high vs. low craving levels yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.684 +/- 0.084 (out-of-sample AUC-ROC = 0.714), with significant separation (p < 0.04; effect size = 0.831). Additionally, classification of cue types (neutral vs. drug) achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.692 +/- 0.090 (out-of-sample AUC-ROC = 0.693), with p < 0.002, effect size= 0.896, and statistical power = 0.800, highlighting the robustness of the model. Conclusion These findings underscore the potential of neuroimaging and machine learning to provide objective, data-driven insights into the neural mechanisms underlying subjective experience of craving and to inform future clinical applications in SUD.

                <p>by Romain Brette</p>

The axon initial segment of principal cells of the cortex and hippocampus is contacted by GABAergic interneurons called chandelier cells. The anatomy, as well as alterations in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, suggest that chandelier cells exert an important inhibitory control on action potential initiation. However, their functional role remains unclear, including whether their effect is indeed inhibitory or excitatory. One reason is that there is a relative gap in electrophysiological theory about the electrical effect of axo-axonic synapses. This contribution uses resistive coupling theory, a simplification of cable theory based on the observation that the small initial segment is resistively coupled to the large cell body acting as a current sink, to fill this gap. The main theoretical finding is that a synaptic input at the proximal axon shifts the action potential threshold by an amount equal to the product of synaptic conductance, driving force at threshold, and axial axonal resistance between the soma and either the synapse or of the middle of the initial segment, whichever is closer. The theory produces quantitative estimates useful to interpret experimental observations, and supports the idea that axo-axonic cells can potentially exert powerful inhibitory control on action potential initiation.

                <p>by Claire Lugrin, Jie Hu, Christian C. Ruff</p>

Prosocial behaviors play a pivotal role for human societies, shaping critical domains such as healthcare, education, taxation, and welfare. Despite the ubiquity of norms that prescribe prosocial actions, individuals do not adhere to them consistently but often behave selfishly, thereby harming the collective good. Interventions to promote prosociality would therefore be beneficial but are often ineffective because we lack a thorough understanding of the various motives that govern prosocial behavior across different contexts. Here we present a computational and experimental framework to identify motives behind individual prosocial choices and to characterize how these vary across contexts with changing social norms. Using a series of experiments in which 575 participants either judge the normative appropriateness of different prosocial actions or choose between prosocial and selfish actions themselves, we first show that while most individuals are consistent in their judgements about behavior appropriateness, the actual prosocial behavior varies strongly across people. We used computational decision models to quantify the conflicting motives underlying the prosocial judgements and decisions, combined with a clustering approach to characterize different types of individuals whose judgements and choices reflect different motivational profiles. We identified four such types: Unconditionally selfish participants never behave prosocially, Cost-sensitive participants behave selfishly when prosocial actions are costly, Efficiency-sensitive participants choose actions that maximize total wealth, and Harm-sensitive participants prioritize avoiding harming others. When these four types of participants were exposed to different social environments where norms were judged or followed more or less by the group, they responded in fundamentally different ways to this change in others’ behavior. Our approach helps us better understand the origins of heterogeneity in prosocial judgments and behaviors and may have implications for policy making and the design of behavioral interventions.

                <p>by Jacob N. Stapley, Jonathan I.D. Hamley, Maria-Gloria Basáñez, Martin Walker</p>

The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed elimination of onchocerciasis transmission (EOT) in a third of endemic countries by 2030. This requires country-wide verification of EOT. Prior to the shift from morbidity control to EOT, interventions in Africa were mostly targeted at moderate- to high-transmission settings, where morbidity was most severe. Consequently, there remain numerous low transmission (hypoendemic) settings which have hitherto not received mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. The WHO has prioritised the delineation of hypoendemic settings to ascertain treatment needs. However, the stability of transmission at such low levels remains poorly understood. We use the stochastic EPIONCHO-IBM transmission model to characterise the stability of transmission dynamics in hypoendemic settings and identify a range of threshold biting rates (TBRs, the annual vector biting rates below which transmission cannot be sustained). We show how TBRs are dependent on population size, inter-individual exposure heterogeneity and simulation time. In contrast with deterministic expectations, there is no fixed TBR; instead, transmission can persist between 70 and 300 bites/person/year. Using survivorship models on data generated from model simulations, we find that multiple vector biting rates can sustain hypoendemic prevalence for several decades. These findings challenge the assumption that hypoendemic foci would naturally fade out following treatment in nearby higher-endemicity regions. Our modelling suggests that, to achieve EOT, treatment should be extended to all areas where endogenous infection is identified, emphasising the need for improved diagnostic tools suitable for detecting low-prevalence infection and for strategies that allow safe treatment of communities where MDA would not be suitable.

                <p>by Mona Nourbakhsh, Yuanning Zheng, Humaira Noor, Hongjin Chen, Subhayan Akhuli, Matteo Tiberti, Olivier Gevaert, Elena Papaleo</p>

Cancer involves dynamic changes caused by (epi)genetic alterations such as mutations or abnormal DNA methylation patterns which occur in cancer driver genes. These driver genes are divided into oncogenes and tumor suppressors depending on their function and mechanism of action. Discovering driver genes in different cancer (sub)types is important not only for increasing current understanding of carcinogenesis but also from prognostic and therapeutic perspectives. We have previously developed a framework called Moonlight which uses a systems biology multi-omics approach for prediction of driver genes. Here, we present an important development in Moonlight2 by incorporating a DNA methylation layer which provides epigenetic evidence for deregulated expression profiles of driver genes. To this end, we present a novel functionality called Gene Methylation Analysis (GMA) which investigates abnormal DNA methylation patterns to predict driver genes. This is achieved by integrating the tool EpiMix which is designed to detect such aberrant DNA methylation patterns in a cohort of patients and further couples these patterns with gene expression changes. To showcase GMA, we applied it to three cancer (sub)types (basal-like breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma) where we discovered 33, 190, and 263 epigenetically driven genes, respectively. A subset of these driver genes had prognostic effects with expression levels significantly affecting survival of the patients. Moreover, a subset of the driver genes demonstrated therapeutic potential as drug targets. This study provides a framework for exploring the driving forces behind cancer and provides novel insights into the landscape of three cancer sub(types) by integrating gene expression and methylation data.

Over the past decade, pathogen genome sequencing has become well established as a powerful approach to study infectious disease epidemiology. In particular, when multiple genomes are available from several geographical locations, comparing them is informative about the relative size of the local pathogen populations as well as past migration rates and events between locations. The structured coalescent model has a long history of being used as the underlying process for such phylogeographic analysis. However, the computational cost of using this model does not scale well to the large number of genomes frequently analysed in pathogen genomic epidemiology studies. Several approximations of the structured coalescent model have been proposed, but their effects are difficult to predict. Here we show how the exact structured coalescent model can be used to analyse a precomputed dated phylogeny, in order to perform Bayesian inference on the past migration history, the effective population sizes in each location, and the directed migration rates from any location to another. We describe an efficient reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme which is implemented in a new R package StructCoalescent. We use simulations to demonstrate the scalability and correctness of our method and to compare it with existing software. We also applied our new method to several state-of-the-art datasets on the population structure of real pathogens to showcase the relevance of our method to current data scales and research questions.

Biological tissues exhibit complex gene expression and multicellular patterns that are valuable to dissect. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides full coverages of genes, but lacks spatial information, whereas spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures spatial locations of individual or group of cells, with more restrictions on gene information. Here we show a transfer learning method named iSORT to decipher spatial organization of cells by integrating scRNA-seq and ST data. iSORT trains a neural network that maps gene expressions to spatial locations. iSORT can find spatial patterns at single-cell scale, identify spatial-organizing genes (SOGs) that drive the patterning, and infer pseudo-growth trajectories using a concept of SpaRNA velocity. Benchmarking on a range of biological systems, such as human cortex, mouse embryo, mouse brain, <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, and human developmental heart, demonstrates iSORT’s accuracy and practicality in reconstructing multicellular organization. We further conducted scRNA-seq and ST sequencing from normal and atherosclerotic arteries, and the functional enrichment analysis shows that SOGs found by iSORT are strongly associated with vascular structural anomalies.

The central nervous system can generate various behaviors, including motor responses, which we can observe through video recordings. Recent advances in gene manipulation, automated behavioral acquisition at scale, and machine learning enable us to causally link behaviors to their underlying neural mechanisms. Moreover, in some animals, such as the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larva, this mapping is possible at the unprecedented scale of single neurons, allowing us to identify the neural microcircuits generating particular behaviors. These high-throughput screening efforts, linking the activation or suppression of specific neurons to behavioral patterns in millions of animals, provide a rich dataset to explore the diversity of nervous system responses to the same stimuli. However, important challenges remain in identifying subtle behaviors, including immediate and delayed responses to neural activation or suppression, and understanding these behaviors on a large scale. We here introduce several statistically robust methods for analyzing behavioral data in response to these challenges: 1) A generative physical model that regularizes the inference of larval shapes across the entire dataset. 2) An unsupervised kernel-based method for statistical testing in learned behavioral spaces aimed at detecting subtle deviations in behavior. 3) A generative model for larval behavioral sequences, providing a benchmark for identifying higher-order behavioral changes. 4) A comprehensive analysis technique using suffix trees to categorize genetic lines into clusters based on common action sequences. We showcase these methodologies through a behavioral screen focused on responses to an air puff, analyzing data from 280 716 larvae across 569 genetic lines.

                <p>by Ihab Hashem, Jian Wang, Jan F.M. Van Impe</p>

Individual-based modeling (IbM) is an instrumental tool for simulating spatial microbial growth, with applications in both microbial ecology and biochemical engineering. Unlike Cellular Automata (CA), which use a fixed grid of cells with predefined rules for interactions, IbMs model the individual behaviors of cells, allowing complex population dynamics to emerge. IbMs require more detailed modeling of individual interactions, which introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in resolving spatial overlaps between cells. Traditionally, this is managed using arrays or kd-trees, which require numerous pairwise comparisons and become inefficient as population size increases. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Discretized Overlap Resolution Algorithm (DORA), which employs a grid-based framework to efficiently manage overlaps. By discretizing the simulation space further and assigning circular cells to specific grid units, DORA transforms the computationally intensive pairwise comparison process into a more efficient grid-based operation. This approach significantly reduces the computational load, particularly in simulations with large cell populations. Our evaluation of DORA, through simulations of microbial colonies and biofilms under varied nutrient conditions, demonstrates its superior computational efficiency and ability to accurately capture microbial growth dynamics compared to conventional methods. DORA’s grid-based strategy enables the modeling of densely populated microbial communities within practical computational timeframes, thereby expanding the scope and applicability of individual-based modeling.

                <p>by Zach Mobille, Usama Bin Sikandar, Simon Sponberg, Hannah Choi</p>

Convergent and divergent structures in the networks that make up biological brains are found across many species and brain regions at various spatial scales. Neurons in these networks fire action potentials, or “spikes,” whose precise timing is becoming increasingly appreciated as large sources of information about both sensory input and motor output. In this work, we investigate the extent to which feedforward convergent/divergent network structure is related to the gain in information of spike timing representations over spike count representations. While previous theories on coding in convergent and divergent networks have largely neglected the role of precise spike timing, our model and analyses place this aspect at the forefront. For a suite of stimuli with different timescales, we demonstrate that structural bottlenecks–small groups of neurons post-synaptic to network convergence–have a stronger preference for spike timing codes than expansion layers created by structural divergence. We further show that this relationship can be generalized across different spike-generating models and measures of coding capacity, implying a potentially fundamental link between network structure and coding strategy using spikes. Additionally, we found that a simple network model based on convergence and divergence ratios of a hawkmoth (<i>Manduca sexta</i>) nervous system can reproduce the relative contribution of spike timing information in its motor output, providing testable predictions on optimal temporal resolutions of spike coding across the moth sensory-motor pathway at both the single-neuron and population levels.

                <p>by Alexander Morin, Ching Pan Chu, Paul Pavlidis</p>

The proliferation of single cell transcriptomics has potentiated our ability to unveil patterns that reflect dynamic cellular processes such as the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, we leverage a broad collection of single cell RNA-seq data to identify the gene partners whose expression is most coordinated with each human and mouse transcription regulator (TR). We assembled 120 human and 103 mouse scRNA-seq datasets from the literature (>28 million cells), constructing a single cell coexpression network for each. We aimed to understand the consistency of TR coexpression profiles across a broad sampling of biological contexts, rather than examine the preservation of context-specific signals. Our workflow therefore explicitly prioritizes the patterns that are most reproducible across cell types. Towards this goal, we characterize the similarity of each TR’s coexpression within and across species. We create single cell coexpression rankings for each TR, demonstrating that this aggregated information recovers literature curated targets on par with ChIP-seq data. We then combine the coexpression and ChIP-seq information to identify candidate regulatory interactions supported across methods and species. Finally, we highlight interactions for the important neural TR ASCL1 to demonstrate how our compiled information can be adopted for community use.

                <p>by David J. Pascall, Christopher Jackson, Stephanie Evans, Theodore Gouliouris, Christopher J.R. Illingworth, Stefan G. Piatek, Julie V. Robotham, Oliver Stirrup, Ben Warne, Judith Breuer, Daniela De Angelis</p>

Nosocomial, or hospital-acquired, infections are a key determinant of patient health in healthcare facilities, leading to longer stays and increased mortality. In addition to the direct effects on infected patients, the burden imposed by nosocomial infections impacts both staff and other patients by increasing the load on the healthcare system. The appropriate infection control response may differ depending on whether the infection was acquired in the hospital or the community. For example, nosocomial outbreaks may require ward closures to reduce the risk of onward transmission, whilst this may not be an appropriate response to repeated importations of infections from outside the facility. Unfortunately, it is often unclear whether an infection detected in a healthcare facility is nosocomial, as the time of infection is unobserved. Given this, there is a strong case for the development of models that can integrate multiple datasets available in hospitals to assess whether an infection detected in a hospital is nosocomial. When assessing nosocomiality, it is beneficial to take into account both whether the timing of infection is consistent with hospital acquisition and whether there are any likely candidates within the hospital who could have been the source of the infection. In this work, we developed a Bayesian model which jointly estimates whether a given infection detected in hospital is nosocomial and whether it came from a set of individuals identified as candidates by hospital staff. The model coherently integrates pathogen genetic information, the timings of epidemiological events, such as symptom onset, and location data on the infected patient and candidate infectors. We illustrated this model on a real hospital dataset showing both its output and how the impact of the different data sources on the assessed probabilities are contingent on what other data has been included in the model, and validated the calibration of the predictions against simulated data.

                <p>by Yufei Wu, Morgan A. Benson, Sean X. Sun</p>

Active fluid circulation and solute transport are essential functions of living organisms, enabling the efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients to various physiological compartments. Since fluid circulation occurs in a network, the systemic flux and pressure are not simple outcomes of individual components. Rather, they are emergent properties of network elements and network topology. Moreover, consistent pressure and osmolarity gradients are maintained across compartments such as the kidney, interstitium, and blood vessels. The mechanisms by which these gradients and network properties are established and maintained are unanswered questions in systems physiology. Previous studies have shown that epithelial cells are fluid pumps and can actively generate pressure and osmolarity gradients. The polarization and activity of solute transporters in epithelial cells, which drive fluid flux, are influenced by pressure and osmolarity gradients. Therefore, there is an unexplored coupling between pressure and osmolarity in the circulatory network. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework that integrates the influence of pressure and osmolarity on solute transport. We use this model to explore both cellular fluid transport and systemic circulation. Using a simple network featuring the kidney-vascular interface, we show that our model naturally generates pressure and osmolarity gradients across the kidney, vessels and renal interstitium. While the current model uses this interface as an example, the findings can be generalized to other physiological compartments. This model demonstrates how systemic transport properties can depend on cellular properties and, conversely, how cell states are influenced by systemic properties. When epithelial and endothelial pumps are considered together, we predict how pressures at various points in the network depend on the overall osmolarity of the system. The model can be improved by including physiological geometries and expanding solute species, and highlights the interplay of fluid properties with cell function in living organisms.

The potential diversity in the global repertoire of human antibody sequences is currently not well understood due to the limited existing paired antibody heavy-light chain sequence data that has been hindered by the low throughput and high costs of current single-cell sequencing methods. Here, we report IgHuAb, a large language model for high-throughput generation of paired human antibody sequences. Using IgHuAb, we created SynAbLib, a synthetic human antibody library that mimics population-level features of naturally occurring human antibody sequences, yet is associated with significantly greater diversity in sequence space. Further, experimental validation of a diverse set of antibodies from SynAbLib showed robust expression yields. IgHuAb and SynAbLib provide a readily expandable platform for human monoclonal antibody generation that can be efficiently mined for antibody sequences with target properties.

The design of proteins capable effectively binding to specific protein targets is crucial for developing therapies, diagnostics, and vaccine candidates for viral infections. Here, we introduce a complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting approach for designing nanobodies (Nbs) that target specific epitopes, with the aid of computer simulation and machine learning. As a proof-of-concept, we designed, evaluated, and characterized a high-affinity Nb against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The designed Nb, referred to as Nb Ab.2, was synthesized and displayed high-affinity for both the purified receptor-binding domain protein and to the virus-like particle, demonstrating affinities of 9 nM and 60 nM, respectively, as measured with microscale thermophoresis. Circular dichroism showed the designed protein’s structural integrity and its proper folding, whereas molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the internal dynamics of Nb Ab.2. This study shows that our computational pipeline can be used to efficiently design high-affinity Nbs with diagnostic and prophylactic potential, which can be tailored to tackle different viral targets.

We present mdciao, an open-source command line tool and Python Application-Programming-Interface (API) for easy, one-shot analysis and representation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Building upon the widely used concept of residue-residue contact-frequencies, mdciao offers a wide spectrum of further analysis and representations, enriched with available domain specific annotations. The user-friendly interface offers pre-packaged solutions for non-expert users, while keeping customizability for expert ones. Emphasis has been put into automatically producing annotated, production-ready figures and tables. Furthermore, seamless on-the-fly query and inclusion of domain-specific generic residue numbering for GPCRs, GAIN-domains, G-proteins, and kinases is made possible through online lookups. This allows for easy selection and comparison across different systems, regardless of sequence identity, target residues or domains. Finally, the fully documented Python API allows users to include the basic or advanced mdciao functions in their analysis workflows, and provides numerous examples and Jupyter Notebook Tutorials. The source code is published under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 or later and hosted on https://github.com/gph82/mdciao, and the documentation, including guides and examples, can be found at https://www.mdciao.org

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012451">The confidence-noise confidence-boost (CNCB) model of confidence rating data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pascal Mamassian, Vincent de Gardelle</p>

Over the last decade, different approaches have been proposed to interpret confidence rating judgments obtained after perceptual decisions. One very popular approach is to compute meta-d’ which is a global measure of the sensibility to discriminate the confidence rating distributions for correct and incorrect perceptual decisions. Here, we propose a generative model of confidence based on two main parameters, confidence noise and confidence boost, that we call <i>CNCB model</i>. Confidence noise impairs confidence judgements above and beyond how sensory noise affects perceptual sensitivity. The confidence boost parameter reflects whether confidence uses the same information that was used for perceptual decisions, or some new information. This CNCB model offers a principled way to estimate a confidence efficiency measure that is a theory-driven alternative to the popular M-ratio. We then describe two scenarios to estimate the confidence boost parameter, one where the experiment uses more than two confidence levels, the other where the experiment uses more than two stimulus strengths. We also extend the model to experiments using continuous confidence ratings and describe how the model can be fitted without binning these ratings. The continuous confidence model includes a non-linear mapping between objective and subjective confidence probabilities that can be estimated. Altogether, the CNCB model should help interpret confidence rating data at a deeper level. This manuscript is accompanied by a toolbox that will allow researchers to estimate all the parameters of the CNCB model in confidence ratings datasets. Some examples of re-analyses of previous datasets are provided in S1 File.

                <p>by Jose A. Carrillo, Hideki Murakawa, Makoto Sato, Miaoxing Wang</p>

Cell sorting by differential adhesion is one of the basic mechanisms explaining spatial organization of neurons in early stage brain development of fruit flies. The columnar arrangements of neurons determine the large-scale patterns in the fly visual center. Experimental studies indicate that hexagonal configurations regularly appear in the fly compound eye, which is connected to the visual center by photoreceptor axons, while tetragonal configurations can be induced in mutants. We need a mathematical framework to study the mechanisms of such a transition between hexagonal and tetragonal arrangements. Here, we propose a new mathematical model based on macroscopic approximations of agent-based models that produces a similar behavior changing from hexagonal to tetragonal steady configurations when medium-range repulsion and longer-range attraction between individuals are incorporated in previous successful models for cell sorting based on adhesion and volume constraints. We analyze the angular configurations of these patterns based on angle summary statistics and compare between experimental data and parameter fitted ARA (Adhesion-Repulsion-Attraction) models showing that intermediate patterns between hexagonal and tetragonal configuration are common in experimental data as well as in our ARA mathematical model. Our studies indicate an overall qualitative agreement of ARA models in tile patterning and pave the way for their quantitative studies. Our study opens up a new avenue to explore tile pattern transitions, found not only in the column arrangement in the brain, but also in the other related biological processes.

                <p>by Camille Quilgars, Eric Boué-Grabot, Philippe de Deurwaerdère, Jean-René Cazalets, Florence E. Perrin, Sandrine S. Bertrand</p>

In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of an increase in motor activity during the highly plastic period of development of the motor spinal cord and hindlimb muscles in newborn mice. A swim training regimen, consisting of two sessions per day for two days, was conducted in 1 and 2-day-old (P1, P2) pups. P3-trained pups showed a faster acquisition of a four-limb swimming pattern, accompanied by dysregulated gene expression in the lateral motor column, alterations in the intrinsic membrane properties of motoneurons (MNs) and synaptic plasticity, as well as increased axonal myelination in motor regions of the spinal cord. Network-level changes were also observed, as synaptic events in MNs and spinal noradrenaline and serotonin contents were modified by training. At the muscular level, slight changes in neuromuscular junction morphology and myosin subtype expression in hindlimb muscles were observed in trained animals. Furthermore, the temporal sequence of acquiring the adult-like swimming pattern and postural development in trained pups showed differences persisting until almost the second postnatal week. A very short motor training performed just after birth is thus able to induce functional adaptation in the developing neuromuscular system that could persist several days. This highlights the vulnerability of the neuromuscular apparatus during development and the need to evaluate carefully the impact of any given sensorimotor procedure when considering its application to improve motor development or in rehabilitation strategies.

                <p>by Alida Melissa Bouatta, Franziska Anzenberger, Lisa Riederauer, Andrea Lepper, Philipp Denninger</p>

During plant fertilization, excess male gametes compete for a limited number of female gametes. The dormant male gametophyte, encapsulated in the pollen grain, consists of two sperm cells enclosed in a vegetative cell. After reaching the stigma of a compatible flower, quick and efficient germination of the vegetative cell to a tip-growing pollen tube is crucial to ensure fertilization success. Rho of Plants (ROP) signaling and their activating ROP Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (ROPGEFs) are essential for initiating polar growth processes in multiple cell types. However, which ROPGEFs activate pollen germination is unknown. We investigated the role of ROPGEFs in initiating pollen germination and the required cell polarity establishment. Of the five pollen-expressed ROPGEFs, we found that GEF8, GEF9, and GEF12 are required for pollen germination and male fertilization success, as <i>gef8;gef9;gef12</i> triple mutants showed almost complete loss of pollen germination <i>in vitro</i> and had a reduced allele transmission rate. Live-cell imaging and spatiotemporal analysis of subcellular protein distribution showed that GEF8, GEF9, and GEF11, but not GEF12, displayed transient polar protein accumulations at the future site of pollen germination minutes before pollen germination, demonstrating specific roles for GEF8 and GEF9 during the initiation of pollen germination. Furthermore, this novel GEF accumulation appears in a biphasic temporal manner and can shift its location laterally. We showed that the C-terminal domain of GEF8 and GEF9 confers their protein accumulation and demonstrated that GEFs locally activate ROPs and alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which is required for pollen tube germination. We demonstrated that not all GEFs act redundantly during pollen germination, and we described for the first time a polar domain with spatiotemporal flexibility, which is crucial for the <i>de novo</i> establishment of a polar growth domain within a cell and, thus, for pollen function and fertilization success.

                <p>by Annabel May, Katja Röper</p>

How tissue shape and therefore function is encoded by the genome remains in many cases unresolved. The tubes of the salivary glands in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo start from simple epithelial placodes, specified through the homeotic factors Scr/Hth/Exd. Previous work indicated that early morphogenetic changes are prepatterned by transcriptional changes, but an exhaustive transcriptional blueprint driving physical changes was lacking. We performed single-cell-RNAseq-analysis of FACS-isolated early placodal cells, making up less than 0.4% of cells within the embryo. Differential expression analysis in comparison to epidermal cells analyzed in parallel generated a repertoire of genes highly upregulated within placodal cells prior to morphogenetic changes. Furthermore, clustering and pseudotime analysis of single-cell-sequencing data identified dynamic expression changes along the morphogenetic timeline. Our dataset provides a comprehensive resource for future studies of a simple but highly conserved morphogenetic process of tube morphogenesis. Unexpectedly, we identified a subset of genes that, although initially expressed in the very early placode, then became selectively excluded from the placode but not the surrounding epidermis, including <i>hth</i>, <i>grainyhead</i> and <i>tollo/toll-8</i>. We show that maintaining <i>tollo</i> expression severely compromised the tube morphogenesis. We propose <i>tollo</i> is switched off to not interfere with key Tolls/LRRs that are expressed and function in the tube morphogenesis.

                <p>by Jacob Francis, Caius R. Gibeily, William V. Smith, Isabel S. Petropoulos, Michael Anderson, William J. Heitler, Astrid A. Prinz, Stefan R. Pulver</p>

How do neural networks generate and regulate diversity and variability in motor outputs with finite cellular components? Here we examine this problem by exploring the role that inhibitory neuron motifs play in generating mixtures of motor programs in the segmentally organised <i>Drosophila</i> larval locomotor system. We developed a computational model that is constrained by experimental calcium imaging data. The model comprises single-compartment cells with a single voltage-gated calcium current, which are interconnected by graded excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Local excitatory and inhibitory neurons form conditional oscillators in each hemisegment. Surrounding architecture reflects key aspects of inter- and intrasegmental connectivity motifs identified in the literature. The model generates metachronal waves of activity that recapitulate key features of fictive forwards and backwards locomotion, as well as bilaterally asymmetric activity in anterior regions that represents fictive head sweeps. The statistics of inputs to competing command-like motifs, coupled with inhibitory motifs that detect activity across multiple segments generate network states that promote diversity in motor outputs, while at the same time preventing maladaptive overlap in motor programs. Overall, the model generates testable predictions for connectomics and physiological studies while providing a platform for uncovering how inhibitory circuit motifs underpin generation of diversity and variability in motor systems.

<p>Dystonia research focuses on the identification of converging biological pathways, allowing to define molecular drivers that serve as treatment targets. We summarize evidence supporting the concept that aberrations in purine metabolism intersect with dystonia pathogenesis. The recent discovery of <i>IMPDH2</i>-related dystonia introduced a gain-of-function paradigm in purinergic system defects, offering new perspectives to understand purine-pool imbalances in brain diseases. We discuss commonalities between known dystonia-linked mechanisms and mechanisms emerging from studies of purine metabolism disorders including Lesch–Nyhan disease. Together, we hypothesize that a greater appreciation of the relevance of purine perturbances in dystonia can offer fresh avenues for therapeutic intervention.

We identified a protein panel signature, in living humans, that correlates to improvement in neurocognition over a period of 5 years. Our signature is composed of complement proteins, coagulation cascade, and extracellular matrix regulators. In our cohort, SERPINF1 is associated with greater maximal oxygen uptake after an aerobic exercise intervention. Sleep quality is also a key factor in relation to inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2, which was associated with greater sleep efficiency. Additionally, we validate that the coagulation profile of decliners’ plasma contains procoagulant agonists, leading to greater platelet activation. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1007–1018</p>

                <p><i>GBA1</i> variants and decreased glucocerebrosidase activity are implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the hypothesis that increased levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a main substrate of glucocerebrosidase, are involved in PD pathogenesis. Using multiple genetic methods, we show that ATPase phospholipid transporting 10D (<i>ATP10D</i>), not <i>GBA1</i>, is the main regulator of plasma GlcCer levels, yet it is not involved in PD pathogenesis. Plasma GlcCer levels were associated with PD, but not in a causative manner, and are not predictive of disease status. These results argue against targeting GlcCer in <i>GBA1</i>-PD, and underscore the need to explore alternative mechanisms and biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:873–878</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the microstructural dynamics of the subventricular zone (SVZ) with aging and their associations with clinical disability and brain structural damage in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One-hundred and forty-one pediatric-onset MS patients (67 pediatric and 74 adults with pediatric-onset) and 233 healthy controls (HC) underwent neurological and 3.0 T MRI assessment. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted from the SVZ and the thalamus (as control region).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, SVZ FA was higher until age 40 then declined, whereas MD was lower until age 35 before rising (false discovery rate <i>p</i> value [pFDR] ≤ 0.008). Thalamic FA was higher until age 30 and then declined, whereas MD was higher until age 50 (pFDR ≤ 0.007). Pediatric MS patients showed significantly higher SVZ FA than pediatric HC (pFDR &lt; 0.001), while adult patients showed no differences compared to adult HC (pFDR ≤ 0.724). Adult patients had lower thalamic FA and higher MD (pFDR &lt; 0.001). Adults had lower SVZ FA and MD, but higher thalamic MD compared to pediatric patients (pFDR &lt; 0.001). In pediatric MS, higher SVZ FA and MD were associated with higher white matter (WM) lesion volume (LV) and choroid plexus volume and lower brain and thalamic volumes (pFDR ≤ 0.047). In adult patients, higher SVZ MD associated with higher WM LV, lower brain volumes, and lower z-SDMT (pFDR≤0.019). Thalamic microstructural abnormalities were associated with more severe disability and brain damage in both groups (pFDR ≤ 0.018).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that microstructural changes in the SVZ occur early in pediatric MS and are associated with brain structural damage but not with clinical impairment. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:979–992</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal loss. Previous studies using human postmortem tissues have shown the impact of neurodegenerative disorders on adult neurogenesis. The extent to which adult neural stem cells are activated in the subventricular zone and whether therapeutic treatments such as deep brain stimulation promote adult neurogenesis remains unclear. The goal of the present study is to assess adult neural stem cells activation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases who were treated or not by deep brain stimulation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Postmortem brain samples from Huntington's and Parkinson's disease patients who had received or not long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our results indicate a significant increase in the thickness of the subventricular zone and in the density of proliferating cells and activated stem cells in the brain of Huntington's disease subjects and Parkinson's disease patients treated with deep brain stimulation. We also observed an increase in the density of immature neurons in the brain of these patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, our data indicate that long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus promotes cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone that are reduced in Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our results also provide a detailed characterization of the cellular composition of the adult human subventricular zone and caudate nucleus in normal condition and in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and demonstrate the plasticity of these regions in response to neurodegeneration.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Whereas a scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is important for diagnosing epilepsy, a single routine EEG is limited in its diagnostic value. Only a small percentage of routine EEGs show interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and overall misdiagnosis rates of epilepsy are 20% to 30%. We aim to demonstrate how network properties in EEG recordings can be used to improve the speed and accuracy differentiating epilepsy from mimics, such as functional seizures – even in the absence of IEDs.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter study, we analyzed routine scalp EEGs from 218 patients with suspected epilepsy and normal initial EEGs. The patients’ diagnoses were later confirmed based on an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admission. About 46% ultimately being diagnosed with epilepsy and 54% with non-epileptic conditions. A logistic regression model was trained using spectral and network-derived EEG features to differentiate between epilepsy and non-epilepsy. Of the 218 patients, 90% were used for training and 10% were held out for testing. Within the training set, 10-fold cross validation was performed. The resulting tool was named “EpiScalp.”</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EpiScalp achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940, an accuracy of 0.904, a sensitivity of 0.835, and a specificity of 0.963 in classifying patients as having epilepsy or not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EpiScalp provides an accurate diagnostic aid from a single initial EEG recording, even in more challenging epilepsy cases with normal initial EEGs. This may represent a paradigm shift in epilepsy diagnosis by deriving an objective measure of epilepsy likelihood from previously uninformative EEGs. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:907–918</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging is crucial in quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) and thereby making an endovascular treatment (EVT) after large vessel occlusion. However, CTP is prone to overestimating the ischemic core. We sought to delineate the optimal regional CBF (rCBF) thresholds of pre-EVT CTP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We collected acute ischemic stroke patients due to large vessel occlusion who achieved successful recanalization with baseline CTP, immediate post-EVT diffusion-weighted image (DWI) within 3 hours, and delayed post-EVT DWI between 24 and 196 hours. Core volumes estimated by CTP at various rCBF thresholds were validated against immediate and delayed DWI lesion volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 175 acute large vessel occlusion patients were included. Baseline CTP was taken in a median of 24 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 21–31 minutes) after arrival; after the CTP, groin puncture in a median of 37 minutes (IQR 28–52 minutes), immediate post-EVT DWI scans in a median of 1.6 hours (IQR 0.8–2.1 hours), and delayed DWI scans in a median of 89 hours (IQR 69–106 hours). The correlations between the rCBF thresholds were the best at rCBF &lt;22% for immediate DWI (0.64; 95% CI 0.55–0.73) and at rCBF &lt;30% for delayed DWI (0.69; 95% CI 0.61–0.76). The interval between CTP and recanalization was inversely correlated with the overestimation of ischemic core volume compared with the subsequent DWI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Optimal rCBF thresholds for estimating ischemic core using CTP depend significantly on the timing of DWI post-EVT and CTP to recanalization delay. The optimal rCBF thresholds for ischemic core estimation may vary depending on the clinical setting. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:919–929</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early stage of Parkinson's disease or related disorders. Diagnosis requires an overnight video-polysomnogram (vPSG), however, even for sleep experts, interpreting vPSG data is challenging. Using a 3D camera, automated analysis of movements has yielded high accuracy. We aimed to replicate and extend prior work using a conventional 2D camera.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The dataset included 172 vPSG recordings from a clinical sleep center, 81 patients with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls (63 with a range of other sleep disorders and 28 healthy sleepers). An optical flow computer vision algorithm automatically detected movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, from which features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility were extracted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD exhibited an increased number of shorter movements and immobility periods. Accuracies for detecting iRBD ranged from 84.9% (with 2 features) to 87.2% (with 5 features). Combining all 5 features but only analyzing short (0.1–2 second duration) movements achieved the highest accuracy at 91.9%. Of the 11 patients with iRBD without noticeable movements during vPSG, 7 were correctly identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work improves prior art by using a 2D camera routinely used in sleep laboratories and improving performance by adding only 3 features. This approach could be implemented in clinical sleep laboratories to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of iRBD. Coupled with automated detection of REM sleep, it should also be tested in the home environment using conventional infrared cameras to detect and/or monitor RBD.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Epidemiological data have identified traumatic brain injury (TBI) as an exogenous risk factor for ALS; however, the mechanisms by which TBI may worsen SOD1 ALS remain largely undefined.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We sought to determine whether repetitive TBI (rTBI) accelerates disease onset and progression in the transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse ALS model, and whether loss of the primary regulator of axonal degeneration sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (<i>Sarm1</i>) mitigates the histological and behavioral pathophysiology. We subjected wild-type (n = 23), <i>Sarm1</i> knockout (KO; n = 17), SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (n = 19), and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>xSarm1<sup>KO</sup> (n = 26) mice of both sexes to rTBI or sham surgery at age 64 days (62–68 days). Body weight and ALS-deficit score were serially assessed up to 17 weeks after surgery and histopathology assessed in layer V of the primary motor cortex at the study end point.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In sham injured SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, genetic ablation of <i>Sarm1</i> did not attenuate axonal loss, improve neurological deficits, or survival. The rTBI accelerated onset of G93A-SOD1 ALS, as indicated by accentuated body weight loss, earlier onset of hindlimb tremor, and shortened survival. The rTBI also triggered TDP-43 mislocalization, enhanced axonal and neuronal loss, microgliosis, and astrocytosis. Loss of <i>Sarm1</i> significantly diminished the impact of rTBI on disease progression and rescued rTBI-associated neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SARM1-mediated axonal death pathway promotes pathogenesis after TBI in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice suggesting that anti-SARM1 therapeutics are a viable approach to preserve neurological function in injury-accelerated G93A-SOD1 ALS. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:963–975</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Clarity AD phase III trial showed that lecanemab reduced amyloid markers in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and resulted in less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo. Herein, we aimed to characterize amyloid-β (Aβ) protofibril (PF) captured by lecanemab in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living participants with different stages in AD, which enable an enhanced understanding of the dynamic changes of lecanemab-associated Aβ-PF (Lec-PF) in vivo.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We newly developed a unique and highly sensitive immunoassay method using lecanemab that selectively captures Lec-PF. The CSF level of Lec-PF, Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, p-tau 217, total tau, and neurogranin were measured in Japanese participants (n = 163). The participants in this study consisted of 48 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-negative (CU–), 8 cognitively impaired diagnosed as suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, 9 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-positive (CU+), 34 Aβ-positive with mild cognitive impairment (MCI+), and 64 Aβ-positive with AD dementia (AD+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The CSF Lec-PF levels significantly increased in the groups of MCI+ and AD+ compared with CU– group. Notably, CSF Lec-PF showed modest correlation with plaque-associated biomarkers in Aβ-positive participants and stronger correlation with neurodegeneration biomarkers, such as CSF total tau and neurogranin, suggesting that CSF Lec-PF levels proximally reflect neurodegeneration as well as the amount of senile amyloid plaques.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first report describing Aβ-PF species captured by lecanemab in human CSF and supporting that Lec-PF is correlated with neurodegeneration in AD and may explain the mechanism of the clinical effect of lecanemab. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:993–1006</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study assesses whether longitudinal quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration after large middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and determines how early changes are detectable.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, single-center observational cohort study included patients with large MCA stroke admitted to Boston Medical Center's intensive care unit (2019–2024). Associations between time-to-neurologic deterioration and quantitative pupillometry, including Neurological Pupil Index (NPi), were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates adjusted for age, sex, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. Models using dilation velocity were compared with partial likelihood ratio tests. Pupillometric changes over 2-h intervals in the 12 h preceding deterioration were analyzed with linear mixed-effects modeling and Tukey's test. Matched referents (age, sex, stroke side, follow-up duration) were used for comparison. Optimal thresholds were identified using the Youden Index.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 71 patients (mean age 66.5 years; 59.2% women), 32 (45.1%) experienced deterioration. A 1-unit decrease in NPi was associated with a higher hazard of deterioration (hazard ratio 2.46; 95% confidence interval 1.68–3.61). Dilation velocity improved model performance compared to NPi alone. NPi was significantly lower at 0–2 h (3.81 vs. 4.38, p = 0.001) and 2–4 h (3.71 vs. 4.38, p &lt; 0.001) before deterioration compared to 10–12 h prior. Optimal thresholds were 4.01 for NPi, 0.49 mm/s for dilation velocity, and −0.15 change in NPi over 12 h.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration in MCA stroke, with declines detectable up to 12 h prior. Dilation velocity shows promise as a novel biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:930–941</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to delineate synaptic density alterations in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and explore its potential role as a biomarker for MSA diagnosis and disease severity monitoring using [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET CT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this prospective study, 60 patients with MSA (30 patients with MSA-parkinsonian [MSA-P] subtype and 30 patients with MSA-cerebellar [MSA-C] subtype), 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET/CT for synaptic density assessment. Visual, voxel, and volumetric region of interest (VOI) analyses were used to elucidate synaptic density patterns in the MSA brain and establish diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic performances of both visual and VOI-based diagnostics were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Spearman correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between brain synaptic density and disease severity</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with MSA displayed extensive reductions in synaptic density throughout the brain, notably affecting both primary VOIs (the cerebellum and putamen) and secondary VOIs including the medulla oblongata, ventral tegmental area, and pons. Notably, patients with MSA-C exhibited a remarkable decrease in cerebellar synaptic density, whereas patients with MSA-P demonstrated significant synaptic loss within the posterior putamen. Compared with patients with PD, the patients with MSA show a more pronounced reduction in synaptic density in infratentorial brain regions. VOI-based diagnosis significantly outperformed visual analysis in diagnosing and differentiating MSA and its subtypes. Synaptic density in primary and multiple secondary VOIs correlated significantly with motor scales in patients with MSA.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study identified widespread synaptic density reductions in MSA, particularly in the basal ganglia and infratentorial region, suggesting [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and evaluating the disease, and guiding synaptic restoration trials.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and tufted astrocytes. Developing treatments for PSP is challenging due to the lack of disease models reproducing its key pathological features. This study aimed to model sporadic PSP-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) using multi-donor midbrain organoids (MOs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The MOs were generated by pooling induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 4 patients with sporadic probable PSP-RS and compared them with MOs from 3 healthy control (HC) subjects. We performed comprehensive analyses of MOs over 120 days to assess neuronal death, reactive gliosis, and the accumulation of 4R-tau and hyperphosphorylated tau forms (pThr231, pSer396, pThr181, and pSer202/pThr205 [AT8]) using immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. On day 90, immunohistochemical analysis using pSer396 and AT8 antibodies was conducted to assess disease pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PSP-derived MOs showed progressive size reduction compared with HC-derived MOs, linked to upregulated apoptosis-related mRNA markers. Dopaminergic neuron degeneration was marked by decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and increased neurofilament light chain (NfL). Immunofluorescence and Western blot revealed accumulation of all investigated tau forms with a peak at 90 days, along with a significant rise in GFAP-positive cells in PSP-derived MOs. Immunochemistry confirmed typical PSP histological alterations, such as neurofibrillary tangles and tufted-shaped astrocytes, absent in HC-derived organoids.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We developed a robust in vitro PSP model reproducing the key molecular and histologic features of the disease. This result holds promise for advancing basic and clinical research in PSP, paving the way for in vitro molecular diagnosis and identification of novel therapeutic targets.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After a recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI), some patients develop perilesional or remote hyperintensities (‘caps/tracks’) to the index infarct on T2/FLAIR MRI. However, their clinical relevance remains unclear. We investigated the clinicoradiological correlates of ‘caps/tracks’, and their impact on long-term outcomes following RSSI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We identified participants with lacunar stroke and MRI-confirmed RSSI from 3 prospective studies. At baseline, we collected risk factors, RSSI characteristics, small vessel disease (SVD) features, and microstructural integrity on diffusion imaging. Over 1-year, we repeated MRI and recorded ‘caps/tracks’ blinded to other data. We evaluated predictors of ‘caps/tracks’, and their association with 1-year functional (modified Rankin Scale score ≥2), mobility (Timed Up-and-Go), cognitive outcomes (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score &lt;26), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (stroke/transient ischemic attack/incident infarct) using multivariable regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 185 participants, 93 (50.3%) developed ‘caps/tracks’ first detected at median 198 days after stroke. ‘Caps/tracks’ were independently predicted by baseline factors: larger RSSI, RSSI located in white matter, higher SVD score, and higher mean diffusivity in normal-appearing white matter (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}], 1.15 [1.07–1.25], 6.01 [2.80–13.57], 1.77 [1.31–2.44], 1.42 [1.01–2.03]). At 1 year, ‘cap/track’ formation was associated with worse functional outcome (OR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.28–8.22), slower gait speed (β: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.01–0.25), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.05–4.02), but not with cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>‘Caps/tracks’ after RSSI are associated with worse clinical outcomes, and may reflect vulnerability to progressive SVD-related injury. Reducing ‘caps/tracks’ may offer early efficacy markers in trials aiming to improve outcome after lacunar stroke. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:942–955</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic dystonia is a complex movement disorder with diverse clinical manifestations resulting from pathogenic mutations in associated genes. A recent paradigm shift emphasizes the functional convergence among dystonia genes, hinting at a shared pathomechanism. However, the neural dynamics supporting this convergence remain largely unexplored.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Herein, we analyzed microelectrode recordings acquired during pallidal deep brain stimulation surgery from 31 dystonia patients with pathogenic mutations in the <i>AOPEP</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, <i>PANK2</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>SGCE</i>, <i>THAP1</i>, <i>TOR1A</i>, and <i>VPS16</i> genes. We identified 1,694 single units whose activity was characterized by a broad set of neural features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>AOPEP</i>, <i>PANK2</i>, and <i>THAP1</i> displayed higher firing regularity, whereas <i>GNAL</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, and <i>SGCE</i> shared a large fraction of bursting neurons (&gt; 26.6%), significantly exceeding the rate in other genes. <i>TOR1A</i> and <i>VPS16</i> genes constituted an intermediate group, bridging these 2 groups, due to having the highest degree of spiking irregularity. Hierarchical clustering algorithms based on these dynamics confirmed the results obtained with first-order comparisons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Despite lacking common molecular pathways, dystonia genes share largely overlapping structures of neural patterns, in particular the degree of pallidal spiking regularity and bursting activity. We propose that the degree of desynchronization facilitated by pallidal neural bursts may explain the variability in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) surgery outcomes across genetic dystonia syndromes. Lastly, investigating the effects of genetic mutations on low-frequency pallidal activity could optimize personalized adaptive DBS treatments in patients with genetic dystonia.

                Nicotine activates the dopamine reward system to promote consumption and addiction, but the brain has a natural brake to counteract it. Jehl, Ciscato, Vicq, Guyon, et al. identified the interpeduncular nucleus as this brake. Blocking its action in mice increased nicotine’s appeal, highlighting its key role in addiction regulation.

                Son et al. describe how Parkinson’s disease mutations in alpha-synuclein compromise autophagy, a major route for alpha-synuclein degradation. A53T and triplication α-Syn mutations activate ACLY, which enhances cytoplasmic p300 activity. This stimulates mTORC1 to inhibit autophagy. Importantly, ACLY inhibitors rescue pathology in neuronal, zebrafish, and mouse α-synucleinopathy models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100490">Cell crowding activates pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS via TRPV4 inhibition and cell volume reduction</a></h4>

              
                Cell crowding is a common microenvironmental factor influencing various disease processes, but its role in promoting cell invasiveness remains unclear. This study investigates the biomechanical changes induced by cell crowding, focusing on pro-invasive cell volume reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Crowding specifically enhanced invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells through significant volume reduction compared to hyperplasia-mimicking or normal cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that crowding selectively relocated ion channels, including TRPV4, to the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. TRPV4 inhibition triggered by crowding decreased intracellular calcium levels, reduced cell volume, and increased invasion and motility. During this process, TRPV4 membrane relocation primed the channel for later activation, compensating for calcium loss. Analyses of patient-derived breast cancer tissues confirmed that plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 is specific to high-grade DCIS and indicates the presence of a pro-invasive cell volume reduction mechanotransduction pathway. Hyperosmotic conditions and pharmacologic TRPV4 inhibition mimicked crowding-induced effects, while TRPV4 activation reversed them. Silencing TRPV4 diminished mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells, reducing calcium depletion, volume reduction, and motility. This study uncovers a novel pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway driven by cell crowding and identifies TRPV4 as a potential biomarker for predicting invasion risk in DCIS patients.

">Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome Associated ADAR G1007R mutation dominantly induces neuroinflammation in mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                The ADARG1007R mutation is one of the most frequent mutations found in type six Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS), a severe inflammatory encephalopathy in pediatric patients. We report here a mouse model bearing an human equivalent ADARG1007R mutation, and the heterozygous mice recapitulated some pathologic features of ADARG1007R AGS patients, including early-onset brain inflammation in heterozygous individuals and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression within deep brain areas. Furthermore, we demonstrated that brain inflammation could be reversed by deletion of the cellular RNA receptor MDA5, which blocks the cellular RNA sensing signaling pathway. This model provides a unique tool for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterozygous ADARWT/G1007R mutation in AGS brain pathogenesis. It may also be a valuable platform for developing personalized therapies for patients with this specific mutation.

">Cannabis use in humans is associated with impaired implicit motor learning and supranormal baseline cortical activity</a></h4>

              
                Chronic cannabis use is associated with cognitive impairment, but its impact on implicit motor learning is unclear. Implicit learning of movement sequences (i.e., their specific ordinal and temporal structure) is vital for performing complex motor behavior and lays the foundation for performing daily activities and interacting socially. We collected data from 32 individuals who used cannabis regularly and 30 individuals who did not use cannabis. We utilized the serial reaction time task to assess implicit motor sequence learning and the Corsi block-tapping test to assess visuospatial short-term and working memory. We also recorded resting state electroencephalography (EEG) to measure baseline cortical activity. While implicit motor learning was evident at the group level, cannabis use measures were associated with a smaller index of motor learning and increased activity in beta and gamma EEG frequencies during resting state. The cannabis group also had a significantly shorter Corsi span (in both forward and backward conditions). These findings indicate that chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired implicit motor learning that may be a function of increased baseline neural oscillatory activity, resulting in increased cortical noise, and reduced visuospatial short-term and working memory. These findings suggest that chronic cannabis use may disrupt corticostriatal pathways that underlie implicit motor sequence learning, indicating a more extensive effect of cannabis on the motor system.

">Control of two-pathway signal integration in a model neocortical pyramidal cell</a></h4>

              
                We demonstrate how neuromodulation and spatially targetted inhibition can alter the integration of the two streams of excitatory input in a thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal cell, using a computational reduced-compartmental cell models. Choosing suitable ranges of brief current stimulus amplitudes, applied basally to either the soma or basal dendrites (basal stimulation) and to the apical tuft (apical stimulation) results in burst firing due to either stimulus alone, if strong enough, or by a combination of the stimuli at lower amplitudes. Applying tonic inhibition to the apical tuft removes the ability of apical input alone to generate a burst over the chosen amplitude range. A similar effect is achieved by reducing the tuft calcium channel conductance as an outcome of neuromodulation. Similarly, tonic inhibition to the basal dendrites removes the ability of basal stimulation alone to generate a burst, without blocking bursts resulting from apical calcium spikes. HCN channels in the apical dendrites may amplify or reduce bursting probability, depending on other active and passive properties of dendrites. So neuromodulation that decreases the conductance of these channels may act to reduce or increase bursting probability across the across the ranges of basal and apical inputs, depending on cell properties. These effects mimic those found previously by simply limiting the range of stimulus amplitudes (Graham et al, 2025) but now show that such changes in two-stream signal integration can happen through network inhibition and neuromodulation with no change in the excitatory driving stimulus strengths. These changes in signal integration also lead to changes in information transmitted by the cell's bursting probability about the two input streams, as shown in Graham et al (2025). Changes in cell morphology are also investigated by reducing the apical trunk length and are revealed to alter this two-stream signal integration through differential effects on passive and active interaction between the soma and apical tuft.

">The role of inhibitory neurons in novelty sound detection in regular and random statistical contexts.</a></h4>

              
                Detecting statistical regularities in sound and responding to violations of these patterns, termed novelty detection, is a core function of the auditory system. Human studies have shown that novelty responses are enhanced in regular compared to random auditory contexts, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined how inhibitory neurons contribute to context-dependent novelty responses in mouse auditory cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of awake head-fixed male and female mice, we recorded neuronal activity during presentation of spectro-temporally rich ripple sounds, with novel ripples embedded in either regular or random ripple sequences. AC neurons exhibited enhanced responses to novel sounds in regular contexts compared to random ones. To identify circuit mechanisms, we selectively inactivated parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) inhibitory neurons using optogenetics during imaging. Inactivation of PV and SST neurons broadly increased novelty responses in both contexts. In contrast, VIP inactivation selectively reduced responses to novel stimuli in the regular context, abolishing the context-dependent enhancement. At the population level, inactivating all three neuronal subtypes increased detectability of the novel stimulus, but with VIP inactivation, the shift was stronger for regular than random context. These findings reveal a distinct role for VIP neurons in modulating prediction error signals based on temporal structure, suggesting that VIP circuits are critical for context-sensitive auditory processing.

">Kinocilia of Vestibular Hair Cells: Bridging Structural and Functional Traits of Primary and Motile Cilia</a></h4>

              
                Vestibular hair cells (HCs) detect head motion and orientation by transducing mechanical forces generated by gravity and acceleration into neural signals. This mechanotransduction is mediated by the hair bundle, which comprises stereocilia and a kinocilium--the latter considered a specialized form of primary cilium. To investigate its characteristics, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 1,522 adult vestibular and cochlear HCs. Our analysis revealed an enrichment of genes associated with motile cilia in vestibular HCs, particularly those linked to the axonemal repeat complex, a defining structural feature of motile cilia. Similar axonemal-related genes were identified in zebrafish and human vestibular HCs, highlighting a conserved molecular composition of kinocilia across vertebrate species. Immunostaining confirmed the expression of key motile cilia markers--including CCDC39, CCDC40, DNAH5, and DNAH6--in vestibular kinocilia. Live imaging of bullfrog saccular and mouse crista HCs revealed spontaneous kinociliary motion that drove oscillations of the hair bundle. Together, these findings establish the kinocilium as a distinct organelle with molecular hallmarks of motile cilia and suggest it functions as an active, force-generating vestibular hair bundle component, potentially influencing mechanosensitivity of HCs.

">Unsupervised feature computation-based feature selection robustly extracted resting-state functional connectivity patterns related to mental disorders</a></h4>

              
                Research on biomarkers for predicting psychiatric disorders from resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is advancing. While the focus has primarily been on the discriminative performance of biomarkers by machine learning, identification of abnormal FCs in psychiatric disorders has often been treated as a secondary goal. However, it is crucial to investigate the effect size and robustness of the selected FCs because they can be used as potential targets of neurofeedback training or transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. Here, we incorporated approximately 5,000 runs of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from six datasets, including individuals with three different psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD], schizophrenia [SCZ], and autism spectrum disorder [ASD]). We demonstrated that an unsupervised feature-computation-based feature selection method can robustly extract FCs related to psychiatric disorders compared to other conventional supervised feature selection methods. We found that our proposed method robustly extracted FCs with larger effect sizes from the validation dataset compared to different types of feature selection methods based on supervised learning for MDD (Cohens d = 0.40 vs. 0.25), SCZ (0.37 vs. 0.28), and ASD (0.17 vs. 0.16). We found 78, 69, and 81 essential FCs for MDD, SCZ, and ASD, respectively, and these FCs were mainly thalamic and motor network FCs. The current study showed that the unsupervised feature-computation-based feature selection method robustly identified abnormal FCs in psychiatric disorders consistently across datasets. The discovery of such robust FCs will contribute to understanding neural mechanisms as abnormal brain signatures in psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, this finding can aid in developing precise therapeutic interventions, such as neurofeedback training or transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy.

">HIF-1α/STOML2 mediated PINK1-dependent mitophagy activation against hypoxia-induced neuronal injury</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia contributes to brain disorders by causing neuronal injury. However, in the early stage of stress, neurons initiate a series of compensatory pathways to resist cell damage, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that hypoxia transiently activates PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-dependent mitophagy in the early stage before cell damage and neurological dysfunction. PINK1 overexpression protects neurons and it knockdown exacerbates neuronal damage, highlighting the key role of PINK1-dependent mitophagy in hypoxic adaptation. Mechanistically, hypoxia promotes HIF-1 nuclear translocation, inducing transcription of stomatin like 2 (STOML2). STOML2 relocates to the mitochondrial membrane, aiding phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) cleavage, which triggers PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Silencing HIF-1, STOML2, or PGAM5 inhibits PINK1-dependent mitophagy and worsens neurological function under hypoxia. Notably, intermittent hypoxia, a hypoxic conditioning strategy for improving hypoxic tolerance, enhances PINK1-dependent mitophagy by activating HIF-1/STOML2 axis, and protects neurons against hypoxia. In conclusion, our study reveals a new "self-protection" mechanism of neurons against hypoxic stress and discovers that intermittent hypoxia is a potential therapeutic strategy against hypoxia-induced injury.
