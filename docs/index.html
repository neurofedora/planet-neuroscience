              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03521">BiND: A Neural Discriminator-Decoder for Accurate Bimanual Trajectory Prediction in Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND (Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient. BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69 ($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model (GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing bimanual decoding.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04064">An analog-electronic implementation of a harmonic oscillator recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory recurrent networks, such as the Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent Network (HORN) model, offer advantages in parameter efficiency, learning speed, and robustness relative to traditional non-oscillating architectures. Yet, while many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor dynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in analog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far are lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in analog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of the digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained parameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error metrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the dynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall well-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on the data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\%$ agreement with the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch is due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the floating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform classification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a re-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to that of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the analog dynamics. This proof-of-concept establishes that analog electronic circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation, providing a demonstration of energy-efficient analog systems that exploit brain-inspired transient dynamics for computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04106">Optimal rate-variance coding due to firing threshold adaptation near criticality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrently connected neuron populations play key roles in sensory perception and memory storage across various brain regions. While these populations are often assumed to encode information through firing rates, this method becomes unreliable with weak stimuli. We propose that in such cases, information can be transmitted via spatial spike patterns, employing a sparse or combinatorial coding based on firing rate variance. Around the critical point of a stochastic recurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme, enabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance coding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs, thus maximizing input/output mutual information. These optimizations are robust across adaptation rules and coupling strengths through self-suppression of internal noise, particularly around the network's phase transition, and are linked to threshold recovery times observed in hippocampal memory circuits (~$10^2$-$10^3$ms). In contrast, nonadaptive networks perform similarly only at criticality, suggesting that threshold adaptation is essential for reliable encoding of weak signals into diverse spatial patterns. Our results imply a fundamental role for near-critical latent adaptive dynamics enabled by dual coding in biological and artificial neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01235">Geometric origin of adversarial vulnerability in deep learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.01235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework, the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge structures while reducing representation interference.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10571">Language Models Do Not Have Human-Like Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.10571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities, we demonstrate that they fundamentally lack a core aspect of human cognition: working memory. Human working memory is an active cognitive system that enables not only the temporary storage of information but also its processing and utilization. Without working memory, individuals may produce unreal conversations, exhibit self-contradiction, and struggle with tasks requiring mental reasoning. Existing evaluations using N-back or context-dependent tasks fail as they allow LLMs to exploit accessible context rather than retain latent information. We introduce three novel tasks, (1) Number Guessing, (2) Yes-No Deduction, and Math Magic, that isolate internal representation from external context. Across seventeen frontier models spanning four major model families, we consistently observe irrational or contradictory behaviors, highlighting LLMs' inability to retain and manipulate latent information. Our work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating working memory in LLMs and identifies this deficit as a critical obstacle to artificial general intelligence. Code and prompts for the experiments are available at https://github.com/penguinnnnn/LLM-Working-Memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02799">Data-driven mean-field within whole-brain models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.02799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean-field models provide a link between microscopic neuronal activity and macroscopic brain dynamics. Their derivation depends on simplifying assumptions, such as all-to-all connectivity, limiting their biological realism. To overcome this, we introduce a data-driven framework in which a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learns the macroscopic dynamics directly from simulations of a network of spiking neurons. The network connection probability serves here as a new parameter, inaccessible to purely analytical treatment, which is validated against ground truth analytical solutions. Through bifurcation analysis on the trained MLP, we demonstrate the existence of new cusp bifurcation that systematically reshapes the system's phase diagram in a degenerate manner with synaptic coupling. By integrating this data-driven mean-field model into a whole-brain computational framework, we show that it extends beyond the macroscopic emergent dynamics generated by the analytical model. For validation, we use simulation-based inference on synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and demonstrate accurate parameter recovery for the novel mean-field model, while the current state-of-the-art models lead to biased estimates. This work presents a flexible and generic framework for building more realistic whole-brain models, bridging the gap between microscale mechanisms and macroscopic brain recordings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04244">Integrating Pruning with Quantization for Efficient Deep Neural Networks Compression</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advances in a wide range of applications. However, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters, which result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this issue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques, commonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance processing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even greater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization to harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily due to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly optimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that integrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT) quantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model accuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied simultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed first to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the pruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal accuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with limited computational resources.

                arXiv:2405.07241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuing generation of novelty, complexity, and adaptation are well-established as core aspects of open-ended evolution. However, it has yet to be firmly established to what extent these phenomena are coupled and by what means they interact. In this work, we track the co-evolution of novelty, complexity, and adaptation in a case study from the DISHTINY simulation system, which is designed to study the evolution of digital multicellularity. In this case study, we describe ten qualitatively distinct multicellular morphologies, several of which exhibit asymmetrical growth and distinct life stages. We contextualize the evolutionary history of these morphologies with measurements of complexity and adaptation. Our case study suggests a loose -- sometimes divergent -- relationship can exist among novelty, complexity, and adaptation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22832">Pulling Back the Curtain on ReLU Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.22832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since any ReLU network is piecewise affine, its hidden units can be characterized by their pullbacks through the active subnetwork, i.e., by their gradients (up to bias terms). However, gradients of deeper neurons are notoriously misaligned, which obscures the network's internal representations. We posit that models do align gradients with data, yet this is concealed by the intrinsic noise of the ReLU hard gating. We validate this intuition by applying soft gating in the backward pass only, reducing the local impact of weakly excited neurons. The resulting modified gradients, which we call "excitation pullbacks", exhibit striking perceptual alignment on a number of ImageNet-pretrained architectures, while the rudimentary pixel-space gradient ascent quickly produces easily interpretable input- and target-specific features. Inspired by these findings, we formulate the "path stability" hypothesis, claiming that the binary activation patterns largely stabilize during training and get encoded in the pre-activation distribution of the final model. When true, excitation pullbacks become aligned with the gradients of a kernel machine that mainly determines the network's decision. This provides a theoretical justification for the apparent faithfulness of the feature attributions based on these pullbacks, potentially even leading to mechanistic interpretability of deeper models. Incidentally, we give a possible explanation for the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and Deep Features, together with a novel perspective on the network's internal memory and generalization properties. We release the code and an interactive app for easier exploration of the excitation pullbacks.

                Anxiety, whilst often viewed as a disorder, is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that facilitates threat detection and survival. However, when stress regulation becomes maladaptive, this adaptive response can shift into pathology. Here, we identify the claustrum (CLA) as a key hub for allostasis following stress, integrating Gad2 (GABAergic)-vGluT1 (glutamatergic) microcircuits. We report that acute social defeat stress activated the CLA and induced hypervigilance and anxiety-like behaviors. Multimodal analyses revealed transcriptional plasticity in CLA neurons, and fiber photometry revealed anticipatory activation of Gad2 neurons and reactive activation of vGluT1+ neurons. We further delineated a reciprocal GABAergic-glutamatergic circuit between the CLA and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that orchestrates allostasis following stress via opposing mechanisms: (1) glutamatergic CLA-ACC projections that amplify threat responses, and (2) two distinct GABAergic inhibitory pathways- intrinsic CLA Gad2+ activity and top-down ACC-CLA Gad2+ modulation. Chronic stress drives persistent hyperactivation of CLA Gad2+ neurons, suppressing CLA glutamatergic activity and leading to depression-like behaviors. Our results identify a dynamic CLA circuit that gates stress responses via CLA Gad2+ neurons acting as a brake under acute stress. Chronic stress amplifies this inhibition, thereby disturbing circuit balance and driving behavioral despair affective pathology.

">Age-Related Changes in Curiosity: The Influence of Locus Coeruleus on Information-Seeking Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Curiosity enhances learning and memory and has been linked to the locus coeruleus (LC), which undergoes age-related decline. To examine how aging affects curiosity and information-seeking, we developed the Photographic Art Storytelling Task. Participants (sixty-eight young and sixty-five older adults) viewed photographs, rated their curiosity, and later read stories associated with selected images. The stories were deliberately constructed to be either interesting or boring, functioning as rewards that elicited prediction errors. Participants reappraised their curiosity, allowing us to separate intrinsic motivation from story-driven reward influences. Associations between performance and both pupil diameter and MRI measures of LC integrity supported a role of LC in curiosity regulation. Aging was associated with greater reliance on novelty-driven (initial) curiosity and a shift away from prediction error-related information-seeking. Both age groups showed curiosity-driven memory enhancement, with older adults exhibiting youth-like effects, suggesting a role for intrinsic motivation in preserving cognitive function in aging.

">Flexible navigation with neuromodulated cognitive maps</a></h4>

              
                Animals develop specialized cognitive maps during navigation, constructing environmental representations that facilitate efficient exploration and goal-directed planning. The hippocampal CA1 region is implicated as the primary neural substrate for cognitive mapping, housing spatially tuned cells that adapt based on behavioral patterns and internal states. Computational approaches to modeling these biological systems have employed various methodologies. Although labeled graphs with local spatial information and deep neural networks have provided computational frameworks for spatial navigation, significant limitations persist in modeling one-shot adaptive mapping. We introduce a biologically inspired place cell architecture that develops cognitive maps during exploration of novel environments. Our model implements a simulated agent for reward-driven navigation that forms spatial representations online. The architecture incorporates behaviorally relevant information through neuromodulatory signals that respond to environmental boundaries and reward locations. Learning combines rapid Hebbian plasticity, lateral competition, and targeted modulation of place cells. Analysis of the capabilities of the model on a variety of environments demonstrates our approachs efficiency, achieving in one shot what traditional RL models require thousands of epochs to learn. The simulation results show that the agent successfully explores and navigates to the target locations in various environments, showing adaptability when the reward positions change. Analysis of neuromodulated place cells reveals dynamic changes in neuronal density and tuning field size after behaviorally significant events. These findings align with experimental observations of reward effects on hippocampal spatial cells while providing computational support for the efficacy of biologically inspired approaches to cognitive mapping.

">Transient Early Postnatal Neuronal Hyperexcitation Results in Lasting Social Preference Deficits</a></h4>

              
                Perturbations during critical periods of neurodevelopment are implicated in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a condition marked by considerable heterogeneity and prevalent comorbidities. One such comorbidity is epilepsy, with approximately 30% of children with ASD experiencing seizures and a similar proportion of children with epilepsy displaying ASD-like symptoms. Both conditions have been associated with disruptions in the brain's excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) balance. Although early-life seizures in rodents have been linked to social impairments, direct causal evidence connecting E/I imbalance, interneuron development, and social behavior remains limited. To address this gap, we induced transient, brain-wide hyperexcitation in neonatal mice using pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABA_A receptor antagonist. We administered both convulsive and subconvulsive doses and assessed long-term effects on social behavior, cortical E/I balance, and parvalbumin (PV) interneuron development. PTZ-treated groups displayed impaired social preference as measured in the 3-chamber test and increased PV interneuron density within the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings highlight a critical developmental window during which E/I imbalance leads to social deficits characteristic of ASD and epilepsy. They also reveal dose-dependent neurobiological changes, underscoring the importance of early-life neural activity in shaping social circuitry.

">Emergence of Balanced Cortical Activity via Calcium-Regulated Synaptic Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits must stabilize activity while retaining the variability and flexibility essential for computation. This raises a fundamental question: how can excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synapses co-adapt through homeostatic plasticity without disrupting network function or relying on fine-tuned parameters? We propose a solution grounded in the multidimensional nature of intracellular calcium signaling, which independently regulates protein synthesis at E and I synapses. By analytically characterizing calcium dynamics driven by spike-train statistics, we show that calcium's mean encodes firing rate, while its variance reflects spike-time irregularity, two complementary features critical for stable yet flexible spiking. Leveraging this dual signal, we construct a closed-loop model in which inhibitory synapses are regulated by calcium's mean and excitatory synapses by its variance through independent pathways. This mechanism preserves irregular spiking and stabilizes firing rates across diverse inputs. Strikingly, it also yields the empirically observed weakening of synaptic strengths with the number of inputs K as 1{surd}K, leading to the spontaneous emergence of balanced excitatory-inhibitory dynamics. These results uncover a calcium-driven regulatory principle linking intracellular signaling to the origin of balanced activity in cortical networks.

">Multiplexing behavioral signals in sensory representations</a></h4>

              
                Activity of sensory neurons is influenced not only by external stimuli but also by the animal's behavioral state. It is well documented that behavior influences the general properties of neural activity, such as response gain. However, it is not known whether it could affect the sensory tuning of individual neurons in a more refined way and what the functional benefit of such nuanced modulation might be. Here, we investigate this in the mouse visual cortex, where sensory response gain varies with locomotion speed. First, using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that gain modulation can multiplex behavioral information in sensory populations, without compromising the accuracy of sensory coding. To implement such multiplexing, behavioral signals should modify the sensory tuning in individual neurons. Second, we analyze neural activity in the mouse visual cortex made available by the Allen Brain Observatory. Our analysis indicates that, in agreement with the theory, locomotion-induced gain modulation can modify the tuning of sensory neurons to direction of visual motion. In that way, the visual cortex could instantiate an accurate, joint representation of sensory and movement-related signals and support computations that simultaneously require both types of information.

">Sex differences in the developing human cortex intersect with genetic risk of neurodevelopmental disorders</a></h4>

              
                Autism is highly heritable and diagnosed more frequently in males than females. To identify neurodevelopmental processes that might present sex-biased vulnerability, we generated transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of cell types present in the prenatally developing human cerebral cortex of 27 males and 21 females. By intersecting sex-biased molecular signatures and genes with de novo mutations in male and female autistic probands, we reveal two points of vulnerability contributing to the sex-biased penetrance in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). First, we show that NDD risk genes are biased towards higher expression in females, identifying the NDD gene MEF2C as a critical transcription factor for female-biased expression. Second, we identify a significant contribution of X chromosome genes to NDD pathobiology. We construct a gene regulatory map of X-linked risk genes to enable functional studies of genetic variants that likely disrupt gene expression in the developing brains of autistic males. Together, these results point towards an outsized contribution of the X-chromosome to both the origin of sex differences in the developing human cortex and NDD vulnerability. We propose a model where female-biased vulnerability is driven by coding variation within genes while male-biased vulnerability is driven by noncoding variation in regulatory elements that affect gene expression.

                <p>The causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and white matter injury and communication remains unclear. We aimed to scrutinize the plausible causal impact of GM on white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), white matter microstructure, white matter connectivity, and multiple neurological diseases via Mendelian randomization study. We identified four WMH-related bacterial taxa, including class <I>Melainabacteria</I>, order <I>Gastranaerophilales</I>, family <I>Alcaligenaceae</I>, and genus <I>Ruminiclostridium 6</I>. In addition, three bacterial taxa were discovered that have consistent effect on multiple aspects of white matter microstructure. Furthermore, we found 12 strong associations between genetic liability in GM and white matter connectivity. Among these bacterial taxa, the family <I>Clostridiaceae 1</I> demonstrated a protective effect against ischemic stroke (IS). The genus <I>Barnesiella</I> showed protective effect on IS and small vessel stroke while posed a risk effect on neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), as well as on aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD). The order <I>Desulfovibrionales</I> and family <I>Desulfovibrionaceae</I> showed protective effect against cardioembolic stroke, and the genus <I>Ruminococcus gnavus group</I> showed a protective effect on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In terms of the mapped genes of statistically significant bacterial taxa, genes such as <I>CPNE1</I>, <I>PIGU</I>, <I>MED22</I>, <I>SURF6</I>, <I>DOCK10</I>, and <I>COPS3</I> exhibited a significant causal correlation with the corresponding white matter connectivity. This study demonstrated a genetically predicted causal relationship between GM and WMH, white matter microstructure, white matter connectivity, and multiple neurological diseases, based on GWAS data from mixed-sex cohorts without sex-stratified summary statistics. These findings highlight the potential role of GM in influencing brain structural integrity.</p>

                <p>by Giuseppe Agapito, Mario Cannataro, Pietro Cinaglia, Marianna Milano</p>

Network alignment (NA) is a computational methodology employed to compare biological networks across different species or conditions. By identifying conserved structures, functions, and interactions, NA provides invaluable insights into shared biological processes, evolutionary relationships, and system-level behaviors. This manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of NA methodologies, including the importance of preprocessing network data, selecting suitable input formats, and understanding diverse network types such as attributed, temporal, and multilayer networks. Additionally, it explores key challenges such as seed nodes selection, algorithm configuration, and cross-species alignment, emphasizing the necessity of integrating functional annotations, sequence similarity, and network topology for biologically meaningful results. Various NA strategies, including Local and Global Network Alignment, are discussed alongside their respective advantages and limitations. Practical recommendations for effectively documenting and visualizing NA experiments are also provided, ensuring reproducibility and clarity in research. By leveraging diverse alignment tools and adopting best practices, researchers can unlock the potential of NA to advance our understanding of complex biological systems.

Recent efforts by a private company to modify modern species with ancient DNA in the name of ‘de-extinction’ are both scientifically and morally suspect. A bright line requiring more than press releases as well as independent ethical oversight must be drawn before they are extended to distant human and hominid ancestors.

                <p>by John J. Wiens, Kristen E. Saban</p>

An important aspect of the current extinction crisis is the loss of distinct clades (e.g., genera). A recent study suggested that there is rapidly accelerating extinction of genera (and other higher taxa), indicating a current mass extinction event that endangers human survival. However, that study was based only on land vertebrates, which include only about half of vertebrates and <2% of living species. Here, we examine the recent extinction (last 500 years) of higher taxa across living organisms. We find that 102 genera have gone extinct (90 animals, 12 plants), along with 10 families and two orders. Yet, the majority of these genus-level extinctions were among mammals and birds, as were all extinctions of families and orders. There were very few extinctions among the thousands of genera of ray-finned fishes (<i>n</i> = 4; 0.08%), squamate reptiles (<i>n</i> = 2; 0.17%), and amphibians (<i>n</i> = 1; 0.18%). Documented extinctions were also rare among the thousands of assessed genera of arthropods (<i>n</i> = 11; 0.32%) and plants (<i>n</i> = 12; 0.17%), which together encompass most known species. Most extinct genera were monotypic (~80%), and most were island endemics (76%). Moreover, despite the claim that extinctions of higher taxa are rapidly accelerating, the highest rates of genus-level extinctions occurred more than 100 years ago, and have declined subsequently. Overall, the recent extinctions of higher taxa are not as dire as previously suggested.

                <p>by Yutong Song, Tianmu Zhang, Tae Hoon Ryu, Kyle Wong, Zekun Wu, Yanan Wei, Justine Schweizer, Khoi-Nguyen Ha Nguyen, Alex Kwan, Xiaoli Zhang, Kweon Yu, Woo Jae Kim</p>

Neuropeptide SIFamide (SIFa) neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> have been characterized by their exceptionally elaborate arborization patterns, which extend from the brain into the ventral nerve cord (VNC). SIFa neurons are equipped to receive signals that integrate both internal physiological cues and external environmental stimuli. These signals enable the neurons to regulate energy balance, sleep patterns, metabolic status, and circadian timing. These peptidergic neurons are instrumental in orchestrating the animal’s internal states and refining its behavioral responses, yet the precise molecular underpinnings of this process remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that SIFa neurons coordinate a range of behavioral responses by selectively integrating inputs and outputs in a context-dependent manner. These neurons engage in a feedback loop with sNPF neurons in the VNC, modifying behaviors such as longer mating duration (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD). Additionally, SIFa neurons interact with dopamine and glutamate to differentially regulate sleep and mating duration. Activating SIFa neurons leads to reduced mating duration and increased food intake, while deactivating them reduces food intake. Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of SIFa neurons in absorbing inputs and turning them into behavioral outputs, shedding light on animal’s intricate behavioral orchestration.

                <p>by Tianmu Zhang, Zekun Wu, Yutong Song, Tae Hoon Ryu, Xiaoli Zhang, Wenjing Li, Yanying Sun, Kyle Wong, Justine Schweizer, Khoi-Nguyen Ha Nguyen, Alex Kwan, Kweon Yu, Woo Jae Kim</p>

Neuropeptides play crucial roles in regulating context-dependent behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We investigate the role of the neuropeptide SIFa and its receptor SIFaR in regulating two distinct mating duration behaviors in male <i>Drosophila</i>: Longer-Mating-Duration (LMD) and Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD). We found that SIFaR expression in specific neurons is required for both LMD and SMD behaviors. Social context and sexual experience lead to synaptic reorganization between SIFa and SIFaR neurons, altering internal states of brain. We revealed that the SIFa-SIFaR/Crz-CrzR neuropeptide relay pathway is essential for generating distinct interval timing behaviors, with Crz neurons being responsive to the activity of SIFa neurons. Additionally, CrzR expression in glial cell population is critical for regulating LMD behavior. Our study provides insights into how neuropeptides and their receptors modulate context-dependent behaviors through synaptic plasticity and calcium signaling, with implications for understanding the neural circuitry underlying interval timing and neuropeptidergic system modulation of behavioral adaptations.

                <p>by Stephen Thomas, Ayatollah S. El-Zayat, James Gurney, Jennifer Rattray, Sam P. Brown</p>

Bacterial quorum sensing is often mediated by multiple signaling systems that interact with each other. The quorum-sensing systems of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> for example, are considered hierarchical, with the <i>las</i> system acting as a master regulator. By experimentally controlling the concentration of auto-inducer signals in a signal deficient strain (PAO1Δ<i>lasI</i>Δ<i>rhlI</i>), we show that the two primary quorum-sensing systems—<i>las</i> and <i>rhl</i>—act reciprocally rather than hierarchically. Just as the <i>las</i> system’s 3‑oxo‑C<sub>12</sub>‑HSL can induce increased expression of <i>rhlI,</i> the <i>rhl</i> system’s C<sub>4</sub>‑HSL increases the expression level of <i>lasI.</i> We develop a mathematical model to quantify relationships both within and between the <i>las</i> and <i>rhl</i> quorum-sensing systems and the downstream genes they influence. The results show that not only do the systems interact in a reciprocal manner, but they do so asymmetrically, cooperatively, and nonlinearly, with the combination of C<sub>4</sub>‑HSL and 3‑oxo‑C<sub>12</sub>‑HSL increasing expression level far more than the sum of their individual effects. We next extend our parameterized mathematical model to generate quantitative predictions on how a QS-controlled effector gene (<i>lasB</i>) responds to changes in wildtype bacterial stationary phase density and find close quantitative agreement with an independent dataset. Finally, we use our parameterized model to assess how changes in multi-signal interactions modulate functional responses to variation in social (population density) and physical (mass transfer) environment and demonstrate that a reciprocal architecture is more responsive to density and more robust to mass transfer than a strict hierarchy.

                Nico U.F. Dosenbach and Roselyne Chauvin spoke with Cell Reports about their recent paper, in which they observed subcortical plasticity in humans following a 2-week arm/hand-casting paradigm with daily brain fMRIs. They discuss the surprising findings and challenges of their work, how they developed a passion for studying the human brain, and their experience publishing with Cell Reports.

                Harbers et al. demonstrate that female marmosets carrying heterozygous FMR1 mutations exhibit phenotypes resembling those of patients with fragile X syndrome, establishing a non-human primate model for the disorder. This distinct model provides a valuable resource for studying pathophysiology and evaluating therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97514">Spatial integration of sensory input and motor output in Pseudomonas aeruginosa chemotaxis through colocalized distribution</a></h4>

              
                The opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> serves as a model organism for studying multiple signal transduction pathways. The chemoreceptor cluster, a core component of the chemotaxis pathway, is assembled from hundreds of proteins. The unipolar distribution of receptor clusters has long been recognized, yet the precise mechanism governing their assembly remains elusive. Here, we directly observed the relative positions of the flagellar motor and chemoreceptor cluster using flagellar filament labeling and gene editing techniques. Surprisingly, we found that both are located at the same cell pole, with the distribution pattern controlled by the polar anchor protein FlhF. Additionally, the efficient assembly of the chemoreceptor cluster is partially dependent on the integrity of the motor structure. Furthermore, we discovered that overexpression of the chemotaxis regulatory protein CheY leads to high intracellular levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP, triggering cell aggregation. Therefore, the colocalization of the chemoreceptor cluster and flagellum in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> serves to avoid cross-pathway signaling interference, enabling cells to conduct various physiological activities in an orderly manner.

                Explorations in the Dinaledi Subsystem of the Rising Star cave system have yielded some of the earliest evidence of a mortuary practice in hominins. Because the evidence is attributable to the small-brained <i>Homo naledi</i>, these analyses call into question several assumptions about behavioral and cognitive evolution in Pleistocene hominins. The evidence from the Dinaledi Subsystem, and at other locations across the Rising Star cave system may widen the phylogenetic breadth of mortuary, and possibly funerary, behaviors. These discoveries may also associate the creation of meaning-making and increased behavioral complexity with a small-brained hominin species, challenging certain assertions about the role of encephalization and cognition in hominin and human evolution. We suggest that the hominin socio-cognitive niche is more diverse than previously thought. If true, technological, meaning-making activities, and cognitive advances in human evolution are not associated solely with the evolution of larger-brained members of the genus <i>Homo</i>.Evidence for complex behaviors associated with a small-brained hominin suggests that large brains are not solely responsible for the manifestation of human-like behavioral complexity.

                Human and murine studies reveal that innate immune cells are able to mount enhanced responses to pathogens after primary inflammatory exposure. Innate immune memory has been shown to last for months to years, longer than the lifespan of most innate immune cells. Indeed, long-lived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) serve as a cellular reservoir for innate immune memory. In this review, we summarize the evidence that innate immune memory is epigenetically encoded in HSPCs, and we consider whether HSPC subpopulations with differentiation bias, cell autonomous epigenetic reprogramming, or both features underlie the phenomenon of central trained immunity. We further profile the significant implications of central trained immunity in stem cell transplant, aging, inflammatory diseases, and vaccination strategies for the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104465">Newly discovered and conserved role of IgM against viral infection in an early vertebrate</a></h4>

              
                IgM emerged in jawed vertebrates 500 Mya and remains the most evolutionarily conserved antibody class. However, despite extensive studies on IgM as an ancient antiviral weapon in warm-blooded vertebrates, its role and mechanisms in combating viral infections in early vertebrates remain poorly understood. Here, significant virus-specific sIgM titers are generated in the serum and gut mucus of a teleost fish (largemouth bass) that survive infection, and fish lacking sIgM were more susceptible to viral infection. These results challenge the paradigm that IgM and IgT are specialized to systemic and mucosal immunity, respectively. More crucially, the neutralization assay provides further insight into the role of sIgM in viral neutralization and clarifies the mechanism through which teleost sIgM blocks viral infection by directly targeting viral particles. From an evolutionary perspective, sIgM in both primitive and modern vertebrates follows conserved principles in the development of specialized antiviral immunity.

">Hypothalamic recurrent inhibition regulates functional states of stress effector neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Stress triggers rapid and reversible shifts in vital physiological functions from homeostatic operation to emergency response. However, the neural mechanisms regulating such functional stress states remain poorly understood. Here we identify a novel recurrent inhibitory circuit governing functional states of key stress regulatory neurons: corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Microendoscopic calcium imaging in freely behaving mice revealed synchronized low-activity state at baselines and a reversible high-activity state during mild stress. Ensemble analysis indicated increased dimensionality of network dynamics during high-activity state. Computational modeling of calcium ensemble data, together with independent modeling of single-unit CRHPVN neurons spiking dynamics, converged to show that recurrent inhibition is a key circuit motif for stress-induced functional state transitions. Guided by model predictions, chemogenetic manipulations of PVN-projecting GABAergic neurons revealed their roles in constraining CRHPVN neurons to low-activity state at baselines via a prolonged feedback inhibition. Unexpectedly, slow CRHergic excitation was dispensable for driving this prolonged feedback, whereas glutamatergic transmission predominated at CRHPVN[-&gt;]PVN[-&gt;]GABA excitatory synapses. Incorporating these findings, we refined our computational model to include fast excitation and slow inhibition, yielding new predictions for circuit operation. Together, our results establish recurrent inhibition as a fundamental circuit motif controlling CRHPVN neurons functional states and highlight the value of iterative experiment-model integration in advancing understanding of neural circuits functions.

">Time-adaptive modulation of evidence evaluation in rat posterior parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                A crucial component of successful decision making is determining the optimal timescale over which to evaluate evidence. For example, when detecting transient changes in the environment, it is best to focus evaluation on the current evidence as opposed to older evidence. However, it is unclear how this adjustment in timescale is achieved in the brain in terms of how the neurons that process evidence adjust their dynamics. To address this question, we used Neuropixel probes to record spiking activity from neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of rats performing a free-response auditory change detection task in which subjects evaluate sensory evidence over short timescales to determine when a change occurs in a noisy sensory stream. Consistent with longer timescale temporal integration tasks, we found that PPC neurons modulated their activity by the strength of evidence leading to decisions, were selective for the rats choices, and had opposing populations of neurons that were positively versus negatively modulated by evidence. However, in contrast to temporal integration tasks, responses of neurons to individual pulses of evidence were transient, such that the effect of the evidence on activity tapered off over a timescale corresponding to the subjects behavioral timescale of evidence evaluation. Intriguingly, PPC also exhibited "gain changes" in the influence of evidence as a function of decision time that were consistent with changes in behavioral urgency. In addition, reversible inactivation revealed an important role for PPC in this auditory change detection, such that PPC inactivation altered choice behavior and the timescale over which rats evaluated evidence. Together, our results suggest important contributions of PPC to free-response decisions that involve adjusting timescales of evidence evaluation.

">Epigenomic regulation of human oligodendrocyte myelination properties, relation to age and lineage</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by immune-mediated injury to myelin and oligodendrocytes (OLs). Repair depends on the ability of OL lineage cells to form new myelin and ensheathe axons. We previously showed that late progenitors (O4+A2B5+ cells) and mature human OLs exhibit age-related differences in ensheathment capacity and vulnerability to injury. Here, we test the hypothesis that differences in chromatin accessibility and specific histone marks may underlie transcriptional differences linked to these functional responses. Confocal imaging of cultured cells revealed higher levels of the transcriptionally permissive histone marks H3K27ac and H4K8ac in pediatric than adult derived late progenitors and mature OLs. Levels were higher in adult-derived progenitors versus mature cells from the same individuals. The majority of pathways and genes related to myelination and immune interactions were downregulated in adult cell samples when compared to pediatric samples. Analysis of publicly available datasets indicated that the chromatin accessibility for genes within these categories was more restricted in adult than pediatric OLs. There was less chromatin accessibility and lower H3K27ac chromatin occupancy also in more differentiated OL compared to progenitors. The levels of the transcriptionally repressive H3K27me3 histone mark in mature OLs were enriched in genomic regions encoding for transcriptional inhibitors of myelination and related signaling pathways, as compared to early progenitors. Restrictions in chromatin accessibility were more pronounced in human cells than in mouse cells. These results link the myelination capacity and immune-mediated injury susceptibility of human OLs to their epigenomic state, raising the issue of how epigenetic modulation could influence disease progression.

">A developmental transition from early neural hyperexcitability in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Early brain development is characterized by plastic phases that play a crucial role in the establishment of functional connectivity. However, this plasticity also renders the developing brain highly sensitive to perturbations. The dynamics of the transition of the immature brain from a hyperexcitable state to a relatively stable network remains poorly understood. Using a combination of brain-wide activity mapping, behavioural and molecular analysis in response to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a GABAA receptor antagonist, we assessed neural hyperexcitability at different developmental stages in larval zebrafish and observed a distinct age-dependent trajectory. Specifically, we observed that early stages (4-6 dpf) exhibited high susceptibility to external perturbations, whereas by 9 dpf, both neural activity and behavioral responses were markedly attenuated. Further, upon chronic insult, rather than a cumulative increase in excitability, early life hyperexcitation events rendered the larvae resistant to subsequent induction. Put together, our work maps the temporal transition of the vertebrate brain from a state of hyperexcitability to a phase of relative resistance and has potential implications on understanding the progression of neurological conditions in the pediatric population.

">Grid cells encode reward distance during path integration in cue-rich environments</a></h4>

              
                The medial entorhinal cortex supports both path integration and landmark anchoring, but how these computations interact during goal-directed navigation is unclear. We show that grid cells dissociate from landmarks and instead encode reward distance when mice perform a path integration task on a cue-rich treadmill. Grid cell population activity reset at rewards and shifted coherently across trials, consistent with continuous attractor dynamics realigned by rewards. Furthermore, grid cells exhibited reduced spatial scales, broadened theta frequency distributions, and altered temporal coordination. These phenomena were captured by a theta interference model incorporating cell competition and two sets of theta oscillating inputs whose frequencies shifted apart. Switching to cue-based navigation stabilized the firing fields and partially restored grid scale, theta frequencies and temporal structure. These results demonstrate that MEC circuits flexibly reset to encode goal-directed trajectories, and suggest that continuous attractor and interference mechanisms normally cooperate but can decouple under path integration demands.

">Direct Evidence for Dendritic Spine Compensation and Regeneration in Alzheimer Disease Models</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spine loss in Alzheimer disease (AD) strongly correlates with cognitive decline, whereas spine preservation is associated to cognitive resilience. Yet, whether and how neurons compensate for spine loss in AD remains largely unknown. Using a chromophore-assisted light inactivation approach (CALI), we developed a tool to selectively eliminate dendritic spines to model this key feature of AD. Using in vivo and in vitro two-photon imaging, we discovered that the artificial elimination of spines triggers a two-stage compensatory response: rapid enlargement of remaining spines followed by delayed spine regeneration. Remarkably, similar structural plasticity was observed across multiple Amyloid beta-driven models of synapse loss, including the APP/PS1 mouse and following intracortical delivery of oligomeric Amyloid beta. Mechanistically, compensatory spine enlargement required NMDA receptor activation and de novo protein synthesis. These findings suggest that neurons retain an intrinsic capacity to reverse early synaptic loss in AD, potentially contributing to cognitive resilience

">Comparative analysis of RAN translation from CAG repeats within the Huntingtin coding sequence</a></h4>

              
                Repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation is a non-canonical initiation event that occurs in the absence of a start codon in repeat expansion disorders, generating aggregation-prone proteins which may contribute to pathogenicity. The mechanism by which repeats trigger RAN translation is not completely understood, with most prior work focused on how repeats might elicit initiation when placed within a 5 leader in reporter plasmids. However, RAN translation is also reported to generate out-of-frame proteins in Huntington disease (HD), where a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT) resides within the coding sequence of the gene. To explore this process, we generated a series of RAN translation-specific reporter constructs that include the 5 leader and first exon of HTT and compared their translation to CGG and GGGGCC repeats. CAG repeats support RAN translation in both the alanine (GCA) and glutamine (CAG) frames in both the presence and absence of upstream start codons or near-AUG cognate codons. HTT RAN translation in the alanine frame is comparable in efficiency to polyalanine RAN translation from CGG repeats and exhibits cap-dependence and selective enhancement by activation of the integrated stress response. Importantly, this translation was readily detectable from in vitro transcribed RNAs transfected into neurons or cellular lysates, suggesting that plasmid based aberrant splicing into CAG repeats does not explain the observed phenomena. CAG repeats in the context of HTT exon 1 elicit neuronal toxicity in the absence of any AUG initiation codons. Taken together, these data suggest that RAN translation shares key mechanistic parameters across different repeat sequences and surrounding RNA contexts with implications for therapy development.

                Sensory over-responsivity (SOR), characterized by strong negative reactions to typically innocuous stimuli, is considered a symptom of autism spectrum disorder. However, SOR also affects 15-20% of children overall, including a majority of children with common psychiatric conditions. Despite its prevalence, the clinical specificity and neurobiological bases of SOR remain poorly understood. Our study aims to determine the specific clinical significance of SOR across diverse child samples and establish whether SOR is associated with distinct patterns of functional connectivity (FC). We analyzed data from 15,728 children (ages 6-17.9 years) across five datasets: three community samples, including the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] and Healthy Brain Network [HBN] studies, and two autism-enriched samples. Bivariate and multivariate models examined associations between SOR and symptoms of anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder, as well as autistic traits. Analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from the ABCD study tested brain-wide and circuit-specific FC correlates of mild SOR, replication of effects in an independent ABCD subsample, as well as extension to severe SOR in ABCD and to SOR in the HBN sample. Multivariate analyses revealed that SOR is associated with a remarkably consistent transdiagnostic profile: greater levels of both autistic traits and anxiety symptoms and, in community samples, lower levels of conduct disorder symptoms. Across samples, SOR is not reliably associated with symptoms of any other analyzed psychiatric conditions. Resting state fMRI analyses reveal that SOR is associated with both brain-wide and circuit-specific functional connectivity (FC) patterns in networks related to tactile processing (somatomotor-hippocampal) and error detection (cingulo opercular-ventral diencephalon) that replicate in independent subsamples. Our results demonstrate that SOR may constitute a transdiagnostic latent trait with both specific clinical risk and protection, and with replicable neural correlates that implicate specific cortico-subcortical circuits. These findings advance our understanding of the neurobiology and clinical relevance of SOR. They may also inform clinical practice and future research aimed at understanding and supporting individuals with sensory challenges.

                Gephyrin is the principal scaffolding protein of inhibitory postsynaptic densities, clustering glycine and GABAA receptors via multivalent interactions. It features structured N and C terminal domains connected by an intrinsically disordered linker. Although the structural and functional properties of its terminal domains are well characterized, the mechanism by which full-length gephyrin organizes into higher-order complexes remains unresolved. Here, we combine biochemical reconstitution, cryo-electron microscopy, and mutational analyses to elucidate the structural logic of gephyrin oligomerization. We demonstrate that gephyrin adopts a stable dimeric assembly which constitutes the basic unit for both linear and oblique tetramers as well as linear hexameric arrangements. High resolution structures reveal a critical segment of the flexible linker that adopts two distinct conformations, one of which occludes the receptor-binding site. This segment harbors key phosphorylation sites, providing a mechanistic link between structural conformation and regulatory control. Our findings redefine the architecture of inhibitory synapses and reconcile gephyrin oligomerization models with published in-situ post-synaptic densities characterized by cryo-electron tomography.

                INTRODUCTION: Deficits in Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep facilitate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Enhancing GABAergic signaling can restore sleep. Unbiased computational analysis identified zolpidem as high-affinity GABA receptor modulator facilitating chloride transport that could slow AD. METHODS: Zolpidem's effects on sleep and Alzheimer's progression were evaluated in young APP/PS1 mice. Sleep was monitored with EEG/EMG telemetry. Widefield imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes was used to track sleep-dependent brain rhythms. Multiphoton microscopy allowed assessments of amyloid plaque load and basal neuronal calcium levels. Behavioral assays were used to measure memory and cognitive function. RESULTS: Zolpidem restored NREM sleep and rescued sleep-dependent brain rhythm, slow oscillation. Zolpidem administration reduced cortical amyloid plaque burden, mitigated neuronal calcium overload, and enhanced sleep-dependent memory consolidation without adverse effects on locomotion. DISCUSSION: Zolpidem effectively slowed Alzheimer's progression in young APP/PS1 mice. This supports zolpidem's therapeutic promise as an intervention strategy at early stages of AD.

">Satiation is associated with OGT-dependent regulation of excitatory synapses.</a></h4>

              
                Satiation is essential for energy homeostasis and is dysregulated in metabolic disorders like obesity and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. While satiation engages a large neural network across brain regions, how the communication within this network depends on metabolic fluctuations is unclear. This study shows that nutrient access can affect neuron-to-neuron communication in this network by regulating excitatory synaptic plasticity through O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in CaMKII satiation neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Using cell-specific knockout mice and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that OGT deletion in PVNCaMKII neurons increases input resistance and neuronal excitability while preserving basic membrane electrical properties. Strikingly, feeding triggered a robust 3.8-fold increase in the excitatory synaptic input in wild-type neurons, whereas OGT-knockout neurons failed to exhibit this feeding-induced synaptic activation, instead displayed a paradoxical trend towards increases in synaptic activity during hungry conditions. Furthermore, OGT deletion destabilized glucose-dependent synaptic responses, with knockout neurons displaying maladaptive depression of excitatory transmission in conditions where stability is normally preserved. These findings establish OGT as a nutrient-sensitive modulator of synaptic plasticity that ensures appropriate satiation signalling by coupling metabolic state to synaptic plasticity.

">Early endothelial activation at the blood-nerve barrier defines a hallmark of ALS</a></h4>

              
                Vascular defects are common in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The prevailing view is that breakdown of the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers contributes to neurodegeneration. Here, we reveal that selective and early vulnerability of peripheral nerve endothelium --manifested as endothelial cell activation and interlinked blood-nerve barrier dysfunction-- constitutes a core feature of ALS pathogenesis, arising before vascular alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) and motor neuron pathology. Vascular changes in ALS patients have been largely studied in postmortem samples, limiting insight into their onset, causes, and pathogenic role. Surveying diagnostic motor nerve samples from ALS patients across clinical stages, we observed endothelial damage that preceded axonal loss and demyelination, marking vascular dysfunction as an early disease event. Similar ultrastructural abnormalities were detected in pre-symptomatic ALS mouse models (SOD1 and TARDBP mutants). Notably, endothelial cells became dysfunctional even when not carrying mutant TDP-43, indicating they respond to non-cell autonomous disease signals. Transcriptional, histological, and functional analyses revealed that these alterations were largely confined to peripheral nerves, while spinal cord vessels exhibited delayed and more focal changes. Single-cell sequencing identified ALS-susceptible endothelial cell subsets prone to a pro-inflammatory phenotype and impaired blood-nerve barrier function, increasing permeability via the transcellular route. These changes coincided with reactivity of nerve-resident macrophages and neutrophil infiltration. Neutrophil depletion attenuated endothelial activation and barrier leakiness, mitigating axonopathy in ALS mice. Our work unmasks the greater susceptibility of the peripheral nerve vasculature in ALS relative to the CNS. The early activation of peripheral nerve endothelium, combined with its potential reversibility, identifies a therapeutic window and suggests strategies for targeting the vascular-immune axis to protect the motor system.

">IRF8 deficiency causes anxiety-like behavior in a sex-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety disorder is a serious psychiatric disease that affects women twice more than men and disrupts patients' daily lives. It is often comorbid with major depression and other mental diseases. Various underlying mechanisms have been proposed, such as neurotransmitters and neuroanatomical disruptions, and more recently, oxidative stress; however, much remained unclear, including the role of glial cells. Here, we investigated the role of IRF8 in anxiety disorders in the mouse model. IRF8 is a transcription factor expressed primarily in microglia in the brain. A battery of behavioral tests revealed that female IRF8 knockout (IRF8KO) mice show increased anxiety relative to male IRF8KO and wild-type mice. Female IRF8KO mice also exhibited a higher tendency for obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, these behavioral abnormalities were not observed when IRF8 was deleted postnatally, indicating that it acts during the fetal stage to control anxiety. Transcriptome analysis revealed that IRF8 deficiency leads to redox dysregulation. Further, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) staining for microglia demonstrated that female IRF8KO microglia produce higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to WT and male IRF8KO counterparts. Detailed RNA-seq analysis, however, did not reveal specific genes that cause high ROS production in female cells. In sum, this work demonstrates that IRF8 in microglia plays a major role in controlling anxiety in a sex dependent manner.

">Neuromedin U Receptor 2 orchestrates sleep continuity and circadian entrainment</a></h4>

              
                Neuromedin S signaling has recently been identified as a modulator of both sleep and circadian rhythms in the central nervous systems of mammals. Nevertheless, the involvement of its preferred receptor, NMUR2, in sleep and circadian regulation remains elusive. Here, employing its only selective antagonist R-PSOP, we demonstrate that NMUR2 function in the mouse brain is essential for physiological sleep architecture under baseline conditions, as well as for responses to homeostatic and circadian challenges. Using a combination of pharmacological, neuronal tagging, brain clearing and chemogenetic tools, we identified and functionally validated a group of PVH neurons as one of the targets mediating the effect of R-PSOP on sleep. These findings establish NMUR2 as a potential therapeutic target for the integral treatment of sleep and circadian neurological disorders.

">Personalized real-time inference of momentary excitability from human EEG</a></h4>

              
                The efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often limited by non-adaptive protocols that disregard instantaneous brain states, potentially constraining therapeutic outcomes. Current EEG-guided approaches are hindered by their reliance on motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), which confound cortical and spinal excitability and restrict applications to the motor cortex, and a dependence on static biomarkers that cannot adapt to changing neurophysiological patterns. We introduce PRIME (Personalized Real-time Inference of Momentary Excitability), a deep learning framework that predicts cortical excitability, quantified by TMS-evoked potential (TEP) amplitude, from raw EEG signals. By targeting cortical excitability directly, PRIME enables brain state-dependent stimulation across any cortical region. PRIME incorporates transfer learning and continual adaptation to automatically identify personalized biomarkers, allowing stimulation timing to be adapted across individuals and sessions. PRIME successfully predicts cortical excitability with minimal latency, providing a computational foundation for next-generation, personalized closed-loop TMS interventions.

">Multiomic profiling reveals aberrant immunomodulatory signature in β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration patient iPSC-derived microglia</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis. In common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD), early and sustained microglial activation has been shown to precede neuronal loss, with elevated levels of microglia-derived inflammatory mediators detected in affected brain regions. In contrast, little is known about the role of microglia in rare neurodegenerative disorders. One such disorder is {beta}-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), a common subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). BPAN shares pathological features with PD, including iron accumulation and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and is caused by mutations in the WD repeat domain 45 (WDR45) gene encoding an autophagy protein also called WIPI4. However, the pathological role of mutant WDR45 in BPAN and the possible contribution of microglia remain unresolved. We generated the first BPAN patient microglia model system using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to identify immune-related alterations and immunomodulatory signaling changes in a disease-relevant context. Integrated transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of iPSC-derived microglia from BPAN patients revealed a consistent shift from a homeostatic to a reactive, disease-associated state. Transcriptomic analysis showed disruption of core microglial pathways, including immune activation, stress response, and autophagy, consistent with a chronic pro-inflammatory phenotype. Complementary secretome analysis identified impaired lysosomal function and increased antigen presentation pathways, further supporting persistent microglial activation. Together this suggests that dysfunctional microglial states may contribute to BPAN pathogenesis. Our findings lay the groundwork for advancing immunomodulatory research in BPAN and may open new avenues for therapeutic development targeting microglial dysfunction.

">Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling of Concurrent and Prospective Substance Use in Adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural mechanisms of adolescent substance use is a critical public health issue, with direct implications for bolstering prevention and treatment strategies. Yet this effort is challenging because substance use is multi-faceted, commonly used brain network features are not optimized to capture both local and global aspects of intrinsic connectivity, and because the facets themselves sensitive to developmental shifts. In this study, we operationalized adolescent substance use along three dimensions--intent, access, and family-developmental history--and trained predictive models of each facet using resting-state connectivity. Trait impulsivity, a known risk factor, was also examined. Using Baseline and 2 Year Follow-Up data from the ABCD Bids Community Collection (ABCC), we found that prediction was more successful at follow-up than baseline. At baseline, predictive accuracy was modest and intent to use substances was the most accurately predicted facet. Prediction accuracies at follow-up were much higher, with access and family-developmental history being better predicted, signaling a developmental shift in the brain-behavior mapping of substance use vulnerabilities. These findings suggest that the neurobiological correlates of substance are dynamic across adolescence, possibly reflecting changing phenotype. More broadly, these results underscore the importance of modeling distinct substance use facets and accounting for developmental timing to understand risk trajectories, while contributing to a growing literature that shows early-developing individual differences are predictive of later outcomes.

">Output-Contingent Working Memory and Decision-Making in Economic Choices</a></h4>

              
                In daily life, economic decisions often unfold sequentially. The brain is thought to compute the subjective value of each option, and comparisons can occur in different reference frames, for example, based on the commodity or presentation order. While primate prefrontal recordings have identified various reference frames for economic choice, it remains unclear how distinct neural mechanisms support them even in similar tasks. To address this, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on two sequential economic decision-making tasks differing only in output contingencies. Analysis of RNN activity, combined with latent connectivity inference, revealed distinct regimes: commodity-based choices with attractor dynamics and order-based choices with rotational dynamics. Moreover, value and choice representations in the order-based tasks aligned with neural data from a novel experiment where reference frames were not explicitly constrained. Our results suggest that different reference frames emerge depending on task demands and engage distinct working memory and decision-making mechanisms.

">Fear, anxiety, and the extended amygdala- Absence of evidence for strict functional segregation</a></h4>

              
                Since the time of Freud, the distinction between fear and anxiety has been a hallmark of influential models of emotion and emotional illness, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. Fear and anxiety disorders are a leading cause of human misery and morbidity. Existing treatments are inconsistently effective, underscoring the importance of developing accurate models of the underlying neurobiology. Although there is agreement that the extended amygdala (EA) plays a central role in orchestrating responses to threat, the respective contributions of its two major subdivisions- the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST)- remain contentious. To help adjudicate this debate, we performed a harmonized mega-analysis of fMRI data acquired from 295 adults as they completed a well-established threat-anticipation paradigm. Contrary to popular double-dissociation models, results demonstrated that the Ce responds to temporally uncertain threat and the BST responds to certain threat. In direct comparisons, the two regions showed statistically indistinguishable responses, with strong Bayesian evidence of regional equivalence. These observations underscore the need to reformulate conceptual models that posit a strict segregation of temporally certain and uncertain threat processing in the EA.

">Inhibited oligodendrogenesis, but not repeated mild traumatic brain injury, impairs attention in adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Attention problems are among the most common long-lasting cognitive symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and as attention is fundamental to many aspects of cognition, the effects of attentional impairment can be broad. The brain's white matter is particularly vulnerable to damage during mTBI. Damage to oligodendrocytes and myelin contributes to cognitive deficits following injury and myelin plasticity is a potential mechanism for functional recovery. The aim of this work was to assess attentional impairment following mTBI in mice and evaluate the role of newly generated oligodendrocytes in recovery. This study used the Myrf conditional knockout mouse model, in which the Myrf gene, required for oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, is deleted from OPCs following tamoxifen injection, thereby halting oligodendrogenesis. Mice were trained on the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time (5-CSRT) task before receiving tamoxifen followed by three mTBI or sham procedures. Attention was probed on the 5-CSRT with decreasing stimulus durations at four time points following injury out to 12 weeks. While no attentional impairment was observed in mice with mTBI, OPC-MyrfKO mice showed lower choice accuracy ({beta} = -2.85%, p = 0.03) and more omitted trials ({beta} = 4.09%, p = 0.02) across injury groups, time points and stimulus durations, suggesting that active oligodendrogenesis is required for sustained attention. These results suggest that this mouse model of mTBI was not severe enough to impact attention as measured by the 5-CSRT task, however myelin plasticity in adulthood may contribute to attention and complex task performance.

">Update on the reproduction and interpretation of DIANA fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Three years ago, our group reported direct imaging of neuronal activity (DIANA) with high spatiotemporal resolution, but its reproducibility and signal origin remain controversial. Here, we report the results of our reproduction experiments of DIANA fMRI performed to date using forelimb electrical stimulation at various magnetic field strengths in anesthetized mice, along with the characteristics of DIANA signal, called the pseudo-steady state (PSS). Theoretical analysis and Bloch simulations demonstrated that the spatial location and temporal phase of PSS oscillations are primarily determined by frequency-offset, and that their spatiotemporal superposition can generate peak signals in specific regions at specific timing that closely resemble DIANA signals. These findings suggest that if PSS oscillations are the primary source of DIANA signals, it may be premature to interpret them as neuronal responses to sensory stimulation. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between DIANA signals and brain activation.

">Glial plasticity and metabolic stability after knockdown of astrocytic Cx43 in the dorsal vagal complex</a></h4>

              
                Obesity affects well over 890 million people worldwide and causes millions of deaths each year due to metabolic complications, making it a major public health challenge. It results from a chronic imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. This balance is regulated by the central nervous system, primarily by the hypothalamus and the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). The latter integrates metabolic signals from energy stores and gastrointestinal tract and coordinates autonomic responses. While historically overshadowed by a focus on neurons, the role of glial cells in regulating energy balance is now well established. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a well-known protein expressed by astrocytes, playing a key role in glial and neuroglial communication. We previously demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels (HCs) in the hypothalamus and the DVC led to anorexia in mice, accompanied by neuronal activation in both regions. To further investigate the role of astrocytic Cx43 within the DVC, where its expression is remarkably high, we developed a mouse model in which Cx43 expression is specifically reduced in DVC astrocytes using an RNA interference approach. The metabolic profile of these animals was assessed under standard feeding conditions as well as under a high-fat, high-sugar diet. Although reduced Cx43 expression led to modified glial (astrocytes and microglia) morphology and phenotype within the DVC, our analyses did not reveal significant changes in the animal's metabolic phenotype. This result is surprising, given the high expression of Cx43 in the DVC and the anorexigenic effect observed with pharmacological HC inhibition. These observations raise crucial questions, about potential compensatory mechanisms involving other cell types and/or alternative neuron-glia communication pathways, as well as the DVC's ability to maintain robust control of energy homeostasis.

">Functional imaging of hippocampal layers using VASO and BOLD on the Next Generation (NexGen) 7T Scanner</a></h4>

              
                Spatial accuracy and venous biases are a central concern in mesoscale fMRI, with subcortical brain regions facing additional challenges due to lower contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), high physiological noise, and complicated vasculature. Here, we optimized CBV VASO on the NexGen 7T scanner for layer-specific investigations of the hippocampus. The presence of venous biases in VASO and BOLD (from the same acquisition) was then compared by using an established autobiographical memory task. While VASO and BOLD based activation patterns converged at macroscale, layer-specific differences emerged in the hippocampal subiculum, consistent with venous bias in the inner layers of the subiculum which can be explained by the unique two-sided venous drainage. Further, both VASO and BOLD showed sensitivity to short blocks (elaboration > construction), revealing an anterior-posterior distinction consistent with stronger involvement of the posterior hippocampus. Hippocampal cortical connectivity revealed brain circuitry between subcortical and cortical regions. Thus, hippocampal fMRI allows mapping layer function with high accuracy, made possible by sequence timing optimization on the high performance NexGen 7T scanner. The improved MR imaging has been developed to enable precision mapping of subcortical brain gray matter. By capturing changes of neural information flow within and across the microcircuitry of the hippocampus, it can provide deeper insights into a number of neuropsychological phenomena and the early changes occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

                <p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the <f></f> foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only <f></f> away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~<f></f> away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>

                <p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>

                <p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>

                <p>GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs) are an important building block in neural activity. Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>

                <p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/36/e2119242025?rss=1">Uncovering the Role of the Human Hippocampus in Procedural Motor Learning: Insights from Implicit Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent evidence suggests that the human hippocampus, traditionally associated with declarative memory, plays a role in motor sequence learning (MSL). However, the classic MSL paradigm depends initially on declarative learning. Thus, it is critical to discern whether the participation of the hippocampus relates to its canonical role or to processing a general aspect of learning that transcends the declarative/non-declarative distinction. To address this issue, here we turned to visuomotor adaptation (VMA)&mdash;a type of motor learning involving skill recalibration&mdash;which unlike MSL can be easily manipulated to eliminate the explicit component. We examined the broader involvement of the hippocampus in procedural motor learning by using diffusion MRI in a sample of males and females to assess structural plasticity associated with memory consolidation in VMA and an implicit-only version (IVMA). We found that both VMA and IVMA engaged the left posterior hippocampus in a learning-specific manner. Remarkably, while VMA induced only transient hippocampal alterations, IVMA elicited structural changes that persisted overnight, underscoring the reliance on implicit learning for enduring neuroplasticity. As expected, training on both tasks impacted the microstructure of the cerebellum and the motor and posterior parietal cortex. Notably, the temporal dynamics of changes in these regions paralleled those of the left hippocampus, suggesting that motor and limbic regions operate together as part of the same network. Collectively, our findings support an active role of the hippocampus in implicit motor learning and argue for a unified function in memory encoding regardless of the declarative or non-declarative nature of the task.</p>

                <p>The insular cortex is involved in a wide range of auditory functions in the mammalian brain. We studied the organization and basic response properties of auditory neurons in the insular cortex and adjacent areas by recording responses to sound stimuli in anesthetized female rats. Auditory neurons were present in an insulo-parietal auditory field that spans the boundary between the posterior insula, particularly in the granular insular cortex, and the ventral part of the adjacent nonprimary somatosensory fields. Confirming previous reports, neurons in this field had narrow tuning and were preferentially tuned to relatively low frequencies (&lt;16&nbsp;kHz). Intriguingly, auditory units in this field displayed shorter minimal latencies than units in the primary auditory cortex, as well as weaker sensitivity to deviance. These results establish the existence of a rapid auditory information stream with distinct properties through the insulo-parietal cortex that may parallel the pathway through the primary and anterior auditory fields.</p>

                <p>Prosocial behaviors are crucial for maintaining primates' complex social relationships. As central regions involved in social decision-making, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) processes social salience and value, while the gyrus of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACCg) integrates social information to guide decision-making. Oxytocin, a key modulator of social behavior, can influence both prosocial behavior and neural activity in these regions, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated oxytocin's effects on prosocial behavior and neural activity by infusing oxytocin or saline into the BLA (Oxt-BLA, Sal-BLA) and examining the effects of Oxt-BLA on prosocial decisions, BLA and ACCg neural activity, and the coordination between the two regions in male rhesus macaques. We found that Oxt-BLA's behavioral effects were state-dependent: during high prosocial states, it sustained prosocial choices and task engagement, counteracting the natural decline seen in the control condition. However, during low prosocial states, Oxt-BLA had minimal behavioral effects. At the neural level, Oxt-BLA enhanced BLA and ACCg activity for prosocial choices only during high prosocial states. Importantly, Oxt-BLA maintained stable BLA&ndash;ACCg coordination during high prosocial states, preventing the decline in communication observed in control conditions. These findings demonstrate that oxytocin's ability to sustain prosocial behavior depends on social motivational state. These results support that oxytocin processing in the BLA acts as a state-dependent neuromodulator that enhances BLA and ACCg neural responses and maintains BLA&ndash;ACCg communication to guide prosocial decisions.</p>

                <p>Current research strives to investigate cognitive processes under natural conditions. Virtual reality and EEG are promising techniques combining naturalistic settings with close experimental control. However, many questions and technical challenges remain, e.g., are saccade onsets a suitable replacement of fixation onsets as key events in continuous gaze trajectories (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Amme et al., 2024</cross-ref>), and consequently, can VR capture differences across different stimulus categories associated with varying saccade durations? To address both questions, we investigate the N170 face effect in humans (14 males, 19 females, zero diverse) using a free-viewing and free-movement immersive VR study that contained houses, various background stimuli, and, notably, static and moving pedestrians to study face perception under naturalistic conditions. Our results show that aligning trials to saccade onsets leads to more well-defined ERPs than fixation onsets, especially for the P100 component, demonstrating that saccade-onset ERPs are a better-suited analysis method for this type of experiment. Furthermore, we observe an evolution of category-based differences, i.e., face versus background saccade-onset ERPs, compatible with previous reports but extending in a large temporal window and including all electrode sites at different points in time. In summary, employing VR, EEG, and eye-tracking to investigate differences across fixation categories provides insights into the relevance of saccadic onsets as event triggers and enhances our understanding of cognitive processes in naturalistic settings.</p>

                <p>by Sandor Beregi, Kris V. Parag</p>

Deciding when to enforce or relax non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) based on real-time outbreak surveillance data is a central challenge in infectious disease epidemiology. Reporting delays and infection under-ascertainment, which characterise practical surveillance data, can misinform decision-making, prompting mistimed NPIs that fail to control spread or permitting deleterious epidemic peaks that overload healthcare capacities. To mitigate these risks, recent studies propose more data-insensitive strategies that trigger NPIs at predetermined times or infection thresholds. However, these strategies often increase NPI durations, amplifying their substantial costs to livelihood and life-quality. We develop a novel model-predictive control algorithm that optimises NPI decisions. We jointly minimise the cumulative risks and costs of interventions of different stringency over stochastic epidemic projections. Our algorithm is among the earliest to realistically incorporate uncertainties underlying both the generation and surveillance of infections. We find, except under extremely delayed reporting, that our projective approach outperforms data-insensitive strategies and show that earlier decisions strikingly improve real-time control with reduced NPI costs. Moreover, we expose how surveillance quality, disease growth and NPI frequency intrinsically limit our ability to flatten epidemic peaks or dampen endemic oscillations and reveal why this potentially makes Ebola virus more controllable than SARS-CoV-2. Our algorithm provides a general framework for guiding optimal NPI decisions ahead-of-time and identifying the key factors limiting practical epidemic control.

                <p>by Jordy Peeters, Dimitri De Bundel, Kenno Vanommeslaeghe</p>

The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) is an interesting target for drug design in the context of antidepressants that might have a rapid onset of action and/or be effective in treatment-resistant cases. The main challenge, however, is that the activation of this receptor can provoke hallucinations. Recent studies have shown that activating the receptor with certain (partial) agonists could potentially give rise to antidepressant effect without hallucinogenic side effects. Although substantial research has been done in this area, the atomistic details of this differential activation of the serotonin-2A receptor are not fully understood. In the present study we performed multiple atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R bound with two antipsychotics, three different potential non-hallucinogens and two hallucinogens to identify the receptor’s ligand dependent conformations. Overall, our findings suggest that modest 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation would only yield antidepressant effects and hallucinations result from excessive activation. While modest activation through microdosing may be problematic on account of abuse potential as well as possibly narrow and patient-dependent therapeutic windows, modest activation through administration of a sufficiently weak partial agonist may offer a viable drug development pathway.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe mental illnesses that significantly impact quality of life. These disorders are associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which can be assessed through heart activity analysis. Heart rate variability (HRV) has shown promise as a potential biomarker for diagnostic support and early screening of those conditions. This study aims to develop and evaluate an automated classification method for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using short-duration electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded with a low-cost wearable device. We conducted classification experiments using machine learning techniques to analyze R-R interval windows extracted from short ECG recordings. The study included 60 participants—30 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and 30 control subjects. We evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, multilayer perceptrons, Gated Recurrent Units, and ensemble methods. Two time window lengths (about 1 and 5 minutes) were evaluated. Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, with hyperparameter optimization and patient-level classification based on individual window decisions. Our method achieved classification accuracy of 83% for the 5-fold cross-validation and 80% for the leave-one-out scenario. Despite the complexity of our scenario, which mirrors real-world clinical settings, the proposed approach yielded performance comparable to advanced diagnostic methods reported in the literature. The results highlight the potential of short-duration HRV analysis as a cost-effective and accessible tool for aiding in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Our findings support the feasibility of using wearable ECG devices and machine learning-based classification for psychiatric screening, paving the way for further research and clinical applications.

                <p>by Alaska Pokhrel, Lachlan Chisholm, Ariana Costas, Matthew Pittorino, Iain G. Duggin, Bill Söderström</p>

<i>Escherichia coli</i> is arguably one of the most studied bacterial model systems in modern biology. While <i>E. coli</i> are normally rod-shaped gram-negative bacteria, they are known to undergo conditional morphology changes under environmental and nutrient stress. In this study, using an infection-based in-vitro infection model system combined with advanced dynamical imaging, we present the first molecular details of uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (UPEC) dividing to form and proliferate as coccoid-shaped cells inside human host cells. For these intracellular UPEC cells, the frequency of cell division outpaced the rate of cell growth, resulting in a morphological transition from traditional rod-shape to coccobacilli. We also visualized the subcellular protein dynamics in these cells and noted that the division proteins follow the similar localization and constriction patterns that have been demonstrated for vegetative growth. However, unlike for fast-growing rod-shaped cells, FtsZ constriction in intracellular UPEC occurs prior to visual nucleoid segregation. Our results suggest that the modulation of division rate contributes to morphological adaptability of intracellular UPEC at the single-cell level.

                <p>by Jan Willem de Gee, Niels A. Kloosterman, Anke Braun, Tobias H. Donner</p>

Theoretical accounts postulate that the catecholaminergic neuromodulator noradrenaline shapes cognition and behavior by reducing the impact of prior expectations on learning, inference, and decision-making. A ubiquitous effect of dynamic priors on perceptual decisions under uncertainty is choice history bias: the tendency to systematically repeat, or alternate, previous choices, even when stimulus categories are presented in a random sequence. Here, we directly test for a causal impact of catecholamines on these priors. We pharmacologically elevated catecholamine levels in human participants through the application of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. We quantified the resulting changes in observers’ history biases in a visual perceptual decision task. Choice history biases in this task were highly idiosyncratic, tending toward choice repetition or alternation in different individuals. Atomoxetine decreased these biases (toward either repetition or alternation) compared to placebo. Behavioral modeling indicates that this bias reduction was due to a reduced bias in the accumulation of sensory evidence, rather than of the starting point of the accumulation process. Atomoxetine had no significant effect on other behavioral measures tested, including response time and choice accuracy. Atomoxetine and variations of pupil-linked arousal at slower and faster timescales had analogous effects on choice history bias. We conclude that catecholamines reduce the impact of a specific form of prior on perceptual decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003359">Short-term memory errors are strongly associated with a drift in neural activity in the posterior parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joon Ho Choi, Sungwon Bae, Jiho Park, Minsu Yoo, Chul Hoon Kim, Lukas Ian Schmitt, Youngbin Tchoe, Dongil Chung, Ji-Woong Choi, Jong-Cheol Rah</p>

Understanding the neural mechanisms behind short-term memory (STM) errors is crucial for unraveling cognitive processes and addressing deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. This study examines whether STM errors arise from misrepresentation of sensory information or decay in these representations over time. Using 2-photon calcium imaging in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of mice performing a delayed match-to-sample task, we identified a subset of PPC neurons exhibiting both directional and temporal selectivity. Contrary to the hypothesis that STM errors primarily stem from mis-encoding during the sample phase, our findings reveal that these errors are more strongly associated with a drift in neural activity during the delay period. This drift leads to a gradual divergence away from the correct representation, ultimately leading to incorrect behavioral responses. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining stable neural representations in the PPC for accurate STM. Furthermore, they highlight the potential for therapeutic interventions aimed at stabilizing PPC activity during delay periods as a strategy for mitigating cognitive impairments in conditions like schizophrenia.

                Cancer neuroscience is an emerging and rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field that is reshaping our understanding of how the nervous system and cancers interact to affect underlying biology and clinical practice. We are pleased to present this special issue, which offers a snapshot of the field through a collection of perspectives, reviews, and NeuroViews that highlight the profound reciprocal influence between neural mechanisms and cancer—encompassing tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and patient symptoms—as well as how cancer can reshape neural circuits and functions.

                Neural signaling regulates multiple steps in the metastatic cascade. In this NeuroView, Sloan and Chang suggest that the neural landscape of metastatic microenvironments is highly dynamic and describe opportunities to target peripheral neuroplasticity for personalized anti-metastatic therapeutic interventions.

                This NeuroView explores how systemic cancer signals induce behavioral changes via brain-body communication pathways, framing cachexia as an adaptive yet unsustainable interoceptive response. Recognizing patient-reported symptoms as biological signals offers new avenues for intervention and understanding brain-disease interactions.

                In this comprehensive review, Karreman & Winkler explore how neural influences on the brain’s metastatic process govern brain tropism, colonization, and growth. Conversely, metastatic cancer has distinct effects on brain biology. These bidirectional neuro-cancer interactions can inform novel neuroscience-instructed cancer therapies.
