              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The Natural History of Leigh Syndrome: A Study of Disease Burden and Progression</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This observational cohort study aims to quantify disease burden over time, establish disease progression rates and identify factors that may determine the disease course of Leigh syndrome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seventy-two Leigh syndrome children who completed the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scales (NPMDS) at baseline 3.7 years (IQR 2.0-7.6) and follow-up assessments 7.5 years (IQR 3.7-11.0) in clinics were enrolled. 82% of this cohort had a confirmed genetic diagnosis with pathogenic variants in the <i>MT-ATP6</i> and <i>SURF1</i> genes being the most common cause. The total NPMDS scores denoted mild (0-14), moderate (15-25) and severe (&gt;25) disease burden. Detailed clinical, neuroradiological and molecular genetic findings were also analysed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median total NPMDS scores rose significantly (<i>Z</i>=-6.9, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and the percentage of children with severe disease burden doubled (22%→42%) over 2.6 years of follow-up. Poor function (especially mobility, self-care, communication, feeding and education) and extrapyramidal features contributed significantly to the disease burden (<i>τ</i>
<sub>b</sub>≈0.45-0.68, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001). These children also deteriorated to wheelchair dependence (31%→57%), exclusive enteral feeding (22%→46%) and one-to-one assistance for self-care (25%→43%) during the study period. Twelve children (17%) died after their last NPMDS scores were recorded. These children had higher follow-up NPMDS scores (disease burden) (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and steeper increase in NPMDS score per annum (disease progression) (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001). Other predictors of poor outcomes include <i>SURF1</i> gene variants (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and bilateral caudate changes on neuroimaging (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study has objectively defined the disease burden and progression of Leigh syndrome<b>.</b> Our analysis has also uncovered potential influences on the trajectory of this neurodegenerative condition.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are abundant cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and are involved in processes including synapse formation/function, ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter uptake, and neurovascular coupling. Recent evidence indicates that astrocytes show diverse molecular, structural, and physiological properties within the CNS. This heterogeneity is reflected in differences in astrocyte structure, gene expression, functional properties, and responsiveness to injury/pathological conditions. Deeper investigation of astrocytic heterogeneity is needed to understand how astrocytes are configured to enable diverse roles in the CNS. While much has been learned about astrocytic heterogeneity in rodents, much less is known about astrocytic heterogeneity in the primate brain where astrocytes have greater size and complexity. The common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) is a promising non-human primate model because of similarities between marmosets and humans with respect to genetics, brain anatomy, and cognition/behavior. Here, we investigated the molecular and structural heterogeneity of marmoset astrocytes using an array of astrocytic markers, multi-label confocal microscopy, and quantitative analysis. We used male and female marmosets and found that marmoset astrocytes show differences in expression of astrocytic markers in cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. These differences were accompanied by intra-regional variation in expression of markers for glutamate/GABA transporters, and potassium and water channels. Differences in astrocyte structure were also found, along with complex interactions with blood vessels, microglia, and neurons. This study contributes to our knowledge of the cellular and molecular features of marmoset astrocytes and is useful for understanding the complex properties of astrocytes in the primate CNS.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder involving defective peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), due to mutation in the <i>ABCD1</i> gene. X-ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism and confers a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Remarkably, a subset of patients exhibit a cerebral form with inflammatory invasion of the central nervous system and extensive demyelination, while in others only dying-back axonopathy or even isolated adrenal insufficiency is seen, without genotype–phenotype correlation. X-ALD's biochemical signature is marked elevation of VLCFAs in blood, a finding that has been utilized for massive newborn screening for early diagnosis. Investigational gene therapy approaches hold promises for improved outcomes. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease remain poorly understood, limiting investigation of targeted therapeutic options. Animal models for the disease recapitulate the biochemical signature of VLCFA accumulation and demonstrate mitochondrially generated reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage, increased glial death, and axonal damage. Most strikingly, however, cerebral invasion of leukocytes and demyelination were not observed in any animal model for X-ALD, reflecting upon pathological processes that are yet to be discovered. This review summarizes the current disease models in animals, the lessons learned from these models, and the gaps that remained to be filled in order to assist in therapeutic investigations for ALD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Xenon is an inert gas with stable chemical properties which is used as an anesthetic. Recent <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> findings indicate that xenon also elicits an excellent neuroprotective effect in subanesthetic concentrations. The mechanisms underlying this primarily involve the attenuation of excitotoxicity and the inhibition of N-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and NMDA receptor-related effects, such as antioxidative effects, reduced activation of microglia, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms, as well as the interaction with certain ion channels and glial cells. Based on this strong neuroprotective role, a large number of experimental and clinical studies have confirmed the significant therapeutic effect of xenon in the treatment of neurological diseases. This review summarizes the reported neuroprotective mechanisms of xenon and discusses its possible therapeutic application in the treatment of various neurological diseases.</p>

                Beating of motile cilia at the brain ventricular surface generates rapid flow in an evolutionary conserved pattern mediating the transport of cerebrospinal fluid, but its functional importance has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show disturbance of this transport may contribute to seizure susceptibility. Mice haploinsufficient for FoxJ1, transcription factor regulating motile cilia exhibited cilia-driven flow blockage and increased seizure susceptibility. Mutations in two epilepsy-associated kinases, Cdkl5 and Yes1, in mice resulted in similar cilia-driven flow blockage and increased seizure susceptibility. We showed this arises from disorganized cilia polarity associated with disruption in the highly organized basal body anchoring meshwork. Together these findings suggest mispatterning of cilia-generated flow may contribute to epilepsy and thus might account for seizures unresponsive to current seizure medications.

                Neurotransmitter receptors support the propagation of signals in the human brain. How receptor systems are situated within macroscale neuroanatomy and how they shape emergent function remains poorly understood, and there exists no comprehensive atlas of receptors. Here we collate positron emission tomography scans in >1,200 healthy individuals to construct a whole-brain 3-D normative atlas of 18 receptors and transporters across 9 different neurotransmitter systems. We find that receptor profiles align with structural connectivity and mediate function, including neurophysiological oscillatory dynamics and resting state hemodynamic functional connectivity. Using the Neurosynth cognitive atlas, we uncover a topographic gradient of overlapping receptor distributions that separates extrinsic and intrinsic psychological processes. Finally, we find both expected and novel associations between receptor distributions and cortical thinning patterns across 13 disorders. We replicate all findings in an independently collected autoradiography dataset. This work demonstrates how chemoarchitecture shapes brain structure and function, providing a new direction for studying multi-scale brain organization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correcting the Hebbian Mistake: Toward a Fully Error-Driven Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a critical role in the rapid learning of new episodic memories. Many computational models propose that the hippocampus is an autoassociator that relies on Hebbian learning (i.e., "cells that fire together, wire together"). However, Hebbian learning is computationally suboptimal as it modifies weights unnecessarily beyond what is actually needed to achieve effective retrieval, causing more interference and resulting in a lower learning capacity. Our previous computational models have utilized a powerful, biologically plausible form of error-driven learning in hippocampal CA1 and entorhinal cortex (EC) (functioning as a sparse autoencoder) by contrasting local activity states at different phases in the theta cycle. Based on specific neural data and a recent abstract computational model, we propose a new model called Theremin (Total Hippocampal ERror MINimization) that extends error-driven learning to area CA3 --- the mnemonic heart of the hippocampal system. In the model, CA3 responds to the EC monosynaptic input prior to the EC disynaptic input through dentate gyrus (DG), giving rise to a temporal difference between these two activation states, which drives error-driven learning in the EC->CA3 and CA3<->CA3 projections. In effect, DG serves as a teacher to CA3, correcting its patterns into more pattern-separated ones, thereby reducing interference. Results showed that Theremin, compared with our original model, has significantly increased capacity and learning speed. The model makes several novel predictions that can be tested in future studies.

	<p>Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is not a defined, separate disease classification, but a set of etiologically diverse symptoms that change with the child’s age. According to the up-to-date definition, CP is a group of permanent but not unchanging disorders of movement and/or posture and motor function, which are due to a nonprogressive interference, lesion, or abnormality of the developing/immature brain. CP is one of the most frequent causes of motor disability in children. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether selected risk factors may vary depending on particular types of CP. Methods: 181 children with CP (aged 4–17 years), hospitalized at the Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Age Neurology in Katowice in the years 2008–2016 were retrospectively analyzed in the present study. The assumed risk factors of CP were divided into two groups: 1—pre-conception and prenatal (mother’s age, family history of epilepsy, burdened obstetric history, mother’s systemic diseases, pregnancy order, multiple pregnancy, duration of pregnancy, bleedings from the genital tract during gestation, arterial hypertension during pregnancy, infections during pregnancy, preterm contractions, maintained pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes, abruptio placentae, and others), 2—perinatal and postnatal (mode of delivery, birth weight, Apgar score at the first and fifth minute, neonatal convulsions, respiratory failure, infections in neonatal and infant period, and intraventricular bleeding). The division into particular CP types was based on Ingram’s classification. Results: The following risk factors were the most frequent in the total group: respiratory failure, infections, intraventricular bleeding, and prematurity. Among the analyzed preconception and prenatal factors, the duration of pregnancy and preterm contractions during pregnancy significantly differentiated the subgroups of patients depending on the type of CP. The prevalence of almost all analyzed perinatal, neonatal, and infant-related risk factors (i.e., birth weight, Apgar score at the first and fifth minute, neonatal convulsions, respiratory failure, infections in neonatal and infant period, and intraventricular bleeding) significantly differed between CP types, apart from the mode of delivery. However, in multivariate regression, only intraventricular bleeding was an independent predictor for tetraplegic CP type when compared to joined extrapyramidal and ataxic types (OR = 2.801, p = 0.028). Conclusions: As CP is a syndrome of multifactorial etiology, the identification of CP risk factors entails the need for careful observation and comprehensive care of children in the risk group. The presence of certain risk factors may be a prognostic indicator for particular types of CP. The knowledge about the association between the risk factor(s) and the CP type could be a very useful tool for pediatricians looking after the child at risk of developmental disorders.</p>

	<p>Social distancing was universally implemented to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Long-term social distancing can lead to increased feelings of social isolation or dissatisfaction with one’s daily interpersonal interactions, which can subsequently result in reduced psychological health (e.g., greater depression). The present study quantified this association, and the extent to which it was moderated by measures of sleep and physical activity, by surveying 3658 adults (mean age = 46.0 years) from across the United States. Participants answered questions related to their social experiences, sleep, physical activity, and depressive symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic (March–June 2020). Results showed that social isolation and social dissatisfaction were associated with greater depressive symptoms. As predicted, self-reported sleep quality and physical activity moderated these associations, such that lower sleep quality and physical activity exacerbated their effect on depressive symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">TwinCons: Conservation score for uncovering deep sequence similarity and divergence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Petar I. Penev, Claudia Alvarez-Carreño, Eric Smith, Anton S. Petrov, Loren Dean Williams</p>

We have developed the program TwinCons, to detect noisy signals of deep ancestry of proteins or nucleic acids. As input, the program uses a composite alignment containing pre-defined groups, and mathematically determines a ‘cost’ of transforming one group to the other at each position of the alignment. The output distinguishes conserved, variable and signature positions. A signature is conserved within groups but differs between groups. The method automatically detects continuous characteristic stretches (segments) within alignments. TwinCons provides a convenient representation of conserved, variable and signature positions as a single score, enabling the structural mapping and visualization of these characteristics. Structure is more conserved than sequence. TwinCons highlights alternative sequences of conserved structures. Using TwinCons, we detected highly similar segments between proteins from the translation and transcription systems. TwinCons detects conserved residues within regions of high functional importance for the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and demonstrates that signatures are not confined to specific regions but are distributed across the rRNA structure. The ability to evaluate both nucleic acid and protein alignments allows TwinCons to be used in combined sequence and structural analysis of signatures and conservation in rRNA and in ribosomal proteins (rProteins). TwinCons detects a strong sequence conservation signal between bacterial and archaeal rProteins related by circular permutation. This conserved sequence is structurally colocalized with conserved rRNA, indicated by TwinCons scores of rRNA alignments of bacterial and archaeal groups. This combined analysis revealed deep co-evolution of rRNA and rProtein buried within the deepest branching points in the tree of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Point-estimating observer models for latent cause detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Laura Lee, Wei Ji Ma</p>

The spatial distribution of visual items allows us to infer the presence of latent causes in the world. For instance, a spatial cluster of ants allows us to infer the presence of a common food source. However, optimal inference requires the integration of a computationally intractable number of world states in real world situations. For example, optimal inference about whether a common cause exists based on <i>N</i> spatially distributed visual items requires marginalizing over both the location of the latent cause and 2<sup>N</sup> possible affiliation patterns (where each item may be affiliated or non-affiliated with the latent cause). How might the brain approximate this inference? We show that subject behaviour deviates qualitatively from Bayes-optimal, in particular showing an unexpected positive effect of <i>N</i> (the number of visual items) on the false-alarm rate. We propose several “point-estimating” observer models that fit subject behaviour better than the Bayesian model. They each avoid a costly computational marginalization over at least one of the variables of the generative model by “committing” to a point estimate of at least one of the two generative model variables. These findings suggest that the brain may implement partially committal variants of Bayesian models when detecting latent causes based on complex real world data.

                Background: With the tremendous increase in the usage of smart meters for industrial/ household purposes, their implementation is considered a crucial challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) world, leading to a demand for emerging 5G technology. In addition, a large amount of data has to be communicated by smart meters efficiently, which needs a significant enhancement in bandwidth. The power amplifier (PA) plays a major role in deciding the efficiency and bandwidth of the entire communication system. Among the various modes of PAs, a newly developed Class-J mode PA has been proven to achieve high efficiency over a wide bandwidth by maintaining linearity. Methods: This paper proposes a Class-J mode PA design methodology using a CGH40010F-GaN device that operates at a 3.5 GHz frequency to meet the requirements of 5G wireless communication technology for the replacement of existing 4G/LTE technology used for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids. This research's main objective is to design the proper matching networks (M.Ns) to achieve Class-J mode operation that satisfies the bandwidth requirements of 5G smart grid applications. With the target impedances obtained using the load-pull simulation, lumped element matching networks are analyzed and designed in 3 ways using the ADS EDA tool. Results: The simulation results reveal that the proposed Class-J PA provides a maximum drain efficiency (D.E) of 82%, power added efficiency (PAE) of 67% with 13 dB small-signal gain at 3.5 GHz, and output power of 40 dBm (41.4 dBm peak) with a power gain of approximately 7 dB over a bandwidth of approximately 400 MHz with a 28 V power supply into a 50 Ω load. Conclusion: The efficiency and bandwidth of the proposed Class-J PA can be enhanced further by fine-tuning the matching network design to make it more suitable for 5G smart meter/grid applications.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is highly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives of the study were to characterize autistic features in young children with TSC.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants included 138 children followed from ages 3 to 36 months with TSC from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASD in TSC. Developmental and autism-specific assessments were administered, and a clinical diagnosis of ASD was determined for all participants at 36 months. Further analyses were performed on 117 participants with valid autism assessments based on nonverbal mental age greater than 15 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prevalence of clinical diagnosis of ASD at 36 months was 25%. Nearly all autistic behaviors on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) were more prevalent in children diagnosed with ASD; however, autism-specific behaviors were also observed in children without ASD. Overall quality of social overtures, facial expressions, and abnormal repetitive interests and behaviors were characteristics most likely to distinguish children with ASD from those without an ASD diagnosis. Participants meeting ADOS-2 criteria but not a clinical ASD diagnosis exhibited intermediate developmental and ADOS-2 scores compared to individuals with and without ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASD is highly prevalent in TSC, and many additional individuals with TSC exhibit a broad range of subthreshold autistic behaviors. Our findings reveal a broader autism phenotype that can be identified in young children with TSC, which provides opportunity for early targeted treatments. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epilepsy is a devastating neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures attributed to the disruption of the dynamic excitatory and inhibitory balance in the brain. Epilepsy has emerged as a global health concern affecting about 70 million people worldwide. Despite recent advances in pre-clinical and clinical research, its etiopathogenesis remains obscure, and there are still no treatment strategies modifying disease progression. Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis have not been clarified yet, the role of ion channels as regulators of cellular excitability has increasingly gained attention. In this regard, emerging evidence highlights the potential implication of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in epileptogenesis. Kir channels consist of seven different subfamilies (Kir1–Kir7), and they are highly expressed in both neuronal and glial cells in the central nervous system. These channels control the cell volume and excitability. In this review, we discuss preclinical and clinical evidence on the role of the several subfamilies of Kir channels in epileptogenesis, aiming to shed more light on the pathogenesis of this disorder and pave the way for future novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

                Visually impaired persons face challenges in running business activities, especially in handling banknotes. Malaysia researchers had proposed some Ringgit banknotes recognition systems to aid visually impaired persons recognize and classify Ringgit banknotes. However, these electronic banknote readers can only recognize Malaysian Banknotes’ Ringgit value, they have no counterfeit detection features. The purpose of this study is to develop a banknote reader that not only can help visually impaired persons recognize the banknote value, but also to detect the counterfeit of the banknote, safeguarding their losses. This paper proposed a Malaysian banknote reader using backlight mechanism and image processing techniques to read and detect counterfeit for one Ringgit and five Ringgit Malaysian banknotes. The developed handheld banknote reader used visual type sensor to capture banknote image, passed to raspberry pi controller to perform image processing on banknote value and the extracted watermarks features. The developed image processing algorithm will trace out the region of interests: 1)see-thru windows, 2)Crescent and Star, 3)Perfect see though register and detect the watermarks features accordingly. The processed result will be passed back to the handheld banknote reader and broadcast on an attached mini speaker to aid the visually impaired understand the holding banknote, whether it is a real one Ringgit, real five Ringgit or none of them. The experimental result shown by this approach able to accomplish numerous round of banknote reading attempts with successful outcomes. Confusion matrix is further employed to study the performance of the banknote reader, in terms of true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. Details analysis had been focused on the critical false positive cases (predicted real banknote and actually is fake banknote) and false negative cases (predicted fake banknote and it is actually real banknote).

                Clinical presentation of liver hydatidosis can vary from asymptomatic forms to lethal complications. We report a rare case of a 27-year-old male from a rural Tunisian region who presented with large-abundance haematemesis, haemodynamic instability, and marked biological signs of hypersplenism. Endoscopy showed bleeding esophageal varicose veins that were ligated. Abdominal ultrasound concluded the presence of three type CE2 hydatic liver cysts causing portal cavernoma with signs of portal hypertension. Despite resuscitation, the patient died of massive rebleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock. Hepatic hydatid cyst should be considered as an indirect cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in endemic countries. Early abdominal ultrasound in varicose haemorrhage is essential in orienting the diagnosis.

<p><i>Faim</i> knockout mice present early aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins, chronic gliosis, blood-retinal barrier disruption and alterations in survival pathways that culminate in photoreceptor cell death. We think FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis and a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fas Apoptotic Inhibitory Molecule protein (FAIM) is a death receptor antagonist and an apoptosis regulator. It encodes two isoforms, namely FAIM-S (short) and FAIM-L (long), both with significant neuronal functions. FAIM-S, which is ubiquitously expressed, is involved in neurite outgrowth. In contrast, FAIM-L is expressed only in neurons and it protects them from cell death. Interestingly, FAIM-L is downregulated in patients and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease before the onset of neurodegeneration, and <i>Faim</i> transcript levels are decreased in mouse models of retinal degeneration. However, few studies have addressed the role of FAIM in the central nervous system, yet alone the retina. The retina is a highly specialized tissue, and its degeneration has proved to precede pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe that <i>Faim</i> depletion in mice damages the retina persistently and leads to late-onset photoreceptor death in older mice. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that <i>Faim</i> knockout (<i>Faim</i>
<sup>−/−</sup>) mice present ubiquitinated aggregates throughout the retina from early ages. Moreover, retinal cells released stress signals that can signal to Müller cells, as shown by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR. Müller cells monitor retinal homeostasis and trigger a gliotic response in <i>Faim</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice that becomes pathogenic when sustained. In this regard, we observed pronounced vascular leakage at later ages, which may be caused by persistent inflammation. These results suggest that FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis, and they support the premise that FAIM is a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration.</p>

     alt="Long-term hypogonadism diminishes the neuroprotective effects of dietary genistein in young adult ovariectomized rats after transient focal ischemia"/>
<p>After short-term, but not after long-term hypogonadism, estrogen and genistein reduced strike-induced infarct in ovariectomize female rats. Estrogen improved neurological function after long-term hypogonadism. Genistein improved aspects of cognition independent of length of hypogonadism. These data support differential benefits of estrogen and genistein after loss of endogenous steroids.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing age disproportionately increases the risk of stroke among women compared to men of similar age, especially after menopause. One of the reasons for this observation is a sharp drop in circulating estrogens. However, the timing of initiation of estrogen replacement after menopause is associated with mixed beneficial and detrimental effects, hence contributing to widespread mistrust of estrogen use. Agents including soy isoflavones are being assessed as viable alternatives to estrogen therapy. In this study, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effects of genistein, a soy isoflavone are less sensitive to the length of hypogonadism in young adult ovariectomized rats following cerebral ischemia. We expected that long-term hypogonadism will worsen motor and cognitive function, increase post-stroke inflammation with no effect on the neuroprotection of genistein. We compared the effect of treatment with dietary genistein (GEN) on short-term (2 weeks) and long-term hypogonadism (12 weeks) in young adult ovariectomized Sprague–Dawley rats on sensorimotor function, cognition and inflammation after focal ischemia. Dorsal Silastic implant of 17β-estradiol (E2) was used as a control for hormone therapy. Long-term hypogonadism stroked rats performed worse than the short-term hypogonadism stroked rats on the motor and cognitive function tests. GEN did not improve neurological assessment and motor learning after either short-term or long-term hypogonadism. GEN improved cognitive flexibility after short-term hypogonadism but not after the long-term. Both GEN and E2 reduced tissue loss after short-term hypogonadism and reduced GFAP expression at the contralateral side of ischemia after long-term hypogonadism. The length of hypogonadism may differentially influence the neuroprotective effects of both GEN and E2 on the motor and cognitive functions in young adult rats.</p>

     alt="Increased susceptibility to quinolinic acid-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations in an animal model of glutaric acidemia type I"/>
<p>Following quinolinic acid (QA) intrastriatal injection, glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) animal model is more susceptible to QA-induced severe seizures, develops spontaneous recurrent seizures, and presents increased mortality rate and persistent changes in brain cortical oscillation patterns. This emphasizes the crucial role of QA in neurological impairment in GA-I</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) is an inborn error of metabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan, caused by glutaryl-CoA-dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency, characterized by the buildup of toxic organic acids predominantly in the brain. After acute catabolic states, patients usually develop striatal degeneration, but the mechanisms behind this damage are still unknown. Quinolinic acid (QA), a metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, increases especially during infections/inflammatory processes, and could act synergically with organic acids, contributing to the neurological features of GA-I. The aim of this study was to investigate whether QA increases seizure susceptibility and modifies brain oscillation patterns in an animal model of GA-I, the <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice taking high-lysine diet (<i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys). Therefore, the characteristics of QA-induced seizures and changes in brain oscillatory patterns were evaluated by video-electroencephalography (EEG) analysis recorded in <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>-</i>Lys, <i>Gcdh<sup>+/+</sup>-</i>Lys, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N (normal diet) animals. We found that the number of seizures <i>per</i> animal was similar for all groups receiving QA, <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA, <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA. However, severe seizures were observed in the majority of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA mice (82%), and only in 25% of <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA and 44% of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA mice. All <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys animals developed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), but <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA animals had increased number of SRS, higher mortality rate, and significant predominance of lower frequency oscillations on EEG. Our results suggest that QA plays an important role in the neurological features of GA-I, as <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys mice exhibit increased susceptibility to intrastriatal QA-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations.</p>

                Self-initiated actions in freely moving rats can be predicted by specific ensemble activity patterns in the secondary motor cortex (M2). Variability in action timing can be explained by metastable attractors in a network model of M2. Transitions between attractors are generated by low-dimensional correlated variability, empirically verified in M2.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Humans use forward thinking to exploit social controllability</a></h4>

              
                The controllability of our social environment has a profound impact on our behavior and mental health. Nevertheless, neurocomputational mechanisms underlying social controllability remain elusive. Here, 48 participants performed a task where their current choices either did (Controllable), or did not (Uncontrollable), influence partners’ future proposals. Computational modeling revealed that people engaged a mental model of forward thinking (FT; i.e., calculating the downstream effects of current actions) to estimate social controllability in both Controllable and Uncontrollable conditions. A large-scale online replication study (n=1342) supported this finding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (n=48), we further demonstrated that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) computed the projected total values of current actions during forward planning, supporting the neural realization of the forward-thinking model. These findings demonstrate that humans use vmPFC-dependent FT to estimate and exploit social controllability, expanding the role of this neurocomputational mechanism beyond spatial and cognitive contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Piezo1 ion channels inherently function as independent mechanotransducers</a></h4>

              
                Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint, which indirectly suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each other’s spatial distribution and interact functionally. Here, we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Our data, together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions, show that both at endogenous densities (1–2 channels/μm<sup>2</sup>), and at non-physiological densities (10–100 channels/μm<sup>2</sup>) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap, Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension. The results suggest that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers. We propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetically engineered mice for combinatorial cardiovascular optobiology</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic effectors and sensors provide a novel real-time window into complex physiological processes, enabling determination of molecular signaling processes within functioning cellular networks. However, the combination of these optical tools in mice is made practical by construction of genetic lines that are optically compatible and genetically tractable. We present a new toolbox of 21 mouse lines with lineage-specific expression of optogenetic effectors and sensors for direct biallelic combination, avoiding the multiallelic requirement of Cre recombinase -mediated DNA recombination, focusing on models relevant for cardiovascular biology. Optogenetic effectors (11 lines) or Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors (10 lines) were selectively expressed in cardiac pacemaker cells, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, alveolar epithelial cells, lymphocytes, glia, and other cell types. Optogenetic effector and sensor function was demonstrated in numerous tissues. Arterial/arteriolar tone was modulated by optical activation of the second messengers InsP<sub>3</sub> (optoα1AR) and cAMP (optoß2AR), or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant membrane channels (CatCh2) in smooth muscle (<i>Acta2</i>) and endothelium (<i>Cdh5</i>). Cardiac activation was separately controlled through activation of nodal/conducting cells or cardiac myocytes. We demonstrate combined effector and sensor function in biallelic mouse crosses: optical cardiac pacing and simultaneous cardiomyocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in <i>Hcn4</i><sup>BAC</sup>-CatCh2/<i>Myh6</i>-GCaMP8 crosses. These experiments highlight the potential of these mice to explore cellular signaling in vivo, in complex tissue networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic, cellular and structural characterization of the membrane potential-dependent cell-penetrating peptide translocation pore</a></h4>

              
                Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) allow intracellular delivery of bioactive cargo molecules. The mechanisms allowing CPPs to enter cells are ill-defined. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based screening, we discovered that KCNQ5, KCNN4, and KCNK5 potassium channels positively modulate cationic CPP direct translocation into cells by decreasing the transmembrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>). These findings provide the first unbiased genetic validation of the role of Vm in CPP translocation in cells. <i>In silico</i> modeling and live cell experiments indicate that CPPs, by bringing positive charges on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, decrease the V<sub>m</sub> to very low values (-150 mV or less), a situation we have coined megapolarization that then triggers formation of water pores used by CPPs to enter cells. Megapolarization lowers the free energy barrier associated with CPP membrane translocation. Using dyes of varying dimensions in CPP co-entry experiments, the diameter of the water pores in living cells was estimated to be 2(-5) nm, in accordance with the structural characteristics of the pores predicted by <i>in silico</i> modeling. Pharmacological manipulation to lower transmembrane potential boosted CPPs cellular internalization in zebrafish and mouse models. Besides identifying the first proteins that regulate CPP translocation, this work characterized key mechanistic steps used by CPPs to cross cellular membrane. This opens the ground for strategies aimed at improving the ability of cells to capture CPP-linked cargos<i> in vitro</i> and<i> in vivo</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Growth-dependent signals drive an increase in early G1 cyclin concentration to link cell cycle entry with cell growth</a></h4>

              
                Entry into the cell cycle occurs only when sufficient growth has occurred. In budding yeast, the cyclin Cln3 is thought to initiate cell cycle entry by inactivating a transcriptional repressor called Whi5. Growth-dependent changes in the concentrations of Cln3 or Whi5 have been proposed to link cell cycle entry to cell growth. However, there are conflicting reports regarding the behavior and roles of Cln3 and Whi5. Here, we found no evidence that changes in the concentration of Whi5 play a major role in controlling cell cycle entry. Rather, the data suggest that cell growth triggers cell cycle entry by driving an increase in the concentration of Cln3. We further found that accumulation of Cln3 is dependent upon homologs of mammalian SGK kinases that control cell growth and size. Together, the data are consistent with models in which Cln3 is a crucial link between cell growth and the cell cycle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Paths and pathways that generate cell-type heterogeneity and developmental progression in hematopoiesis</a></h4>

              
                Mechanistic studies of <i>Drosophila</i> lymph gland hematopoiesis are limited by the availability of cell-type specific markers. Using a combination of bulk RNA-Seq of FACS-sorted cells, single cell RNA-Seq, and genetic dissection, we identify new blood cell subpopulations along a developmental trajectory with multiple paths to mature cell types. This provides functional insights into key developmental processes and signaling pathways. We highlight metabolism as a driver of development, show that graded Pointed expression allows distinct roles in successive developmental steps, and that mature crystal cells specifically express an alternate isoform of Hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif/Sima). Mechanistically, the Musashi-regulated protein Numb facilitates Sima-dependent non-canonical, and inhibits canonical, Notch signaling. Broadly, we find that prior to making a fate choice, a progenitor selects between alternative, biologically relevant, transitory states allowing smooth transitions reflective of combinatorial expressions rather than stepwise binary decisions. Increasingly, this view is gaining support in mammalian hematopoiesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The decoy SNARE Tomosyn sets tonic versus phasic release properties and is required for homeostatic synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic vesicle release probability (<i>P<sub>r</sub></i>) is a key presynaptic determinant of synaptic strength established by cell intrinsic properties and further refined by plasticity. To characterize mechanisms that generate <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> heterogeneity between distinct neuronal populations, we examined glutamatergic tonic (Ib) and phasic (Is) motoneurons in Drosophila with stereotyped differences in <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> and synaptic plasticity. We found the decoy SNARE Tomosyn is differentially expressed between these motoneuron subclasses and contributes to intrinsic differences in their synaptic output. Tomosyn expression enables tonic release in Ib motoneurons by reducing SNARE complex formation and suppressing <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> to generate decreased levels of synaptic vesicle fusion and enhanced resistance to synaptic fatigue. In contrast, phasic release dominates when Tomosyn expression is low, enabling high intrinsic <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> at Is terminals at the expense of sustained release and robust presynaptic potentiation. In addition, loss of Tomosyn disrupts the ability of tonic synapses to undergo presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The consequences of group structure and efficiency benefits for the evolution of division of labour</a></h4>

              
                Recent theory has overturned the assumption that accelerating returns from individual specialisation are required to favour the evolution of division of labour. Yanni et al. (2020) showed that topologically constrained groups, where cells cooperate with only direct neighbours such as for filaments or branching growths, can evolve a reproductive division of labour even with diminishing returns from individual specialisation. We develop a conceptual framework and specific models to investigate the factors that can favour the initial evolution of reproductive division of labour. We find that selection for division of labour in topologically constrained groups: (1) is not a single mechanism to favour division of labour - depending upon details of the group structure, division of labour can be favoured for different reasons; (2) always involves an efficiency benefit at the level of group fitness; and (3) requires a mechanism of coordination to determine which individuals perform which tasks. Given that such coordination must evolve prior to or concurrently with division of labour, this could limit the extent to which topological constraints favoured the initial evolution of division of labour. We conclude by suggesting experimental designs that could determine why division of labour is favoured in the natural world.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Causal roles of prefrontal cortex during spontaneous perceptual switching are determined by brain state dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to orchestrate cognitive dynamics. However, in tests of bistable visual perception, no direct evidence supporting such presumable causal roles of the PFC has been reported. Here, using a novel brain-state-dependent neural stimulation system, we identified causal effects on percept dynamics in three PFC activities-right frontal eye fields, dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and inferior frontal cortex (IFC)-. The causality is behaviourally detectable only when we track brain state dynamics and modulate the PFC activity in brain-state-/state-history-dependent manners. The behavioural effects are underpinned by transient neural changes in the brain state dynamics, and such neural effects are quantitatively explainable by structural transformations of the hypothetical energy landscapes. Moreover, these findings indicate distinct functions of the three PFC areas: in particular, the DLPFC enhances the integration of two PFC-active brain states, whereas IFC promotes the functional segregation between them. This work resolves the controversy over the PFC roles in spontaneous perceptual switching and underlines brain state dynamics in fine investigations of brain-behaviour causality.

                The brain's 'default mode network' (DMN) enables flexible switching between internally and externally focused cognition. Precisely how this modulation occurs is not well understood, although may involve key subcortical mechanisms, including hypothesized influences from the basal forebrain (BF) and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Here, we used ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the involvement of the BF and MD across states of task-induced DMN activity modulation. Specifically, we mapped DMN activity suppression ('deactivation') when participants transitioned between rest and externally focused task performance, as well as DMN activity engagement ('activation') when task performance was internally (i.e., self) focused. Consistent with recent rodent studies, the BF showed overall activity suppression with DMN cortical regions when comparing the rest to external task conditions. Further analyses, including dynamic causal modelling, confirmed that the BF drove changes in DMN cortical activity during these rest-to-task transitions. The MD, by comparison, was specifically engaged during internally focused cognition and demonstrated a broad excitatory influence on DMN cortical activation. These results provide the first direct evidence in humans of distinct basal forebrain and thalamic circuit influences on the control of DMN function and suggest novel mechanistic avenues for ongoing translational research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Artifacts in EEG-based BCI therapies: friend or foe?</a></h4>

              
                EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have promising therapeutic potential beyond traditional neurofeedback training, such as enabling personalized and optimized virtual reality (VR) neurorehabilitation paradigms where the timing and parameters of the visual experience is synchronized with specific brain-states. While BCI algorithms are often designed to focus on whichever portion of a signal is most informative, in these brain-state-synchronized applications, it is of critical importance that the resulting decoder is sensitive to physiological brain activity representative of various mental states, and not to artifacts such as those arising from naturalistic movements. In this study, we compare the relative classification accuracy with which different motor tasks can be decoded from both extracted brain activity and artifacts contained in the EEG signal. EEG data was collected from 17 chronic stroke patients while performing six different head, hand, and arm movements in a realistic VR-based neurorehabilitation paradigm. Results show that the artifact component of the EEG signal is significantly more informative than brain activity to the classifier. This finding is consistent across different feature extraction methods and classification pipelines. Whereas informative artifacts are a helpful friend in BCI-based communication applications, they can be a problematic foe in the estimation of physiological brain states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metacognition, cortical thickness, and tauopathy in aging</a></h4>

              
                We investigated two aspects of metacognition and their relationship with cortical thickness and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers, amyloid and tau, in cognitively healthy older adults (N=151). The two metacognition measures were self-appraisal rating of task performance and the difference between self-appraisal rating and actual task performance (appraisal discrepancy). All participants underwent neuropsychological testing and 1.5T structural MRI. A subset (N=66) received amyloid-PET with [11C] PiB and tau-PET with [18F] Flortaucipir. We found that worse performers had lower self-appraisal ratings, but still overestimated their performance, consistent with the Dunning-Kruger effect. Self-appraisal rating and appraisal discrepancy revealed distinct relationships with cortical thickness and AD pathology. Greater appraisal discrepancy, indicating overestimation, was related to thinning of inferior-lateral temporal, fusiform, and rostral anterior cingulate cortices. Lower self-appraisal was associated with higher entorhinal and inferior temporal tau. These results suggest that overestimation could implicate structural atrophy beyond AD pathology, while lower self-appraisal could indicate early behavioral alteration due to AD pathology, supporting the notion of subjective cognitive decline prior to objective deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chemogenetic activation of Locus Coeruleus Noradrenergic Neurons Modulates the Default Mode Network</a></h4>

              
                The default mode network (DMN) of the brain is involved in cognition, emotion regulation, impulsivity, and balancing between internally and externally focused states. Dysregulation of DMN has been implicated in several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and spectral fiber-photometry to investigate the selective neuromodulatory effect of norepinephrine (NE)-releasing noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) on DMN in mice. Chemogenetic-induced LC-NE activation decreased cerebral blood volume (CBV) and glucose uptake, while increasing synchronous low frequency power within the frontal cortices of the DMN. Fiber-photometry results corroborated these findings, showing LC-NE activation induces NE release, enhances calcium-weighted neuronal spiking, and reduces CBV in the anterior cingulate cortex. These data suggest the lack of conventional stimulus-evoked coupling between neuronal activity and CBV in the frontal DMN. We also demonstrated that chemogenetic activation of LC-NE neurons strengthen functional connectivity within the frontal DMN, and this effect is causally mediated by reduced modulatory inputs from retrosplenial and hippocampal regions to the association cortices of the DMN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Translating outcomes from the clinical setting to preclinical models: chronic pain and functionality in chronic musculoskeletal pain</a></h4>

              
                Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain disorder characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain (CWP), tenderness, and fatigue, which interferes with daily functioning and quality of life. In clinical studies, this symptomology is assessed, while preclinical models of CWP are limited to nociceptive assays. The aim of the study was to investigate the human-to-model translatability of clinical behavioral assessments for pain and muscle function in a preclinical model of CWP. We assessed correlations between pain behaviors and muscle function in a preclinical model of CWP and in women with fibromyalgia to examine whether similar relationships between outcomes existed in both settings, for usability of clinical assays in model systems. For preclinical measures, the acidic saline model of FM which induces widespread muscle pain, was used in adult female mice. Two gastrocnemius injections of acidic or physiological pH saline were given following baseline measures, five days apart. An array of adapted pain measures and functional assays were assessed for three weeks. For clinical measures, pain and functional assays were assessed in adult women with FM. For both preclinical and clinical outcomes, movement-evoked pain (MEP) was associated with mechanical pain sensitivity. Mechanical sensitivity was correlated to shifts in weight-bearing preclinically and was predictive of functionality in patients. Preclinically, it is imperative to expand how the field assesses pain behaviors when studying multi-symptom disorders like FM. Targeted pain assessments to match those performed clinically is an important aspect of improving preclinical to clinical translatability of animal models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vagus nerve stimulation accelerates motor learning through cholinergic modulation</a></h4>

              
                Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a novel therapeutic option to treat a broad and rapidly expanding set of neurologic conditions. While classically used to treat epilepsy and depression, more recently VNS has received FDA approval as a therapeutic option for stroke rehabilitation and is under preclinical and clinical investigation for other disorders. Despite benefits across a diverse range of neurological disorders, the mechanism for how VNS influences central nervous system circuitry is not well described. A deeper understanding of the influence of VNS on neural circuits and activity is needed to optimize the use of VNS therapy. To define the complex dynamics between VNS, neuronal activity, plasticity, and behavior, we performed chronic VNS in mice during the learning of a dexterous motor task, and leveraged genetic tools to perform optogenetic circuit dissection and longitudinal in vivo imaging calcium activity in cortical neurons. We find VNS has the most robust effect on motor learning when paired with successful movement outcome, while randomized stimulation impairs learning, consistent with VNS serving as a reinforcement cue. In motor cortex, VNS paired with movement outcome selectively modulates neurons that are representing outcome, but not other movement-related neurons. Finally, cholinergic signaling from basal forebrain is required both for VNS-driven improvements in motor learning and the effects on neural activity in M1. This suggests that the effect of VNS on motor learning is mediated by cholinergic signaling, and also presents a novel role for cholinergic signaling in endogenous motor learning. These data imply that VNS therapy may be mediated by augmenting reinforcement cues with precisely-timed cholinergic neuronal activity, presenting strategies for optimizing the use of VNS to treat neurologic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical adaptation to sound reverberation</a></h4>

              
                In almost every natural environment, sounds are reflected by nearby objects, producing many delayed and distorted copies of the original sound, known as reverberation. Our brains usually cope well with reverberation, allowing us to recognize sound sources regardless of their environments. In contrast, reverberation can cause severe difficulties for speech recognition algorithms and hearing-impaired people. The present study examines how the auditory system copes with reverberation. We trained a linear model to recover a rich set of natural, anechoic sounds from their simulated reverberant counterparts. The model neurons achieved this by extending the inhibitory component of their receptive filters for more reverberant spaces, and did so in a frequency-dependent manner. These predicted effects were observed in the responses of auditory cortical neurons of ferrets in the same simulated reverberant environments. Together, these results suggest that auditory cortical neurons adapt to reverberation by adjusting their filtering properties in a manner consistent with dereverberation.

                Development of self-regulatory competencies during adolescence is partially dependent on normative brain maturation. Here we report that juvenile rats as compared to adults exhibit impulsive and compulsive-like behavioral traits, the latter being associated with lower expression of mRNA levels of the immediate early gene zif268 in the anterior insula (AI). This observation suggests that deficits in AI function in juvenile rats could explain their immature pattern of interoceptive cue integration in rational decision-making and compulsive phenotype. In support of this, here we report hypoexcitability of juvenile layer-V pyramidal neurons in the AI, concomitant with reduced glutamatergic synaptic input to these cells. Chemogenetic activation of the AI attenuated the compulsive trait suggesting that delayed maturation of the AI results in suboptimal integration of sensory and cognitive information in adolescents and this contributes to inflexible behaviors in specific conditions of reward availability.

                Modular structures in the brain play a central role in compositionality and intelligence, however the general mechanisms driving module emergence have remained elusive. Studying entorhinal grid cells as paradigmatic examples of modular architecture and function, we demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of a small number of discrete spatial and functional modules from an interplay between continuously varying lateral interactions generated by smooth cortical gradients. We derive a comprehensive analytic theory of modularization, revealing that the process is highly generic with its robustness deriving from topological origins. The theory generates universal predictions for the sequence of grid period ratios, furnishing the most accurate explanation of grid cell data to date. Altogether, this work reveals novel principles by which simple bottom-up dynamical interactions lead to macroscopic modular organization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural population dynamics underlying evidence accumulation in multiple rat brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence in service of sensory decision making is a core cognitive function. However, previous work has focused either on the dynamics of neural activity during decision-making or on models of evidence accumulation governing behavior. We unify these two perspectives by introducing an evidence-accumulation framework that simultaneously describes multi-neuron population spiking activity and dynamic stimulus-driven behavior during sensory decision-making. We apply our method to behavioral choices and neural activity recorded from three brain regions - the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the frontal orienting fields (FOF), and the anterior-dorsal striatum (ADS) - while rats performed a pulse-based accumulation task. The model accurately captures the relationship between stimuli and neural activity, the coordinated activity of neural populations, and the distribution of animal choices in response to the stimulus. Model fits show strikingly distinct accumulation models expressed within each brain region, and that all differ strongly from the accumulation strategy expressed at the level of choices. In particular, the FOF exhibited a suboptimal 'primacy' strategy, where early sensory evidence was favored. Including neural data in the model led to improved prediction of the moment-by-moment value of accumulated evidence and the intended-and ultimately made-choice of the animal. Our approach offers a window into the neural representation of accumulated evidence and provides a principled framework for incorporating neural responses into accumulation models.

                Deposition of amyloid beta (A?) along with glia cell-mediated neuroinflammation are prominent pathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, impairment of autophagy has been found to be another important feature, contributing to AD progression and aging. Therefore, we assessed the effect of the autophagy activator Spermidine, a small body-endogenous polyamine often used as dietary supplement and known to promote longevity, on glia cell-mediated neuroinflammation. Spermidine reduced TLR3- and TLR4-mediated inflammatory processes in microglia and astrocytes by decreasing cytotoxicity, inflammasome activity and NF-?B signaling. In line with these anti-inflammatory effects, oral treatment of the amyloid prone AD-like APPPS1 mice with Spermidine reduced neuroinflammation and neurotoxic soluble A?. Mechanistically, single nuclei sequencing revealed microglia as one of the main targets of Spermidine treatment, with increased expression of genes implicated in cell motility and phagocytosis. Thus, Spermidine provides a promising therapeutic potential to target glia cells in AD progression.

	<p>Chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause permanent disability and thereby negatively affect patients, families, and society. Currently, there is no effective treatment for patients with chronic TBI. One possible option is granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which has potential neuroregenerative and neuroprotective effects through its ability to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells and increase neurogenic growth factor levels. Previous studies have shown that G-CSF administration is safe for patients with neurological diseases such as stroke and dementia. The present study aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of G-CSF use in patients with chronic TBI. Methods: 38 patients with chronic TBI were administered 3-day rounds of G-CSF (10 μg/kg per day) once a month for 6 months. These patients were clinically evaluated using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS). Laboratory measures of the leucocyte counts and differential count percentage were also assessed. Results: At the 6-month follow-up, further assessment showed that patients tolerated the treatment well with only mild and transient side effects being observed. Further clinical evaluation showed significant improvements in mRS and KPS after G-CSF treatment. Laboratory results also confirmed the action of the medication, with increased leukocytosis and band forms. Conclusions: The results suggest that 6-month chronic G-CSF treatment is safe for patients with chronic TBI and may provide clinical benefits and neurological improvements. The adverse effects of the treatment, however, are transient and usually tolerable. Thus, these preliminary findings suggest that future clinical trials of G-CSF use in patients with chronic TBI are warranted.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This study explored the effect of short vestibular and cognitive training on the reading speed in dyslexic children. (2) Methods: The reading speed was evaluated by using a reading test (Évaluation de la Lecture en FluencE, ELFE) in a crossover design before (baseline) and after vestibular training (post VT) and no vestibular training (post no VT). Nineteen dyslexic children (9.48 ± 0.15 years) participated in the study. The vestibular and cognitive training (software developed by BeonSolution S.r.l.) consisted in four exercises presented on a Wacom tablet 10″ done for 16 min per session two times per week for four weeks; each exercise was composed of eight levels with increased difficulty. (3) Results: Following vestibular and cognitive training, dyslexic children increased their reading speed; interestingly, such an increase persisted at least one month after training. (4) Conclusions: Vestibular and cognitive training could improve the vestibular network, which is well known for being involved in several cognition functions leading to reading improvement in dyslexic children. Adaptive mechanisms could be responsible for maintaining such improvement for at least one month.</p>

	<p>There is still no effective drug treatment available for Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (CMT). Current management relies on rehabilitation therapy, surgery for skeletal deformities, and symptomatic treatment of pain; fatigue and cramps are frequent complaints that are difficult to treat. The challenge is to find disease-modifying therapies. Several approaches, including gene silencing, to counteract the PMP22 gene overexpression in the most frequent CMT1A type are under investigation. PXT3003 is the compound in the most advanced phase for CMT1A, as a second-phase III trial is ongoing. Gene therapy to substitute defective genes or insert novel ones and compounds acting on pathways important for different CMT types are being developed and tested in animal models. Modulation of the Neuregulin pathway determining myelin thickness is promising for both hypo-demyelinating and hypermyelinating neuropathies; intervention on Unfolded Protein Response seems effective for rescuing misfolded myelin proteins such as P0 in CMT1B. HDAC6 inhibitors improved axonal transport and ameliorated phenotypes in different CMT models. Other potential therapeutic strategies include targeting macrophages, lipid metabolism, and Nav1.8 sodium channel in demyelinating CMT and the P2X7 receptor, which regulates calcium influx into Schwann cells, in CMT1A. Further approaches are aimed at correcting metabolic abnormalities, including the accumulation of sorbitol caused by biallelic mutations in the sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) gene and of neurotoxic glycosphingolipids in HSN1.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous systematic reviews report that arterial hypertension (AHT) is associated with lower performance in cognition in the elderly. However, some studies show that with higher blood pressure, a better cognitive performance is obtained. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between AHT with cognitive performance in the elderly. Methods: the review involved a search on PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO databases from January 1990 to March, 2020 to identify the relationship among AHT and cognitive performance in older people. Results: 1170 articles were identified, 136 complete papers were reviewed, a qualitative analysis of 26 studies and a quantitative analysis of eight studies were carried out. It was found that people with AHT have a lower performance in processing speed SMD = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.54), working memory SMD = 0.28 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.41) in short-term memory and learning SMD = −0.27 (95% CI: −0.37, −0.17) and delayed recall SMD = −0.20 (95% CI: −0.35, −0.05). Only one study found that higher blood pressure was associated with better memory performance. Conclusion: Our results suggest that high blood pressure primarily affects processing speed, working memory, short-term memory and learning and delayed recall.</p>

	<p>The presence of intrathecal IgM synthesis (ITMS) has been associated with an aggressive multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical course. In the present systematic review, we aimed at assessing the prevalence of ITMS among different MS phenotypes. Moreover, we aimed at quantifying the risk of a second relapse in ITMS positive and oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGBs)-positive patients. We selected clinical studies reporting the ITMS prevalence assessed as oligoclonal IgM Bands (OCMBs), lipid-specific OCMBs (LS-OCMBs), and/or as an intrathecal IgM production &amp;amp;gt; 0% (IgMLoc, Reiber formula). The overall prevalence of ITMS was higher in relapsing-remitting (RR) than clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients (40.1% versus 23.8%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001), while was in line with that detected in primary progressive MS (PPMS, 26.7%). Almost all patients (98%) with ITMS had also OCGBs. The risk of having a second relapse was higher in OCGBs positive patients (HR = 2.18, p = 0.007) but much higher in ITMS positive patients (HR = 3.62, p = 0.0005). This study revealed that the prevalence of ITMS is higher in RRMS patients. It suggests that the risk of having a second relapse, previously ascribed to OCGBs, may, to a certain extent, be related to the presence of intrathecal IgM.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Early intervention for children with ASD can help to improve their intellectual ability and reduces autistic symptoms. Multiple clinical researches have suggested that facial phenotypic differences exist between ASD children and typically developing (TD) children. In this research, we propose a practical ASD screening solution using facial images through applying VGG16 transfer learning-based deep learning to a unique ASD dataset of clinically diagnosed children that we collected. Our model produced a 95% classification accuracy and 0.95 F1-score. The only other reported study using facial images to detect ASD was based on the Kaggle ASD Facial Image Dataset, which is an internet search-produced, low-quality, and low-fidelity dataset. Our results support the clinical findings of facial feature differences between children with ASD and TD children. The high F1-score achieved indicates that it is viable to use deep learning models to screen children with ASD. We concluded that the racial and ethnic-related factors in deep-learning based ASD screening with facial images are critical to solution viability and accuracy.</p>

	<p>Altered patterns of brain connectivity have been found in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and associated with specific symptoms and behavioral features. Growing evidence suggests that the autistic peculiarities are not confined to the clinical population but extend along a continuum between healthy and maladaptive conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a differentiated connectivity pattern could also be tracked along the continuum of autistic traits in a non-clinical population. A Granger causality analysis conducted on a resting-state EEG recording showed that connectivity along the posterior-frontal gradient is sensitive to the magnitude of individual autistic traits and mostly conveyed through fast oscillatory activity. Specifically, participants with higher autistic traits were characterized by a prevalence of ascending connections starting from posterior regions ramping the cortical hierarchy. These findings point to the presence of a tendency within the neural mapping of individuals with higher autistic features in conveying proportionally more bottom-up information. This pattern of findings mimics those found in clinical forms of autism, supporting the idea of a neurobiological continuum between autistic traits and ASD.</p>

	<p>Debate exists as to the effects of anxiety in performance-based studies. However, no studies have examined the influence of motivation both in preparation of a motor movement and during movement performance. The present study measured beta activation in preparation for and during execution of the effort expenditure for rewards task (EEfRT), a button-pressing task consisting of easy and hard trials. Results indicated that motor preparation (i.e., reduced beta activation) was greater in preparation for hard trials than for easy trials. Additionally, motor preparation decreased (i.e., beta activation increased) over the course of hard trial execution. These results suggest that motor preparation is enhanced prior to more challenging tasks but that motor preparation declines as participants become closer to completing their goal in each challenging trial. These results provide insight into how beta activation facilitates effort expenditure for motor tasks varying in difficulty and motivation. The impact of these results on models of anxiety and performance is discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Phosphorylation of CREB at Serine 142 and 143 Is Essential for Visual Cortex Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is involved in a myriad of cellular functions in the central nervous system. For instance, the role of CREB via phosphorylation at the amino-acid residue Serine (Ser)133 in expressing plasticity-related genes and activity-dependent neuronal plasticity processes has been extensively demonstrated. However, much less is known about the role of CREB phosphorylation at Ser142 and Ser143. Here, we employed a viral vector containing a dominant negative form of CREB, with serine-to-alanine mutations at residue 142 and 143 to specifically block phosphorylation at both sites. We then transfected this vector into primary neurons <I>in vitro</I> or intracortically injected it into mice <I>in vivo</I>, to test whether these phosphorylation events were important for activity-dependent plasticity. We demonstrated by immunohistochemistry of cortical neuronal cultures that the expression of Arc, a known plasticity-related gene, requires triple phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133, Ser142, and Ser143. Moreover, we recorded visually-evoked field potentials in awake mice before and after a 7-d period of monocular deprivation (MD) to show that, in addition to CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the visual cortex also requires CREB phosphorylation at Ser142/143. Our findings suggest that Ser142/143 phosphorylation is an additional post-translational modification of CREB that triggers the expression of specific target genes and activity-dependent neuronal plasticity processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Cascades Shape Whole-Brain Functional Dynamics at Rest</a></h4>

              
                <p>At rest, mammalian brains display remarkable spatiotemporal complexity, evolving through recurrent functional connectivity (<I>FC</I>) states on a slow timescale of the order of tens of seconds. While the phenomenology of the resting state dynamics is valuable in distinguishing healthy and pathologic brains, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify neuronal cascades as a potential mechanism. Using full-brain network modeling, we show that neuronal populations, coupled via a detailed structural connectome, give rise to large-scale cascades of firing rate fluctuations evolving at the same time scale of resting-state networks (<I>RSNs</I>). The ignition and subsequent propagation of cascades depend on the brain state and connectivity of each region. The largest cascades produce bursts of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) co-fluctuations at pairs of regions across the brain, which shape the simulated <I>RSN</I> dynamics. We experimentally confirm these theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the existence and stability of intermittent epochs of <I>FC</I> comprising BOLD co-activation (CA) bursts in mice and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We then provide evidence for the existence and leading role of the neuronal cascades in humans with simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings. These results show that neuronal cascades are a major determinant of spontaneous fluctuations in brain dynamics at rest.</p>

                Background - Since 2016, the Securities Commission (SC) in Malaysia has given licenses to only eleven P2P lending platforms. Such lending platforms are expected to disrupt the lending services of traditional lenders in the coming years. However, being still in their infant stages, it is essential to know the extent to which such platforms are made known to potential investors out there. This study examines the extent to which young adults are aware of Malaysia's eleven P2P lending platforms.      Methods - A sample of 65 undergraduate students majoring in finance and accounting was used for this pilot study. An online questionnaire was designed with three main parts: demographic, financial literacy, and P2P lending awareness.     Results - Findings show that more than half of respondents in the sample are not aware of P2P lending platforms in Malaysia.  Most of the respondents are financially literate to certain degrees. Those aware of their presence underestimated the potentially high level of their default rates and misunderstood that investor would be fully protected by such platforms when a loan default.     Conclusions -The study's findings have shed light on the current awareness of P2P lending platforms among Malaysian young adults, potential investors of such platforms in the coming years.

Stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of non-essential businesses are powerful, but socially costly, tools to control the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Mass testing strategies, which rely on widely administered frequent and rapid diagnostics to identify and isolate infected individuals, could be a potentially less disruptive management strategy, particularly where vaccine access is limited. In this paper, we assess the extent to which mass testing and isolation strategies can reduce reliance on socially costly non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as distancing and shutdowns. We develop a multi-compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission incorporating both preventative non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and testing and isolation to evaluate their combined effect on public health outcomes. Our model is designed to be a policy-guiding tool that captures important realities of the testing system, including constraints on test administration and non-random testing allocation. We show how strategic changes in the characteristics of the testing system, including test administration, test delays, and test sensitivity, can reduce reliance on preventative NPIs without compromising public health outcomes in the future. The lowest NPI levels are possible only when many tests are administered and test delays are short, given limited immunity in the population. Reducing reliance on NPIs is highly dependent on the ability of a testing program to identify and isolate unreported, asymptomatic infections. Changes in NPIs, including the intensity of lockdowns and stay at home orders, should be coordinated with increases in testing to ensure epidemic control; otherwise small additional lifting of these NPIs can lead to dramatic increases in infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Importantly, our results can be used to guide ramp-up of testing capacity in outbreak settings, allow for the flexible design of combined interventions based on social context, and inform future cost-benefit analyses to identify efficient pandemic management strategies.

Experimental data about gene functions curated from the primary literature have enormous value for research scientists in understanding biology. Using the Gene Ontology (GO), manual curation by experts has provided an important resource for studying gene function, especially within model organisms. Unprecedented expansion of the scientific literature and validation of the predicted proteins have increased both data value and the challenges of keeping pace. Capturing literature-based functional annotations is limited by the ability of biocurators to handle the massive and rapidly growing scientific literature. Within the community-oriented wiki framework for GO annotation called the Gene Ontology Normal Usage Tracking System (GONUTS), we describe an approach to expand biocuration through crowdsourcing with undergraduates. This multiplies the number of high-quality annotations in international databases, enriches our coverage of the literature on normal gene function, and pushes the field in new directions. From an intercollegiate competition judged by experienced biocurators, Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies (CACAO), we have contributed nearly 5,000 literature-based annotations. Many of those annotations are to organisms not currently well-represented within GO. Over a 10-year history, our community contributors have spurred changes to the ontology not traditionally covered by professional biocurators. The CACAO principle of relying on community members to participate in and shape the future of biocuration in GO is a powerful and scalable model used to promote the scientific enterprise. It also provides undergraduate students with a unique and enriching introduction to critical reading of primary literature and acquisition of marketable skills.

Fifth generation networks (5G) will be associated with a partial shift to higher carrier frequencies, including wavelengths of insects. This may lead to higher absorption of radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) by insects and could cause dielectric heating. The yellow fever mosquito (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>), a vector for diseases such as yellow and dengue fever, favors warm climates. Being exposed to higher frequency RF EMFs causing possible dielectric heating, could have an influence on behavior, physiology and morphology, and could be a possible factor for introduction of the species in regions where the yellow fever mosquito normally does not appear. In this study, the influence of far field RF exposure on <i>A</i>. <i>aegypti</i> was examined between 2 and 240 GHz. Using Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations, the distribution of the electric field in and around the insect and the absorbed RF power were found for six different mosquito models (three male, three female). The 3D models were created from micro-CT scans of real mosquitoes. The dielectric properties used in the simulation were measured from a mixture of homogenized <i>A</i>. <i>aegypti</i>. For a given incident RF power, the absorption increases with increasing frequency between 2 and 90 GHz with a maximum between 90 and 240 GHz. The absorption was maximal in the region where the wavelength matches the size of the mosquito. For a same incident field strength, the power absorption by the mosquito is 16 times higher at 60 GHz than at 6 GHz. The higher absorption of RF power by future technologies can result in dielectric heating and potentially influence the biology of this mosquito.

The spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 presents many challenges to healthcare systems and infrastructures across the world, exacerbating inequalities and leaving the world’s most vulnerable populations most affected. Given their density and available infrastructure, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements can be particularly susceptible to disease spread. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach to simulating the spread of disease in refugee and IDP settlements under various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model, based on the June open-source framework, is informed by data on geography, demographics, comorbidities, physical infrastructure and other parameters obtained from real-world observations and previous literature. The development and testing of this approach focuses on the Cox’s Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh, although our model is designed to be generalizable to other informal settings. Our findings suggest the encouraging self-isolation at home of mild to severe symptomatic patients, as opposed to the isolation of all positive cases in purpose-built isolation and treatment centers, does not increase the risk of secondary infection meaning the centers can be used to provide hospital support to the most intense cases of COVID-19. Secondly we find that mask wearing in all indoor communal areas can be effective at dampening viral spread, even with low mask efficacy and compliance rates. Finally, we model the effects of reopening learning centers in the settlement under various mitigation strategies. For example, a combination of mask wearing in the classroom, halving attendance regularity to enable physical distancing, and better ventilation can almost completely mitigate the increased risk of infection which keeping the learning centers open may cause. These modeling efforts are being incorporated into decision making processes to inform future planning, and further exercises should be carried out in similar geographies to help protect those most vulnerable.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We evaluated whether genetically-elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with lower risk of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage (IA/SAH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study. Our primary analysis used the inverse-variance weighted method. In secondary analyses, we implemented the MR-PRESSO method, restricted our analysis to LDL-C specific instruments, and performed multivariable MR.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One mmol/L increase of genetically-instrumented LDL-C levels was associated with a 17% lower risk of IA/SAH (OR=0.83; 95%CI=0.73-0.94; p=0.004). Results remained consistent in secondary and multivariable analyses (all p&lt;0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) complex are heterogeneous and vary in dendritic morphology, cell shape, spine and axon presence, soma size, and orientation to surrounding fibers. An example of 7, Golgi-stained neurons with five primary dendrites and their location (inset) in this composite sagittal section illustrates a spectrum of dendritic arbors and these other features. Arrows point to the direction of fibers in the TRN. Greatest soma length (<i>L</i>) is indicated. Neurons in the inset, enlarged views of neurons, and enclosed boxes are coded with similar colors.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical structure influencing information transfer to the forebrain. In crocodilians, the TRN shares many features with its mammalian counterpart. One area that has not been explored is how individual neurons in the crocodilian TRN compare with those found in mammals. In mammals, TRN neurons are aligned parallel to the external border of the dorsal thalamus, have their dendrites oriented perpendicular to the fibers in the internal capsule, have fine, filamentous dendritic appendages, are either bipolar or multipolar, and are commonly considered to be a homogeneous morphological population of cells. To investigate the cellular morphology of the TRN complex, a Golgi analysis was undertaken in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>. This study examined features that have been used in mammals. In <i>Alligator</i>, the four TRN divisions are the dorsal peduncular nucleus, the perireticular nucleus, the interstitial nucleus, and the neurons in the medial forebrain bundle associated with the interstitial nucleus. In crocodilians, the dorsal peduncular nucleus is homologous to the TRN of mammals. From the 1787 drawn neuron profiles in the traditional three planes of section, the following were concluded. First, neurons in each part of the TRN complex in <i>Alligator</i> were similar in morphology. Second, each part of the TRN complex of <i>Alligator</i> contained a heterogenous population of cells. These variations between the cellular morphology of the dorsal peduncular nucleus of crocodilians and the TRN of mammals are speculated to partly result from differences in forebrain organization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">A causal role for the pulvinar in coordinating task‐independent cortico–cortical interactions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pulvinar is the largest nucleus in the primate thalamus and has topographically organized connections with multiple cortical areas, thereby forming extensive cortico-pulvino-cortical input–output loops. Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a <i>causal</i> role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico–cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task-dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large-scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (lateral intraparietal area [LIP]) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4–15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4–15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large-scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.</p>

     alt="The synaptic inputs and thalamic projections of two classes of layer 6 corticothalamic neurons in primary somatosensory cortex of the mouse"/>
<p>Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6 CThNs) in primary somatosensory cortex of the rodent are morphologically diverse. This study shows that one class of L6 CThNs receives more widespread presynaptic inputs than the other and projects to different regions of the thalamic reticular nucleus, suggesting that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in somatosensory cortex.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although corticothalamic neurons (CThNs) represent the largest source of synaptic input to thalamic neurons, their role in regulating thalamocortical interactions remains incompletely understood. CThNs in sensory cortex have historically been divided into two types, those with cell bodies in Layer 6 (L6) that project back to primary sensory thalamic nuclei and those with cell bodies in Layer 5 (L5) that project to higher-order thalamic nuclei and subcortical structures. Recently, diversity among L6 CThNs has increasingly been appreciated. In the rodent somatosensory cortex, two major classes of L6 CThNs have been identified: one projecting to the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM-only L6 CThNs) and one projecting to both VPM and the posterior medial nucleus (VPM/POm L6 CThNs). Using rabies-based tracing methods in mice, we asked whether these L6 CThN populations integrate similar synaptic inputs. We found that both types of L6 CThNs received local input from somatosensory cortex and thalamic input from VPM and POm. However, VPM/POm L6 CThNs received significantly more input from a number of additional cortical areas, higher order thalamic nuclei, and subcortical structures. We also found that the two types of L6 CThNs target different functional regions within the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Together, our results indicate that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in the somatosensory cortex and suggest that VPM-only L6 CThNs regulate, via their more restricted circuits, sensory responses related to a cortical column while VPM/POm L6 CThNs, which are integrated into more widespread POm-related circuits, relay contextual information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Distinct burst properties contribute to the functional diversity of thalamic nuclei</a></h4>

     alt="Distinct burst properties contribute to the functional diversity of thalamic nuclei"/>
<p>We used intracellular recordings from six thalamic nuclei and compartmental models to investigate the properties of rebound bursts in first-order (FO) and higher-order (HO) nuclei and the implications of burst properties for thalamocortical transmission and oscillatory bursting. We found that:
</p>
<p>
Bursts had distinct properties in FO neurons: dLGN had bursts with few spikes/burst (<i>S</i>; <i>figure shows averages</i>) and relatively long latencies to the first spike (<i>L</i>; <i>in ms</i>); bursts in vMGB and VP had shorter latencies, but bursts in VP had more spikes/burst. HO cells had consistent burst properties across sensory modalities; on average, HO neurons had more spikes per burst and longer latencies than FO.
The number of spikes/burst and latency determine different release probabilities and the effectiveness of transmission at thalamocortical synapses.
The latency to burst limits the oscillatory frequency of rebound bursting to about 15 Hz in most FO neurons and to 10 Hz or less in many HO cells.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thalamic neurons fire spikes in two modes, burst and tonic. The function of burst firing is unclear, but the evidence suggests that bursts are more effective at activating cortical cells, and that postinhibition rebound bursting contributes to thalamocortical oscillations during sleep. Bursts are considered stereotyped signals; however, there is limited evidence regarding how burst properties compare across thalamic nuclei of different functional or anatomical organization. Here, we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings and compartmental modeling to investigate the properties of bursts in six sensory thalamic nuclei, to study the mechanisms that can lead to different burst properties, and to assess the implications of different burst properties for thalamocortical transmission and oscillatory functions. We found that bursts in higher-order cells on average had higher number of spikes and longer latency to the first spike. Additionally, burst features in first-order neurons were determined by sensory modality. Shifting the voltage-dependence and density of the T-channel conductance in a compartmental model replicates the burst properties from the intracellular recordings, pointing to molecular mechanisms that can generate burst diversity. Furthermore, the model predicts that bursts with higher number of spikes will drastically reduce the effectiveness of thalamocortical transmission. In addition, the latency to burst limited the rebound oscillatory frequency in modeled cells. These results demonstrate that burst properties vary according to the thalamocortical hierarchy and with sensory modality. The findings imply that, while in burst mode, thalamocortical transmission and firing frequency will be determined by the number of spikes and latency to burst.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nociceptive markers in mice have been identified in two distinct peptidergic and nonpeptidergic neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and distributed in different laminae of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Recently, however, a study in humans showed a significant overlapping in these two populations. In this study, we investigated the distribution of various nociceptive markers in the lumbar DRG and spinal cord of the dromedary camel. Immunohistochemical data showed a remarkable percentage of total neurons in the DRG expressed IB4 binding (54.5%), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; 49.5%), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1; 48.2%), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS; 30.6%). The co-localization data showed that 89.6% and 74.0% of CGRP- and TRPV1-labeled neurons, respectively, were IB4 positive. In addition, 61.6% and 84.2% of TRPV1- and NOS-immunoreactive neurons, respectively, were also co-localized with CGRP. The distribution of IB4, CGRP, TRPV1, substance P, and NOS immunoreactivities in the spinal cord were observed in lamina I and outer lamina II (IIo). Quantitative data showed that 82.4% of IB4-positive nerve terminals in laminae I and IIo were co-localized with CGRP, and 86.0% of CGRP-labeled terminals were co-localized with IB4. Similarly, 85.1% of NOS-labeled nerve terminals were co-localized with CGRP. No neuropeptide Y (NPY) or cholecystokinin (CCK) immunoreactivities were detected in the DRG, and no co-localization between IB4, NPY, and CCK were observed in the spinal cord. Our results demonstrate marked convergence of nociceptive markers in the primary afferent neurons in camels, which is similar to humans rather than the mouse. The data also emphasizes the importance of interspecies differences when selecting ideal animal models for studying nociception and treating chronic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Proactive measures to eradicate Malaysia’s poverty in IR4.0 era: a shared prosperity vision [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the country’s shared prosperity vision, Malaysia aspires to uplift the bottom 40% household income group (B40) by addressing wealth and income disparities. By 2030, the nation seeks to eradicate poverty through the provision of employment opportunities and career progression plans. A grey area between the nation’s aspirations and actions in practice can be observed because the goals have not been achieved despite numerous efforts aimed at the upliftment of the B40 group. The nation is still way behind its targeted outcomes despite various policies being implemented, which could be attributed to the mismatch between government policies and that of organisational practice. Thus, this study explores the rationale of strategic government intervention in managing B40 talent in the IR4.0 era. Methods: A general qualitative inquiry method that used 11 semi-structured interviews was carried out with representatives of Malaysia’s policy makers’, training providers, and trainees. All Interview questions centred around measures, importance and outcomes of B40 youth training from a multi-stakeholder perspective. Data were thematically analysed in five stages using NVivo. Results: Training, which includes IR4.0 era digital skills, is the key to uplifting the B40 youth to eradicate poverty. Proactive measures are imperative in the success of B40 youth training towards poverty eradication. Conclusions: This study contributes to the existing literature and helps practitioners by addressing the current gap in Malaysia’s aspirations versus organisational practice. Stakeholders should formulate proactive strategies to ensure that the right trainees are matched with the right training providers and government policies. A linkage between government policies and industry requirements needs to be established as opposed to the present discontinuity. A structured training needs analysis should be applied through a collaboration between industries and governments. Then, B40 individuals commonly found in lower-level positions can be pooled into the career pathway towards a shift into M40.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A synaptic learning rule for exploiting nonlinear dendritic computation</a></h4>

              
                Bicknell and Häusser develop a theoretical approach for investigating single-neuron computation and learning. By deriving a plasticity rule that optimally adjusts the strengths of interacting synapses to control somatic spiking, they show that neurons can learn to harness the biophysical properties of their dendrites to perform nonlinear computations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decoding subjective emotional arousal from eeg during an immersive virtual reality experience</a></h4>

              
                Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables naturalistic neuroscientific studies while maintaining experimental control, but dynamic and interactive stimuli pose methodological challenges. We here probed the link between emotional arousal, a fundamental property of affective experience, and parieto-occipital alpha power under naturalistic stimulation: 37 young healthy adults completed an immersive VR experience, which included rollercoaster rides, while their EEG was recorded. They then continuously rated their subjective emotional arousal while viewing a replay of their experience. The association between emotional arousal and parieto-occipital alpha power was tested and confirmed by (1) decomposing the continuous EEG signal while maximizing the comodulation between alpha power and arousal ratings and by (2) decoding periods of high and low arousal with discriminative common spatial patterns and a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network. We successfully combine EEG and a naturalistic immersive VR experience to extend previous findings on the neurophysiology of emotional arousal towards real-world neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phagocytic 'teeth' and myosin-II 'jaw' power target constriction during phagocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Phagocytosis requires rapid actin reorganization and spatially controlled force generation to ingest targets ranging from pathogens to apoptotic cells. How actomyosin activity directs membrane extensions to engulf such diverse targets remains unclear. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) with microparticle traction force microscopy (MP-TFM) to quantify actin dynamics and subcellular forces during macrophage phagocytosis. We show that spatially localized forces leading to target constriction are prominent during phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized targets. This constriction is largely driven by Arp2/3-mediated assembly of discrete actin protrusions containing myosin 1e and 1f ('teeth') that appear to be interconnected in a ring-like organization. Contractile myosin-II activity contributes to late-stage phagocytic force generation and progression, supporting a specific role in phagocytic cup closure. Observations of partial target eating attempts and sudden target release via a popping mechanism suggest that constriction may be critical for resolving complex <i>in vivo</i> target encounters. Overall, our findings present a phagocytic cup-shaping mechanism that is distinct from cytoskeletal remodeling in 2D cell motility and may contribute to mechanosensing and phagocytic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), a key checkpoint in reprogramming of regulatory T cells metabolism and function</a></h4>

              
                Cellular metabolism has key roles in T cells differentiation and function. CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper-1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 subsets are highly glycolytic while regulatory T cells (Tregs) use glucose during expansion but rely on fatty acid oxidation for function. Upon uptake, glucose can enter pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) or be used in glycolysis. Here, we showed that blocking 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) in the oxidative PPP resulted in substantial reduction of Tregs suppressive function and shifts toward Th1, Th2, and Th17 phenotypes which led to the development of fetal inflammatory disorder in mice model. These in turn improved anti-tumor responses and worsened the outcomes of colitis model. Metabolically, 6PGD blocked Tregs showed improved glycolysis and enhanced non-oxidative PPP to support nucleotide biosynthesis. These results uncover critical role of 6PGD in modulating Tregs plasticity and function, which qualifies it as a novel metabolic checkpoint for immunotherapy applications.

                Continuous adaptation allows survival in an ever-changing world. Adjustments in the synaptic coupling strength between neurons are essential for this capability, setting us apart from simpler, hard-wired organisms. How these changes can be mathematically described at the phenomenological level, as so-called ‘plasticity rules’, is essential both for understanding biological information processing and for developing cognitively performant artificial systems. We suggest an automated approach for discovering biophysically plausible plasticity rules based on the definition of task families, associated performance measures and biophysical constraints. By evolving compact symbolic expressions, we ensure the discovered plasticity rules are amenable to intuitive understanding, fundamental for successful communication and human-guided generalization. We successfully apply our approach to typical learning scenarios and discover previously unknown mechanisms for learning efficiently from rewards, recover efficient gradient-descent methods for learning from target signals, and uncover various functionally equivalent STDP-like rules with tuned homeostatic mechanisms.

                Background: Altered activity of the ventral pallidum (VP) underlies disrupted motivation after stress exposure. The VP is a very heterogeneous structure comprised of many different neuron types with distinct electrophysiological properties and projections. Neuronal PAS 1-positive (Npas1+) VP neurons are thought to send projections to brain regions critical for stress response. In this study, we evaluated how activity of VP Npas1+ neurons affect emotional behaviors and responses to social stress. Methods: We used a chemogenetic approach to manipulate VP Npas1+ neurons during social defeat stress (SDS) and behavioral tasks related to anxiety and motivation in Npas1-Cre mice. We employed a similar approach in females using the chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS). Finally, to characterize VP Npas1+ neuron circuitry and molecular identity we evaluated the projection targets of the VP Npas1+ neurons and performed RNA-seq on ribosome-associated mRNA from VP Npas1+ neurons. Results: Chemogenetic activation of VP Npas1+ neurons increased susceptibility to a subthreshold (S)SDS and anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and open field. Inhibition of VP Npas1+ neurons enhanced resilience to chronic (C)SDS and CWDS. We identified VP Npas1+ projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), medial and lateral habenula (LHb), lateral hypothalamus (LH), thalamus, medial and lateral septum, and periaqueductal gray area. VP Npas1+ neurons displayed distinct transcriptomes representing distinct biological processes. Conclusions: Activity, of VP Npas1+ neurons, modulates susceptibility to social stressors and anxiety-like behavior. These outcomes could be related to their projections to brain regions that modulate reward and aversion.

                Syllable sequences in male mouse ultrasonic-vocalizations (USVs), songs, contain structure - quantified through predictability, like birdsong and aspects of speech. Apparent USV innateness and lack of learnability, discount mouse USVs for modelling speech-like social communication and its deficits. Informative contextual natural sequences (SN) were theoretically extracted and they were preferred by female mice. Primary auditory cortex (A1) supragranular neurons show differential selectivity to the same syllables in SN and random sequences (SR). Excitatory neurons (EXNs) in females showed increases in selectivity to whole SNs over SRs based on extent of social exposure with male, but syllable selectivity remained unchanged. Thus mouse A1 single neurons adaptively represent entire order of acoustic units without altering selectivity of individual units, fundamental to speech perception. Additionally, observed plasticity was replicated with silencing of somatostatin positive neurons, which had plastic effects opposite to EXNs, thus pointing out possible pathways involved in perception of sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Left angular gyrus disconnection impairs multiplication fact retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Arithmetic fact retrieval has been suggested to recruit a left-lateralized network comprising perisylvian language areas, parietal areas such as the angular gyrus (AG), and subcortical structures such as the hippocampus. However, the underlying white matter connectivity of these areas has not been evaluated systematically so far. Using simple multiplication problems, we evaluated how disconnections in parietal brain areas affected arithmetic fact retrieval following stroke. We derived disconnectivity measures by jointly considering data from n=73 patients with acute unilateral lesions in either hemisphere and a white-matter tractography atlas (HCP-842) using the Lesion Quantification Toolbox (LQT). Whole-brain voxel-based analysis indicated a left-hemispheric cluster of white matter fibers connecting the AG and superior temporal areas to be associated with a fact retrieval deficit. Subsequent analyses of direct grey-to-grey matter disconnections revealed that disconnections of additional left-hemispheric areas (e.g., between the superior temporal gyrus and parietal areas) were significantly associated with the observed fact retrieval deficit. Results imply that disconnections of parietal areas (i.e., the AG) with language-related areas (i.e., superior and middle temporal gyri) seem specifically detrimental to arithmetic fact retrieval. This suggests that arithmetic fact retrieval recruits a widespread left-hemispheric network and emphasizes the relevance of white matter connectivity for number processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Insights into Early Word Comprehension: Tracking the Neural Representations of Word Semantics in Infants.</a></h4>

              
                Infants start developing rudimentary language skills and can start understanding simple words well before their first birthday. This development has also been shown primarily using Event Related Potential (ERP) techniques to find evidence of word comprehension in the infant brain. While these works validate the presence of semantic representations of words (word meaning) in infants, they do not tell us about the mental processes involved in the manifestation of these semantic representations or the content of the representations. To this end, we use a decoding approach where we employ machine learning techniques on Electroencephalography (EEG) data to predict the semantic representations of words found in the brain activity of infants. We perform multiple analyses to explore word semantic representations in two groups of infants (9-month-old and 12-month-old). Our analyses show significantly above chance decodability of overall word semantics, word animacy, and word phonetics. As we analyze brain activity, we observe that participants in both age groups show signs of word comprehension immediately after word onset, marked by our model's significantly above chance word prediction accuracy. We also observed strong neural representations of word phonetics in the brain data for both age groups, some likely correlated to word decoding accuracy and others not. Lastly, we discover that the neural representations of word semantics are similar in both infant age groups. Our results on word semantics, phonetics, and animacy decodability, give us insights into the evolution of neural representation of word meaning in infants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mesodiencephalic junction Gabaergic inputs are processed separately from motor cortical inputs in the basilar pons</a></h4>

              
                The basilar pontine nuclei (bPN) receive inputs from the entire neocortex and constitute the main source of mossy fibers to the cerebellum. Despite their critical position in the cortico-cerebellar pathway, it remains unclear if and how the bPN process inputs. An important unresolved question is whether the bPN strictly receives excitatory inputs or also receives inhibitory inputs. In the present study, we identified the mesodiencephalic junction as a prominent source of GABAergic afferents to the bPN. We combined optogenetics and whole-cell patch clamp recordings and confirmed that the bPN indeed receives monosynaptic GABA inputs from this region. Furthermore, we found no evidence that these inhibitory inputs converge with motor cortex (M1) inputs at the single neuron level. We also found no evidence of any connectivity between bPN neurons, suggesting the absence of a local circuit. Finally, rabies tracings revealed that GABAergic MDJ neurons themselves receive prominent inputs from neocortical output neurons. Our data indicates that inhibition from the MDJ, and excitation from the neocortex remain separate streams of information through the bPN. It is therefore unlikely that inhibition in the bPN has a gating function, but rather shapes an appropriate output of the bPN during behavior.

                Learning and consolidation of new motor skills require adaptations of neuronal activity and connectivity in the motor cortex and striatum, two key motor regions of the brain. Yet, how neurons undergo synaptic changes and become recruited during motor learning to form a memory engram remains an open question. Here, we train mice on a single-pellet reaching motor learning task and use a genetic approach to identify and manipulate behavior-relevant neurons selectively in the primary motor cortex (M1). We find that the degree of reactivation of M1 engram neurons correlates strongly with motor performance. We further demonstrate that learning-induced dendritic spine reorganization specifically occurs in these M1 engram neurons. In addition, we find that motor learning leads to an increase in the number and strength of outputs from M1 engram neurons onto striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and that these synapses form local clusters along SPN dendrites. These results identify a highly specific synaptic plasticity during the formation of long-lasting motor memory traces in the corticostriatal circuit.

                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1). While mutant ATXN1 is expressed throughout the brain, SCA1 is characterized by severe degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and cerebellar gliosis. It is likely that cerebellar microenvironment and in particular glial cells contribute to the Purkinje cell specific vulnerability in SCA1. We have used single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA seq) to uncover effects of mutant ATXN1 on PCs gene expression changes as well as non-cell autonomous changes in glial cells transcriptomes in cerebella of Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] mice, a transgenic SCA1 mouse model expressing mutant ATXN1 only in PCs cells

Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmosets, a model of MS that recapitulates focal cerebral MS lesions, we investigated whether remyelination can be detected and characterized noninvasively. In 6 animals followed with multisequence 7-tesla MRI, 36 focal lesions, classified as demyelinated or remyelinated based on signal intensity on proton density-weighted images, were subsequently assessed with histopathology. Remyelination occurred in 5 of 6 marmosets and 51% of lesions. Radiological-pathological comparison showed high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (90%) for detecting remyelination by in vivo MRI. This study demonstrates the prevalence of spontaneous remyelination in marmoset EAE and the ability of in vivo MRI to detect it, with implications for preclinical testing of pro-remyelinating agents and translation to clinical practice.

                As a regressive neurodevelopmental disorder with a well-established genetic cause, Rett Syndrome and its Mecp2 loss-of-function mouse model provide an excellent opportunity to define potentially translatable functional signatures of disease progression, as well as offer insight into Mecp2's role in functional circuit development. Thus, we applied optical fluorescence imaging to assess mesoscale calcium functional connectivity (FC) in the Mecp2 cortex prior to symptom onset as well as during decline. We found that FC was profoundly disrupted in Mecp2 males both in juvenile development and early adulthood. Female Mecp2 mice displayed a subtle homotopic contralateral increase in motor cortex as juveniles but not in adulthood, where instead parietal regions were implicated. Additionally, conditional rescue studies indicated FC phenotypes are driven by excitatory neurons. Altogether, the female results identify subtle candidate translatable biomarkers of disease progression, while the male results indicate MeCP2 protein is needed in a circuit-specific manner for FC.

                Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Separate lines of evidence suggest that synapses and astrocytes could play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying disease. Given that astrocytes make specialised contacts with some synapses, called tripartite synapses, we hypothesise that tripartite synapses could act as the fulcrum of ALS disease. We have performed an extensive microscopy-based analyses to investigate synapses and tripartite synapses in ALS mouse spinal cords. We reveal widescale synaptic changes at the early symptomatic stages of the SOD1G93a mouse models. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that large complex postsynaptic structures are lost in ALS mice. Most surprisingly, tripartite synapses are selectively lost in ALS while non-tripartite synapses remain in equal number to healthy controls. Finally, we also observe that human post-mortem spinal cords display a similar selective loss of tripartite synapses. From these data we conclude that tripartite synaptopathy is a key hallmark of ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parameter and model recovery of reinforcement learning models for restless bandit problems</a></h4>

              
                Multi-armed restless bandit tasks are regularly applied in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to assess exploration and exploitation behavior in structured environments. These models are also readily applied to examine effects of (virtual) brain lesions on performance, and to infer neurocomputational mechanisms using neuroimaging or pharmacological approaches. However, to infer individual, psychologically meaningful parameters from such data, computational cognitive modeling is typically applied. Recent studies indicate that softmax (SM) decision rule models that include a representation of environmental dynamics (e.g. the Kalman Filter) and additional parameters for modeling exploration and perseveration (Kalman SMEP) fit human bandit task data better than competing models. Parameter and model recovery are two central requirements for computational models: parameter recovery refers to the ability to recover true data-generating parameters; model recovery refers to the ability to correctly identify the true data generating model using model comparison techniques. Here we comprehensively examined parameter and model recovery of the Kalman SMEP model as well as nested model versions, i.e. models without the additional parameters, using simulation and Bayesian inference. Parameter recovery improved with increasing trial numbers, from around .8 for 100 trials to around .93 for 300 trials. Model recovery analyses likewise confirmed acceptable recovery of the Kalman SMEP model. Model recovery was lower for nested Kalman filter models as well as delta rule models with fixed learning rates.

Exploratory analyses examined associations of model parameters with model-free performance metrics. Random exploration, captured by the inverse softmax temperature, was associated with lower accuracy and more switches. For the exploration bonus parameter modeling directed exploration, we confirmed an inverse-U-shaped association with accuracy, such that both an excess and a lack of directed exploration reduced accuracy. Taken together, these analyses underline that the Kalman SMEP model fulfills basic requirements of a cognitive model.

                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is characterized by inflammation and focal areas of demyelination, ultimately resulting in axonal degradation and neuronal loss. Several lines of evidence point towards a role for microglia and other brain macrophages in disease initiation and progression, but exactly how lesion formation is triggered is currently unknown. Here, we characterized early changes in MS brain tissue through transcriptomic analysis of normal appearing white matter (NAWM). We found that NAWM was characterized by enriched expression of genes associated with inflammation and cellular stress derived from brain macrophages. Single cell RNA sequencing confirmed an early stress response in brain macrophages in NAWM and identified specific macrophage subsets that associate with different stages of demyelinating lesions. These early changes associated with lesion development in MS brain tissue may provide therapeutic targets to limit lesion progression and demyelination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia-specific promoter activities of human HexB gene</a></h4>

              
                Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated genetic targeting of microglia remains challenging. Overcoming this hurdle is essential for the eradication of HIV reservoirs in the central nervous system (CNS) wherein microglia harbor the main HIV reservoirs. Here, we characterized the minimal/native promoter of the HexB gene, which is known to be specifically and stably expressed in the microglia under homeostasis and pathological conditions. Dual reporter and serial deletion assays identified the critical role of the natural 5 untranslated region (-97 bp related to the first ATG) in driving transcriptional activity of mouse HexB gene. The native promoter region of mouse, human and monkey HexB located at -135, -134 and -170 bp to the first ATG, respectively. These promoters were highly active and specific in microglia with strong cross-species transcriptional activity, but had no activities in primary astrocytes. To further exploit microglia specific promoters, we identified a 135 bp CD68 gene promoter, similar to 134 bp HexB gene, was highly active in microglia but not in astrocytes. These data suggest that the novel microglia-specific HexB promoter can be an ideal candidate for specific microglia-targeting AAV gene therapy, which could be developed for HIV proviral eradication in the CNS.

SummaryIt is hard to overstate the importance of gene therapy that can remove viral genes from human cells. A cure for HIV would mean a lifestyle free of treatment for patients who must constantly ensure that they are maintaining a strict regimen of ART indefinitely. In order to develop a cure using AAV delivery of HIV eradicator, DNA must meet the viral size limitations, and the genes must be expressed appropriately. Previous studies have identified microglia-specific HexB gene that shows stable expression during neural homeostasis and pathogenesis. Our study identified the essential HexB gene promoter (134 bp) as a strong candidate for AAV gene therapy to specifically target the brain microglia, the main cellular reservoirs of HIV in the CNS. Our studies continue to move us closer to identifying target-specific gene therapy for NeuroAIDS.

                The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has been reported to improve outcome in patients following ischemic stroke but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Here, utilizing a photothrombotic murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we show that imatinib-mediated inhibition of stroke-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction coincided with decreased expression of genes associated with inflammation and fibrosis in the cerebrovasculature. We found that imatinib effectively dampened stroke-induced reactive gliosis and myofibroblast transdifferentiation, whilst having very limited effect on the rest of the glia scar and on peripheral leukocyte infiltration. Further, our data suggest that consolidation of the PDGFR+ portion of the fibrotic scar in imatinib-treated mice contributes to the improvement in functional outcome compared to the vehicle controls, where the PDGFR+ scar is expanding. Comparison with human stroke transcriptome databases revealed significant overlap with imatinib-regulated genes, suggesting imatinib may modulate reactive gliosis and fibrotic scarring also in human stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-Term Inactivation of Sodium Channels as a Mechanism of Adaptation in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is involved in memory and spatial navigation. Many CA1 pyramidal cells function as place cells, increasing their firing rate when a specific place field is traversed. The dependence of CA1 place cell firing on position within the place field is asymmetric. We investigated the source of this asymmetry by injecting triangular depolarizing current ramps to approximate the spatially-tuned, temporally-diffuse depolarizing synaptic input received by these neurons while traversing a place field. Ramps were applied to rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro (slice electrophysiology) and in silico (multi-compartmental NEURON model). Under control conditions, CA1 neurons fired more action potentials at higher frequencies on the up-ramp versus the down-ramp. This effect was more pronounced for dendritic compared to somatic ramps. We incorporated a five-state Markov scheme for NaV1.6 channels into our model and calibrated the spatial dependence of long-term inactivation according to the literature; this spatial dependence was sufficient to explain the difference in dendritic versus somatic ramps. Long-term inactivation reduced the firing frequency by decreasing open-state occupancy, and reduced spike amplitude during trains by decreasing occupancy in closed states, which comprise the available pool. PKC activators like phorbol ester phorbol-dibutyrate (PDBu) are known to reduce NaV long-term inactivation. PDBu application removed spike amplitude attenuation during spike trains in vitro, more visibly in dendrites, consistent with decreased NaV long-term inactivation. Moreover, PDBu greatly reduced adaptation, consistent with our hypothesized mechanism. Our synergistic experimental/computational approach shows that long-term inactivation of NaV1.6 is the primary mechanism of adaptation in CA1 pyramidal cells.

                The feedback people receive on their behavior shapes the process of belief formation and self-efficacy in mastering a given task. The neural and computational mechanisms of how the subjective value of these beliefs and corresponding affect bias the learning process are yet unclear. Here we investigate this question during learning of self-efficacy beliefs using fMRI, pupillometry, computational modeling and individual differences in affective experience. Biases in the formation of self-efficacy beliefs were associated with affect, pupil dilation and neural activity within the anterior insula, amygdala, VTA/SN, and mPFC. Specifically, neural and pupil responses map the valence of the prediction errors in correspondence to the experienced affect and learning bias people show during belief formation. Together with the functional connectivity dynamics of the anterior insula within this network our results hint towards neural and computational mechanisms that integrate affect in the process of belief formation.

                Behavior arises from concerted activity throughout the brain. Consequently, a major focus of modern neuroscience is defining the physiology and behavioral roles of projection neurons linking different brain areas. Single-cell RNA sequencing has facilitated these efforts by revealing molecular determinants of cellular physiology and markers that enable genetically targeted perturbations such as optogenetics, but existing methods for sequencing of defined projection populations are low-throughput, painstaking, and costly. We developed a straightforward, multiplexed approach, Virally Encoded Connectivity Transgenic Overlay RNA sequencing (VECTORseq). VECTORseq repurposes commercial retrogradely infecting viruses typically used to express functional transgenes, e.g., recombinases and fluorescent proteins, by treating viral transgene mRNA as barcodes within single-cell datasets. VECTORseq is compatible with different viral families, resolves multiple populations with different projection targets in one sequencing run, and identifies cortical and subcortical excitatory and inhibitory projection populations. Our study provides a roadmap for high-throughput identification of neuronal subtypes based on connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Balancing memory fidelity and representational stability in the female mouse accessory olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems must balance the value of efficient coding schemes against the need to update specific memorized representations without perturbing other memories. Here we describe a unique solution to this challenge that is implemented by the vomeronasal system (VNS) to encode and remember multiple conspecific individuals as part of the Bruce Effect (BE). In the BE, exposure of a pregnant female mouse to the odors of an unfamiliar male leads to failure of the pregnancy (pregnancy block) via the VNS. Following mating and sensory exposure, however, the female becomes protected from a pregnancy block by the stud individual. While this form of natural learning has been proposed to depend on changes in the representation of his odors in her accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), a key VNS structure, there are no direct comparisons of in vivo sensory responses before and after imprinting. It has further been suggested that these changes simply render the AOB insensitive to stud odors. However, the combinatorial odor code used by the AOB and the significant overlap in the odor composition of different males means that silencing responses to one individual is likely to degrade responses to others, posing potential problems for more general sensory encoding. To identify the neuronal correlates of learning in the context of the BE, we recorded extracellular responses of AOB neurons in vivo in mated and unmated female mice upon controlled presentation of urinary chemosignals, including urine from both the stud and males of a distinct strain. We find that while initial sensory responses in the AOB (within a timescale required to guide social interactions) remain stable, responses to extended stimulation (as required for eliciting the pregnancy block) display selective attenuation of stud-responsive neurons. Based on our results, we propose a model that reconciles the formation of strong, selective memories with the need to sustain robust representational bandwidth by noting a distinction between the representations of brief and extended stimuli. This temporal disassociation allows attenuation of slow-acting endocrine processes in a stimulus-specific manner, without compromising consistent ongoing representations of stimuli that guide behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuomotor adaptation modulates the clustering of sleep spindles into trains</a></h4>

              
                Sleep spindles are thought to promote memory consolidation. Recently, we have shown that visuomotor adaptation (VMA) learning increases the density of spindles and promotes the coupling between spindles and slow oscillations, locally, with the level of spindle-SO synchrony predicting overnight memory retention. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the rhythmicity in spindle occurrence may also influence the stabilization of declarative and procedural memories. Here, we examined if VMA learning promotes the temporal organization of sleep spindles into trains. We found that VMA increased the proportion of spindles and spindle-SO couplings in trains. In agreement with our previous work, this modulation was observed over the contralateral hemisphere to the trained hand, and predicted overnight memory retention. Interestingly, spindles grouped in a cluster showed greater amplitude and duration than isolated spindles. The fact that these features increased as a function of train length, provides evidence supporting a biological advantage of this temporal arrangement. Our work opens the possibility that the periodicity of NREM oscillations may be relevant in the stabilization of procedural memories.

CONTRIBUTION STATEMENTEver since the discovery of memory systems, the study of the mechanisms supporting the consolidation of declarative and procedural memories has progressed somewhat in parallel. We now know, however, that structures originally thought of as purely declarative such as the hippocampus, participate in the consolidation of procedural tasks. Recently, we showed that sleep predicts long-term motor memory through the local synchrony between fast sleep spindles and slow oscillations, a mechanism initially described for the consolidation of declarative memories. Novel evidence has linked the rhythmicity in the occurrence of spindles to memory stabilization. This framework proposes that temporally clustered spindles into trains of two or more separated by 3-6 seconds, may favor the reinstatement and subsequent reprocessing of previously acquired memories. This temporal arrangement may facilitate mnemonic replay and neocortical integration. In the present study, we show that motor learning promotes the organization of spindles into trains, locally, over the contralateral hemisphere, and that this modulation predicts overnight memory retention. Spindle grouping also augmented the proportion of spindle-SO couplings in trains. Importantly, spindles in a cluster increased their duration and amplitude as a function of train length, pointing to a physiological benefit of this temporal organization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Offline memory replay in recurrent neuronal networks emerges from constraints on online dynamics</a></h4>

              
                During spatial exploration, neural circuits in the hippocampus store memories of sequences of sensory events encountered in the environment. When sensory information is absent during "offline" resting periods, brief neuronal population bursts can "replay" sequences of activity that resemble bouts of sensory experience. These sequences can occur in either forward or reverse order, and can even include spatial trajectories that have not been experienced, but are consistent with the topology of the environment. The neural circuit mechanisms underlying this variable and flexible sequence generation are unknown. Here we demonstrate in a recurrent spiking network model of hippocampal area CA3 that experimental constraints on network dynamics such as spike rate adaptation, population sparsity, stimulus selectivity, and rhythmicity enable additional emergent properties, including variable offline memory replay. In an online stimulus-driven state, we observed the emergence of neuronal sequences that swept from representations of past to future stimuli on the timescale of the theta rhythm. In an offline state driven only by noise, the network generated both forward and reverse neuronal sequences, and recapitulated the experimental observation that offline memory replay events tend to include salient locations like the site of a reward. These results demonstrate that biological constraints on the dynamics of recurrent neural circuits are sufficient to enable memories of sensory events stored in the strengths of synaptic connections to be flexibly read out during rest and sleep, which is thought to be important for memory consolidation and planning of future behavior.

                Despite the importance and versatility of linear mixed effects models (LME), they have seldom been used in whole brain imaging analyses due to the computational requirement. Here, we introduce a fast and efficient mixed-effects algorithm (FEMA) that makes whole brain voxelwise imaging LME analyses possible. We demonstrate the equivalency of statistical power and control of type I errors between FEMA and classical LME, whilst showing an order of magnitude improvement in the speed of FEMA compared to classical LME. By applying FEMA on diffusion images and resting state functional connectivity matrices from the ABCD StudySM release 4.0 data, we show voxelwise annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and functional connectomes in early adolescence, highlighting a critical time of establishing associations among cortical and subcortical regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term effects of network-based fMRI neurofeedback training for sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                Neurofeedback allows for learning voluntary control over one's own brain activity, aiming to enhance cognition and clinical symptoms. A recent study improved sustained attention temporarily by training healthy participants to up-regulate the differential activity of the sustained attention network (SAN) minus the default mode network (DMN). However, long-term learning effects of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training remain under-explored. Here, we evaluate the effects of network-based fMRI neurofeedback training for sustained attention by assessing behavioral and brain measures before, one day after, and two months after training. The behavioral measures include task as well as questionnaire scores, and the brain measures include activity and connectivity during self-regulation runs without feedback (i.e., transfer runs) and during resting-state runs. Neurally, we found that participants maintained their ability to control the differential activity during follow-up sessions. In resting-state runs and only in the follow-up, we observed higher connectivity within the DMN and higher degree of functional connectivity (FC) in regions that were successfully trained. We also show evidence for effects of training in the salience network mediating the switch between anticorrelated networks (the DMN and part of the SAN). Also, the training-induced increase in FC between the DMN and occipital gyrus was maintained during follow-up transfer runs. In contrast, the training-induced increased FC between DMN and occipital gyrus was not observed during follow-up resting-state runs. Behaviorally, we found that enhanced sustained attention right after training returned to baseline level during follow-up. The discrepancy between lasting regulation-related brain changes but transient behavioral and resting-state effects raises the question of how neural changes induced by neurofeedback training translate to potential behavioral improvements. Since neurofeedback directly targets brain measures to indirectly improve behavior long-term, a better understanding of the brain-behavior associations during and after neurofeedback training is needed to develop its full potential as a promising scientific and clinical tool.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous emergence of music detectors in a deep neural network trained for natural sound recognition</a></h4>

              
                Music exists in almost every society, has universal acoustic features, and is processed by distinct neural circuits in humans even with no experience of musical training. These characteristics suggest an innateness of the sense of music in our brain, but it is unclear how this innateness emerges and what functions it has. Here, using an artificial deep neural network that models the auditory information processing of the brain, we show that units tuned to music can spontaneously emerge by learning natural sound detection, even without learning music. By simulating the responses of network units to 35,487 natural sounds in 527 categories, we found that various subclasses of music are strongly clustered in the embedding space, and that this clustering arises from the music-selective response of the network units. The music-selective units encoded the temporal structure of music in multiple timescales, following the population-level response characteristics observed in the brain. The process of generalization was critical for the emergence of music-selectivity, as such properties were absent when the label of the training data was randomized to prevent generalization. We confirmed that music-selectivity can work as a functional basis for the generalization of natural sound, thereby elucidating its origin. These findings suggest that our sense of music can be innate, universally shaped by evolutionary adaptation to process natural sound.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibiting adult neurogenesis differentially affects spatial learning in females and males</a></h4>

              
                Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in the spatial processing functions of the hippocampus but ablating neurogenesis does not consistently lead to behavioral deficits in spatial tasks. Parallel studies have shown that adult-born neurons also regulate behavioral responses to stressful and aversive stimuli. We therefore hypothesized that spatial functions of adult-born neurons may be more prominent under conditions of stress, and may differ between males and females given established sex differences in stress responding. To test this we trained intact and neurogenesis-deficient rats in the spatial water maze at temperatures that vary in their degree of aversiveness. At standard temperatures (25{degrees}C) ablating neurogenesis did not alter learning and memory in either sex, consistent with prior work. However, in cold water (16{degrees}C), ablating neurogenesis had divergent sex-dependent effects: relative to intact rats, male neurogenesis-deficient rats were slower to escape and female neurogenesis-deficient rats were faster. Neurogenesis promoted temperature-related changes in search strategy in females, but it promoted search strategy stability in males. Females displayed greater recruitment of the dorsal hippocampus than males, particularly at 16{degrees}C. However, blocking neurogenesis did not alter activity-dependent immediate-early gene expression in either sex. Finally, morphological analyses of retrovirally-labelled neurons revealed greater experience-dependent plasticity in new neurons in males. Neurons had comparable morphology in untrained rats but 16{degrees}C training increased spine density, and 25{degrees}C training caused shrinkage of mossy fiber presynaptic terminals, specifically in males. Collectively, these findings indicate that neurogenesis functions in memory are prominent under conditions of stress, they provide the first evidence for sex differences in the behavioral function of newborn neurons, and they suggest possibly distinct roles for neurogenesis in cognition and mental health in males and females.

                Adaptive behavior in real-world environments demands that choices integrate over several variables, including the novelty of the options under consideration, their expected value, and uncertainty in value estimation. We recorded neurons from the human pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate to probe how integration over decision variables occurs during decision-making. In contrast to the other areas, preSMA neurons not only represented separate pre-decision variables for each choice option, but also encoded an integrated utility signal and, subsequently, the decision itself. Conversely, post-decision related encoding of variables for the chosen option was more widely distributed and especially prominent in vmPFC. Our findings position the human preSMA as central to the implementation of value-based decisions.

                Studies of healthy brain aging have reported diffusivity patterns associated with white matter degeneration using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which assumes that diffusion measured at the typical b-value (approximately 1000 s/mm2) is Gaussian. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of DTI that measures non-Gaussian diffusion (kurtosis) to better capture microenvironmental changes by incorporating additional data at a higher b-value. In this study, using UK Biobank data (b values of 1000 and 2000 s/mm2), we investigate (1) the extent of novel information gained from adding diffusional kurtosis to diffusivity observations in aging, and (2) how conventional DTI metrics in aging compare with diffusivity metrics derived from DKI, which are corrected for kurtosis. We find a general pattern of lower kurtosis alongside higher diffusivity among older adults. We also find differences between diffusivity metrics derived from DTI and DKI, emphasizing the importance of accounting for non-Gaussian diffusion. This work highlights the utility of measuring diffusional kurtosis as a simple addition to conventional diffusion imaging of aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG microstate dynamics indicate a U-shaped path to propofol-induced loss of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                It is commonly believed that the stream of consciousness is not continuous but parsed into transient brain states manifesting themselves as discrete spatiotemporal patterns of global neuronal activity. Electroencephalographical (EEG) microstates are proposed as the neurophysiological correlates of these transiently stable brain states that last for fractions of seconds. To further understand the link between EEG microstate dynamics and consciousness, we continuously recorded high-density EEG in 23 surgical patients from their awake state to unconsciousness, induced by step-wise increasing concentrations of the intravenous anesthetic propofol. Besides the conventional parameters of microstate dynamics, we introduce a new method that estimates the complexity of microstate sequences. The brain activity under the surgical anesthesia showed a decreased sequence complexity of the stereotypical microstates, which became sparser and longer-lasting. However, we observed an initial increase in microstates' temporal dynamics and complexity with increasing depth of sedation leading to a distinctive U-shape that may be linked to the paradoxical excitation induced by moderate levels of propofol. Our results support the idea that the brain is in a metastable state under normal conditions, balancing between order and chaos in order to flexibly switch from one state to another. The temporal dynamics of EEG microstates indicate changes of this critical balance between stability and transition that lead to altered states of consciousness.

                Water restriction is commonly used to motivate rodents to perform behavioral tasks; however, its effects on hydration and stress hormone levels are unknown. Here, we report daily body weight and bi-weekly packed red blood cell volume and corticosterone in adult male rats across 80 days for three commonly used water restriction schedules. We also assessed renal adaptation to water restriction using post-mortem histological evaluation of renal medulla. A control group received ad libitum water. After one week of water restriction, rats on all restriction schedules resumed similar levels of growth relative to the control group. Nominal hydration was observed, and water restriction did not drive renal adaptation. An intermittent restriction schedule was associated with an increase in corticosterone relative to the control group. Our results suggest that the water restriction schedules used here will maintain welfare in rats. However, intermittent restriction evokes a stress response which could affect behavioral and neurobiological results. Our results also suggest that stable motivation in behavioral tasks may only be achieved after one week of restriction.

                The exact somatotopy of the human facial representation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) remains debated. One reason that progress has been hampered is due the methodological challenge of how to apply automated vibrotactile stimuli to face areas in a manner that is: 1) reliable despite different curvature depending on the face location; and 2) MR-compatible and free of MR-interference artefacts when applied in the MR head-coil. Here we overcame this challenge by using soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) technology. SPAs are made of a soft silicon material and can be in- or deflated by means of airflow, have a small diameter, and are flexible in structure, enabling good skin contact even on curved body surfaces (as on the face). Here, we aimed to provide a methodological advance by providing automated tactile vibration stimulation inside the head-coil of the MRI. As a sanity check, we first mapped the well-characterised S1 finger layout using this novel device. We found that tactile stimulation of the fingers elicited characteristic somatotopic finger activations in S1, validating the use of our SPA-setup to map somatotopic representations. Ultimately, we used the device to automatically and systematically deliver somatosensory stimulation to different face locations. We found that the forehead representation was least distance from the representation of the hand. Within the face representation, we found that the lip representation is most distant from the forehead representation, with the chin represented in between. Together our results show that, by providing vibrotactile stimulation using the SPA-technology, we are able to reveal clear somatotopic representational patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered Salience Network Connectivity in 6-Week-Old Infants at Risk for Autism</a></h4>

              
                Converging evidence implicates disrupted brain connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the mechanisms linking altered connectivity early in development to the emergence of ASD symptomatology remain poorly understood. Here we examined whether atypicalities in the Salience Network (SN) -- an early-emerging neural network involved in orienting attention to the most salient aspects of one's internal and external environment -- may predict the development of ASD markers such as reduced social attention and atypical sensory processing. Six-week-old infants at high-risk for ASD exhibited stronger SN connectivity with sensorimotor regions; low-risk infants demonstrated stronger SN connectivity with prefrontal regions involved in social attention. Infants with higher connectivity with sensorimotor regions had lower connectivity with prefrontal regions, suggesting a direct tradeoff between attention to basic sensory versus socially-relevant information. Early alterations in SN connectivity predicted subsequent ASD symptomatology, providing a plausible mechanistic account for the unfolding of atypical developmental trajectories associated with ASD risk.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vivo MR spectroscopy reflects synapse density in a Huntington's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Background: Striatal medium spiny neurons are highly susceptible in Huntington's disease (HD), resulting in early synaptic perturbations that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. Non-invasive imaging techniques, such as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), have been used in HD mouse models and patients with HD to monitor neurochemical changes associated with neuronal health. However, the molecular connection between brain neurochemical alterations and synaptic dysregulation is unknown, limiting our ability to monitor potential treatments that may affect synapse function. Objective: Assess the intersection of synapse density and 1H-MRS during disease progression in an HD mouse model. Methods: We conducted in vivo longitudinal 1H-MRS in the striatum followed by ex-vivo analyses of excitatory synapse density of two synaptic circuits disrupted in HD: thalamo-striatal (T-S) and cortico-striatal (C-S) pathways. We used the heterozygous knock-in zQ175 HD mouse model as well as zQ175 mice lacking one allele of CK2'(zQ175(Tg/0):CK2'(+/-)), a kinase previously shown to regulate synapse function in HD. Results: Longitudinal analyses of excitatory synapse density showed early and sustained reduction in T-S synapses in zQ175 mice, preceding C-S synapse depletion, which was rescued in zQ175:CK2'(+/-). Linear regression analyses showed C-S synapse number correlated with 1H-MRS-measured levels of GABA while T-S synapse number positively correlated with alterations in the levels of alanine, phosphoethanolamine, lactate, and taurine relative to total creatine. Conclusion: We propose these neurochemicals could be used as surrogate biomarkers to monitor circuit-specific synaptic dysfunction using 1H-MRS in the zQ175 mouse model and perhaps in HD pre-clinical studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">KIBRA-PKCγ signaling pathway modulates memory performance in mice and humans</a></h4>

              
                Human memory is a polygenic cognitive trait that is fundamental to individual competence. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified KIBRA as a novel gene associated with human memory performance. KIBRA interacts with AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and proteins essential for synaptic plasticity. The deletion of Kibra in mice impairs synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. However, the molecular basis through which KIBRA regulates dynamic AMPAR trafficking underlying synaptic plasticity is still unknown. Here we report that KIBRA interacts with the neuronal specific kinase PKC{gamma} to modulate AMPAR trafficking upon learning, and KIBRA-PKC{gamma} signaling pathway also associates with human memory performance. We find PKC{gamma} is an essential kinase that phosphorylates AMPARs upon learning, and the loss of KIBRA in mouse brain impedes PKC{gamma}-AMPAR interaction. Activation of PKC{gamma} enables KIBRA to recruit phosphorylated AMPARs to the synapse to promote LTP and learning. We further performed transcriptomic and genetic analyses in human postmortem brain samples, and behavioral and fMRI evaluations in living human subjects, to demonstrate the genetic interactions between KIBRA and PRKCG on memory performance and memory associated physiological engagement of the hippocampal memory system. Overall, our results support that the KIBRA-PKC{gamma} signaling pathway is crucial for modulating memory performance in mice and humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spindle - slow oscillation coupling correlates with memory performance and connectivity changes in a hippocampal network after sleep</a></h4>

              
                After experiences are encoded, post-encoding reactivations during sleep have been proposed to mediate long-term memory consolidation. Spindle-slow oscillation coupling during NREM sleep is a candidate mechanism through which a hippocampal-cortical dialogue may strengthen a newly formed memory engram. Here, we investigated the role of fast spindle- and slow spindle-slow oscillation coupling in the consolidation of spatial memory in humans with a virtual water maze task involving allocentric and egocentric learning strategies. Furthermore, we analyzed how resting-state functional connectivity evolved across learning, consolidation, and retrieval of this task using a data-driven approach. Our results show task-related connectivity changes in the executive control network, the default mode network, and the hippocampal network at post-task rest. The hippocampal network could further be divided into two subnetworks of which only one showed modulation by sleep. Decreased functional connectivity in this subnetwork was associated with higher spindle-slow oscillation coupling power, which was also related to better memory performance at test. Overall, this study contributes to a more holistic understanding of the functional resting-state networks and the mechanisms during sleep associated to spatial memory consolidation.

	<p>Brain dopamine signaling is essential for the motivation to eat, and obesity is associated with altered dopaminergic signaling and increased food craving. We used molecular neuroimaging to explore whether striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability is associated with craving as measured with the General Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait (G-FCQ-T). We here show that humans with obesity (n = 34) experienced significantly more craving for food compared with lean subjects (n = 32), but food craving did not correlate significantly with striatal DAT availability as assessed with 123I-FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography. We conclude that food craving is increased in obesity, but the scores for food craving are not related to changes in striatal DAT availability.</p>

	<p>The interrelation between motor and emotional processes has been a recurrent question since several decades in the scientific literature. An interesting experimental technique to explore this question is posturography which assess the modulation of human postural control. In an emerging scientific field, this technique has been used to explore the reaction of the body in different emotional conditions. However, among available studies, some inconsistencies appear. In this brief report, we want to show how a widely used experimental model, i.e., empathy for pain, allowed in several study to provide comprehensive understanding elements on the postural correlates of socioemotional information processing. In particular, the role of mental simulation is discussed.</p>

	<p>Outcomes following cochlear implantation vary widely for both adults and children, and behavioral tests are currently relied upon to assess this. However, these behavioral tests rely on subjective judgements that can be unreliable, particularly for infants and young children. The addition of an objective test of outcome following cochlear implantation is therefore desirable. The aim of this scoping review was to comprehensively catalogue the evidence for the potential of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to be used as a tool to objectively predict and measure cochlear implant outcomes. A scoping review of the literature was conducted following the PRISMA extension for scoping review framework. Searches were conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science electronic databases, with a hand search conducted in Google Scholar. Key terms relating to near infrared spectroscopy and cochlear implants were used to identify relevant publications. Eight records met the criteria for inclusion. Seven records reported on adult populations, with five records only including post-lingually deaf individuals and two including both pre- and post-lingually deaf individuals. Studies were either longitudinal or cross-sectional, and all studies compared fNIRS measurements with receptive speech outcomes. This review identified and collated key work in this field. The homogeneity of the populations studied so far identifies key gaps for future research, including the use of fNIRS in infants. By mapping the literature on this important topic, this review contributes knowledge towards the improvement of outcomes following cochlear implantation.</p>

	<p>The chronic irreversible regression of cognitive ability and memory function in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAND) is linked with late-stage HIV infection in the brain. The molecular-level signatures of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are linked with dysfunction in HAND patients. Protein expression changes and posttranslational modification are epigenetic cues for dementia and neurodegenerative disease. In this study quantitative proteome analysis was performed to comprehensively elucidate changes in protein profiles in HIV-positive (HIV+) human brains. Frontal and temporal lobes of normal and HIV+ brains were subjected to label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using the data-independent acquisition method. Comprehensive proteomic identification and quantification analysis revealed that 3294 total proteins and 251 proteins were differentially expressed in HIV+ brains; specifically, HIV+ frontal and temporal lobes had 132 and 119 differentially expressed proteins, respectively. Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses revealed protein alterations predominantly in the HIV+ frontal lobe region. The expression of GOLPH3, IMPDH2, DYNLL1, RPL11, and GPNMB proteins was significantly altered in HIV+ frontal lobes compared to that in normal brains. These proteins are associated with metabolic pathways, neurodegenerative disorders, and dementia. These proteomic-level changes may be potential biological markers and therapeutic targets to relieve the dementia-associated symptoms in individuals with HAND.</p>

	<p>Mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs), as the name suggests, are the membranes that physically and biochemically connect mitochondria with endoplasmic reticulum. MAMs not only structurally but also functionally connect these two important organelles within the cell which were previously thought to exist independently. There are multiple points of communication between ER–mitochondria and MAMs play an important role in both ER and mitochondria functions such as Ca2+ homeostasis, proteostasis, mitochondrial bioenergetics, movement, and mitophagy. The number of disease-related proteins and genes being associated with MAMs has been continually on the rise since its discovery. There is an overwhelming overlap between the biochemical functions of MAMs and processes affected in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Thus, MAMs have received well-deserving and much delayed attention as modulators for ER–mitochondria communication and function. This review briefly discusses the recent progress made in this now fast developing field full of promise for very exciting future therapeutic discoveries.</p>

TPM (80 mg/kg b.m.) was administered in young male Wistar rats with an intragastric tube before and immediately after HS. Specimens (1 mm3) collected from the neocortex, fixed via transcardial perfusion with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde solution, were routinely processed for transmission-electron microscopic study, i.e., for descriptive and morphometric analysis. The ultrastructure of neocortical neuropil components affected by hyperthermic stress showed distinct swelling of pre and post-synaptic axodendritic and axospinal endings, including total disintegration. Mitochondria were markedly damaged in synaptic structures. Axoplasm of presynaptic boutons contained a decreased number of synaptic vesicles. Synaptic junctions showed active zone-shortening. Preventive administration of TPM before HS induction demonstrated neuroprotective effects against synaptic damage in approximately 1/4 of these structures. Interestingly, beneficial effects on synapsis morphology were more common in perivascular zones close to well-preserved capillaries. They were demonstrated by smaller swelling of both presynaptic and postsynaptic parts, well-preserved mitochondria, an increased number and regular distribution of synaptic vesicles within axoplasm, and a significantly increased synaptic active zones. However, topiramate used directly after HS was ineffective in the prevention of hyperthermia-evoked synaptic injury. Our findings support the hypothesis that topiramate applied before HS can protect some neocortical synapses via the vascular factor by enhancing blood–brain barrier components and improving the blood supply of gray matter in the temporal lobe, which may be significant in febrile seizure-prevention in children.</p>

	<p>Background: Gliomas are among the most challenging pathologies for neurosurgeons due to their infiltrative and recurrent nature in functionally relevant regions. Current knowledge confirms that gross total resection highly influence survival in patient with glioma. However, surgery performed in eloquent brain area, could seriously compromise the quality of life in patient with reduced life expectancy even more if it concerns the language function. Methods: 18 right-handed patients with perisylvian gliomas on the left hemisphere were prospectively analyzed over a period of 12 months. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging based tractography of the five main language Tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus, Frontal Aslant Tract, Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, Uncinate Fasciculus) was navigated during the surgical procedure. Using a validated method, correlations were made between the pre-operative fascicles and their possible infiltration and surgical damage. The language status was assessed using the Aachen Aphasia Test. Results: In all nine patients who developed a permanent disorder there was pre-operative involvement of at least one fascicle and resection of at least one of these. In this way, areas of high risk of permanent language damage have emerged as a result of surgical injury: the temporoparietal junction, the middle portion of the FAT and the temporal stem. Conclusions: Navigated tractography has proven to be a user-friendly tool that can assess perioperative risk, guide surgical resection, and help the neurosurgeon to find that balance between tumor resection and function preservation.</p>

	<p>(1) Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of non-immersive virtual reality in reducing falls and improving balance in patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. (2) Methods: The following databases were searched: PUBMED, PEDro, Scielo, CINAHL, Web of Science, Dialnet, Scopus and MEDLINE. These databases were searched for randomized controlled trials published using relevant keywords in various combinations. The methodological quality of the articles was evaluated using the PEDro scale. (3) Results: A total of 10 studies with a total of 537 subjects, 58.7% of which (n = 315) were men, have been included in the review. The age of the participants in these studies ranged between 55 and 80 years. Each session lasted between 30 and 75 min, and the interventions lasted between 5 and 12 weeks. These studies showed that non-immersive virtual reality is effective in reducing the number of falls and improving both static and dynamic balance in patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Results after non-immersive virtual reality intervention showed an improvement in balance and a decrease in the number and the risk of falls. However, no significant differences were found between the intervention groups and the control groups for all the included studies regarding balance. (4) Conclusions: There is evidence that non-immersive virtual reality can improve balance and reduce the risk and number of falls, being therefore beneficial for people diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.</p>

	<p>Patients with degenerative disc disease may suffer from chronic lumbar discogenic (DP) or radicular leg (RLP) pain. Minimally invasive DiscoGel therapy involves the percutaneous injection of an ethanol gel into the degenerated disk’s nucleus pulposus. This paper compares the 1-year outcome of such treatment in DP and RLP patients. We operated on 67 patients (49 men and 18 women) aged 20–68 years (mean age 46 ± 11 years) with DP (n = 45) and RLP (n = 22), of at least 6–8 weeks duration, with no adverse effects. We evaluated the treatment outcome with Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). A year after the ethanol gel injection, in the DP cohort, COMI and VAS dropped by 66% (6.40 vs. 2.20) and 53% (6.33 vs. 2.97), respectively. For the RLP patients, the corresponding values dropped 48% (7.05 vs. 3.68) and 54% (6.77 vs. 3.13). There were no differences between the cohorts in COMI and VAS at the follow-up end. Six months into the study, 74% of DP and 81% of RLP patients did not use any analgesics. Ethanol gel therapy can be effective for many patients. Moreover, its potential failure does not exclude surgical treatment options.</p>

	<p>Stereotactic biopsy of posterior fossa lesions is often regarded as hazardous due to the critical structures in that area. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of infratentorial stereotactic biopsy of brainstem or cerebellar lesions and its associations with other clinical, laboratory, and radiological parameters. From January 2000 to May 2021, 190 infratentorial stereotactic biopsies of posterior fossa tumors, including 108 biopsies of brainstem lesions, were performed. Moreover, 63 supratentorial biopsies of cerebral peduncle lesions were analyzed to compare the safety and efficacy of both approaches. Additionally, the presence of antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii and Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) were documented in 67 and 66 patients, respectively, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated in 114 patients. Only 4% of patients had minor complications and 1.5% had major complications, including one patient who died from intracranial bleeding. Nine (4.7%) biopsies were non-diagnostic. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status were assessed in 29 patients, and were non-diagnostic in only 3 (10.3%) cases. Patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG) were more frequently seropositive for T. gondii than individuals with low-grade gliomas (LGG; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). A total of 27% of HGG and 41% of LGG were non-enhancing on MRI. The infratentorial approach is generally safe and reliable for biopsy of brainstem and cerebellar lesions. In our study, the safety and efficacy of supratentorial biopsy of the cerebral peduncle and infratentorial biopsy of lesions below the cerebral peduncle were comparably high. Moreover, patients with HGG were more frequently seropositive for T. gondii than patients with LGG, and the relationship between toxoplasmosis and gliomagenesis requires further investigation.</p>

	<p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most incapacitating pathologies, leading to huge rehabilitation challenges besides a social-economic burden on SCI patients and their families. There is no complete curative treatment available so far. Non-invasive and patient-friendly use of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field stimulation (EMF) has emerged as a therapeutic and rehabilitation option. In this study, we tested whole-body EMF stimulation on thoracic complete SCI-induced nociception including sensorimotor deficits in rats. The EMF application significantly attenuated hyperalgesia and allodynia to thermal, electrical, and chemical stimuli from 6 weeks onwards as well as restoration of spinal reflexes, viz., H-reflex and nociceptive flexion reflex at the study endpoint (week 8). Besides, massively increased glutamate at the SCI injury site was observed in SCI rats with no treatment, which was also attenuated significantly by EMF stimulation. Spinal cord histology of the injury area showed a decrease in lesion volume and glial population in the EMF-stimulated rats. These findings indicate the beneficial role of EMF stimulation after thoracic complete SCI in adult male rats and, thereby, a beneficial patient-friendly rehabilitation tool.</p>

	<p>Patients with severe hemiplegia along with knee instability require knee–ankle–foot orthoses (KAFOs) for gait training. However, in these patients, it is unclear which type of walking training is more effective to improve gait function. Providing alternate gait training (AGT) improves walking function in patients with spinal cord injury, but it is still unclear whether this is effective in hemiplegic stroke patients. In this study, we defined “unified AGT” as AGT performed with the same therapeutic concept by physiotherapists. We then investigated whether AGT improved gait function quicker than our traditional gait training in hemiplegic stroke patients. We enrolled 15 subjects with severe hemiplegia and knee instability who had undergone unified AGT using KAFOs with hinged oil dampers at the ankles, and 30 historical control (HC) subjects who had undergone traditional gait training. We used multiple comparison and survival analyses to analyze the differences in the functional independence measure (FIM) gait score changes between the two groups. The multiple comparison revealed a significant increase (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in the FIM gait score compared with its initial score in the subjects with unified AGT. However, this improvement was not seen in the HC subjects. Additionally, the survival analysis of time taken to recover revealed a significant difference between the subjects with unified AGT and HC subjects (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that unified AGT using a KAFO facilitates gait improvement in patients with severe hemiplegia and knee instability.</p>

	<p>Methods to improve drug delivery efficiency through blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) based on microbubbles and focused ultrasound (FUS) are continuously being studied. However, most studies are being conducted in preclinical trial environments using small animals. The use of the human skull shows differences between the clinical and preclinical trials. BBBD results from preclinical trials are difficult to represent in clinical trials because various distortions of ultrasound by the human skull are excluded in the former. Therefore, in our study, a clinical validation platform based on a preclinical trial environment, using a human skull fragment and a rat model, was developed to induce BBBD under conditions similar to clinical trials. For this, a human skull fragment was inserted between the rat head and a 250 kHz FUS transducer, and optimal ultrasound parameters for the free field (without human skull fragment) and human skull (with human skull fragment) were derived by 300 mVpp and 700 mVpp, respectively. BBBD was analyzed according to each case using magnetic resonance images, Evans blue dye, cavitation, and histology. Although it was confirmed using magnetic resonance images and Evans blue dye that a BBB opening was induced in each case, multiple BBB openings were observed in the brain tissues. This phenomenon was analyzed by numerical simulation, and it was confirmed to be due to standing waves owing to the small skull size of the rat model. The stable cavitation doses (SCDh and SCDu) in the human skull decreased by 13.6- and 5.3-fold, respectively, compared to those in the free field. Additionally, the inertial cavitation dose in the human skull decreased by 1.05-fold compared to that of the free field. For the histological analysis, although some extravasated red blood cells were observed in each case, it was evaluated as recoverable based on our previous study results. Therefore, our proposed platform can help deduct optimal ultrasound parameters and BBBD results for clinical trials in the preclinical trials with small animals because it considers variables relevant to the human skull.</p>

	<p>Developmental dyslexia is defined by reading impairments that are disproportionate to intelligence, motivation, and the educational opportunities considered necessary for reading. Its cause has traditionally been considered to be a phonological deficit, where people have difficulties with differentiating the sounds of spoken language. However, reading is a multidimensional skill and relies on various cognitive abilities. These may include high-level vision—the processes that support visual recognition despite innumerable image variations, such as in viewpoint, position, or size. According to our high-level visual dysfunction hypothesis, reading problems of some people with dyslexia can be a salient manifestation of a more general deficit of high-level vision. This paper provides a perspective on how such non-phonological impairments could, in some cases, cause dyslexia. To argue in favor of this hypothesis, we will discuss work on functional neuroimaging, structural imaging, electrophysiology, and behavior that provides evidence for a link between high-level visual impairment and dyslexia.</p>
