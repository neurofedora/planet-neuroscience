              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Vaccine hesitancy among mothers of under-five children in Coastal South India: a facility-based cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vaccine hesitancy (VH) has been identified by the World Health Organization as one among the top ten threats to global public health. There is limited literature regarding VH from developing countries like India. Methods: In this facility based cross-sectional study, 172 mothers of under-five children were assessed regarding VH using the parental attitude towards childhood vaccination questionnaire (PACV). Results: The prevalence of VH was 3.4% (n=6). Only 7.6% (n=13) of the study participants had ever refused vaccination for their child and the most common reason cited for their refusal was that they thought it was not safe (n=6). Government health facilities was the place of routine immunization for 60.5% (n=104) participants. Health care providers (n =79, 46%) were the major source of information regarding vaccines. Conclusions: Our study highlights the presence of very low prevalence of VH in Mangalore compared to similar studies from India and other parts of the world. The limited number of participants had refused vaccination due to concerns related to vaccine safety.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1, α2, and α3 subunits cause a wide range of disabling neurological disorders, and dysfunction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to neuronal injury in stroke and dementia. To better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is important to determine the expression patterns of the different Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits within the brain and among specific cell types. Using two available scRNA-Seq databases from the adult mouse nervous system, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of the different isoforms of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α, β and <i>Fxyd</i> subunits at the single-cell level among brain regions and various neuronal populations. We subsequently identified specific types of neurons enriched with transcripts for α1 and α3 isoforms and elaborated how α3-expressing neuronal populations govern cerebellar neuronal circuits. We further analyzed the co-expression network for α1 and α3 isoforms, highlighting the genes that positively correlated with α1 and α3 expression. The top 10 genes for α1 were <i>Chn2</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Selm</i>, <i>Kcnc1</i>, <i>Snrk</i>, <i>Snap25</i>, <i>Ckb</i> and <i>Ccndbp1</i> and for α3 were <i>Sorcs3</i>, <i>Eml5</i>, <i>Neurod2</i>, <i>Ckb</i>, <i>Tbc1d4</i>, <i>Ptprz1</i>, <i>Pvrl1</i>, <i>Kirrel3</i>, <i>Pvalb</i>, and <i>Asic2</i>.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic and stable brain connectivity during movie watching as revealed by functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                Spatially remote brain regions show synchronized activity as typically revealed by correlated functional MRI (fMRI) signals. An emerging line of research has focused on the temporal fluctuations of connectivity, however, its relationships with stable connectivity have not been clearly illustrated. We examined the stable and dynamic connectivity from fMRI data when the participants watched four different movie clips. Using inter-individual correlation, we were able to estimate functionally meaningful dynamic connectivity associated with different movies. Widespread consistent dynamic connectivity was observed for each movie clip as well as their differences between clips. A cartoon movie clip showed higher consistent dynamic connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus, while a court drama clip showed higher dynamic connectivity with the auditory cortex and temporoparietal junction, which suggest the involvement of specific brain processing for different movie contents. In contrast, stable connectivity was highly similar among the movie clips, and showed fewer statistical significant differences. The patterns of dynamic connectivity had higher accuracy for classifications of different movie clips than the stable connectivity and regional activity. These results support the functional significance of dynamic connectivity in reflecting functional brain changes, which could provide more functionally related information than stable connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gli1 regulates the postnatal acquisition of peripheral nerve architecture</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nerves are organized into discrete cellular compartments. Axons, Schwann cells (SCs), and endoneurial fibroblasts (EFs) reside within the endoneurium and are surrounded by the perineurium - a cellular sheath comprised of layers of perineurial glia (PNG). SC secretion of Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) regulates this organization. In Dhh nulls, the perineurium is deficient and the endoneurium is subdivided into small compartments termed minifascicles. Human Dhh mutations cause a peripheral neuropathy with similar defects. Here we examine the role of Gli1, a canonical transcriptional effector of hedgehog signaling, in regulating peripheral nerve organization. We identify PNG, EFs, and pericytes as Gli1-expressing cells by genetic fate mapping. Although expression of Dhh by SCs and Gli1 in target cells is coordinately regulated with myelination, Gli1 expression unexpectedly persists in Dhh null EFs. Thus, Gli1 is expressed in EFs non-canonically i.e., independent of hedgehog signaling. Gli1 and Dhh also have non-redundant activities. In contrast to Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls have a normal perineurium. Like Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls form minifascicles, which we show likely arise from EFs. Thus, Dhh and Gli1 are independent signals: Gli1 is dispensable for perineurial development but functions cooperatively with Dhh to drive normal endoneurial development. During development, Gli1 also regulates endoneurial extracellular matrix production, nerve vascular organization, and has modest, non-autonomous effects on SC sorting and myelination of axons. Finally, in adult nerves, induced deletion of Gli1 is sufficient to drive minifascicle formation. Thus, Gli1 regulates the development and is required to maintain the endoneurial architecture of peripheral nerves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic sodium bromide treatment relieves autistic-like behavioral deficits in three mouse models of autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose diagnosis relies on deficient social interaction and communication together with repetitive behavior. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved that ameliorates social behavior in patients with ASD. Based on the excitation/inhibition imbalance theory of autism, we hypothesized that bromide ions, long used as an antiepileptic medication, could relieve core symptoms of ASD. We evaluated the effects of chronic sodium bromide (NaBr) administration on autistic-like symptoms in three genetic mouse models of autism: Oprm1-/- , Fmr1-/- and Shank3{Delta}ex13-16-/- mice. We showed that chronic NaBr treatment relieved autistic-like behaviors in these three models. In Oprm1-/- mice, these beneficial effects were superior to those of chronic bumetanide administration. At transcriptional level, chronic NaBr in Oprm1 null mice was associated with increased expression of genes coding for chloride ions transporters, GABAA receptor subunits, oxytocin and mGlu4 receptor. Lastly, we uncovered synergistic alleviating effects of chronic NaBr and a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGlu4 receptor on autistic-like behavior in Oprm1-/- mice. We evidenced in heterologous cells that bromide ions behave as PAMs of mGlu4, providing a molecular mechanism for such synergy. Our data reveal the therapeutic potential of bromide ions, alone or in combination with a PAM of mGlu4 receptor, for the treatment of ASDs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 is critical for phasic axonal dopamine release in the striatum and mesencephalon, but is dispensable for basic motor behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, a population of cells that are critical for motor control, motivated behaviors and cognition, release DA via an exocytotic mechanism from both their axonal terminals and their somatodendritic (STD) compartment. In Parkinson's disease (PD), it is striking that motor dysfunctions only become apparent after extensive loss of DA innervation. Although it has been hypothesized that this resilience is due to the ability of many motor behaviors to be sustained through a basal tone of DA and diffuse transmission, experimental evidence for this is limited. Here we conditionally deleted the calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) in DA neurons (cKODA mice) to abrogate most activity-dependent axonal DA release in the striatum and mesencephalon, leaving STD DA release intact. Strikingly, Syt1 cKODA mice showed intact performance in multiple unconditioned DA-dependent motor tasks, suggesting that activity-dependent DA release is dispensable for such basic motor functions. Basal extracellular levels of DA in the striatum were unchanged, suggesting that a basal tone of extracellular DA is sufficient to sustain basic movement. We also found multiple adaptations in the DA system of cKODA mice, similar to those happening at early stages of PD. Taken together, our findings reveal the striking resilience of DA-dependent motor functions in the context of a near-abolition of phasic DA release, shedding new light on why extensive loss of DA innervation is required to reveal motor dysfunctions in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABA and IA Independently Regulate rNST Responses to Afferent Input</a></h4>

              
                Taste responses in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) influence motivated ingestive behavior via ascending pathways, and consummatory reflex behavior via local, brainstem connections. Modifications to the afferent signal within the rNST include changes in gain (the overall rate of neuron activity) and changes in gustatory tuning (the degree to which individual neurons respond to divergent gustatory qualities). These alterations of the sensory signal derive from both synaptic interactions within the nucleus and the constitutive cellular membrane properties of rNST neurons. GABA neurons are well represented within the rNST, as is expression of KV4.3, a channel for a rapidly inactivating outward K+ current (IA). GABAergic synapses suppress rNST responses to afferent input and previous studies showed that this suppression is greater in cells expressing IA, suggesting a possible interaction. Here, we examine the potential interaction between GABAergic inhibition and IA channels in a series of patch clamp experiments. Optogenetic release of GABA suppressed rNST responses to afferent (electrical) stimulation and this effect was greater in cells with IA, confirming an earlier report. We further observed that the composite inhibitory postsynaptic potential was larger in IA positive cells, suggesting one mechanism for the greater afferent suppression. Blocking IA with the channel blocker AmmTX3, enhanced the response to afferent stimulation, suggesting a suppressive role for this channel in regulating afferent input at rest. However, pharmacologic blockade of IA did not suppress GABAergic inhibition, indicating that IA and GABA independently regulate excitatory afferent input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Role for Visual Areas in Physics Simulations</a></h4>

              
                To engage with the world, we must regularly make predictions about the outcomes of physical scenes. How do we make these predictions? Recent evidence points to simulation - the idea that we can introspectively manipulate rich, mental models of the world - as one possible explanation for how such predictions are accomplished. While theories based on simulation are supported by computational models, neuroscientific evidence for simulation is lacking and many important questions remain. For instance, do simulations simply entail a series of abstract computations? Or are they supported by sensory representations of the objects that comprise the scene being simulated? We posit the latter and suggest that the process of simulating a sequence of physical interactions is likely to evoke an imagery-like envisioning of those interactions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that when participants predict how a ball will fall through an obstacle-filled display, motion-sensitive brain regions are activated. We further demonstrate that this activity, which occurs even though no motion is being sensed, resembles activity patterns that arise while participants perceive the ball's motion. This finding suggests that the process of simulating the ball's movement is accompanied by a sensory representation of this movement. These data thus demonstrate that mental simulations recreate sensory depictions of how a physical scene is likely to unfold.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Environmental and molecular modulation of motor individuality in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Innate behavioral biases such as human handedness are a ubiquitous form of inter-individual variation that are not strictly hardwired into the genome and are influenced by diverse internal and external cues. Yet, genetic and environmental factors modulating behavioral variation remain poorly understood, especially in vertebrates. To identify genetic and environmental factors that influence behavioral variation, we take advantage of larval zebrafish light-search behavior. During light-search, individuals preferentially turn in leftward or rightward loops, in which directional bias is sustained and non-heritable, and maintained by a habenula-rostral PT circuit. Here we use a medium-throughput recording strategy and unbiased analysis to show that significant individual to individual variation exists in wildtype larval zebrafish turning preference. We classify stable left, right, and unbiased turning types, with most individuals exhibiting a directional preference. Raising larvae at elevated temperature selectively reduces the leftward turning type and impacts rostral PT neurons, specifically. Exposure to conspecifics, variable salinity, environmental enrichment, and physical disturbance does not significantly impact inter-individual turning bias. Pharmacological manipulation of Notch signaling and carrying a mutant allele of a known Notch pathway affecter gene, gsx2, disrupted turn bias individuality in a dose-dependent manner. These results establish that larval zebrafish is a powerful vertebrate model for inter-individual variation with sensitivity to specific environmental perturbations and gene dosage.

	<p>Accurate identification of the prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in adults with Down syndrome (MCI-DS) has been challenging because there are no established diagnostic criteria that can be applied for people with lifelong intellectual disabilities (ID). As such, the sequence of cognitive decline in adults with DS has been difficult to ascertain, and it is possible that domain constructs characterizing cognitive function in neurotypical adults do not generalize to this high-risk population. The present study examined associations among multiple measures of cognitive function in adults with DS, either prior to or during the prodromal stage of AD to determine, through multiple statistical techniques, the measures that reflected the same underlying domains of processing. Participants included 144 adults with DS 40–82 years of age, all enrolled in a larger, multidisciplinary study examining biomarkers of AD in adults with DS. All participants had mild or moderate lifelong intellectual disabilities. Overall AD-related clinical status was rated for each individual during a personalized consensus conference that considered performance as well as health status, with 103 participants considered cognitively stable (CS) and 41 to have MCI-DS. Analyses of 17 variables derived from 10 tests of cognition indicated that performance reflected three underlying factors: language/executive function, memory, and visuomotor. All three domain composite scores significantly predicted MCI-DS status. Based upon path modeling, the language/executive function composite score was the most affected by prodromal AD. However, based upon structural equation modeling, tests assessing the latent construct of memory were the most impacted, followed by those assessing visuomotor, and then those assessing language/executive function. Our study provides clear evidence that cognitive functioning in older adults with DS can be characterized at the cognitive domain level, but the statistical methods selected and the inclusion or exclusion of certain covariates may lead to different conclusions. Best practice requires investigators to understand the internal structure of their variables and to provide evidence that their variables assess their intended constructs.</p>

	<p>Background: The rapid expansion and severity of the COVID-19 contagion has had negative physical and psychological health implications for millions of people around the world, but even more so among children and adolescents. Given the severity of the situation and the small number of studies on the direct influence of viral infection on the cognitive development within adolescents, the present study aims at understanding the consequences of contracting the virus and being hospitalized in relation to cognitive functioning, in particular, for executive functioning, among adolescents. Methods: To all subjects included in the sample, divided into four groups based on the severity of the COVID-19 infection, were administered the WISC-IV in order to evaluate the global cognitive functioning, and subsequently, the subtests Courses and Tower of London (ToL), both part of the BVN 12–18, were administered for the evaluation of executive operation. Results: Our analyses showed that between subjects who did not contract the viral infection and those who contracted it in an asymptomatic form, there are no significant differences in cognitive functioning, but only in executive functioning. Furthermore, in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized subjects, we found lower scores especially for WM skills, while IQ scores are in a medium range. Conclusion: the present study shows that contracting the viral infection and, thus, being hospitalized, caused greater problems and difficulties as compared to those who were not hospitalized, impacting global cognitive (and executive) functioning, especially the WM. We believe that these results could allow an early detection of alterations in cognitive and executive functioning, a fundamental aspect of the interventions that occur in evolutionary phases such as those related to pre-adolescence, allowing, therefore, the activation of functional recovery pathways in a short time.</p>

	<p>Background: The combination of intralabyrinthine schwannoma (ILS) removal and cochlear implantation is the standard of care after surgical resection for audiological rehabilitation. Intracochlear ILS is not only the most frequent tumor in this group of schwannomas, but it is also, to some degree, surgically the most challenging because of its position behind the modiolus. Recent developments in the knowledge of implant position, implant magnet choice, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences make an MRI follow-up after surgical removal possible. Thus far, no results are known about the surgical success and residual rate of these kind of tumors. The aim of the present study was to perform an early MRI follow-up for the evaluation of residual or recurrent intracochlear ILS after surgical removal and cochlear implantation. Methods: In a retrospective study, we evaluated seven patients after an intracochlear ILS removal and single-stage cochlear implantation with a mean period of 13.4 months post surgery with a 3T T1 GAD 2 mm sequence for a residual ILS. Patients were operated on using an individualized technique concept. Results: In six out of seven cases, 3 T T1 GAD 2 mm MRI follow-up showed no residual or recurrent tumor. In one case, a T1 signal indicated a tumor of the upper inner auditory canal (IAC) at the MRI follow up. Conclusion: MRI follow-up as a quality control tool after ILS removal and cochlear implantation is highly important to exclude residual tumors. Long-term MRI evaluation results are needed and can be obtained under consideration of implant position, implant magnet, and MRI sequence choice. A preoperative MRI slice thickness less than 2 mm can be recommended to visualize possible modiolar and IAC expansion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Cellular resolution anatomical and molecular atlases for prenatal human brains</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing interest in studies of prenatal human brain development, particularly using new single-cell genomics and anatomical technologies to create cell atlases, creates a strong need for accurate and detailed anatomical reference atlases. In this study, we present two cellular-resolution digital anatomical atlases for prenatal human brain at post-conceptional weeks (PCW) 15 and 21. Both atlases were annotated on sequential Nissl-stained sections covering brain-wide structures on the basis of combined analysis of cytoarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase staining and an extensive marker gene expression dataset. This high information content dataset allowed reliable and accurate demarcation of developing cortical and subcortical structures and their subdivisions. Furthermore, using the anatomical atlases as a guide, spatial expression of 37 and 5 genes from the brains respectively at PCW 15 and 21 was annotated, illustrating reliable marker genes for many developing brain structures. Finally, the present study uncovered several novel developmental features, such as the lack of an outer subventricular zone in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex, and the apparent extension of both cortical (excitatory) and subcortical (inhibitory) progenitors into the prenatal olfactory bulb. These comprehensive atlases provide useful tools for visualization, segmentation, targeting, imaging and interpretation of brain structures of prenatal human brain, and for guiding and interpreting the next generation of cell census and connectome studies.</p>

                <p>Treatment options for cerebral infarction beyond the time window of reperfusion therapy are limited, and novel approaches are needed. PDGF-B is considered neuroprotective; however, it is difficult to administer at effective concentrations to infarct areas. Nanoparticles (NPs) are small and stable; therefore, we modified PDGF-B to the surface of naturally occurring heat shock protein NPs (HSPNPs) to examine its therapeutic effect in cerebral infarction. PDGF-B modified HSPNPs (PDGF-B HSPNPs) were injected 1 d after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) in CB-17 model mice. We analyzed the infarct volume and motor functional recovery at 3 and 7 d. PDGF-B HSPNPs were specifically distributed in the infarct area, and compared with HSPNPs alone, they significantly reduced infarct volumes and improved neurologic function 3 and 7 d after administration. PDGF-B HSPNP administration was associated with strong phosphorylation of Akt in infarct areas and significantly increased neurotrophin (NT)-3 production as well as reduced cell apoptosis compared with HSPNPs alone. Moreover, astrogliosis in peri-infarct area was significantly upregulated with PDGF-B HSPNPs compared with HSPNPs alone. Treatment with PDGF-B HSPNPs might be a novel approach for treating cerebral infarction.</p>

                <p>Opsin 3 (<I>Opn3</I>) is highly expressed in the adult brain, however, information for spatial and temporal expression patterns during embryogenesis is significantly lacking. Here, an <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP reporter mouse line was used to monitor cell body expression and axonal projections during embryonic and early postnatal to adult stages. By applying 2D and 3D fluorescence imaging techniques, we have identified the onset of Opn3 expression, which predominantly occurred during embryonic stages, in various structures during brain/head development. In addition, this study defines over twenty <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP-positive neural structures never reported before. <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP was first observed at E9.5 in neural regions, including the ganglia that will ultimately form the trigeminal, facial and vestibulocochlear cranial nerves (CNs). As development proceeds, expanded <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP expression coincided with the formation and maturation of critical components of the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS, PNS), including various motor-sensory tracts, such as the dorsal column-medial lemniscus (DCML) sensory tract, and olfactory, acoustic, and optic tracts. The widespread, yet distinct, detection of <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP already at early embryonic stages suggests that Opn3 might play important functional roles in the developing brain and spinal cord to regulate multiple motor and sensory circuitry systems, including proprioception, nociception, ocular movement, and olfaction, as well as memory, mood, and emotion. This study presents a crucial blueprint from which to investigate autonomic and cognitive opsin-dependent neural development and resultant behaviors under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The mouse vomeronasal system controls several social behaviors. Pheromones and other social cues are detected by sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO). Stimuli activate a transduction cascade that leads to membrane potential depolarization, increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, and increased firing. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channels TMEM16A and TMEM16B are co-expressed within microvilli of vomeronasal neurons, but their physiological role remains elusive. Here, we investigate the contribution of each of these channels to vomeronasal neuron firing activity by comparing wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice. Performing loose-patch recordings from neurons in acute VNO slices, we show that spontaneous activity is modified by <I>Tmem16a</I> KO, indicating that TMEM16A, but not TMEM16B, is active under basal conditions. Upon exposure to diluted urine, a rich source of mouse pheromones, we observe significant changes in activity. Vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) from <I>Tmem16a</I> cKO and <I>Tmem16b</I> KO mice show shorter interspike intervals (ISIs) compared with WT mice, indicating that both TMEM16A and TMEM16B modulate the firing pattern of pheromone-evoked activity in VSNs.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temperature-sensitive two-pore domain potassium channels (thermal K2P) are recently shown to cluster at nodes of Ranvier (NRs) and play a key role in action potential (AP) regeneration and conduction on A&beta;-afferent nerves. Cooling temperatures affect AP regeneration and conduction on A&beta;-afferent nerves but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we have performed patch-clamp recordings directly at the NR in an <I>ex vivo</I> trigeminal nerve preparation. We have characterized the effects of cooling temperatures on intrinsic electrophysiological properties and AP regeneration at the NR on rat A&beta;-afferent nerves, and determined whether and how thermal K2P channels may be involved in the effects of cooling temperatures. We show that cooling temperatures from 35&deg;C to 15&deg;C decrease outward leak currents, increase input resistance, depolarize resting membrane potential (RMP), broaden AP width and increase latency of AP threshold at the NR. We further demonstrate that cooling temperatures impair regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR. The effects of cooling temperatures on the intrinsic electrophysiological properties and regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR can be partially reversed by BL-1249 (BL), arachidonic acid (AA), and intra-axonal protons, three thermal K2P activators, indicating the involvement of thermal K2P channels. Moreover, we show that at cooling temperatures there are interplays among thermal K2P channels, RMPs, and voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, which together limit regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR. Our findings demonstrate a new role of thermal K2P channels in temperature-dependent conduction of high-frequency sensory signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Glymphatic System: A Novel Component of Fundamental Neurobiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Throughout the body, lymphatic fluid movement supports critical functions including clearance of excess fluid and metabolic waste. The glymphatic system is the analog of the lymphatic system in the CNS. As such, the glymphatic system plays a key role in regulating directional interstitial fluid movement, waste clearance, and, potentially, brain immunity. The glymphatic system enables bulk movement of CSF from the subarachnoid space along periarterial spaces, where it mixes with interstitial fluid within the parenchyma before ultimately exiting from the parenchyma via perivenous spaces. This review focuses on important questions about the structure of this system, why the brain needs a fluid transport system, and unexplored aspects of brain fluid transport. We provide evidence that astrocytes and blood vessels determine the shape of the perivascular space, ultimately controlling the movement of perivascular fluid. Glymphatic fluid movement has the potential to alter local as well as global transport of signaling molecules and metabolites. We also highlight the evidence for cross talk among the glymphatic system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and lymphatic system. Much remains to be studied, but we propose that the glymphatic/lymphatic system acts as a cornerstone in signaling between the brain and body.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Intercellular Arc Signaling Regulates Vasodilation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Injury responses require communication between different cell types in the skin. Sensory neurons contribute to inflammation and can secrete signaling molecules that affect non-neuronal cells. Despite the pervasive role of translational regulation in nociception, the contribution of activity-dependent protein synthesis to inflammation is not well understood. To address this problem, we examined the landscape of nascent translation in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons treated with inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified the activity-dependent gene, Arc, as a target of translation <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Inflammatory cues promote local translation of Arc in the skin. Arc-deficient male mice display exaggerated paw temperatures and vasodilation in response to an inflammatory challenge. Since Arc has recently been shown to be released from neurons in extracellular vesicles (EVs), we hypothesized that intercellular Arc signaling regulates the inflammatory response in skin. We found that the excessive thermal responses and vasodilation observed in Arc defective mice are rescued by injection of Arc-containing EVs into the skin. Our findings suggest that activity-dependent production of Arc in afferent fibers regulates neurogenic inflammation potentially through intercellular signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nociceptors play prominent roles in pain and inflammation. We examined rapid changes in the landscape of nascent translation in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) treated with a combination of inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified several hundred transcripts subject to rapid preferential translation. Among them is the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc. We provide evidence that Arc is translated in afferent fibers in the skin. Arc-deficient mice display several signs of exaggerated inflammation which is normalized on injection of Arc containing extracellular vesicles (EVs). Our work suggests that noxious cues can trigger Arc production by nociceptors which in turn constrains neurogenic inflammation in the skin.</p>

                <p>Chronic itch is a troublesome condition and often difficult to cure. Emerging evidence suggests that the periaqueductal gray (PAG)-rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) pathway may play an important role in the regulation of itch, but the cellular organization and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that a group of RVM neurons distinctively express the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which mediates descending inhibition of itch. We found that GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons in the RVM were activated in chronic itch conditions in rats and mice. Selective ablation or chemogenetic suppression of RVM GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons resulted in mechanical alloknesis and increased scratching in response to pruritogens, whereas chemogenetic activation of GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons abrogated itch responses, indicating that GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons are antipruritic. Moreover, GPER-deficient mice and rats of either sex exhibited hypersensitivity to mechanical and chemical itch, a phenotype reversible by the &micro; type opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism. Additionally, significant MOR phosphorylation in the RVM was detected in chronic itch models in wild-type but not in GPER<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> rats. Therefore, GPER not only identifies a population of medullary antipruritic neurons but may also determine the descending antipruritic tone through regulating &micro; opioid signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Therapeutic options for itch are limited because of an as yet incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of itch processing. Our data have provided novel insights into the cellular organization and molecular mechanisms of descending regulation of itch in normal and pathologic conditions. GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons (largely GABAergic) in the RVM are antipruritic neurons under tonic opioidergic inhibition, activation of GPER promotes phosphorylation of MOR and disinhibition of the antipruritic GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons from inhibitory opioidergic inputs, and failure to mobilize GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons may result in the exacerbation of itch. Our data also illuminate on some of the outstanding questions in the field, such as the mechanisms underlying sex bias in itch, pain, and opioid analgesia and the paradoxical effects of morphine on pain and itch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">RIM-Binding Protein 2 Organizes Ca2+ Channel Topography and Regulates Release Probability and Vesicle Replenishment at a Fast Central Synapse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rab-interacting molecule (RIM)-binding protein 2 (BP2) is a multidomain protein of the presynaptic active zone (AZ). By binding to RIM, bassoon (Bsn), and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>), it is considered to be a central organizer of the topography of Ca<SUB>V</SUB> and release sites of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at the AZ. Here, we used RIM-BP2 knock-out (KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates of either sex to investigate the role of RIM-BP2 at the endbulb of Held synapse of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) with bushy cells (BCs) of the cochlear nucleus, a fast relay of the auditory pathway with high release probability. Disruption of RIM-BP2 lowered release probability altering short-term plasticity and reduced evoked EPSCs. Analysis of SV pool dynamics during high-frequency train stimulation indicated a reduction of SVs with high release probability but an overall normal size of the readily releasable SV pool (RRP). The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fast component of SV replenishment after RRP depletion was slowed. Ultrastructural analysis by superresolution light and electron microscopy revealed an impaired topography of presynaptic Ca<SUB>V</SUB> and a reduction of docked and membrane-proximal SVs at the AZ. We conclude that RIM-BP2 organizes the topography of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>, and promotes SV tethering and docking. This way RIM-BP2 is critical for establishing a high initial release probability as required to reliably signal sound onset information that we found to be degraded in BCs of RIM-BP2-deficient mice <I>in vivo</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Rab-interacting molecule (RIM)-binding proteins (BPs) are key organizers of the active zone (AZ). Using a multidisciplinary approach to the calyceal endbulb of Held synapse that transmits auditory information at rates of up to hundreds of Hertz with submillisecond precision we demonstrate a requirement for RIM-BP2 for normal auditory signaling. Endbulb synapses lacking RIM-BP2 show a reduced release probability despite normal whole-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and abundance of the key priming protein Munc13-1, a reduced rate of SV replenishment, as well as an altered topography of voltage-gated (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>)2.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and fewer docked and membrane proximal synaptic vesicles (SVs). This hampers transmission of sound onset information likely affecting downstream neural computations such as of sound localization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Autism Spectrum Disorder/Intellectual Disability-Associated Mutations in Trio Disrupt Neuroligin 1-Mediated Synaptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>We recently identified an autism spectrum disorder/intellectual disability (ASD/ID)-related <I>de novo</I> mutation hotspot in the Rac1-activating GEF1 domain of the protein Trio. Trio is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) that is essential for glutamatergic synapse function. An ASD/ID-related mutation identified in Trio's GEF1 domain, Trio D1368V, produces a pathologic increase in glutamatergic synaptogenesis, suggesting that Trio is coupled to synaptic regulatory mechanisms that govern glutamatergic synapse formation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Trio regulates glutamatergic synapses are largely unexplored. Here, using biochemical methods, we identify an interaction between Trio and the synaptogenic protein Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) in the brain. Molecular biological approaches were then combined with super-resolution dendritic spine imaging and whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology in hippocampal slices from male and female rats to examine the impact ASD/ID-related Trio mutations have on NLGN1-mediated synaptogenesis. We find that an ASD/ID-related mutation in Trio's eighth spectrin repeat region, Trio N1080I, inhibits Trio's interaction with NLGN1 and prevents Trio D1368V-mediated synaptogenesis. Inhibiting Trio's interaction with NLGN1 via Trio N1080I blocked NLGN1-mediated synaptogenesis and increases in synaptic NMDA Receptor function but not NLGN1-mediated increases in synaptic AMPA Receptor function. Finally, we show that the aberrant synaptogenesis produced by Trio D1368V is dependent on NLGN signaling. Our findings demonstrate that ASD/ID-related mutations in Trio are able to pathologically increase as well as decrease NLGN-mediated effects on glutamatergic neurotransmission, and point to an NLGN1-Trio interaction as part of a key pathway involved in ASD/ID etiology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A number of genes have been implicated in the development of autism spectrum disorder/intellectual disability (ASD/ID) in humans. It is now important to identify relationships between these genes to uncover specific cellular regulatory pathways that contribute to these disorders. In this study, we discover that two glutamatergic synapse regulatory proteins implicated in ASD/ID, Trio and Neuroligin 1, interact with one another to promote glutamatergic synaptogenesis. We also identify ASD/ID-related mutations in Trio that either inhibit or augment Neuroligin 1-mediated glutamatergic synapse formation. Together, our results identify a synaptic regulatory pathway that, when disrupted, likely contributes to the development of ASD/ID. Going forward, it will be important to determine whether this pathway represents a point of convergence of other proteins implicated in ASD/ID.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Differentiation Status of Hair Cells That Regenerate Naturally in the Vestibular Inner Ear of the Adult Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging, disease, and trauma can lead to loss of vestibular hair cells and permanent vestibular dysfunction. Previous work showed that, following acute destruction of ~95% of vestibular hair cells in adult mice, ~20% regenerate naturally (without exogenous factors) through supporting cell transdifferentiation. There is, however, no evidence for the recovery of vestibular function. To gain insight into the lack of functional recovery, we assessed functional differentiation in regenerated hair cells for up to 15 months, focusing on key stages in stimulus transduction and transmission: hair bundles, voltage-gated conductances, and synaptic contacts. Regenerated hair cells had many features of mature type II vestibular hair cells, including polarized mechanosensitive hair bundles with zone-appropriate stereocilia heights, large voltage-gated potassium currents, basolateral processes, and afferent and efferent synapses. Regeneration failed, however, to recapture the full range of properties of normal populations, and many regenerated hair cells had some properties of immature hair cells, including small transduction currents, voltage-gated sodium currents, and small or absent HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) currents. Furthermore, although mouse vestibular epithelia normally have slightly more type I hair cells than type II hair cells, regenerated hair cells acquired neither the low-voltage-activated potassium channels nor the afferent synaptic calyces that distinguish mature type I hair cells from type II hair cells and confer distinctive physiology. Thus, natural regeneration of vestibular hair cells in adult mice is limited in total cell number, cell type diversity, and extent of cellular differentiation, suggesting that manipulations are needed to promote full regeneration with the potential for recovery of vestibular function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Death of inner ear hair cells in adult mammals causes permanent loss of hearing and balance. In adult mice, the sudden death of most vestibular hair cells stimulates the production of new hair cells but does not restore balance. We investigated whether the lack of systems-level function reflects functional deficiencies in the regenerated hair cells. The regenerated population acquired mechanosensitivity, voltage-gated channels, and afferent synapses, but did not reproduce the full range of hair cell types. Notably, no regenerated cells acquired the distinctive properties of type I hair cells, a major functional class in amniote vestibular organs. To recover vestibular system function in adults, we may need to solve how to regenerate the normal variety of mature hair cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An Anatomically Constrained Model of V1 Simple Cells Predicts the Coexistence of Push-Pull and Broad Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The spatial organization and dynamic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that define the receptive field (RF) of simple cells in the cat primary visual cortex (V1) still raise the following paradoxical issues: (1) stimulation of simple cells in V1 with drifting gratings supports a wiring schema of spatially segregated sets of excitatory and inhibitory inputs activated in an opponent way by stimulus contrast polarity and (2) in contrast, intracellular studies using flashed bars suggest that although ON and OFF excitatory inputs are indeed segregated, inhibitory inputs span the entire RF regardless of input contrast polarity. Here, we propose a biologically detailed computational model of simple cells embedded in a V1-like network that resolves this seeming contradiction. We varied parametrically the RF-correlation-based bias for excitatory and inhibitory synapses and found that a moderate bias of excitatory neurons to synapse onto other neurons with correlated receptive fields and a weaker bias of inhibitory neurons to synapse onto other neurons with anticorrelated receptive fields can explain the conductance input, the postsynaptic membrane potential, and the spike train dynamics under both stimulation paradigms. This computational study shows that the same structural model can reproduce the functional diversity of visual processing observed during different visual contexts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identifying generic connectivity motives in cortical circuitry encoding for specific functions is crucial for understanding the computations implemented in the cortex. Indirect evidence points to correlation-based biases in the connectivity pattern in V1 of higher mammals, whereby excitatory and inhibitory neurons preferentially synapse onto neurons respectively with correlated and anticorrelated receptive fields. A recent intracellular study questions this push&ndash;pull hypothesis, failing to find spatial anticorrelation patterns between excitation and inhibition across the receptive field. We present here a spiking model of V1 that integrates relevant anatomic and physiological constraints and shows that a more versatile motif of correlation-based connectivity with selectively tuned excitation and broadened inhibition is sufficient to account for the diversity of functional descriptions obtained for different classes of stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">From Receptive to Perceptive Fields: Size-Dependent Asymmetries in Both Negative Afterimages and Subcortical On and Off Post-Stimulus Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Negative afterimages are perceptual phenomena that occur after physical stimuli disappear from sight. Their origin is linked to transient post-stimulus responses of visual neurons. The receptive fields (RFs) of these subcortical ON- and OFF-center neurons exhibit antagonistic interactions between central and surrounding visual space, resulting in selectivity for stimulus polarity and size. These two features are closely intertwined, yet their relationship to negative afterimage perception remains unknown. Here we tested whether size differentially affects the perception of bright and dark negative afterimages in humans of both sexes, and how this correlates with neural mechanisms in subcortical ON and OFF cells. Psychophysically, we found a size-dependent asymmetry whereby dark disks produce stronger and longer-lasting negative afterimages than bright disks of equal contrast at sizes &gt;0.8&deg;. Neurophysiological recordings from retinal and relay cells in female cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus showed that subcortical ON cells exhibited stronger sustained post-stimulus responses to dark disks, than OFF cells to bright disks, at sizes &gt;1&deg;. These sizes agree with the emergence of center-surround antagonism, revealing stronger suppression to opposite-polarity stimuli for OFF versus ON cells, particularly in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Using a network-based retino-geniculate model, we confirmed stronger antagonism and temporal transience for OFF-cell post-stimulus rebound responses. A V1 population model demonstrated that both strength and duration asymmetries can be propagated to downstream cortical areas. Our results demonstrate how size-dependent antagonism impacts both the neuronal post-stimulus response and the resulting afterimage percepts, thereby supporting the idea of perceptual RFs reflecting the underlying neuronal RF organization of single cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual illusions occur when sensory inputs and perceptual outcomes do not match, and provide a valuable tool to understand transformations from neural to perceptual responses. A classic example are negative afterimages that remain visible after a stimulus is removed from view. Such perceptions are linked to responses in early visual neurons, yet the details remain poorly understood. Combining human psychophysics, neurophysiological recordings in cats and retino-thalamo-cortical computational modeling, our study reveals how stimulus size and the receptive-field structure of subcortical ON and OFF cells contributes to the parallel asymmetries between neural and perceptual responses to bright versus dark afterimages. Thus, this work provides a deeper link from the underlying neural mechanisms to the resultant perceptual outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Effect of Serotonin Receptor 5-HT1B on Lateral Inhibition between Spiny Projection Neurons in the Mouse Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <p>The principal neurons of the striatum, the spiny projection neurons (SPNs), make inhibitory synaptic connections with each other via collaterals of their main axon, forming a local lateral inhibition network. Serotonin, acting via the 5-HT1B receptor, modulates neurotransmitter release from SPN terminals in striatal output nuclei, but the role of 5-HT1B receptors in lateral inhibition among SPNs in the striatum is unknown. Here, we report the effects of 5-HT1B receptor activation on lateral inhibition in the mouse striatum. Whole-cell recordings were made from SPNs in acute brain slices of either sex, while optogenetically activating presynaptic SPNs or fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). Activation of 5-HT1B receptors significantly reduced the amplitude of IPSCs evoked by optical stimulation of both direct and indirect pathway SPNs. This reduction was blocked by application of a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist. Activation of 5-HT1B receptors did not reduce the amplitude of IPSCs evoked from FSIs. These results suggest a new role for serotonin as a modulator of lateral inhibition among striatal SPNs. The 5-HT1B receptor may, therefore, be a suitable target for future behavioral experiments investigating the currently unknown role of lateral inhibition in the function of the striatum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that stimulation of serotonin receptors reduces the efficacy of lateral inhibition between spiny projection neurons (SPNs), one of the biggest GABAergic sources in the striatum, by activation of the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor. The striatum receives serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe nuclei and is important in behavioral brain functions like learning and action selection. Our findings suggest a new role for serotonin in modulating the dynamics of neural interactions in the striatum, which extends current knowledge of the mechanisms of the behavioral effects of serotonin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Switching between Single- and Dual-Network Activity via Modulation of Intrinsic Membrane Properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oscillatory networks underlie rhythmic behaviors (e.g., walking, chewing) and complex behaviors (e.g., memory formation, decision-making). Flexibility of oscillatory networks includes neurons switching between single- and dual-network participation, even generating oscillations at two distinct frequencies. Modulation of synaptic strength can underlie this neuronal switching. Here we ask whether switching into dual-frequency oscillations can also result from modulation of intrinsic neuronal properties. The isolated stomatogastric nervous system of male <I>Cancer borealis</I> crabs contains two well-characterized rhythmic feeding-related networks (pyloric, ~1 Hz; gastric mill, ~0.1 Hz). The identified modulatory projection neuron MCN5 causes the pyloric-only lateral posterior gastric (LPG) neuron to switch to dual pyloric/gastric mill bursting. Bath applying the MCN5 neuropeptide transmitter Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide only partly mimics the LPG switch to dual activity because of continued LP neuron inhibition of LPG. Here, we find that MCN5 uses a cotransmitter, glutamate, to inhibit LP, unlike Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide excitation of LP. Thus, we modeled the MCN5-elicited LPG switching with Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide application and LP photoinactivation. Using hyperpolarization of pyloric pacemaker neurons and gastric mill network neurons, we found that LPG pyloric-timed oscillations require rhythmic electrical synaptic input. However, LPG gastric mill-timed oscillations do not require any pyloric/gastric mill synaptic input and are voltage-dependent. Thus, we identify modulation of intrinsic properties as an additional mechanism for switching a neuron into dual-frequency activity. Instead of synaptic modulation switching a neuron into a second network as a passive follower, modulation of intrinsic properties could enable a switching neuron to become an active contributor to rhythm generation in the second network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuromodulation of oscillatory networks can enable network neurons to switch from single- to dual-network participation, even when two networks oscillate at distinct frequencies. We used small, well-characterized networks to determine whether modulation of synaptic strength, an identified mechanism for switching, is necessary for dual-network recruitment. We demonstrate that rhythmic electrical synaptic input is required for continued linkage with a "home" network, whereas modulation of intrinsic properties enables a neuron to generate oscillations at a second frequency. Neuromodulator-induced switches in neuronal participation between networks occur in motor, cognitive, and sensory networks. Our study highlights the importance of considering intrinsic properties as a pivotal target for enabling parallel participation of a neuron in two oscillatory networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Consciousness and Task Relevance in Face Perception Using Simultaneous EEG-fMRI</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current theories of visual consciousness disagree about whether it emerges during early stages of processing in sensory brain regions or later when a widespread frontoparietal network becomes involved. Moreover, disentangling conscious perception from task-related postperceptual processes (e.g., report) and integrating results across different neuroscientific methods remain ongoing challenges. The present study addressed these problems using simultaneous EEG-fMRI and a specific inattentional blindness paradigm with three physically identical phases in female and male human participants. In phase 1, participants performed a distractor task during which line drawings of faces and control stimuli were presented centrally. While some participants spontaneously noticed the faces in phase 1, others remained inattentionally blind. In phase 2, all participants were made aware of the task-irrelevant faces but continued the distractor task. In phase 3, the faces became task-relevant. Bayesian analysis of brain responses demonstrated that conscious face perception was most strongly associated with activation in fusiform gyrus (fMRI) as well as the N170 and visual awareness negativity (EEG). Smaller awareness effects were revealed in the occipital and prefrontal cortex (fMRI). Task-relevant face processing, on the other hand, led to strong, extensive activation of occipitotemporal, frontoparietal, and attentional networks (fMRI). In EEG, it enhanced early negativities and elicited a pronounced P3b component. Overall, we provide evidence that conscious visual perception is linked with early processing in stimulus-specific sensory brain areas but may additionally involve prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the strong activation of widespread brain networks and the P3b are more likely associated with task-related processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does our brain generate visual consciousness&mdash;the subjective experience of what it is like to see, for example, a face? To date, it is hotly debated whether it emerges early in sensory brain regions or later when a widespread frontoparietal network is activated. Here, we use simultaneous fMRI and EEG for high spatial and temporal resolution and demonstrate that conscious face perception is predominantly linked to early and occipitotemporal processes, but also prefrontal activity. Task-related processes (e.g., decision-making), on the other hand, elicit brain-wide activations including late and strong frontoparietal activity. These findings challenge numerous previous studies and highlight the importance of investigating the neural correlates of consciousness in the absence of task relevance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Linear Integration of Sensory Evidence over Space and Time Underlies Face Categorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual object recognition relies on elaborate sensory processes that transform retinal inputs to object representations, but it also requires decision-making processes that read out object representations and function over prolonged time scales. The computational properties of these decision-making processes remain underexplored for object recognition. Here, we study these computations by developing a stochastic multifeature face categorization task. Using quantitative models and tight control of spatiotemporal visual information, we demonstrate that human subjects (five males, eight females) categorize faces through an integration process that first linearly adds the evidence conferred by task-relevant features over space to create aggregated momentary evidence and then linearly integrates it over time with minimum information loss. Discrimination of stimuli along different category boundaries (e.g., identity or expression of a face) is implemented by adjusting feature weights of spatial integration. This linear but flexible integration process over space and time bridges past studies on simple perceptual decisions to complex object recognition behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although simple perceptual decision-making such as discrimination of random dot motion has been successfully explained as accumulation of sensory evidence, we lack rigorous experimental paradigms to study the mechanisms underlying complex perceptual decision-making such as discrimination of naturalistic faces. We develop a stochastic multifeature face categorization task as a systematic approach to quantify the properties and potential limitations of the decision-making processes during object recognition. We show that human face categorization could be modeled as a linear integration of sensory evidence over space and time. Our framework to study object recognition as a spatiotemporal integration process is broadly applicable to other object categories and bridges past studies of object recognition and perceptual decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reactivation of Single-Episode Pain Patterns in the Hippocampus and Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aversive and rewarding experiences can exert a strong influence on subsequent behavior. While decisions are often supported by the value of single past episodes, most research has focused on the role of well-learned value associations. Recent studies have begun to investigate the influence of reward-associated episodes, but it is unclear whether these results generalize to negative experiences, such as pain. To investigate whether and how the value of previous aversive experiences modulates behavior and brain activity, in our experiments female and male human participants experienced episodes of high or low pain in conjunction with incidental, trial-unique neutral pictures. In an incentive-compatible surprise test phase, we found that participants avoided pain-paired objects. In a separate fMRI experiment, at test, participants exhibited significant pain value memory. Neurally, when participants were re-exposed to pain-paired objects, we found no evidence for reactivation of pain-related patterns in pain-responsive regions, such as the anterior insula. Critically, however, we found significant reactivation of pain-related patterns of activity in the hippocampus, such that activity significantly discriminated high versus low pain episodes. Further, stronger reactivation in the anterior hippocampus was related to improved pain value memory performance. Our results demonstrate that single incidental aversive experiences can build memories that affect decision-making and that this influence may be supported by the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aversive and rewarding experiences can exert a strong influence on our subsequent behavior. While decisions are often supported by single past negative or positive episodes, most research has focused on the role of well-learned value associations. In experiments using aversive heat pain in conjunction with incidental objects, we found that participants' choices were biased by the level of pain associated with the objects. Further, when participants saw the objects again, pain-related neural patterns in the hippocampus were re-expressed, and this was related to pain value memory performance. These results suggest a mechanism by which even single negative experiences can guide our later decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Evidence for Representational Persistence Within Events</a></h4>

              
                <p>How does the brain process continuous experiences so they can be remembered? Evidence suggests that people perceive their experience as a series of distinct and meaningful events. Information encountered within the same event shows greater temporal integration into memory as well as enhanced neural representational similarity. Although these data support the theory that the brain builds and maintains a mental model of the current event that represents recently encountered stimulus information, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We used fMRI in humans (<I>N</I> = 21, 13 female) to test whether within-event neural similarity indicates the persistence of stimulus representations in a mental model. Participants viewed trial-unique visual images that were grouped into events. We calculated neural pattern similarity across time in the category-selective visual cortex to measure stimulus persistence. Pattern similarity was enhanced within, compared with between, events in the object-sensitive left lateral occipital (LO) cortex. This was specific to situations when objects could persist within a mental model, suggesting modulation of neural activity based on the features and structure of the event. Left LO object persistence was correlated with activity in a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) region linked to representing mental models within events. mFPC activity also correlated with pattern similarity in the hippocampus but more generally across stimulus categories. Critically, left LO similarity was related to estimates of temporal proximity in memory. The data suggest that temporal neural stability reflects stimulus persistence in mental models and highlight the importance of within-event representational stability in the transformation of experience to memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain process continuous experiences so they can be remembered? One idea is that information persists in mental models during stable events, facilitating the organization of events in memory. Using fMRI pattern similarity analysis, we found enhanced similarity within, compared with between, events in the object-sensitive LO but only when objects could persist within a mental model. mPFC activity correlated with left LO similarity when objects persisted within an event; in contrast, mPFC activity correlated with hippocampal similarity across stimulus categories. Left LO persistence was also related to the remembered temporal proximity of stimuli. The data suggest the brain dynamically maintains stimulus information in mental models during events, supporting the transformation of experience into memory.</p>

                Background: Several studies have investigated whether personalising trial documentation can aid recruitment and retention. We did a ‘study within a trial’ (SWAT) evaluating the effectiveness of a personalised text message compared to a non-personalised text message, on the retention rate in a large orthopaedic trial. Methods: The SWAT was embedded in the Knee Replacement Bandaging Study (KReBS) trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of 12-month questionnaires returned. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of questionnaires completed and time to questionnaire return. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) are presented, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values. Results: In total, 1465 participants were included in the SWAT. In the personalised group, 644/723 (89.1%) of participants returned a questionnaire, compared to 654/742 (88.1%) in the non-personalised group. The absolute difference in return rate was 0.9% (95% CI: -2.3% to 4.2%; p=0.57). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the likelihood of returning a questionnaire (OR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.51; p=0.61), the likelihood of returning a complete questionnaire (OR 1.11; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.51; p=0.50) nor in time to return (HR 1.05; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.17; p=0.40). Conclusion: This SWAT adds to the growing evidence base for whether personalised text messages are effective. Registration: ISRCTN87127065 (20/02/2017); SWAT 35 (01/12/2015)

                <p>by Christian Selinger, Samuel Alizon</p>

Interactions within a population shape the spread of infectious diseases but contact patterns between individuals are difficult to access. We hypothesised that key properties of these patterns can be inferred from multiple infection data in longitudinal follow-ups. We developed a simulator for epidemics with multiple infections on networks and analysed the resulting individual infection time series by introducing similarity metrics between hosts based on their multiple infection histories. We find that, depending on infection multiplicity and network sampling, multiple infection summary statistics can recover network properties such as degree distribution. Furthermore, we show that by mining simulation outputs for multiple infection patterns, one can detect immunological interference between pathogens (i.e. the fact that past infections in a host condition future probability of infection). The combination of individual-based simulations and analysis of multiple infection histories opens promising perspectives to infer and validate transmission networks and immunological interference for infectious diseases from longitudinal cohort data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Slow manifolds within network dynamics encode working memory efficiently and robustly</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elham Ghazizadeh, ShiNung Ching</p>

Working memory is a cognitive function involving the storage and manipulation of latent information over brief intervals of time, thus making it crucial for context-dependent computation. Here, we use a top-down modeling approach to examine network-level mechanisms of working memory, an enigmatic issue and central topic of study in neuroscience. We optimize thousands of recurrent rate-based neural networks on a working memory task and then perform dynamical systems analysis on the ensuing optimized networks, wherein we find that four distinct dynamical mechanisms can emerge. In particular, we show the prevalence of a mechanism in which memories are encoded along slow stable manifolds in the network state space, leading to a phasic neuronal activation profile during memory periods. In contrast to mechanisms in which memories are directly encoded at stable attractors, these networks naturally forget stimuli over time. Despite this seeming functional disadvantage, they are more efficient in terms of how they leverage their attractor landscape and paradoxically, are considerably more robust to noise. Our results provide new hypotheses regarding how working memory function may be encoded within the dynamics of neural circuits.

                <p>by Kwang Il Ryom, Vezha Boboeva, Oleksandra Soldatkina, Alessandro Treves</p>

We discuss simple models for the transient storage in short-term memory of cortical patterns of activity, all based on the notion that their recall exploits the natural tendency of the cortex to hop from state to state—latching dynamics. We show that in one such model, and in simple spatial memory tasks we have given to human subjects, short-term memory can be limited to similar low capacity by interference effects, in tasks terminated by errors, and can exhibit similar sublinear scaling, when errors are overlooked. The same mechanism can drive serial recall if combined with weak order-encoding plasticity. Finally, even when storing randomly correlated patterns of activity the network demonstrates correlation-driven latching waves, which are reflected at the outer extremes of pattern space.

                <p>Patients with epilepsy report that sleep deprivation is a common trigger for breakthrough seizures. The basic mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. In the Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model of epilepsy, daily sleep deprivation indeed exacerbated seizures though these effects were lost after the third day. Sleep deprivation also accelerated mortality in ~ 52% of Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, not observed in controls. Voltage-clamp experiments on the day after recovery from sleep deprivation showed reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells in epileptic Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our results suggest that sleep deprivation is detrimental to seizures and survival, possibly due to reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                The pandemic has created challenges in all sectors of the economy and education. Traditional teaching approaches seem futile in the new context, thus the need to constantly reinvent the delivery to meet the fast-paced changes in the education domain. Hence, Design Thinking (DT) is an alternative approach that might be useful in the given context. DT is known to be a human-centric approach to innovative problem-solving processes. DT could be employed in the delivery process to develop twenty-first-century skills and enhance creativity and innovation, in an attempt to identify alternative solutions. The study explores the role of design thinking (DT) mindset in innovative delivery among teachers. It enhances and facilitates innovative content delivery by leveraging creativity. The study targeted 131 teachers from primary and secondary schools in Malaysia. Data was collected through an online survey and was analyzed using SmartPLS to establish relationships between DT and Innovative Delivery in schools. The data was further analyzed to seek co-relations between the DT steps and the successful transformation of content delivery by teachers. The study established a framework for the application of design thinking for teachers as the primary support in developing activities for their students. The outcome of this study will help fill the gap towards creating an interesting method of delivery in schools and constantly innovating the method to suit the evolving generation. It provides an in-depth reason as to why students are not interested in the teacher's lessons which, in turn, affects their performance. This insight is crucial for the Ministry of Education and policymakers to enhance teachers’ ability to innovatively deliver content to students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hearing aid through skin sensory for profound deaf people [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                An individual with profound deafness or total hearing loss has a hearing threshold of 80dB or more. The ineffectiveness of hearing aids, surging costs and complex surgeries for cochlear implants have discouraged many to opt for these types of treatments. Hence, this research aims to provide an alternative hearing aid that stimulates “hearing” through the skin sensory, which is more affordable and accessible for the profoundly deaf or total hearing loss community. We have developed four initial vibrating transducers with single spectrum, which are strapped to a belt. The transducers pick up audible sounds through a microphone, amplifies the sound to a high-level signal, stimulating a vibration pattern on the human skin sensory. The belt was tested on 30 random people who identified as normal, partial, and profoundly deaf. When the belt was strapped to the individual’s waist, audible sound was played (stimulus) and the individual was asked whether   he/she can feel a stimulation or vibration on their skin, and if so, state the sound source direction. Based on the test, all individuals were able to feel the vibrating stimulation on their skin, and they were also able to state the directions accurately. The various vibrating pattern that stimulates the human sensory system for the profoundly deaf can be learned over time, which could serve as useful information. However, interpreting and identifying the different types of vibrating pattern perceived through the skin remains a huge challenge for profoundly deaf people. As hearing through skin sensory is a very new area of research, there are very limited research articles published in this field. Thus far, this is the first study to evaluate the method of audio spectrum to develop hearing aid through skin sensory.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Environmental perceptions of global business travel by Swiss companies in the Zurich airport region [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This article presents findings from research conducted before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on companies located in the Zurich airport region of Switzerland, regarding the needs for global business travel and its impacts. Methods: The study involved a mixed methods approach. Five hypotheses were tested using inferential statistics on data obtained from pre-tested closed questions in a web-based survey. Deeper context was explored through an interview-based case-study conducted at a Swiss pharma company. Results: Supporting alternative hypothesis 3 (Ha(3)), a significant positive relationship was found between travel frequency and business growth, F(1, 100) = 11.31, p = 0.0011. Supporting Ha(4), corporate culture had a significant positive relationship with business travel frequency (F(1, 100) = 15.50, p = 0.0002) and average trip length (F(1, 100) = 6.39, p = 0.01). And thirdly supporting Ha(5), corporate social responsibility had a significant relationship with global business travel (91%). Ho(2) and Ho(3) were accepted. The case study found that smart corporate travel policies and regulations should be instantiated to enhance our environment, which would also benefit employee wellbeing. Travel can be reduced significantly despite being demonstrated that physical co-presence is important for building trust. The case study suggests tools to support the monitoring and management of global business travel by organizations. Conclusions: COVID-19 has impacted travel for business significantly, and future research will be necessary to assess its impact. The article explores the ongoing research in this area, and several relevant implications are proposed for future leaders. The case study found willingness to pay both corporate and individual green taxes, and a deficiency in corporate communication around the environment. Business travel is needed to build trust; however, it can be reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strychnine poisoning due to traditional Chinese medicine: a case series [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Strychnine poisoning is rare but possibly fatal. The most reported sources of strychnine poisoning include rodenticides and adulterated street heroin. Here we report a case series of an unusual cause of strychnine poisoning – Strychni semen, a herb known as “maqianzi” in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: All cases of strychnine poisoning confirmed by the Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory (HATRL, the highest-level clinical toxicology laboratory in Hong Kong) between May 2005 and May 2018 were reviewed. Results: Twelve cases of strychnine poisoning were recorded, and Strychni semen was the exclusive source. Ten (83.3%) patients presented with muscle spasms, and four (33.3%) developed typical conscious convulsions. The poisoning was severe in two (16.7%) patients, moderate in three (25%) and mild in eight (58.3%). No case fatality was recorded. Three (25%) patients were TCM practitioners and two (16.7%) were laymen who bought the herb themselves without a proper prescription. Conclusion: The practice of TCM is becoming popular in different parts of the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The spectrum of clinical features of strychnine poisoning secondary to Strychni semen are similar to those arising from different origins. Eliciting a history of TCM use, apart from exposure to rodenticides and drugs of abuse, may allow timely diagnosis in patients with compatible clinical features. Enhancement of TCM safety could minimize the hazard.

                Background: Binahong (Anredera cordifolia (Ten.) STEENIS) is a widely available herbal plant in Indonesia and has been intensely researched for its healing abilities due to its biological activities, but few have studied its capability in accelerating hard tissue healing in post-extraction tooth sockets. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effects of 3% binahong leaf extract gel on alveolar bone healing in post-extraction sockets in Wistar rats. Methods: In this study, 48 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to twelve groups. After the extraction of the left mandibular incisor, sockets in Group I to IV were given 3% binahong leaf extract gel, group V to VIII were given a control gel, and group IX to XII were given Gengigel® for 14 days. The residual socket volume (RSV) and fibroblast proliferation were observed on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th day post-extraction, while the osteoblast and osteocyte proliferation were observed on the 7th, 14th, and 28th day post-extraction. The RSV data were analysed using repeated measure ANOVA and one-way ANOVA, while the histopathological data were analysed using one-way ANOVA. Results: The results showed that the binahong group had the lowest RSV and the highest fibroblast proliferation compared to the other groups on the 7th day (p<0.05) and the highest osteoblast and osteocyte proliferation compared to the other groups on the 14th day (p<0.05). Conclusion: The experiment showed that 3% binahong leaf extract gel could accelerate wound closure, which was characterized by a greater decrease in the RSV value in comparison to the other treatment groups and could enhance alveolar bone healing by increasing the proliferation of fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes.

                Background: The giant gourami sago strain (Osphronemus goramy Lacepède) has been approved in 2018 as a candidate for freshwater aquaculture in Indonesia. However, information on the species’ reproduction is minimal. This study analyzed the reproductive characteristics of the gourami sago strain broodfish to provide basic knowledge for a future hatchery development strategy. Methods: A total of 10 female and 10 male mature gourami sago strain broodfish were measured for body weight and length, and were evaluated for their reproductive characteristics.  Breeding fish were spawned naturally in a 2×1×0.6 m concrete pond with a male-female sex ratio of 1:1. Egg weight and diameter were measured in 25 eggs per female using, respectively, ACIS AD- 600i scales with 0.01 g accuracy, and a microscope (Labo model L-711) using Canon Digital Camera Software 3 . Semen was collected using plastic syringes in 3 mL aliquots, then placed in an insulated ice-cooled container, and analyzed within two hours of collection. Results: Average weights of female and male broodfish before spawning were 2180±159.78 g and 3060±134.99 g, respectively. The relative fecundity and egg diameter were 1029±36 eggs kg-1 and 2.42±0.05 mm, respectively. The hatching rate and embryo survival to an eyed-egg stage were respectively 76.40±2.27% and 94.76±0.42%.  Sperm characteristics showed that volume was 0.60±0.12 ml kg-1 and percentage of motile sperm was 70.04±2.27%. Female broodfish weight after spawning was strongly correlated with the weight before spawned (r2 = 0.999) and absolute fecundity was also strongly correlated with female broodfish weight before spawning (r2= 0.921). Sperm concentration was moderately correlated with sperm motility (r2 = 0.556) and duration of sperm motility (r2 = 0.502). Conclusions: The gourami sago strain broodfish has suitable reproductive characteristics for the development of hatcheries. Successful natural spawning should be followed by larval weaning and feeding technology to increase growth and survival.

                Background: Driving-induced lower back pain (DLBP) is associated with long driving times and awkward postures. Nonetheless, its actual causes and solutions remain unclear due to intervening causes from activities of daily living and traumatic injuries. This study investigated the causes and recommendations for DLBP using the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ). Methods: A cause-and-effect chain analysis (CECA) was conducted based on discussions with 19 ergonomics experts from Malaysia. Engineering contradictions were formulated according to the causes and associated with the parameters of the TRIZ system. These parameters were then intersected in the contradiction matrix to extract the inventive principles. Finally, recommendations were made based on these principles. Results: CECA uncovered the design- and posture-related causes of DLBP. It was implied that missing seat adjustment controls might cause drivers to sit with their knees positioned higher than their hips. This issue causes an excessive posterior pelvic tilt, resulting in DLBP. To address this issue, an inert atmosphere involving the addition of inflatable bubble wraps to elevate the posterior position was recommended. Conclusion: While there have been studies on DLBP, the present study demonstrated originality by using TRIZ to preliminarily but systematically investigate and resolve DLBP. Further triangulations, prototyping, experimentations, and verifications were not possible due to time and budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, this research uncovered the TRIZ-integrated perspectives on ergonomic solutions to DLBP that are more cost-effective than medical treatments or design overhauls.

                Introduction: Malaysia is one of the countries with the highest lightning flash density globally. While sufficiency of lightning protection system is crucial to ensure human safety against lightning strikes, the public awareness towards lightning safety is also equally important in Malaysia. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the current lightning safety awareness level of the Malaysian population. Methods: An online questionnaire survey which consists of 22 scientific statements of lightning was first developed in Malay and English. The questionnaire allows the respondent to also check their own score upon completion of the questionnaire. It was then distributed to the public for data collection. The sample size comprised of both genders, all layers of society from various educational level and social background. Results: Overall, the awareness on lightning safety amongst Malaysian is at moderate level with an average score of slightly above 50%. Urbanites scored marginally better than their rural counterparts. One’s education level does not dictate their awareness level of lightning safety. Discussion: In conclusion, the public in Malaysia needs to be better educated on lightning safety. Similar studies should be replicated in other countries experiencing similar levels of lightning activity to better understand the public’s perception on lightning.

                Kramer et al. demonstrate that antibody 54042-4 recognizes residues highly conserved across global SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Antibody 54042-4 potently neutralizes all known circulating variants of concern (VOCs), and could be developed as a clinical candidate to treat COVID-19 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A modified fluctuation assay reveals a natural mutator phenotype that drives mutation spectrum variation within Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Although studies of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> have provided many insights into mutagenesis and DNA repair, most of this work has focused on a few laboratory strains. Much less is known about the phenotypic effects of natural variation within <i>S. cerevisiae</i>'s DNA repair pathways. Here, we use natural polymorphisms to detect historical mutation spectrum differences among several wild and domesticated <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains. To determine whether these differences are likely caused by genetic mutation rate modifiers, we use a modified fluctuation assay with a <i>CAN1</i> reporter to measure <i>de novo </i>mutation rates and spectra in 16 of the analyzed strains. We measure a 10-fold range of mutation rates and identify two strains with distinctive mutation spectra. These strains, known as AEQ and AAR, come from the panel's 'Mosaic beer' clade and share an enrichment for C&gt;A mutations that is also observed in rare variation segregating throughout the genomes of several Mosaic beer and Mixed origin strains. Both AEQ and AAR are haploid derivatives of the diploid natural isolate CBS 1782, whose rare polymorphisms are enriched for C&gt;A as well, suggesting that the underlying mutator allele is likely active in nature. We use a plasmid complementation test to show that AAR and AEQ share a mutator allele in the DNA repair gene<i> OGG1</i>, which excises 8-oxoguanine lesions that can cause C&gt;A mutations if left unrepaired.

                Insects have evolved diverse and remarkable strategies for navigating in various ecologies all over the world. Regardless of species, insects share the presence of a group of morphologically conserved neuropils known collectively as the central complex (CX). The CX is a navigational center, involved in sensory integration and coordinated motor activity. Despite the fact that our understanding of navigational behavior comes predominantly from ants and bees, most of what we know about the underlying neural circuitry of such behavior comes from work in fruit flies. Here we aim to close this gap, by providing the first comprehensive map of all major columnar neurons and their projection patterns in the CX of a bee. We find numerous components of the circuit that appear to be highly conserved between the fly and the bee, but also highlight several key differences which are likely to have important functional rami1cations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A nascent polypeptide sequence modulates DnaA translation elongation in response to nutrient availability</a></h4>

              
                The ability to regulate DNA replication initiation in response to changing nutrient conditions is an important feature of most cell types. In bacteria, DNA replication is triggered by the initiator protein DnaA, which has long been suggested to respond to nutritional changes; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report a novel mechanism that adjusts DnaA synthesis in response to nutrient availability in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. By performing a detailed biochemical and genetic analysis of the <i>dnaA</i> mRNA, we identified a sequence downstream of the <i>dnaA</i> start codon that inhibits DnaA translation elongation upon carbon exhaustion. Our data show that the corresponding peptide sequence, but not the mRNA secondary structure or the codon choice, is critical for this response, suggesting that specific amino acids in the growing DnaA nascent chain tune translational efficiency. Our study provides new insights into DnaA regulation and highlights the importance of translation elongation as a regulatory target. We propose that translation regulation by nascent chain sequences, like the one described, might constitute a general strategy for modulating the synthesis rate of specific proteins under changing conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SUV39 SET domains mediate crosstalk of heterochromatic histone marks</a></h4>

              
                The SUV39 class of methyltransferase enzymes deposits histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation (H3K9me2/3), the hallmark of constitutive heterochromatin. How these enzymes are regulated to mark specific genomic regions as heterochromatic is poorly understood. Clr4 is the sole H3K9me2/3 methyltransferase in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</i> and recent evidence suggests that ubiquitination of lysine 14 on histone H3 (H3K14ub) plays a key role in H3K9 methylation. However, the molecular mechanism of this regulation and its role in heterochromatin formation remain to be determined. Our structure-function approach shows that the H3K14ub substrate binds specifically and tightly to the catalytic domain of Clr4, and thereby stimulates the enzyme by over 250-fold. Mutations that disrupt this mechanism lead to a loss of H3K9me2/3 and abolish heterochromatin silencing similar to <i>clr4</i> deletion. Comparison with mammalian SET domain proteins suggests that the Clr4 SET domain harbors a conserved sensor for H3K14ub, which mediates licensing of heterochromatin formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel form of bivalent chromatin associates with rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to a pathogen signal in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                Temporal dynamics of gene expression underpin responses to internal and environmental stimuli. In eukaryotes, regulation of gene induction includes changing chromatin states at target genes and recruiting the transcriptional machinery that includes transcription factors. As one of the most potent defense compounds in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, camalexin can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. Though several transcription factors controlling camalexin biosynthesis genes have been characterized, how the rapid activation of genes in this pathway upon a pathogen signal is enabled remains unknown. By combining publicly available epigenomic data with <i>in vivo</i> chromatin modification mapping, we found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on gene expression, H3K27me3 (repression) and H3K18ac (activation), to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3K27m3 or H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. Our study indicates that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin, which we name a kairostat, plays an important role controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stimuli in plants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A PX-BAR protein Mvp1/SNX8 and a dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 drive endosomal recycling</a></h4>

              
                Membrane protein recycling systems are essential for maintenance of the endosome-lysosome system. In yeast, retromer and Snx4 coat complexes are recruited to the endosomal surface where they recognize cargos. They sort cargo and deform the membrane into recycling tubules that bud from the endosome and target to the Golgi. Here, we reveal that the SNX-BAR protein, Mvp1, mediates an endosomal recycling pathway which is mechanistically distinct from the retromer and Snx4 pathways. Mvp1 deforms the endosomal membrane and sorts cargos containing a specific sorting motif into a membrane tubule. Subsequently, Mvp1 recruits the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 to catalyze membrane scission and release of the recycling tubule. Similarly, SNX8, the human homolog of Mvp1, which has been also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, mediates formation of an endosomal recycling tubule. Thus, we present evidence for a novel endosomal retrieval pathway that is conserved from yeast to humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta oscillations in frontal cortex differentially modulate accuracy and speed in flexible stimulus- and action-based learning</a></h4>

              
                Flexible reward learning relies on frontal cortex, with substantial evidence indicating the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) play important roles. Recent studies in both rat and macaque suggest theta oscillations (5-10 Hz) may be a spectral signature that coordinates this learning. However, causal network-level interactions between ACC and OFC in flexible learning remain unclear. We investigated the learning of stimulus-outcome (S-O) and action-outcome (A-O) associations using a combination of simultaneous in-vivo electrophysiology in dorsal ACC and ventral OFC, partnered with bilateral inhibitory DREADDs in ACC. In freely-behaving male and female rats and using a within-subject design, we examined accuracy and speed of response across distinct and precisely-defined trial epochs including correct choice, incorrect choice, and reward collection. We report significant modulation of accuracy by theta power in both ACC and OFC. Both ACC and OFC theta oscillations consistently signaled accuracy in the initial discrimination phase, whereas it was OFC theta alone in the reversal phases of both S-O and A-O learning. Theta power in either region was not correlated with deliberation speed. Indeed, theta modulation of accuracy was dissociable from its involvement in speed of response which was affected by ACC inhibition, most prominently in A-O learning. Results are discussed with reference to the nonhuman primate literature, where there is by contrast more reported specialization of OFC and ACC in flexible learning of stimuli and actions. The present results also point to a specific role of OFC theta in signaling a reversal of either kind.

                SCN2A is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene and encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. However, the impact of autism-associated SCN2A de novo variants on human neuron development is unknown. We studied SCN2A using isogenic SCN2A-/- induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and patient-derived iPSCs harboring a p.R607* or a C-terminal p.G1744* de novo truncating variant. We used Neurogenin2 to generate excitatory glutamatergic neurons and found that SCN2A+/p.R607* and SCN2A-/- neurons displayed a reduction in synapse formation and excitatory synaptic activity using multielectrode arrays and electrophysiology. However, the p.G1744* variant, which leads to early-onset seizures in addition to ASD, altered action-potential dynamics but not synaptic activity. Proteomic and functional analysis of SCN2A+/p.R607* neurons revealed defects in neuronal morphology and bioenergetic pathways, which were not present in SCN2A+/p.G1744* neurons. Our study reveals that SCN2A de novo variants can have differential impact on human neuron function and signaling.

                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1) and characterized by motor deficits, cognitive decline, changes in affect, and premature lethality. Due to the severe cerebellar degeneration in SCA1, the pathogenesis of Purkinje cells has been the main focus of previous studies. However, mutant ATXN1 is expressed throughout the brain, and pathology in brain regions beyond the cerebellar cortex likely contribute to the symptoms of SCA1. Here, we investigate early-stage SCA1 alterations in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in clinically relevant brain regions including hippocampus and brain stem of Atxn1154Q/2Q mice, a knock-in mouse model of SCA1 expressing mutant ATXN1 globally. Our results indicate shared and brain region specific astrocyte pathology early in SCA1 preceding neuronal loss. We found reduced expression of homeostatic astrocytic genes Kcnj10, Aqp4, Slc1a2 and Gja1, all of which are key for neuronal function in the hippocampus and brain stem. These gene expression changes did not correlate with classical astrogliosis. Neuronal and microglial numbers were largely unaltered at this early stage of SCA1 with the exception of cerebellar white matter, where we found significant reduction in microglial density, and the brain stem where we detected an increase in microglial cell counts. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a growth factor important for the survival and function of neurons with broad therapeutic potential for many brain diseases. We report here that BDNF expression is decreased in cerebellum and medulla of patients with SCA1. Moreover, we found that BDNF had dual effect on SCA1 and wild-type mice. Motor performance, strategy development, hippocampal neurogenesis, and expression of astrocyte homeostatic genes in the hippocampus were ameliorated in BDNF-treated SCA1 mice and further enhanced in BDNF-treated wild-type mice. On the other hand, BDNF had a negative effect on memory recall and expression of homeostatic genes in the brain stem astrocytes both in wild-type and in SCA1 mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incidental reinstatement of faces and scenes in medial temporal lobe subregions during word recognition</a></h4>

              
                During associative retrieval, the brain reinstates neural representations that were present during encoding. The human medial temporal lobe (MTL) with its subregions hippocampus (HC), perirhinal cortex (PRC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) plays a central role in neural reinstatement. Previous studies have given compelling evidence for reinstatement in the MTL during explicitly instructed associative retrieval. High-confident recognition may be similarly accompanied by recollection of associated information from the encoding context. It is unclear, however, whether high-confident recognition memory elicits reinstatement in the MTL even in the absence of an explicit instruction to retrieve associated information. Here, we addressed this open question using high-resolution fMRI. Twenty-eight male and female human volunteers engaged in a recognition memory task for words that they had previously encoded together with faces and scenes. Using complementary uni- and multivariate approaches, we show that MTL subregions including the PRC, PHC, and HC differentially reinstate category-specific representations during high-confident word recognition, even though no explicit instruction to retrieve the associated category was given. This constitutes novel evidence that high-confident recognition memory is accompanied by incidental reinstatement of associated category information in MTL subregions, and supports a functional model of the MTL that emphasises content-sensitive representations during both encoding and retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal parvalbumin neurons mediate behavioral responses to chronic social stress</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Behavioral responses to stress are, in part, mediated by the hippocampus and Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons. However, whether chronic stress induces molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal PV neurons contribute to stress-induced behavioral outcomes remains elusive. METHOD: Using chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), we investigated the role of neuronal activity and gene expression in hippocampal PV neurons in mediating stress-resilience and -susceptibility. We first used in vivo high-density silicon probe recordings and chemogenetics to test whether the activity of PV neurons in ventral dentate gyrus (PVvDG) is associated with particular behavioral outcomes. To find critical molecular pathways associated with stress-resilience and -susceptibility, we used PV-neuron-selective translating ribosome affinity purification and RNAseq. We used immunoblotting, RNAscope, and region- or cell type-specific gene deletion to determine whether Ahnak, a molecule regulating depression-like behavior, was necessary for behavioral divergence after CSDS. RESULTS: We find CSDS modulates neuronal activity in vDG. Notably, stress-susceptibility is associated with an increase of PVvDG firing, which we find is necessary and sufficient for susceptibility. Additionally, genes involved in mitochondrial function, protein synthesis and synaptogenesis are differentially expressed in hippocampal PV neurons of stress-resilient and -susceptible mice. Interestingly, protein and mRNA levels of Ahnak, an endogenous regulator of L-type calcium channels are associated with susceptibility after CSDS. vDG- and PV cell type-specific deletions reveal that Ahnak is required for stress-susceptibility to CSDS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that CSDS-induced molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal PV neurons mediate behavioral consequences, proposing a mechanism underlying individual differences in stress vulnerability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">AAV-PHP.S-mediated delivery of reporters to cranial ganglion sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Because of their ease of use and low risk containment, Adeno-Associated Virus vectors are indispensable tools for much of neuroscience. Yet AAVs have been used relatively little to study the identities and connectivity of peripheral sensory neurons because methods to selectively target particular receptive fields or neuron types have been limited. The introduction of the AAVPHP.S capsid with selective tropism for peripheral neurons (Chan et al., 2017) offered a solution, which we further elaborate here. We demonstrate using AAV-PHP.S with GFP or mScarlet reporters, that all cranial sensory ganglia, i.e. for cranial nerves V, VII, IX and X, are targeted. Pseudounipolar neurons of both somatic and visceral origin, but not satellite glia, are efficiently transduced rapidly and express the gene of interest within 1 week of injection. Fluorescent reporter proteins are transported into the central and peripheral axons of these sensory neurons, permitting visualization of terminals at high resolution, and/or in intact, cleared brain using light sheet microscopy. By combining a Cre-dependent reporter with the AAVPHP.S capsid, we confirmed expression in a cell-type dependent manner for both anatomical and targeted functional analyses. The AAV-PHP.S capsid will be a powerful tool for mapping the receptive fields and circuits of molecular subtypes of many somatosensory, gustatory and visceral sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Naturalistic stimuli reveal a critical period in visual cortex development: Evidence from adult-onset blindness</a></h4>

              
                How do life experiences impact cortical function? In people who are born blind, the "visual" cortices are recruited for nonvisual tasks such as Braille reading and sound localization (e.g., Collignon et al., 2011; Sadato et al., 1996). The mechanisms of this recruitment are not known. Do visual cortices have a latent capacity to respond to nonvisual information that is equal throughout the lifespan? Alternatively, is there a sensitive period of heightened plasticity that makes visual cortex repurposing possible during childhood? To gain insight into these questions, we leveraged naturalistic auditory stimuli to quantify and compare cross-modal responses congenitally blind (CB, n=22), adult-onset blind (vision loss >18 years-of-age, AB, n=14) and sighted (n=22) individuals. Participants listened to auditory excerpts from movies; a spoken narrative; and matched meaningless auditory stimuli (i.e., shuffled sentences, backwards speech) during fMRI scanning. These rich naturalistic stimuli made it possible to simultaneous engage a broad range of cognitive domains. We correlated the voxel-wise timecourses of different participants within each group. For all groups, all stimulus conditions induced synchrony in auditory cortex and for all groups only the narrative stimuli synchronized responses in higher-cognitive fronto-parietal and temporal regions. Inter-subject synchrony in visual cortices was high in the CB group for the movie and narrative stimuli but not for meaningless auditory controls. In contrast, visual cortex synchrony was equally low among AB and sighted blindfolded participants. Even many years of blindness in adulthood fail to enable responses to naturalistic auditory information in visual cortices of people who had sight as children. These findings suggest that cross-modal responses in visual cortex of people born blind reflect the plasticity of developing visual cortex during a sensitive period.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The individuality of shape asymmetries of the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetries of the cerebral cortex are found across diverse phyla and occur at multiple spatial scales, from the global morphology of the two hemispheres to fine-grained sulcal and gyral anatomy. Cortical asymmetries are particularly pronounced in humans and have important implications for brain function and disease. However, most studies conflate asymmetries in regional size and shape and only consider effects at fairly fine-grained resolutions, such as image voxels or a priori regions-of-interest. As such, whether asymmetries are preferentially expressed at specific spatial resolutions over others remains unclear. Here, we apply a spectral shape analysis to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from three independent samples to derive a multiscale description of asymmetries in cortical shape that is distinct from regional size-related descriptors such as volume or thickness. We show that our proposed shape asymmetry signature (SAS) is a highly individualized feature, akin to a cortical fingerprint, that more accurately identifies individuals than size-based descriptors or measures of inter-regional functional coupling of brain activity. Notably, individual identifiability is optimal at coarse spatial scales (~37 mm wavelength), and shape asymmetries at specific scales show differences between males and females but are unrelated to the handedness. We further demonstrate that while unihemispheric shape descriptors show significant heritability at coarse scales, the SAS are determined primarily by unique environmental effects across all scales considered. Our findings thus identify coarse-scale scale asymmetries of cortical shape as being highly unique to individuals, sexually dimorphic, and largely driven by stochastic environmental influences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RTICBM-74 is a Brain-Penetrant CB1 Receptor Allosteric Modulator that Reduces Alcohol Intake in Rats</a></h4>

              
                The endocannabinoid system is implicated in the neuronal mechanisms of alcohol use disorder (AUD), with the cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 (CB1) representing a promising target for AUD therapeutic interventions. We have previously shown negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of the CB1 receptor attenuated the reinstatement of other drugs of abuse including cocaine and methamphetamine in rats; however, their effects on alcohol-related behaviors have not been investigated. Here, we tested the pharmacokinetic properties of one such CB1 NAM, RTICBM-74, and its effects on alcohol self-administration in rats. RTICBM-74 showed low aqueous solubility and high protein binding but had excellent half-life and low clearance against rat liver microsomes and hepatocytes, and excellent brain penetrance in rats. RTICBM-74 pretreatment specifically reduced alcohol intake across a range of doses in male or female Wistar or Long-Evans rats that were trained to self-administer alcohol. These effects were similar to the CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant which was tested as a positive control. Importantly, RTICBM-74 was effective at reducing alcohol intake at doses that did not affect locomotion or sucrose self-administration. Our findings suggest that CB1 NAMs such as RTICBM-74 have promising therapeutic potential in treatment of AUD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model-based characterization of the selectivity of neurons in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                To understand the complexity of stimulus selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1), models constructed to match observed responses to complex time-varying stimuli, instead of to explain responses to simple parametric stimuli, are increasingly used. While such models often can more accurately reflect the computations performed by V1 neurons in more natural visual environments, they do not by themselves provide insight into established measures of V1 neural selectivity such as receptive field size, spatial frequency tuning and phase invariance. Here, we suggest a series of analyses that can be directly applied to encoding models to link complex encoding models to more interpretable aspects of stimulus selectivity, applied to nonlinear models of V1 neurons recorded in awake macaque in response to random bar stimuli. In linking model properties to more classical measurements, we demonstrate several novel aspects of V1 selectivity not available to simpler experimental measurements. For example, we find that individual spatiotemporal elements of the V1 models often have a smaller spatial scale than the overall neuron sensitivity, and that this results in non-trivial tuning to spatial frequencies. Additionally, our proposed measures of nonlinear integration suggest that more classical classifications of V1 neurons into simple versus complex cells are spatial-frequency dependent. In total, rather than obfuscate classical characterizations of V1 neurons, model-based characterizations offer a means to more fully understand their selectivity, and provide a means to link their classical tuning properties to their roles in more complex, natural, visual processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimization of long-term human iPSC-derived spinal motor neuron culture using a dendritic polyglycerol amine-based substrate</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (h-iPSCs) derived from healthy and diseased individuals can give rise to many cell types, facilitating the study of mechanisms of development, human disease modeling, and early drug target validation. In this context, experimental model systems based on h-iPSC-derived motor neurons (MNs) have been used to study MN diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Modeling MN disease using h-iPSC-based approaches requires culture conditions that can recapitulate in a dish the events underlying differentiation, maturation, aging, and death of MNs. Current h-iPSC-derived MN-based applications are often hampered by limitations in our ability to monitor MN morphology, survival, and other functional properties over a prolonged timeframe, underscoring the need for improved long-term culture conditions. Here we describe a cytocompatible dendritic polyglycerol amine (dPGA) substrate-based method for prolonged culture of h-iPSC-derived MNs. We provide evidence that MNs cultured on dPGA-coated dishes are more amenable to long-term study of cell viability, molecular identity, and spontaneous network electrophysiological activity. The present study has the potential to improve iPSC-based studies of human MN biology and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interpreting sensory and cognitive signals in the cortical reading network</a></h4>

              
                Receptive field properties measured in the reading portion of the ventral occipital-temporal (VOT) cortex are task- and stimulus-dependent. To understand these effects, we analyzed responses in visual field-maps (V1-3, hV4, VO1) whose signals are likely inputs to the VOT. Within these maps, each voxel contains neurons that are responsive to specific regions of the visual field; these regions can be quantified using the moving bar paradigm and population receptive field (pRF) analysis. We measured pRFs using several types of contrast patterns within the bar (English words, Hebrew words, checkers, and false fonts). Word and false-font stimuli produce estimates that are as much as 3-4 deg closer to the fovea than checker stimuli in all visual field maps, becoming very pronounced in V3, hV4 and VO-1. The responses in the visual field maps suggest that the pRF shifts depend mostly on the visual characteristics of the stimulus, and may be explained by sensory signal models and their known neural circuitry. Responses in the VOT reading regions do not follow the same pattern as the visual maps. The pRF centers are confined to the central five degrees, and the responses to false-fonts differ from the responses to words. To understand these VOT signals, we suggest it is necessary to extend the sensory pRF model to include an explicit cognitive signal that distinguishes words from false-fonts.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are neurodevelopmental diseases associated with various genetic mutations. Recent clinical studies report that chromosomal 12q24.31 microdeletions are associated with human ASD/ID. However, the causality and underlying mechanisms linking 12q24.31 microdeletions to ASD/ID pathogenesis remain undetermined. Here we show Kdm2b, one of the genes located in chromosomal 12q24.31, plays a critical role in maintaining neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing mouse brain. Loss of the CxxC-ZF domain of KDM2B impairs its function in recruiting Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to chromatin, resulting in de-repression of genes involved in cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, NSC premature senescence, and leading to the loss of NSC populations in the brain. Importantly, the Kdm2b mutation is sufficient to induce ASD/ID-like social and memory deficits in adult mice. Thus, our study reveals a critical role of an epigenetic factor KDM2B in normal brain development, a causality between the Kdm2b mutation and genesis of ASD/ID-like phenotypes in mice, and potential molecular mechanisms linking the function of KDM2B-PRC1 in transcriptional regulation and NSC senescence to the12q24.31 microdeletion-associated ASD/ID.

                Most systems neuroscience studies fall into one of two categories: basic science work aimed at understanding the relationship between neurons and behavior, or translational work aimed at developing treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we use these two approaches to inform and enhance each other. Our study both tests hypotheses about basic science neural coding principles and elucidates the neuronal mechanisms underlying new, clinically relevant behavioral effects of systemically administered methylphenidate (Ritalin). We discovered that orally administered methylphenidate, used clinically to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and generally to enhance cognition (Lakhan & Kirchgessner, 2012; Maher, 2008), increases spatially selective visual attention, enhancing visual performance at only the attended location. And as predicted by our previous work (Ni et al., 2018), we found that this causal manipulation enhances vision in rhesus macaques specifically when it decreases the mean correlated variability of neurons in visual area V4. Our findings demonstrate that the visual system is a platform for understanding the neural underpinnings of both complex cognitive processes (basic science) and neuropsychiatric disorders (translation). Addressing basic science hypotheses, our results are consistent with a scenario in which methylphenidate has cognitively specific effects by working through naturally selective cognitive mechanisms. Clinically, our findings suggest that the often staggeringly specific symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders may be caused and treated by leveraging general mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social isolation is linked to classical risk factors of Alzheimer's disease-related dementias</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is a major public health burden - compounding over upcoming years due to longevity. Recently, clinical evidence hinted at the experience of social isolation in expediting dementia onset. In 502,506 UK Biobank participants and 30,097 participants from the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging, we revisited traditional risk factors for developing dementia in the context of loneliness and lacking social support. Across these measures of subjective and objective social deprivation, we have identified strong links between individuals' social capital and various indicators of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias risk, which replicated across both population cohorts. The quality and quantity of daily social encounters had deep connections with key aetiopathological factors, which represent 1) personal habits and lifestyle factors, 2) physical health, 3) mental health, and 4) societal and external factors. Our population-scale assessment suggest that social lifestyle determinants are linked to most neurodegeneration risk factors, highlighting them promising targets for preventive clinical action.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">c-Kit mediates cutaneous sensory axon innervation and multi-kinase inhibitor-induced neurotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral somatosensory neurons innervate the skin and sense the environment. Loss of skin innervation, often caused by the dying back of distal somatosensory axons, is a common side effect of drug-induced peripheral neuropathies (DIPNs) and results in pain and sensory dysfunction. Targeted cancer therapies frequently employ multi-kinase inhibitor (MKI) drugs that each block multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. Many MKIs produce DIPNs but the molecular targets and cellular mechanisms underlying these are unknown. We performed live-imaging of cutaneous somatosensory axons in larval zebrafish during treatment with several MKIs known to induce DIPNs, and observed axonal retraction consistent with a dying back pathology. These results were replicated in mouse somatosensory neurons. Genetic knockout of potential MKI targets identified c-Kit receptor as a regulator of sensory axon innervation and a major target of these MKIs mediating loss of axonal density. In both fish and mammals, Kit receptor is expressed in cutaneous somatosensory neurons and its ligand, Kitlg, is expressed in the skin. Mosaic misexpression of Kitlg in the skin induced dramatic increases in local sensory axon density, suggesting an important role for Kit signaling in cutaneous axon growth and maintenance. Immunostaining and structure-function analysis revealed Src, a downstream Kit target, mediates Kits role in cutaneous axon innervation and MKI neurotoxicity. Our data shows that the Kit-Src signaling pathway has a major role in cutaneous sensory axon innervation and is a potential therapeutic target to address DIPNs caused by MKIs and other compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individualized Assays of Temporal Coding in the Ascending Human Auditory System</a></h4>

              
                Neural phase-locking to temporal fluctuations is a fundamental and unique mechanism by which acoustic information is encoded by the auditory system. The perceptual role of this metabolically expensive mechanism, the neural phase-locking to temporal fine structure (TFS) in particular, is debated. Although hypothesized, it is unclear if auditory perceptual deficits in certain clinical populations are attributable to deficits in TFS coding. Efforts to uncover the role of TFS have been impeded by the fact that there are no established assays for quantifying the fidelity of TFS coding at the individual level. While many candidates have been proposed, for an assay to be useful, it should not only intrinsically depend on TFS coding, but should also have the property that individual differences in the assay reflect TFS coding per se over and beyond other sources of variance. Here, we evaluate a range of behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based measures as candidate individualized measures of TFS sensitivity. Our comparisons of behavioral and EEG-based metrics suggest that extraneous variables dominate both behavioral scores and EEG amplitude metrics, rendering them ineffective. After adjusting behavioral scores using lapse rates, and extracting latency or percent-growth metrics from EEG, interaural timing sensitivity measures exhibit robust behavior-EEG correlations. Together with the fact that unambiguous theoretical links can be made relating binaural measures and phase-locking to TFS, our results suggest that these "adjusted" binaural assays may be well-suited for quantifying individual TFS processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping brain-wide excitatory projectome of primate prefrontal cortex at submicron resolution: relevance to diffusion tractography</a></h4>

              
                Resolving trajectories of axonal pathways in the primate prefrontal cortex remains crucial to gain insights into higher-order processes of cognition and emotion, which requires a comprehensive map of axonal projections linking demarcated subdivisions of prefrontal cortex and the rest of brain. Here we report a mesoscale excitatory projectome issued from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) to the entire macaque brain by using viral-based genetic axonal tracing in tandem with high-throughput serial two-photon tomography, which demonstrated prominent monosynaptic projections to other prefrontal areas, temporal, limbic and subcortical areas, relatively weak projections to parietal and insular cortices but no projections directly to the occipital lobe. In a common 3D space, we quantitatively validated an atlas of diffusion tractography-derived vlPFC connections with correlative enhanced green fluorescent protein-labelled axonal tracing, and observed generally good agreement except a major difference in the posterior projections of inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These findings raise an intriguing question as to how neural information passes along long-range association fiber bundles in macaque brains, and call for the caution of using diffusion tractography to map the wiring diagram of brain circuits.

                Migraine is a poorly understood neurological disorder and a leading cause of disability in young adults. Migraines are characterized by severe pulsating unilateral headache and visual symptoms. Whether visual function is also impaired in the interictal period between migraines remains controversial. Thus, this meta-analysis investigated the evidence for altered visual function as measured electrophysiologically via pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitudes and habituation in adult migraineurs with or without visual aura and control in the interictal period. Twenty-three studies were selected for random effects meta-analysis, demonstrating slightly diminished VEP amplitudes and substantially reduced habituation in the early P100 component in migraineurs without aura and with aura compared to controls. No differences were found between migraineurs with and without aura. Although heterogeneity between studies and insufficient published data for VEP latencies and the earlier N75 VEP component data was observed and require further testing, P100 anomalies may indicate abnormal functioning of the fast-conducting magnocellular visual pathway, in episodic migraineurs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synthetic amyloid beta does not induce a robust transcriptional response in innate immune cell culture systems</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts nearly 400 million people worldwide. The accumulation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) in the brain has historically been associated with AD, and recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a central role in its origin and progression. These observations have given rise to the theory that A{beta} is the primary trigger of AD, and induces proinflammatory activation of immune brain cells (i.e. microglia), which culminates in neuronal damage and cognitive decline. In order to test this hypothesis, many in vitro systems have been established to study A{beta}-mediated activation of innate immune cells. Nevertheless, the transcriptional resemblance of these models to the microglia in the AD brain has never been comprehensively studied on a genome-wide scale. To address this, we used bulk RNA-seq to assess the transcriptional differences between in vitro cell types used to model neuroinflammation in AD, including several established, primary and iPSC-derived immune cell lines (macrophages, microglia and astrocytes) and their similarities to primary cells in the AD brain. We then analyzed the transcriptional response of these innate immune cells to synthetic A{beta}. We found that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived microglia (IMGL) are the in vitro cell model that best resembles primary microglia. Surprisingly, synthetic A{beta} does not trigger a robust transcriptional response in any of the cellular models analyzed, despite testing a wide variety of A{beta} formulations, concentrations, and treatment conditions. Finally, we found that bacterial LPS and INF{gamma} activate microglia and induce transcriptional changes similar to those observed in disease associated microglia present in the AD brain, suggesting the potential suitability of this model to study AD-related neuroinflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of superstition of cognitive control during neurofeedback training</a></h4>

              
                Background: Real-time fMRI neurofeedback is growing in reputation as a means to alter brain activity patterns and alleviate psychiatric symptoms. Activity in ventral striatum structures is considered an index of training efficacy. fMRI response in these brain regions indicates neurofeedback-driven associative learning. Here we investigated the impact of mere superstition of control as observed during neurofeedback training on patterns of fMRI activation. Methods: We examined the brain activations of a large sample of young participants (n = 97, 50 female, age range 18-54yrs) in a simple fMRI task. Participants saw a display similar to that typically used for real-time fMRI. They were instructed to watch the bars' movements or to control them with their own brain activity. Bar movements were not connected with brain activity of participants in any way and perceptions of control were superstitious. After the pretended control condition, they rated how well they were able to control the bars' movements. Results: Strong activation in the basal ganglia and ventral striatum as well as in large portions of the anterior insula, supplementary motor area, and the middle frontal gyrus due to the superstition of brain control. Conclusions: The superstition of control over one's own brain activity in a pretended neurofeedback training session activates the same neural networks as neurofeedback-driven learning. Therefore, activity in the basal ganglia and ventral striatum cannot be taken as evidence for neurofeedback-driven associative learning unless its effects are proven to supersede those elicited by appropriate sham conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bodily ownership of an independent supernumerary limb: An exploratory study</a></h4>

              
                Can our brain perceive a sense of ownership towards an independent supernumerary limb; one that can be moved independently of any other limb and provides its own independent movement feedback? Following the rubber-hand illusion experiment, a plethora of studies have shown that the human representation of 'self' is very plastic. But previous studies have almost exclusively investigated ownership towards 'substitute' artificial limbs, which are controlled by the movements of a real limb and/or limbs from which non-visual sensory feedback is provided on an existing limb. Here, to investigate whether the human brain can own an independent artificial limb, we first developed a novel independent robotic 'sixth finger.' We allowed participants to train using the finger and examined whether it induced changes in the body representation using behavioral as well as cognitive measures. Our results suggest that unlike a substituted artificial limb (like in the rubber hand experiment), it is more difficult for humans to perceive a sense of ownership towards an independent limb. However, ownership does seem possible, as we observed clear tendencies of changes in the body representation that correlated with the cognitive reports of the sense of ownership. Our results provide the first evidence to show that an independent supernumerary limb can be embodied by the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural Disconnection of the Posterior Medial Frontal Cortex Reduces Speech Error Monitoring</a></h4>

              
                Optimal performance in any task relies on the ability to detect and repair errors. The anterior cingulate cortex and the broader posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) are active during error processing. However, it is unclear whether damage to the pMFC impairs error monitoring. We hypothesized that successful error monitoring critically relies on connections between the pMFC and broader cortical networks involved in executive functions and the task being monitored. We tested this hypothesis in the context of speech error monitoring in people with post-stroke aphasia. Diffusion weighted images were collected in 51 adults with chronic left-hemisphere stroke and 37 age-matched control participants. Whole-brain connectomes were derived using constrained spherical deconvolution and anatomically-constrained probabilistic tractography. Support vector regressions identified white matter connections in which lost integrity in stroke survivors related to reduced error detection during confrontation naming. Lesioned connections to the bilateral pMFC were related to reduced error monitoring, including many connections to regions associated with speech production and executive function. We conclude that connections to the pMFC support error monitoring. Error monitoring in speech production is supported by the structural connectivity between the pMFC and regions involved in speech production and executive function. Interactions between pMFC and other task relevant processors may similarly be critical for error monitoring in other task contexts.

                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or autism is characterized by social and non-social symptoms, including sensory hyper- and hyposensitivities. A suggestion has been put forward that some of these symptoms could be explained by differences in how sensory information is integrated with its context, including a lower tendency to leverage the past in the processing of new perceptual input. At least two history-dependent effects of opposite directions have been described in the visual perception literature: a repulsive adaptation effect, where perception of a stimulus is biased away from an adaptor stimulus, and an attractive serial choice bias, where perceptual choices are biased towards the previous choice. In this study, we investigated whether autistic participants differed in either bias from typically developing controls (TD). Sixty-four adolescent participants (31 with ASD, 33 TD) were asked to categorize oriented line stimuli in two tasks which were designed so that we would induce either adaptation or serial choice bias. Although our tasks successfully induced both biases, in comparing the two groups, we found no differences in the magnitude of adaptation nor in the modulation of perceptual choices by the previous choice. In conclusion, we find no evidence of a decreased integration of the past in visual perception of autistic individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Blood-based untargeted metabolomics in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis revealed the testable therapeutic target</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic aberrations impact the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and possibly can provide clues for new treatment strategies. Using untargeted metabolomics, we measured serum metabolites from 35 relapsing-remitting patients and 14 healthy age-matched controls. Out of 632 known metabolites detected, 60 were significantly altered in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Bioinformatics analysis identified an altered metabotype in RRMS patients, represented by 4 changed metabolic pathways of glycerophospholipid, citrate cycle, sphingolipid, and pyruvate metabolism. Interestingly, the common upstream metabolic pathway feeding these 4 pathways is the glycolysis pathway. Real-time bioenergetic analysis of the patient derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells, showed enhanced glycolysis, supporting the altered metabolic state of immune cells. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice treated with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose ameliorated the disease progression and inhibited the disease pathology significantly by promoting the anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes/macrophage in the central nervous system. Our study suggests that targeting glycolysis offers a potential target for MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation increases eye-gaze on salient facial features and oxytocin release</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with promising therapeutic potential in the context of epilepsy, pain, and depression and which may also have beneficial effects on social cognition. However, the underlying mechanisms of taVNS are unclear and evidence regarding its role in social cognition improvement is limited. Objective: In order to investigate the impact of taVNS on social cognition we have studied its effects on gaze towards emotional faces using an eye-tracking task and also on release of the neuropeptide oxytocin which plays a key role in influencing social cognition and motivation. Methods: A total of fifty-four subjects were enrolled in a sham-controlled, participant-blind crossover experiment, consisting of two treatment sessions, separated by one week. In one session participants received 30-min taVNS (tragus), and in the other, they received 30-min sham (earlobe) stimulation with the treatment order counterbalanced across participants. Gaze duration towards the faces and facial features (eyes, nose, and mouth) were measured together with resting pupil size. Additionally, saliva samples were taken for the measurement of oxytocin concentrations by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results: Saliva oxytocin concentrations increased significantly after taVNS compared to sham stimulation, while resting pupil size did not. In addition, taVNS increased fixation time on the nose region irrespective of face emotion, and this was positively correlated with increased saliva oxytocin concentrations. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that taVNS biases visual attention towards socially salient facial features across different emotions and this is associated with its effects on increasing endogenous oxytocin release.

                Recent works shed light on the neural correlates of true and false recognition and the influence of time of day on cognitive performance. The current study aimed to investigate the modulation of the false memory formation by the time of day using a non-linear correlation analysis originally designed for fMRI resting-state data. Fifty-four young and healthy participants (32 females, mean age: 24.17 y.o., SD: 3.56 y.o.) performed in MR scanner the modified Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm in short-term memory during one session in the morning and another in the evening. Subjects' responses were modeled with a general linear model, which includes as a predictor the non-linear correlations of regional BOLD activity with the stimuli, separately for encoding and retrieval phases. The results show the dependence of the non-linear correlations measures with the time of day and the type of the probe. In addition, the results indicate differences in the correlations measures with hippocampal regions between positive and lure probes. Besides confirming previous results on the influence of time-of-day on cognitive performance, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the non-linear correlation analysis method for the characterization of fMRI task paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Addiction-Related Memory Transfer and Retention in Planaria</a></h4>

              
                Memory retention and transfer in organisms happen at either the neural or genetic level. In humans, addictive behavior is known to pass from parents to offspring. In flatworm planaria (Dugesia tigrina), memory transfer has been claimed to be horizontal, i.e., through cannibalism. Our study is a preliminary step to understand the mechanisms underlying the transfer of addictive behavior to offspring. Since the neural and neurochemical responses of planaria share similarities with humans, it is possible to induce addictions and get predictable behavioral responses. Addiction can be induced in planaria, and decapitation will reveal if the addictive memories are solely stored in the brain. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that addictive memory is also retained in the brainless posterior region of planaria. The surface preference of the planaria was first determined between smooth and rough surfaces. Through Pavlovian conditioning, the preferred surface was paired with water and the unpreferred surface with sucrose. After the planaria were trained and addicted, their surface preference shifted as a conditioned place preference (CPP) was established. When decapitated, the regenerated segment from the anterior part containing the brain retained the addiction, thus maintaining a shift in the surface preference. Importantly, we observed that the posterior part preserved this CPP as well, suggesting that memory retention is not attributed exclusively to the brain but might also occur at the genetic level. As a secondary objective, the effects of neurotransmitter blocking agents in preventing addiction were studied by administering a D1 dopamine antagonist to planaria, which could provide pointers to treat addictions in humans.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease, with fatigue syndrome as one of the main symptoms. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that moderate physical activity (MPA) may have a beneficial effect on postural stability, balance, and clinical parameters. The research group consisted of 137 randomized patients hospitalized at the Department of Neurological Rehabilitation, Medical University of Lodz. Finally, 76 patients were qualified who were divided into two groups—high fatigue (HF) and low fatigue (LF). Participants were assessed twice: before and after a 4-week MPA program using: the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and stabilometric platform tests were performed. Results obtained after the 4-week MPA program showed a positive effect of the MPA with differences between LF and HF groups. The MPA was more effective in MS patients with LF in cognitive functions, functional status, and postural stability but among HF patients in an emotional state, especially in MS patients below 65 years, although in total, both groups benefited from the MPA.</p>

	<p>Temporal processing (TP) is associated with functions such as perception, verbal skills, temporal perspective, and future planning, and is intercorrelated with working memory, attention, and inhibitory control, which are highly impaired in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here we evaluate TP measures as potential endophenotypes in Caribbean families ascertained from probands affected by ADHD. A total of 232 individuals were recruited and clinically evaluated using an extensive battery of neuropsychological tasks and reaction time (RT)-based task paradigms. Further, the heritability (genetic variance underpinning phenotype) was estimated as a measure of the genetics apportionment. A predictive framework for ADHD diagnosis was derived using these tasks. We found that individuals with ADHD differed from controls in neuropsychological tasks assessing mental control, visual-verbal memory, verbal fluency, verbal, and semantic fluency. In addition, TP measures such as RT, errors, and variability were also affected in individuals with ADHD. Moreover, we determined that only omission and commission errors had significant heritability. In conclusion, we have disentangled omission and commission errors as possible TP endophenotypes in ADHD, which can be suitable to assess the neurobiological and genetic basis of ADHD. A predictive model using these endophenotypes led to remarkable sensitivity, specificity, precision and classification rate for ADHD diagnosis, and may be a useful tool for patients’ diagnosis, follow-up, and longitudinal assessment in the clinical setting.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacts healthcare utilization across all care settings and health conditions. The objective of this study was to determine changes in hospital admissions for neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany; (2) Methods: This cross-sectional study used nationwide administrative claims data covering 1468 hospitals. The primary outcome was the year-to-year relative change in case numbers during a four-month study period (16 January–15 May 2020 vs. 2019) during the first pandemic wave. Secondary outcomes included year-to-year relative changes during a four-week peak phase (16 March–15 April) and changes between differential phases of the wave. The analyzed NDD comprised progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease; (3) Results: Hospital admissions for any reason decreased by 16.7% in 2020 during the study period and by 36.6% during the peak phase, whereas admissions for NDD decreased by 27.6% and 65.0%, respectively. PSP cases decreased during the study period (−34.7%) and the peak phase (−68.1%) and stayed reduced in a late phase with falling COVID-19 numbers. MSA and ALS cases increased strongest after the peak, with ALS cases being comparatively weakly reduced during the study period (−17.3%) and peak phase (−51.7%); (4) Conclusions: Inpatient care utilization for NDD changed differentially during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and showed a greater reduction than overall and general neurological admissions. Mitigating long-term health deterioration of this vulnerable subgroup is important to reduce morbidity and mortality in the future.</p>

	<p>The adaptive control hypothesis developed by Green and Abutalebi is the most influential theory of bilingual language control. The focus of this article is on the predictions that other researchers have derived based on the three different modes of interactional context described by the hypothesis. Foremost, that dual-language contexts should enhance domain-general executive functions more than single-language contexts. Several recent and ambitious behavioral tests of these predictions are reviewed. Although there was some evidence that dual-language contexts are associated with smaller switch costs, the evidence is inconsistent and there were no similar advantages for inhibitory control. The hypothesis also predicts neuroanatomical adaptations to the three types of interactional context. A careful evaluation of the relevant fMRI and ERP studies that take into account whether behavioral differences align with neuroscience differences and resolves valence ambiguities led to the conclusion that the neuroscience evidence for the hypothesis is, at best, inconsistent. The study also includes new analyses of two large-sample studies that enable the identification of relatively pure cases of single-language bilinguals, dual-language bilinguals, and dense-code switchers. Across nine different measures of executive functioning, the predicted advantage of the dual-language context never materialized. The hypotheses derived from the adaptive control hypothesis do not accurately predict behavioral performance on tests of executive functioning and do not advance our understanding as to what dimensions of bilingualism may lead to enhancements in specific components of executive functioning.</p>

	<p>Background: Depression is a common psychiatric comorbidity in individuals with Down syndrome (DS), particularly adults, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of at least 10%. The current literature on the treatment of depression in adults with DS is limited to case series published more than two decades ago, prior to the widespread use of modern antidepressant medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The purpose of this retrospective chart review study was to examine the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of SSRIs for depression in adults with DS. Methods: Medical records of 11 adults with DS and depression were reviewed. Assignment of scores for severity (S) of symptoms of depression and improvement (I) of symptoms with treatment with an SSRI was made retrospectively using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population, SSRI name, dose, and duration of treatment; and adverse effects were also recorded. Results: All 11 patients (7 male, 4 female; mean age = 27.2 years, range 18–46 years) completed a 12-week treatment course with an SSRI. The median duration of time after initiation of the SSRI covered by record review was 2.1 years, with a range of 24 weeks to 6.7 years. Nine of the 11 patients (82%; 95% CI 52%, 95%) were judged responders to SSRIs based on a rating of “much improved” or “very much improved” on the CGI-I after 12 weeks of treatment (median time of follow-up was 14.4 weeks, with a range of 12.0–33.0 weeks). Adverse effects occurred in four patients (36%). The most common adverse effects were daytime sedation and anger. Conclusions: In this preliminary retrospective study, the majority of patients responded to a 12-week course of SSRI treatment and some tolerated long-term use.

<p>Subanalgesic morphine augments fentanyl analgesia via MOP and DOP interactions that increase G protein activation unrelated to MOP receptor internalization. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are commonly used for the treatment of postoperative and post-traumatic pain; however, their therapeutic effectiveness is limited by undesirable and life-threatening side effects. Researchers have long attempted to develop opioid co-administration therapies that enhance analgesia, but the complexity of opioid analgesia and our incomplete mechanistic understanding has made this a daunting task. We discovered that subanalgesic morphine doses (100 ng/kg–10 µg/kg) augmented the acute analgesic effect of fentanyl (20 µg/kg) following subcutaneous drug co-administration to male rats. In addition, administration of equivalent drug ratios to naïve rat spinal cord membranes induced a twofold increase in G protein activation. The rate of GTP hydrolysis remained unchanged. We demonstrated that these behavioral and biochemical effects were mediated by the delta opioid receptor (DOP). Subanalgesic doses of the DOP-selective agonist SNC80 also augmented the acute analgesic effect of fentanyl. Furthermore, co-administration of the DOP antagonist naltrindole with both fentanyl-morphine and fentanyl-SNC80 combinations prevented augmentation of both analgesia and G protein activation. The mu opioid receptor (MOP) antagonist cyprodime did not block augmentation. Confocal microscopy of the substantia gelatinosa of rats treated with fentanyl, subanalgesic morphine, or this combination showed that changes in MOP internalization did not account for augmentation effects. Together, these findings suggest that augmentation of fentanyl analgesia by subanalgesic morphine is mediated by increased G protein activation resulting from a synergistic interaction between or heterodimerization of MOPs and DOPs. This finding is of great therapeutic significance because it suggests a strategy for the development of DOP-selective ligands that can enhance the therapeutic index of clinically used MOP drugs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of acetylcholine on cortical activation were studied in wild-type (WT) mice, compared to knockout (KO) mice depleted of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene in the basal forebrain, and knockdown (KD) mice with heterogeneous depletion of VAChT gene in the brain. Cortical activation was assessed by comparing power spectra of local field potentials (LFPs) during activated states of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM) or walk (WLK), with those during non-activated states of slow-wave sleep (SWS) or awake-immobility (IMM). Activation-induced suppression of delta (1–4 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) power in the hippocampus, and delta power in frontal cortex, were reduced in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Mean theta frequency was higher in KD than KO mice during WLK and REM, but not different between WT and KO mice. Peak theta (4–12 Hz) and integrated gamma (30–150 Hz) power were not significantly different among mouse groups. However, theta-peak-frequency selected gamma2 (62–100 Hz) power was lower in KO than WT or KD mice during WLK, and theta-peak-frequency selected theta power during REM decreased faster with high theta frequency in KO than WT/ KD mice. Theta power increase during REM compared to WLK was lower in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Theta–gamma cross-frequency coherence, a measure of synchronization of gamma with theta phase, was not different among mouse groups. However, during REM, SWS, and IMM, delta-gamma coherence was significantly higher and proximal–distal delta coherence in CA1 was lower in KO than WT/KD mice. We conclude that a deficiency in basal forebrain acetylcholine release not only enhances slow waves and suppresses theta-associated gamma waves during activation, but also increases delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence during nonactivated states, with a possible effect of disrupting cognitive processing during any brain state.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination is crucial for the development and maintenance of axonal integrity, especially fast axonal action potential conduction. There is increasing evidence that glutamate signaling and release through neuronal activity modulates the myelination process. In this study, we examine the effect of manipulating glutamate signaling on myelination of oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells and their development in zebrafish (zf). We use the “intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter” (iGluSnFR) in the zf model (both sexes) to address the hypothesis that glutamate is implicated in regulation of myelinating OLs. Our results show that glial iGluSnFR expression significantly reduces OL lineage cell number and the expression of myelin markers in larvae (zfl) and adult brains. The specific glutamate receptor agonist, L-AP4, rescues this iGluSnFR effect by significantly increasing the expression of the myelin-related genes, <i>plp1b</i> and <i>mbpa</i>, and enhances myelination in L-AP4-injected zfl compared to controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that degrading glutamate using Glutamat-Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT) or the blockade of glutamate reuptake by L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC) significantly decreases myelin-related genes and drastically declines myelination in brain ventricle-injected zfl. Moreover, we found that myelin-specific ClaudinK (CldnK) and 36K protein expression is significantly decreased in iGluSnFR-expressing zfl and adult brains compared to controls. Taken together, this study confirms that glutamate signaling is directly required for the preservation of myelinating OLs and for the myelination process itself. These findings further suggest that glutamate signaling may provide novel targets to therapeutically boost remyelination in several demyelinating diseases of the CNS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Retinoic Acid Signaling in the Hippocampus of Aged Rats with and without Memory Impairment</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A, has many physiological functions, and mounting evidence points to important roles in cognition. <I>In vitro</I> experiments indicate that RA is involved in homeostatic synaptic scaling in the hippocampus, which supports overall network stability during learning. It has been previously determined that disrupted RA signaling in the hippocampus causes deterioration of memory, that RA signaling declines with age in brain, and that application of RA reverses this decline. Here, we explore whether RA signaling is altered in an animal model of neurocognitive aging. We used a Morris water maze protocol to study cognitive decline in aged rats, which assesses hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and reveals substantial interindividual differences in aged animals. Aged unimpaired (AU) rats perform on par with young (Y), while aged impaired (AI) animals exhibit spatial memory deficits. We show that the major substrate for RA, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), is decreased in AU rats, and retinol cell surface receptor declines with chronological age. Other affected components of RA signaling include selective increases in AI animals in hippocampal synthesis (RALDH1) and catabolism of RA (CYP26B1), RA receptor &alpha;, the RA regulated ionotropic glutamate receptor (GluR1), as well as fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The results support the conclusion that, surprisingly, increased RA signaling in the aged hippocampus is associated with poor cognitive outcome.</p>

<p>Brain stem is one of the earliest affected regions in synucleinopathies. The present study demonstrated that pontine mean diffusivity values would be a useful neurodegeneration marker in synucleinopathies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pons is one of the earliest affected regions in patients with synucleinopathies. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of measuring pontine damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in these patients. We enrolled 49 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 16 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), 23 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 39 healthy controls in this study. All the participants underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DTI. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fraction anisotropy (FA) values in the pons were calculated to characterize structural damage. The discriminatory power of pontine MD and FA values to differentiate patients with synucleinopathies from healthy controls was examined using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses. Compared to healthy controls, patients with PD, iRBD, and MSA had increased MD values and decreased FA values in the pons, although no correlation was observed between these DTI measures and disease severity. The ROC analyses showed that MD values in the pons had a fair discriminatory power to differentiate healthy controls from patients with PD (area under the curve [AUC], 0.813), iRBD (AUC, 0.779), and MSA (AUC, 0.951). The AUC for pontine FA values was smaller than that for pontine MD values when differentiating healthy controls from patients with PD (AUC, 0.713; <i>p</i> = 0.054) and iRBD (AUC, 0.686; <i>p</i> = 0.045). Our results suggest that MD values in the pons may be a useful marker of brain stem neurodegeneration in patients with synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>Loss of <i>Cx3cr1</i> function compromises cochlear defense mechanisms against noise-induced neutrophil infiltration and potentiates functional loss of the cochlea. This study provides new insights into the molecular control of cochlear neutrophil activities after noise damage.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cochlea, the sensory organ for hearing, has a protected immune environment, segregated from the systemic immune system by the blood-labyrinth barrier. Previous studies have revealed that acute acoustic injury causes the infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the cochlea. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling immune cell trafficking are poorly understood. Here, we report the role of CX3CR1 in regulating the entry of neutrophils into the cochlea after acoustic trauma. We employed B6.129P-<i>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup>
</i>/J mice, a transgenic strain that lacks the gene, <i>Cx3cr1</i>, for coding the fractalkine receptor. Our results demonstrate that lack of <i>Cx3cr1</i> results in the augmentation of neutrophil infiltration into cochlear tissues after exposure to an intense noise of 120 dB SPL for 1 hr. Neutrophil distribution in the cochlea is site specific, and the infiltration level is positively associated with noise intensity. Moreover, neutrophils are short lived and macrophage phagocytosis plays a role in neutrophil clearance, consistent with typical neutrophil dynamics in inflamed non-cochlear tissues. Importantly, our study reveals the potentiation of noise-induced hearing loss and sensory cell loss in <i>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice. In wild-type control mice (<i>Cx3cr1<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) exposed to the same noise, we also found neutrophils. However, neutrophils were present primarily inside the microvessels of the cochlea, with only a few in the cochlear tissues. Collectively, our data implicate CX3CR1-mediated signaling in controlling neutrophil migration from the circulation into cochlear tissues and provide a better understanding of the impacts of neutrophils on cochlear responses to acoustic injury.</p>

                Background: Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic disease affecting bones. Objective: To investigate the long-term effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) combined with exercise protocol on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers in men with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Methods: Ninety-five males with osteopenia or osteoporosis (mean age, 51.26 ± 2.41 years; mean height, 176 ± 2.02 cm; mean weight, 83.08 ± 2.60 kg; mean body–mass index (BMI), 26.08 ± 1.09 kg/m2) participated in the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received a full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PEMF +EX), Group 2 received a placebo full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PPEMF +EX), and Group 3 received a full-body PEMF alone (PEMF). PEMF was applied for the whole body using a full-body mat three times per week for 12 weeks, with an exercise protocol that includes flexibility, aerobic exercise, strengthening, weight-bearing, and balance exercises followed by whole-body vibration (WBV) training. Outcome measures include BMD of total hip and lumbar spine and bone markers [serum osteocalcin (s-OC), Serum amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-NTX), Serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX), Parathyroid hormones (PTH), Bone-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (Vit D)]. Results: The BMD of total hip and lumbar spine was significantly increased post-treatment in all groups, and more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than Group 3. There was a significant difference in bone markers in all groups, more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than in Group 3. Conclusion: PEMF combined with exercise protocol exerts a potent role for treating OP, is more effective than exercise and PEMF alone for increasing BMD and enhancing bone formation, and suppresses bone-resorption markers after 12-weeks of treatment with the impact lasting up to 6 months.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rats spontaneously perceive global motion direction of drifting plaids</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giulio Matteucci, Benedetta Zattera, Rosilari Bellacosa Marotti, Davide Zoccolan</p>

Computing global motion direction of extended visual objects is a hallmark of primate high-level vision. Although neurons selective for global motion have also been found in mouse visual cortex, it remains unknown whether rodents can combine multiple motion signals into global, integrated percepts. To address this question, we trained two groups of rats to discriminate either gratings (G group) or plaids (i.e., superpositions of gratings with different orientations; P group) drifting horizontally along opposite directions. After the animals learned the task, we applied a visual priming paradigm, where presentation of the target stimulus was preceded by the brief presentation of either a grating or a plaid. The extent to which rat responses to the targets were biased by such prime stimuli provided a measure of the spontaneous, perceived similarity between primes and targets. We found that gratings and plaids, when uses as primes, were equally effective at biasing the perception of plaid direction for the rats of the P group. Conversely, for G group, only the gratings acted as effective prime stimuli, while the plaids failed to alter the perception of grating direction. To interpret these observations, we simulated a decision neuron reading out the representations of gratings and plaids, as conveyed by populations of either component or pattern cells (i.e., local or global motion detectors). We concluded that the findings for the P group are highly consistent with the existence of a population of pattern cells, playing a functional role similar to that demonstrated in primates. We also explored different scenarios that could explain the failure of the plaid stimuli to elicit a sizable priming magnitude for the G group. These simulations yielded testable predictions about the properties of motion representations in rodent visual cortex at the single-cell and circuitry level, thus paving the way to future neurophysiology experiments.

A continuing challenge in modern medicine is the identification of safer and more efficacious drugs. Precision therapeutics, which have one molecular target, have been long promised to be safer and more effective than traditional therapies. This approach has proven to be challenging for multiple reasons including lack of efficacy, rapidly acquired drug resistance, and narrow patient eligibility criteria. An alternative approach is the development of drugs that address the overall disease network by targeting multiple biological targets (‘polypharmacology’). Rational development of these molecules will require improved methods for predicting single chemical structures that target multiple drug targets. To address this need, we developed the Multi-Targeting Drug DREAM Challenge, in which we challenged participants to predict single chemical entities that target pro-targets but avoid anti-targets for two unrelated diseases: RET-based tumors and a common form of inherited Tauopathy. Here, we report the results of this DREAM Challenge and the development of two neural network-based machine learning approaches that were applied to the challenge of rational polypharmacology. Together, these platforms provide a potentially useful first step towards developing lead therapeutic compounds that address disease complexity through rational polypharmacology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Microplastics and anthropogenic fibre concentrations in lakes reflect surrounding land use</a></h4>

Pollution from microplastics and anthropogenic fibres threatens lakes, but we know little about what factors predict its accumulation. Lakes may be especially contaminated because of long water retention times and proximity to pollution sources. Here, we surveyed anthropogenic microparticles, i.e., microplastics and anthropogenic fibres, in surface waters of 67 European lakes spanning 30° of latitude and large environmental gradients. By collating data from >2,100 published net tows, we found that microparticle concentrations in our field survey were higher than previously reported in lakes and comparable to rivers and oceans. We then related microparticle concentrations in our field survey to surrounding land use, water chemistry, and plastic emissions to sites estimated from local hydrology, population density, and waste production. Microparticle concentrations in European lakes quadrupled as both estimated mismanaged waste inputs and wastewater treatment loads increased in catchments. Concentrations decreased by 2 and 5 times over the range of surrounding forest cover and potential in-lake biodegradation, respectively. As anthropogenic debris continues to pollute the environment, our data will help contextualise future work, and our models can inform control and remediation efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Synthesis of human amyloid restricted to liver results in an Alzheimer disease–like neurodegenerative phenotype</a></h4>

Celliers, Michael Nesbit, Somayra Mamsa, Frank Arfuso, Sukanya Das, Frank Koentgen, Maree Hagan, Lincoln Codd, Kirsty Richardson, Brenton O’Mara, Rainer K.

Several lines of study suggest that peripheral metabolism of amyloid beta (Aß) is associated with risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). In blood, greater than 90% of Aß is complexed as an apolipoprotein, raising the possibility of a lipoprotein-mediated axis for AD risk. In this study, we report that genetic modification of C57BL/6J mice engineered to synthesise human Aß only in liver (hepatocyte-specific human amyloid (HSHA) strain) has marked neurodegeneration concomitant with capillary dysfunction, parenchymal extravasation of lipoprotein-Aß, and neurovascular inflammation. Moreover, the HSHA mice showed impaired performance in the passive avoidance test, suggesting impairment in hippocampal-dependent learning. Transmission electron microscopy shows marked neurovascular disruption in HSHA mice. This study provides causal evidence of a lipoprotein-Aß /capillary axis for onset and progression of a neurodegenerative process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 genome datasets analytics for informed infectious disease surveillance [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged economies, health systems, and lives globally. Concerns surrounding near total economic collapse, loss of livelihood and emotional complications ensuing from lockdowns and commercial inactivity, resulted in governments loosening economic restrictions. These concerns were further exacerbated by the absence of vaccines and drugs to combat the disease, with the fear that the next wave of the pandemic would be more fatal. Consequently, integrating disease surveillance mechanism into public healthcare systems is gaining traction, to reduce the spread of community and cross-border infections and offer informed medical decisions. Methods: Publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases around the globe deposited between December, 2019 and March 15, 2021 were retrieved from GISAID EpiFluTM and processed. Also retrieved from GISAID were data on the different SARS-CoV-2 variant types since inception of the pandemic. Results: Epidemiological analysis offered interesting statistics for understanding the demography of SARS-CoV-2 and helped the elucidation of local and foreign transmission through a history of contact travels. Results of genome pattern visualization and cognitive knowledge mining revealed the emergence of high intra-country viral sub-strains with localized transmission routes traceable to immediate countries, for enhanced contact tracing protocol. Variant surveillance analysis indicates increased need for continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants.  A collaborative Internet of Health Things (IoHT) framework was finally proposed to impact the public health system, for robust and intelligent support for modelling, characterizing, diagnosing and real-time contact tracing of infectious diseases. Conclusions: Localizing healthcare disease surveillance is crucial in emerging disease situations and will support real-time/updated disease case definitions for suspected and probable cases. The IoHT framework proposed in this paper will assist early syndromic assessments of emerging infectious diseases and support healthcare/medical countermeasures as well as useful strategies for making informed policy decisions to drive a cost effective, smart healthcare system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 measures and human rights guaranteed by the Japanese Constitution [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Since March 2020, the Act on Special Measures for Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases Preparedness and Response has been a significant statute in dealing with COVID-19 in Japan. The Act mandates requests, instructions and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, as well as stay-at-home requests. These measures limit freedom of movement and establishment, guaranteed rights under the Japanese Constitution. This article poses the following research question: “Does the Japanese Constitution allow measures against COVID-19 such as requests, instructions and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, and stay-at-home requests?” It also asks: “Are measures with penalties allowed by the Constitution?” given the fact that the penalties were introduced in February 2021. This paper introduces constitutional concepts that guarantee or limit individual freedom. Concepts that guarantee individual freedoms include freedom of establishment and movement. These freedoms derive from the constitutional values of freedom to choose one’s occupation and choose and change one’s residence (Art. 22) and the right to own or hold property (Art. 29). Concepts that limit individual freedom include the right to life (Art. 13), welfare rights and public health (Art. 25), and public welfare (Art. 13). Individual freedom that threatens right to life, welfare rights and public health, and public welfare may not be guaranteed. This paper argues that the Constitution allows the measures against COVID-19 limiting freedom of establishment and movement from the perspectives of the right to life, welfare rights, public health, and public welfare, and the government is responsible for reducing the risk to life from COVID-19. It also argues that the Constitution permits measures with penalties, while proportionality needs to be considered.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Graded remapping of hippocampal ensembles under sensory conflicts</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells are believed to combine sensory cues into a cognitive map of the external environment. Fetterhoff et al. show that when confronted with conflicting sensory information, hippocampal ensembles remap in a continuous manner such that variations of visual landmarks induce graded changes in the neuronal response.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The RNA-binding protein Musashi controls axon compartment-specific synaptic connectivity through ptp69D mRNA poly(A)-tailing</a></h4>

              
                Landínez-Macías et al. show that the RNA-binding protein Musashi differentially controls synaptic connectivity in distinct subcellular compartments of the same CNS axon, either promoting or repressing synapse allocation to specific compartments. Musashi post-transcriptionally stimulates the expression of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptp69D, revealing a mechanism that shapes CNS circuit wiring.

                Lowden et al. show that the histone variant H2A.Z has an essential role in neuronal survival by promoting the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and supporting organelle function. H2A.Z deficiency in Purkinje cells leads to Purkinje cell degeneration and progressive cerebellar ataxia.

                Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that establish diversity in the dopaminergic system. Tolve et al. show that the transcription factor BCL11A defines dopaminergic subpopulations with distinct projection targets and susceptibility to neurodegeneration and is required for the establishment and maintenance of normal function of this subset.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">AIM/CD5L attenuates DAMPs in the injured brain and thereby ameliorates ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Maehara et al. show that AIM (or CD5L) is increased in the infarcted brain and associates with DAMPs. The association decreases DAMPs, and therefore, AIM improves post-stroke prognosis in mice by reducing cerebral inflammation. AIM may be a useful therapy for ischemic stroke targeting DAMP-mediated sterile inflammation.

Lu et al. demonstrate that helped, but not helpless, CD8 T cells maintain effector functions and avoid exhaustion.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Expression of Tim-3 drives phenotypic and functional changes in Treg cells in secondary lymphoid organs and the tumor microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) limit the immune response to tumors, and tumor-infiltrating Treg cells are especially suppressive. However, the mechanisms underlying enhanced Treg cell function are poorly understood. Banerjee et al. show that Tim-3 expression is linked to increased Treg cell suppressive activity, possibly through the cytokine IL-10, in mouse models and people with cancer.
