     alt="Neurological and Cognitive Effects of Hypothyroidism in Patients With Epilepsy: A Study on Anti-Seizure Medicines Therapy"/>
<p>The study's significance lies in its comprehensive analysis of neurological disorders and cognitive pathologies in hypothyroidism and epilepsy patients undergoing anti-seizure medicines therapy. The study findings underscore the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate therapy in managing cognitive and neurological impairments in patients with hypothyroidism and epilepsy. To enhance clinical practice, specific measures that could be implemented include integrating routine cognitive assessments into the standard care of patients with thyroid dysfunction and personalizing treatment protocols based on individual risk factors such as hormone levels, family history, and stress indicators.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to examine neurological disorders and cognitive impairments in patients with secondary hypothyroidism and epilepsy undergoing treatment with antiepileptic medications. The study included 184 patients divided into three groups: Group 1 (subclinical hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 60), Group 2 (manifest hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 64), and Group 3 (control, <i>n</i> = 60). Patients in Group 2 received levothyroxine therapy (initial dose of 25 μg/day, titrated to 50–100 μg/day), while Groups 1 and 2 were treated with anti-seizure medications (valproic acid, 40 mg/kg/day). Neurological symptoms, including Babinski's reflex abnormalities (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 8.15, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and sensory disturbances (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 12.44, <i>p</i> = 0.005), were significantly more frequent in Group 2 than in Group 1. Cognitive test scores were significantly lower in Group 2 compared to Group 3 across all domains (<i>F</i>(2, 181) = 6.55, <i>p</i> = 0.002 for MMSE; <i>F</i>(2, 181) = 4.70, <i>p</i> = 0.010 for FAB; and <i>F</i>(2, 181) = 5.75, <i>p</i> = 0.006 for CDT), with Group 1 showing intermediate results. Regression analysis identified neurodegenerative disease risk (<i>β</i> = 0.34, CI: 0.20–0.48, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), anemia (<i>β</i> = 0.32, CI: 0.15–0.49, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and prolonged stress (<i>β</i> = 0.26, CI: 0.12–0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.002) as significant predictors of cognitive decline, while higher education was protective (<i>β</i> = −0.28, CI: −0.42 to −0.14, <i>p</i> = 0.003). An inverse relationship was observed between TSH levels and cognitive scores (<i>r</i> = −0.55, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural Localization of Glutamate Delta Receptor 1 in the Rodent and Primate Lateral Habenula"/>
<p>In this study, we used immunoelectron microscopic methods combined with tract-tracing approaches to demonstrate that GluD1 is primarily expressed in the core of symmetric synapses formed by GABAergic terminals that originate from the lateral hypothalamus and entopeduncular nucleus in the rodent and primate lateral habenula.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glutamate delta receptor 1 (GluD1) is a unique synaptogenic molecule expressed at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The lateral habenula (LHb), a subcortical structure that regulates negative reward prediction error and major monoaminergic systems, is enriched in GluD1. LHb dysfunction has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, both of which are associated with <i>GRID1</i>, the gene that encodes GluD1. Thus, disruption in GluD1 synaptic signaling may contribute to LHb dysfunction and the pathophysiology of LHb-associated disorders. Despite its strong cellular expression, little is known about the subsynaptic and subcellular localization of GluD1 in LHb neurons. Given that GluD1 is involved in the development and/or regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in various brain regions, a detailed map of GluD1 synaptic localization is essential to elucidate its role in the LHb. To address this issue, we used immunoelectron microscopy methods in rodents and monkeys. In both species, GluD1 immunoreactivity was primarily expressed in dendritic profiles, with lower expression in somata, spines, and glial elements. Pre- and post-embedding immunogold experiments revealed strong GluD1 expression in the core of symmetric GABAergic synapses. Albeit less frequent, GluD1 was also found at the edges (i.e., perisynaptic) of asymmetric, putative glutamatergic synapses. Through the combination of anterograde tracing with immunogold labeling in rats, we showed that axon terminals from the entopeduncular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus express postsynaptic GluD1 immunolabeling in the LHb. Our findings suggest that GluD1 may play a critical role in modulating GABAergic transmission in the rodent and primate LHb.</p>

">Seeking rhythmic patterns in microglial cells within the circadian pineal gland from male rats</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, constitute a highly dynamic cell population that displays several functions influenced by the light:dark (L:D) cycle. Within the pineal gland (PG), a key organ of the circadian timing system, microglia actively participate in its development and homeostasis. However, little is known about their rhythmic features in this circadian organ. This study aimed to elucidate morphological and functional phenotypes of pineal microglial cells at two time points of the L:D cycle. We performed immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy on paraffin-embedded pineal sections from 3- and 18-month-old Wistar rats, analyzing samples collected at midday (ZT6) and midnight (ZT18). Our results showed that the density and spatial distribution of IBA1+ microglial cells did not vary between ZT6 and ZT18 in the 3-month-old PG. However, these cells exhibited reduced size and amoeboid-like shapes, along with a reduction in the expression of the phagocytosis inhibitor SIRP alpha, at ZT18 compared to ZT6. Moreover, IBA1+ cells were immunoreactive for the lysosomal marker CD68 and the autophagic marker LC3B at both ZTs. Additionally, contacts with PAX6+ cells were detected in the two ZTs analyzed. Interestingly, IBA1+ cells showed attenuated or abolished rhythmicity in morphological parameters and SIRP alpha expression levels in the 18-month-old PG. Our findings suggest that microglia undergo transitions into alerted states at night, characterized by small, rounded shapes and enhanced phagocytic capacity. This adaptation likely prepares them to respond to potential invading agents and other insults in the PG, which could impact the nocturnal melatonin production.

">Respiration facilitates behaviour during multisensory integration</a></h4>

              
                The brain processes information from the external environment alongside signals generated by the body. Among bodily rhythms, respiration emerges as a key modulator of sensory processing. Multisensory integration, the non-linear combination of information from multiple senses to reduce environmental uncertainty, may be influenced by respiratory dynamics. This study investigated how respiration modulates reaction times and multisensory integration in a simple detection task. Forty healthy participants were presented with unimodal (Auditory, Visual, Tactile) and bimodal (Audio-Tactile, Audio-Visual, Visuo-Tactile) stimuli while their respiratory activity was recorded. Results revealed that reaction times systematically varied with respiration, with faster responses during peak inspiration and early expiration but slower responses during the expiration-to-inspiration transition. Applying the race model inequality approach to quantify multisensory integration, we found that Audio-Tactile and Audio-Visual stimuli exhibited the highest integration during the expiration-to-inspiration phase. These findings conceivably reflect respiration phase-locked changes in cortical excitability which in turn, orchestrates multisensory integration. Interestingly, participants also tended to adapt their respiratory cycles, aligning response onsets preferentially with early expiration. This suggests that, rather than a mere bottom-up mechanism, respiration is actively adjusted to maximise the signal-to-noise balance between interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.

">Non-mutated human tau stimulates Alzheimer's disease-relevant neurodegeneration in a microglia-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                The accumulation of abnormal, non-mutated tau protein is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite its strong association with disease progression, the mechanisms by which tau drives neurodegeneration in the brain remain poorly understood. Here, we selectively expressed non-mutated or mutated human microtubule-associated protein tau (hMAPT) in neurons across the brain and observed neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, especially associated with non-mutated human tau. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing confirmed a selective loss of hippocampal excitatory neurons by the wild-type tau and revealed the upregulation of neurodegeneration-related pathways in the affected populations. The accumulation of phosphorylated tau was accompanied by cellular stress in neurons and reactive gliosis in multiple brain regions. Notably, the lifelong absence of microglia significantly and differentially influenced the extent of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and thalamus. Therefore, our study established an AD-relevant tauopathy mouse model, elucidated both neuron-intrinsic and neuron-extrinsic responses, and highlighted critical and complex roles of microglia in modulating tau-driven neurodegeneration.

">The Neurocognitive efficiency score: Derivation, validation, and application of a novel combination of concurrent electrophysiological and behavioral data</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual and cognitive work require the expenditure of brain energy, and the efficiency of that energy expenditure can vary as a function of a range of exogenous and endogenous factors. The same is true for physical work, and tools have been developed to quantify energetic efficiency in the performance of physical work. The same is not true for the study of perceptual and cognitive work. We here draw on two lines of research---the formal characterization of workload capacity in perception and cognition, and the study of physical work---to propose a novel measure of neurocognitive efficiency. This neurocognitive efficiency score (NES) combines reaction time data with measures on concurrently acquired electroencephalographic (EEG) data to form a ratio that can be interpreted in terms of work accomplished relative to energy. We consider three measures on the EEG and show that one of them---global field power (GFP)---evidences a strong relationship to measures of metabolic energy expended. We then show how the NES can provide insights into differences in perceptual performance as a function of biological state. We argue that the NES has the potential for a wide range of applications in the study of perception and cognition in the context of factors including (but not limited to) aging, disease, stress, and differences in levels of expertise.

">Enhancer Dynamics and Spatial Organization Drive Anatomically Restricted Cellular States in the Human Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                Here, we report the spatial organization of RNA transcription and associated enhancer dynamics in the human spinal cord at single-cell and single-molecule resolution. We expand traditional multiomic measurements to reveal epigenetically poised and bivalent active transcriptional enhancer states that define cell type specification. Simultaneous detection of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications in spinal cord nuclei reveals previously unobserved cell-type specific cryptic enhancer activity, in which transcriptional activation is uncoupled from chromatin accessibility. Such cryptic enhancers define both stable cell type identity and transitions between cells undergoing differentiation. We also define glial cell gene regulatory networks that reorganize along the rostrocaudal axis, revealing anatomical differences in gene regulation. Finally, we identify the spatial organization of cells into distinct cellular organizations and address the functional significance of this observation in the context of paracrine signaling. We conclude that cellular diversity is best captured through the lens of enhancer state and intercellular interactions that drive transitions in cellular state. This study provides fundamental insights into the cellular organization of the healthy human spinal cord.

">Intracellular tension relaxation engineered through D-enantiomeric hydrogel maneuvers neurogenesis and immunomodulation to facilitate spinal cord repair</a></h4>

              
                Microenvironment mechanics plays a vital role in regulating morphogenesis and immune response after injury, but their exploration has been hindered by the fragile mechanical strength and oxidative physiological environment in spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we engineered self-assembly hydrogels of enantiomeric peptides with neural tissue-matching mechanical properties to persistently manipulate cellular membrane tension and mechanotransduction through stereo conformational recognition and consequent protein affinity difference. The D-enantiomeric hydrogel-induced intracellular tension relaxation activates neurogenesis and ECM remolding in astrocytes, suppresses pro-inflammation and promotes pro-regeneration in microglia, which significantly facilitates neuroprotection and functional recovery in a rat severe SCI model. The intracellular tension relaxation-induced morphogenesis may be neural characteristics, contrary to non-neural cells, as the downstream mechanical signaling is activated by the resulted neurogenic morphology change. Overall, inducing intracellular tension relaxation is a potential effective strategy for promoting nerve regeneration.

">Subthalamic Signature of Freezing of Gait in Parkinson Disease</a></h4>

              
                Freezing of gait (FOG) is a significant disability in Parkinson disease (PD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) only partially alleviates it, with approximately one-third of patients experiencing worsening FOG within a year after surgery. The precise role of STN dysfunction in gait disabilities and FOG remains not fully elucidated. To investigate this, we recorded gait and STN local field potential (LFP) activity in 38 PD patients, both Off and On dopamine medication. Our analysis focused on the relationship between gait performance and STN neuronal activity, particularly examining differences in LFP activity across the posterior-sensorimotor and central-associative regions of the STN. When Off dopamine medication, 12 patients experienced FOG during recordings, with a total of 263 FOG episodes documented. Even in trials without FOG episodes, these patients exhibited altered gait initiation strategies, prioritizing stepping rhythm to manage balance and initiate walking. In contrast, non-FOG patients maintained a higher walking pace. STN activity patterns revealed key differences. In FOG patients, weaker STN alpha/low beta band activity in the STN was associated with walking pace, while stronger decreased low beta band activity correlated with rhythm and balance control. This low beta band association extended from the posterior-sensorimotor to the central-associative STN. In contrast, non-FOG patients showed a more restricted relationship between low beta band activity and gait performance, confined to the posterior STN. As stepping rhythm deteriorated further in FOG patients, FOG episodes occurred. FOG episodes were preceeded by a significant positive relationship between high beta power and rhythm restricted to the posterior STN, with a reverse negative relationship with pace, and a disruption in low beta desynchronization across both posterior and central STN regions. Dopamine medication significantly improved gait patterns, and partially restored STN neuronal activity, reducing differences between FOG and non-FOG patients. These findings differentiate two FOG states, i.e. predisposition and occurrence, each associated with distinct gait initiation strategies and STN activity patterns. They suggest distinct pathophysiological roles of low and high beta band STN activity within specific STN regions in regulating gait and FOG. These findings provide key insights for refining targeted DBS therapies.

">CHOLINERGIC MODULATION OF CELLULAR RESONANCE IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATE HIPPOCAMPUS</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine modulates the network physiology of the hippocampus, a crucial brain structure that supports cognition and memory formation in mammals (1-3). In this and adjacent regions, synchronized neuronal activity within theta-band oscillations (4-10Hz) is correlated with attentive processing that leads to successful memory encoding (4-10). Acetylcholine facilitates the hippocampus entering a theta oscillatory regime and modulates the temporal organization of activity within theta oscillations (11,12). Unlike rodents that exhibit constant theta oscillations during movement and exploration, primates only manifest theta oscillations in transient bouts during periods of acute attention, despite conserved hippocampal anatomy (13-16). The phasic nature of primate theta oscillations and their susceptibility to muscarinic antagonists (17), suggest that acetylcholine afferents acutely modulate local circuitry, resulting in a temporary shift in hippocampal rhythmic dynamics. However, we lack a mechanistic understanding that links cellular physiology to emergent theta-rhythmic network dynamics. We explored the hypothesis that acetylcholine induces a distinct modulation of cellular properties to facilitate synchronization within the theta band in non-human primate neurons. Here we show that non-human primate neurons from the CA1 region of monkey hippocampus are not homogeneous in their voltage response to inputs of varying frequencies, a phenomenon known as cellular resonance (18-19). We classified these neurons as resonant or non-resonant. Under the influence of carbachol, these two classes of neurons become indistinguishable in their resonance, suggesting that acetylcholine transiently creates a homogeneous susceptibility to inputs within the theta range. This change is mediated by metabotropic acetylcholine receptors that enhance sag potentials, indicating that acetylcholine acts on principal neurons to modulate Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated channels. Our results reveal a mechanism through which acetylcholine can rapidly modulate intrinsic properties of primate hippocampal neurons to facilitate synchronization within theta-rhythmic circuits, providing insight into the unique features of primate hippocampal physiology.

">Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps</a></h4>

              
                Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial 'feature dimension maps', which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing neural feature dimension maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex using a spatial inverted encoding model. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location which always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus, or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed priority maps were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended, and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended, and this effect was primarily observed at the stimulus location. While enhancement was localized to the stimulus in color-selective regions, motion-selective regions were globally enhanced when motion was task relevant. These results suggest different cortical regions support spatial maps of different visual features, and that each map is uniquely reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior towards the most relevant locations based on important features.

">Quantifying Differences in Neural Population Activity With Shape Metrics</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying differences across species and individuals is fundamental to many fields of biology. However, it remains challenging to draw detailed functional comparisons between large populations of interacting neurons. Here, we introduce a general framework for comparing neural population activity in terms of shape distances. This approach defines similarity in terms of explicit geometric transformations, which can be flexibly specified to obtain different measures of population-level neural similarity. Moreover, differences between systems are defined by a distance that is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality, enabling downstream analyses such as clustering and nearest-neighbor regression. We demonstrate this approach on datasets spanning multiple behavioral tasks (navigation, passive viewing of images, and decision making) and species (mice and non-human primates), highlighting its potential to measure functional variability across subjects and brain regions, as well as its ability to relate neural geometry to animal behavior.

">Layer 1 NDNF interneurons form distinct subpopulations with opposite activation patterns during sleep in freely behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep facilitates memory consolidation by transferring information from the hippocampus to the neocortex. Recent evidence suggests that this transfer occurs primarily when hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) and thalamocortical spindles are synchronized. In this study, we asked what role cortical layer 1 NDNF-expressing (L1 NDNF) interneurons play during NREM sleep in gating information transfer during SWR-spindle synchronization. Using simultaneous cell-specific calcium imaging and local field potential recordings in freely moving mice, we discovered that L1 NDNF neurons form cell assemblies tuned to specific sleep stages, exhibiting differential responses to spindle synchronization. L1 NDNF neurons mediate slow inhibition through GABAB receptors. Systemic application of a GABAB receptor antagonist increased pyramidal neuron excitability during NREM sleep, enhanced inhibitory responses during SWRs, and disrupted SWR-spindle coupling. Overall, these findings suggest an important contribution of L1 NDNF neuron-mediated slow inhibition to the synchronization of sleep oscillations with potential implications for memory consolidation processes.

">Perceived risk of forward versus backward balance disturbances while walking in young and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Falls, which often result from trips or slips, pose a major health concern, particularly among older adults. Experiencing falls or near-falls from balance disturbances can shape subsequent gait-related decisions, as individuals may avoid situations they perceive as risky. Here, we explore whether perceptions of risk are sensitive to the direction of previously experienced balance disturbances - forward or backward - and whether these perceptions change with age. Twenty young and twenty older adults walked on a split-belt treadmill while performing a two-alternative forced-choice task, where they indicated their preference between a forward-falling trip and a backward-falling slip. We varied the perturbation magnitudes using an adaptive staircase algorithm to obtain multiple trip-slip equivalence points. Using a mixed-effects linear model, we estimated the slope of the trip-slip relationship, which quantified the direction and strength of the sensitivity of perceived risk to perturbation type. To assess reliability, we repeated the procedure on a second day. Additionally, we investigated two potential reasons underlying any observed sensitivity - 1) emotional responses measured by state anxiety, and 2) physical responses measured by peak center of mass velocity. We found that both young and older adults perceived slips to be riskier than trips, with no group difference in sensitivity. The relative sensitivity to slips versus trips was moderately reliable across two days of testing, though most participants were less sensitive to perturbation direction on the second day. Neither state anxiety responses nor peak center of mass (CoM) velocity explained the directional sensitivity, though CoM velocity was higher during slips than trips for both age groups. These results suggest that the characteristics of experienced balance disturbances may influence behavioral decisions. Objectively measuring individual differences in the perceived risk of balance disturbances and the ability to recover from these disturbances, can potentially improve fall risk assessment and inform personalized training interventions.

">Whole-body coarticulation reflects expertise in sport climbing</a></h4>

              
                Taking sport climbing as a testbed, we explored coarticulation in naturalistic motor-behavior at the level of whole-body kinematics. Participants were instructed to execute a series of climbing routes, each composed of two initial foot-moves equal in all routes, and two subsequent hand-moves differing across routes in a set of eight possible configurations. The goal was assessing whether climbers modulate the execution of a given move depending on which moves come next in the plan. Coarticulation was assessed by training a set of classifiers and estimating how well the whole-body (or single-joint) kinematics during a given stage of the climbing execution could predict its future unfolding. Results showed that most participants engage in coarticulation, with temporal and bodily patterns that depend on expertise. Non-climbers tend to prepare the next-to-come move right before its onset and only after the end of the previous move. Rather, expert-climbers (and to a smaller extent, beginner-climbers) show early coarticulation during the execution of the previous move and engage in adjustments that involve the coordination of a larger number of joints across the body. These results demonstrate coarticulation effects in whole-body naturalistic motor behavior and as a function of expertise. Furthermore, the enhanced coarticulation found in expert-climbers provides hints for experts engaging in more refined mental processes converting abstract instructions (e.g., move the right hand to a given location) into motor simulations involving whole-body coordination. Overall, these results contribute to advancing our current knowledge of the rich interplay between cognition and motor control.

They modulate their forward speed and momentum ahead of upcoming steps, perhaps to optimize energy expenditure as they prefer to do for level ground. But actual optimization is a complex, deliberative process and seems not to describe how human act in real time during continuous walking. Here we show that human uneven walking strategies are predicted well by an control scheme that requires no deliberation yet is nearly optimal. The experimentally measured speed trajectory for a single upward step (a kernel) predicts the strategy for a complex terrain sequence, by repeatedly delaying and weighting (convolving) it for each step height. Conversely, the same strategy can be deconvolved to predict for six other terrains about as well as deliberative energy minimization Composability is predicted by a simple model of walking, which requires work to redirect the body center of mass velocity between pendulum-like steps. These dynamics obey linear superposition, so that a simple kernel, learnable through experience, is sufficient to compose other strategies with lookahead information about upcoming step heights. Walking dynamics may allow humans to act quickly and nearly optimally without thinking slowly.

">Homeostatic regulation of a motor circuit through temperature sensing rather than activity sensing</a></h4>

              
                Homeostasis is a driving principle in physiology. To achieve homeostatic control of neural activity, neurons monitor their activity levels and then initiate corrective adjustments in excitability when activity strays from a set point. However, fluctuations in the brain microenvironment, such as temperature, pH, and other ions represent some of the most common perturbations to neural function in animals. Therefore, it is unclear if activity sensing is a universal strategy for different types of perturbations or if stability may arise by sensing specific environmental cues. Here we show the respiratory network of amphibians mounts a fast homeostatic response to restore motor function following inactivity caused by cooling over the physiological range. This response was not initiated by inactivity, but rather, by temperature. Compensation involved cold-activation of the noradrenergic system via mechanisms that involve inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase, causing {beta}-adrenoceptor signaling that enhanced network excitability. Thus, acute cooling initiates a modulatory response that opposes inactivity and enhances network excitability. As the nervous system of all animals is subjected to changes in the microenvironment, some circuits may have selected regulatory systems tuned to environmental variables in place of, or in addition to, activity-dependent control mechanisms.

">Attentional enhancement and suppression of stimulus-synchronized BOLD oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Visual cortical neurons synchronize their firing rates to periodic visual stimuli. EEG is commonly used to study directed attention by frequency-tagging brain responses to multiple stimuli oscillating at different frequencies, but is limited by its coarse spatial resolution. Here we leverage frequency-tagging fMRI (ft-fMRI) to study the influence of directed attention on the fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics of competing stimulus-driven visual cortical oscillations. Our analysis reveals that distinct populations of visual cortical neurons exhibit in-phase (enhancing) or antiphase (suppressive) synchronization with the oscillating stimuli. Directed attention homogeneously increases the amplitude of anti-phase BOLD oscillations across the visual hierarchy, consistent with a distributed suppressive field. In contrast, attentional modulation of in phase BOLD oscillations increases hierarchically from V1 to hV4. The strength of anti-phase, but not in-phase, modulation predicted psychophysical correlates of attentional performance. Our results strongly corroborate the biased competition model of attention and unveil a novel BOLD correlate of attentional suppression.

">Decoding Gene Networks Controlling Hypothalamic and Prethalamic Neuron Development.</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal subtypes derived from the embryonic hypothalamus and prethalamus regulate many essential physiological processes, yet the gene regulatory networks controlling their development remain poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA- and ATAC-sequencing, we analyzed mouse hypothalamic and prethalamic development from embryonic day 11 to postnatal day 8, profiling 660,000 cells in total. This identified key transcriptional and chromatin dynamics driving regionalization, neurogenesis, and differentiation. This identified multiple distinct neural progenitor populations, as well as gene regulatory networks that control their spatial and temporal identities, and their terminal differentiation into major neuronal subtypes. Integrating these results with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we identified a central role for transcription factors controlling supramammillary hypothalamic development in a broad range of metabolic and cognitive traits. Recurring cross-repressive regulatory relationships were observed between transcription factors that induced prethalamic and tuberal hypothalamic identity on the one hand and mammillary and supramammillary hypothalamic identity on the other. In postnatal animals, Dlx1/2 was found to severely disrupt GABAergic neuron specification in both the hypothalamus and prethalamus, resulting in a loss of inhibition of thalamic neurons, hypersensitivity to cold, and behavioral hyperactivity. By identifying core gene regulatory networks controlling the specification and differentiation of major hypothalamic and prethalamic neuronal cell types, this study provides a roadmap for future efforts aimed at preventing and treating a broad range of homeostatic and cognitive disorders.

">Astroglial deficiency for oligophrenin-1 contributes to intellectual disability</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders, including X-linked intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia, can result from the mutation of oligophrenin-1 (Ophn1), encoding a Rho-GTPase-activating protein. Ophn1 regulates synaptic development and function, in part via cytoskeleton reorganization, and is expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. Despite the crucial role of astrocytes in synapse function, altered in neurodevelopmental disorders, and their Ophn1 expression, the specific impact of astroglial Ophn1 deficiency on synaptic transmission and behavior remains unknown. Here, we show that Ophn1 deficiency postnatally in hippocampal astrocytes impairs synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity and spatial working memory in adults. This involves an adenosine A1 receptor-dependent presynaptic mechanism associated with astroglial morphological rearrangements resulting in increased astroglial synapse coverage. The structural, functional and behavioral alterations induced by astroglial Ophn1 deficiency are rescued in adults by pharmacological inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway. Our findings uncover an important role for astroglial Ophn1 deficiency in synaptic and behavioral dysfunctions, pointing to a novel cellular therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Collateral connectomes of Esr1-positive hypothalamic neurons modulate defensive behavior plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) projects to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN), mediating freezing and escape behaviors, respectively. We investigated VMH collateral (VMH-coll) neurons, which innervate both PAG and AHN, to elucidate their role in postsynaptic processing and defensive behavior plasticity. Using all-optical voltage imaging of 22,151 postsynaptic neurons ex vivo, we found that VMH-coll neurons engage inhibitory mechanisms at both synaptic ends and can induce synaptic circuit plasticity. In vivo optogenetic activation of the VMH-coll somas induced escape behaviors. We identified an Esr1-expressing VMH-coll subpopulation with postsynaptic connectome resembling that of wild-type collaterals on the PAG side. Activation of Esr1+VMH-coll neurons evoked freezing and unexpected flattening behavior, previously not linked to the VMH. Neuropeptides such as PACAP and dynorphin modulated both Esr1+VMH-coll connectomes. In vivo kappa-opioid receptor antagonism impaired Esr1+VMH-coll-mediated defensive behaviors. These findings unveiled the central role of VMH-coll pathways in innate defensive behavior plasticity.

">Association between theta-band resting-state functional connectivity and declarative memory abilities in children</a></h4>

              
                Declarative memory formation critically relies on the synchronization of brain oscillations in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency band within specific brain networks. The development of this capacity is closely linked to the functional organization of these networks already at rest. However, the relationship between theta-band resting-state functional connectivity and declarative memory abilities remains unexplored in children. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we examined the association between declarative memory performance and pre-learning resting-state functional connectivity across frequency bands in 32 school-aged children. Declarative memory was assessed as the percentage of correct retrieval of 50 new associations between non-objects and magical functions, while resting-state functional connectivity was measured through power envelope correlation of the theta, alpha, low and high beta frequency bands. We found that stronger theta-band resting-state functional connectivity within occipito-temporo-frontal networks correlated with better declarative memory retrieval, while no correlation was observed in the alpha and beta frequency bands. These findings suggest that the functional brain architecture at rest, specifically involving theta-band oscillations, supports declarative memory in children. This mechanism may facilitate the subsequent rapid transformation of sensory input into visuo-semantic representations, highlighting the critical role of theta-band connectivity in early cognitive development.

">High-field fMRI at 7 Tesla reveals topographic responses tuned to number in the developing human brain</a></h4>

              
                In the adult brain, hemodynamic responses to visually presented numerosities reveal receptive field-like tuning curves in topographically organized maps across association cortices. It is currently unknown whether such tuned topographic responses to numerosities can also be detected in the developing brain. Here we conducted a 7 Tesla fMRI experiment in which we presented a large set of visual dot displays to 11-12-year-old children and adults. We found that developing hemodynamic responses indeed revealed logarithmic Gaussian tuning to quantitative information. Tuning models explained comparable amounts of variance in children and adults. In most subjects, six bilateral cortical maps consistently exhibited topographic responses to numerosities. The present study goes beyond previous work by uncovering a population code for quantity detection in individual developing human brains. Our work lays a foundation for a model-based neuroimaging approach to individual cognitive differences in the context of developmental dyscalculia and mathematical giftedness.

	<p>Background: Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is the most dreaded complication after reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to estimate and compare risks of sICH after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) depending on the location of the large vessel occlusion, concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis, timing of treatment, and core size. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were included, following a comprehensive search of different databases from inception to 1 March 2024. Random-effect models in a meta-analysis were employed to obtain the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sICH with MT, and were then compared to other reperfusion treatment regimens, including best medical treatment and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Results: MT in the anterior circulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of sICH as compared with no-MT (RR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.03&amp;amp;ndash;2.07; p = 0.037). The risk of sICH was comparable between the MT and MT+IVT groups (RR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.57&amp;amp;ndash;1.03; p = 0.079). There was no difference in sICH risk with MT as compared with no-MT within 6 h of last known well (RR: 1.14; 95%CI: 0.78&amp;amp;ndash;1.66; p = 0.485) and beyond that time (RR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.80&amp;amp;ndash;2.08; p = 0.252); the risk of sICH was also comparable between MT conducted within 6 h of last known well and MT conducted beyond that time (p = 0.512). The sICH risk for MT in the posterior circulation (RR: 7.48; 95%CI: 2.27&amp;amp;ndash;24.61) was significantly higher than for MT in the anterior circulation (RR: 1.18; 95%CI: 0.90&amp;amp;ndash;1.56) (p = 0.003). MT was also associated with a significantly higher sICH risk than no-MT among patients with large core strokes (RR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;2.66, p = 0.018). Conclusions: When evaluating cumulative evidence from randomized controlled trials, the risk of sICH is increased after MT compared with patients not treated with MT. Yet, the difference is largely driven by the greater risk of sICH in patients treated with MT for posterior circulation occlusions and, to a lesser degree, large core strokes. Concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis and the use of MT in the extended therapeutic window do not raise the risk of sICH.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have shown that multiple post-traumatic irradiations of the cochlea with near-infrared light (NIR) can significantly reduce noise-induced hearing loss. However, a single NIR pre-treatment was shown to have the same effect. Extending the pre-treatment time did not result in any further reduction in hearing loss. The present study investigated whether a combined NIR pre- and post-treatment had an increased effect on hearing preservation. Methods: Frequency-specific auditory brainstem potential thresholds (ABR) were determined in young adult mice. One group (n = 8) underwent NIR irradiation (808 nm, 120 mW, 15 min) of the cochlea, followed by a 30 min noise exposure (5&amp;amp;ndash;20 kHz, 115 dB SPL). A post-NIR treatment was administered for 30 min immediately following the noise trauma. After 14 days, hearing loss was determined by ABR measurements. The results were compared with a trauma-only group (n = 8) and an untreated control group (n = 5). Subsequently, the spiral ganglion neuron density was investigated. Results: A peri-traumatic NIR treatment resulted in a significantly lower hearing loss compared to the trauma-only group. Hearing protection in these animals significantly exceeded the effect of an exclusive pre- or post-treatment across all frequencies. A loss of spiral ganglion neurons in the trauma-only group was observed, which was significantly rescued by the peri-traumatic NIR treatment. Conclusions: A single peri-traumatic NIR treatment seems to be the more effective approach for the preservation of hearing thresholds after noise trauma compared to an isolated pre- or post-treatment. One target of the protective effect seems to be the spiral ganglion.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by cardinal motor features and a multitude of non-motor manifestations. Among them, cognitive impairment in PD has been recognised as a defined clinical entity, and it might lead to an increased risk of developing dementia. Consequently, the present review aimed to ascertain the available interventions for the training of cognitive abilities in persons with PD (PwPD). Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to select studies in the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers conducted the different phases of the review, and a third expert was called in to address any doubts/conflicts. Randomised controlled trials and randomised clinical trials concerning cognitive training with cognitive outcomes in PwPD were selected. Results: A total of 28 articles were included. The considered studies applied various experimental interventions for the training of cognitive functions in PwPD: computer-based platforms, exergames, paper-and-pencil programmes, dual-task or treadmill training with action observation therapy, motor imagery, and virtual reality components, interventions targeting precise cognitive domain, tele-rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation, structured cognitive training, and multimodal treatments. Cognitive functions were assessed employing neuropsychological tests, self-report questionnaires, and computerised batteries. Conclusions: Overall, the review reported better performances in the experimental groups compared to the control groups, in several cognitive domains. Structured cognitive training emerged as the most effective strategy to enhance cognitive functioning in PwPD. However, further studies are necessary to determine the most appropriate and useful training and to develop interventions that also consider patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life.</p>

	<p>Objective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data pose significant challenges due to their inherently noisy and complex nature, making traditional statistical models less effective in capturing predictive features. While deep learning models offer superior performance through their non-linear capabilities, they often lack transparency, reducing trust in their predictions. This study introduces the Time Reversal (TR) pretraining method to address these challenges. TR aims to learn temporal dependencies in data, leveraging large datasets for pretraining and applying this knowledge to improve schizophrenia classification on smaller datasets. Methods: We pretrained an LSTM-based model with attention using the TR approach, focusing on learning the direction of time in fMRI data, achieving over 98 % accuracy on HCP and UK Biobank datasets. For downstream schizophrenia classification, TR-pretrained weights were transferred to models evaluated on FBIRN, COBRE, and B-SNIP datasets. Saliency maps were generated using Integrated Gradients (IG) to provide post hoc explanations for pretraining, while Earth Mover&amp;amp;rsquo;s Distance (EMD) quantified the temporal dynamics of salient features in the downstream tasks. Results: TR pretraining significantly improved schizophrenia classification performance across all datasets: median AUC scores increased from 0.7958 to 0.8359 (FBIRN), 0.6825 to 0.7778 (COBRE), and 0.6341 to 0.7224 (B-SNIP). The saliency maps revealed more concentrated and biologically meaningful salient features along the time axis, aligning with the episodic nature of schizophrenia. TR consistently outperformed baseline pretraining methods, including OCP and PCL, in terms of AUC, balanced accuracy, and robustness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the dual benefits of the TR method: enhanced predictive performance and improved interpretability. By aligning model predictions with meaningful temporal patterns in brain activity, TR bridges the gap between deep learning and clinical relevance. These findings emphasize the potential of explainable AI tools for aiding clinicians in diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in conditions characterized by disrupted temporal dynamics.</p>

                <p>It is widely believed that axons in the central nervous system of adult mammals do not regrow following injury. This failure is thought, at least in part, to underlie the limited recovery of function following injury to the brain or spinal cord. Some studies of fixed tissue have suggested that, counter to dogma, norepinephrine (NE) axons regrow following brain injury. Here, we have used in vivo two-photon microscopy in layer 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex in transgenic mice harboring a fluorophore selectively expressed in NE neurons. This protocol allowed us to explore the dynamic nature of NE axons following injury with the selective NE axon toxin <I>N</I>-(2-chloroethyl)-<I>N</I>-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4). Following DSP4, NE axons were massively depleted and then slowly and partially recovered their density over a period of weeks. This regrowth was dominated by new axons entering the imaged volume. There was almost no contribution from local sprouting from spared NE axons. Regrown axons did not appear to use either the paths of previously lesioned NE axons or NE axons that were spared and survived DSP4 as a guide. To measure NE release, GCaMP8s was selectively expressed in neocortical astrocytes and startle-evoked, NE receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were measured. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were abolished soon after DSP4 lesion but returned to pre-lesion values after 3&ndash;5&nbsp;weeks, roughly coincident with NE axon regrowth, suggesting that the regrown NE axons are competent to release NE in response to a physiological stimulus in the awake mouse.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0419-24.2024?rss=1">Interaction between Facial Expression and Color in Modulating ERP P3</a></h4>

              
                <p>The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence selective attention and brain activity contributed to selective attention remains unclear. For example, reddish angry faces increase emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether brain activity and selective attention are similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, facial expression or facial color had no significant main effect or interaction effect on P1 amplitudes for the target, and facial expression had significant main effects only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the interaction between facial expression and color modulates the P3 associated with selective attention. Moreover, the response enhancement resulting from this interaction appears to occur at a cognitive processing stage that follows the processing stage associated with facial color or expression alone. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.</p>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                The splenic localization of hydatid cysts is extremely rare. A 50-year-old obese female who consults with a painful and febrile syndrome of the right hypochondrium. Abdominal ultrasound and a CT scan computed tomography revealed a complete situs inversus, a mass of the right hypochondrium measuring 152 mm with membrane detachment, and infiltration of the surrounding fat, evoking a type II complicated splenic hydatic cyst. The patient was operated on in an emergency via midline laparotomy. Exploration revealed situs inversus, an angiant cyst of the spleen. Exposition of the splenic pedicle is difficult. The samples were then infected. Total splenectomy was performed. The postoperative period was unproblematic, and the patient was discharged with antibiotic and antiparasitic treatment and habitual vaccination.

                Introduction Recent advances in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and improvements in clinical trial design have reinvigorated the potential for agents developed in preclinical studies to be translated into new therapeutic agents, as well as highlighting the need for improved and effective means of measuring neuropathy in preclinical and clinical research. A systematic review of the literature on the methods of measuring the severity of DPN and the association of the results of each method with diabetic retinopathy would contribute positively to the above developments. Methods The intended scoping review will be aligned, in combination, with the frameworks proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and the framework proposed by Peters et al. in 2015. The PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases will be searched, as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. The search strategy will include the following sequence of Boolean terms and operators: (“retinopathy” OR “eye disease” OR “eye disease” OR “maculopathy” OR “retinal” OR “macular”) AND “neuropathy” and for the title/abstract or abstract only “severity” AND (“diabetes” OR “diabetic”). The yielded publications will be screened according to criteria. This will be followed by data extraction, synthesis and presentation of results, discussion and conclusions. Discussion The different ways of measuring the severity of peripheral neuropathy identified in the previous literature will be discussed, as well as the association of neuropathy and/or its severity with retinopathy in patients with diabetes. The main aim of the discussion will be to elucidate the role of different methods of measuring the severity of DPN and its association with retinopathy. Registration The protocol has been registered on the international platform of registered systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (INPLASY).

                Abstract* Background This study investigates how perceived work alienation influences whistleblowing intention, with religious political orientation as a mediator and social value orientation as a moderator. Previous research has shown work alienation negatively correlates with prosocial behavior and activism while positively correlating with knowledge hiding. The study proposes that work alienation negatively predicts whistleblowing intention, with both religious political orientation and social value orientation playing influential roles in this relationship. Methods Predictive correlational design with a mediation and moderation analysis was used in this study. The participants of this study were 263 Indonesians (131 males, 132 females; M age = 25.91 years old; SD age = 5.47 years). Results The findings confirm that higher work alienation leads to lower whistleblowing intention. While religious political orientation did not significantly mediate the relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention as hypothesized, the study revealed that prosocial-type social value orientation weakens the negative relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention. The individualistic type showed no significant moderating effect. Conclusion The research demonstrates that work alienation significantly predicts whistleblowing intention, with prosocial social value orientation serving as a buffer against the negative effects of work alienation on whistleblowing intention. These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological factors influencing whistleblowing behavior in corruption prevention and eradication efforts.

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers especially in the Indian population considering its varied ethnicity and lifestyle practices. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers therefore demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health in the Indian population. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing and validating IPC educational modules tailored to diabetic foot care. It can aid in enhancing adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices. By promoting collaborative care approaches, these educational resources can contribute to better preventive practices, potentially reducing the risk of complications like foot ulcers and amputations in individuals with diabetes.

                Background The deductive system of BCL-algebra has not been thoroughly explored, and its fuzzification remains undefined. This study aims to the association of this gap by introducing a fuzzy extension of the deductive system of BCL-algebra using Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Methods We define a Pythagorean fuzzy set as a pair of membership and non-membership functions, where the sum of their squares lies between 0 and 1. These functions are used to extend the classical deductive system of BCL-algebra, allowing for reasoning based on fuzzy degrees. The system incorporates fuzzy operations such as union, intersection, and complement, while maintaining the structure of BCL-algebra. We also introduce key components such as the accuracy function, score function, degree of indeterminacy, and square deviation to measure the certainty, truth, uncertainty, and deviation of fuzzy sets. Results We prove that the intersection of two Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems remains a valid Pythagorean fuzzy deductive system within BCL-algebra. However, we show that the union of such systems does not necessarily form a valid fuzzy deductive system. The study also provides detailed proofs using induction, logical derivations, and algebraic techniques. Conclusion The results disclose that while the intersection of Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems preserves the system's structure, the union does not, offering new insights into the behavior and limitations of fuzzy systems in BCL-algebra.

                Introduction Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. Methods In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2methods: manuel on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(≥10). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. Results 25patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods(p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age(>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. Conclusion TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.

                <p>by Ahmed Daoud, Asa Ben-Hur</p>

Complex deep learning models trained on very large datasets have become key enabling tools for current research in natural language processing and computer vision. By providing pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific applications, they enable researchers to create accurate models with minimal effort and computational resources. Large scale genomics deep learning models come in two flavors: the first are large language models of DNA sequences trained in a self-supervised fashion, similar to the corresponding natural language models; the second are supervised learning models that leverage large scale genomics datasets from ENCODE and other sources. We argue that these models are the equivalent of foundation models in natural language processing in their utility, as they encode within them chromatin state in its different aspects, providing useful representations that allow quick deployment of accurate models of gene regulation. We demonstrate this premise by leveraging the recently created Sei model to develop simple, interpretable models of intron retention, and demonstrate their advantage over models based on the DNA language model DNABERT-2. Our work also demonstrates the impact of chromatin state on the regulation of intron retention. Using representations learned by Sei, our model is able to discover the involvement of transcription factors and chromatin marks in regulating intron retention, providing better accuracy than a recently published custom model developed for this purpose.

Transfer learning aims to integrate useful information from multi-source datasets to improve the learning performance of target data. This can be effectively applied in genomics when we learn the gene associations in a target tissue, and data from other tissues can be integrated. However, heavy-tail distribution and outliers are common in genomics data, which poses challenges to the effectiveness of current transfer learning approaches. In this paper, we study the transfer learning problem under high-dimensional linear models with t-distributed error (Trans-PtLR), which aims to improve the estimation and prediction of target data by borrowing information from useful source data and offering robustness to accommodate complex data with heavy tails and outliers. In the oracle case with known transferable source datasets, a transfer learning algorithm based on penalized maximum likelihood and expectation-maximization algorithm is established. To avoid including non-informative sources, we propose to select the transferable sources based on cross-validation. Extensive simulation experiments as well as an application demonstrate that Trans-PtLR demonstrates robustness and better performance of estimation and prediction when heavy-tail and outliers exist compared to transfer learning for linear regression model with normal error distribution.

Computational models are complex scientific constructs that have become essential for us to better understand the world. Many models are valuable for peers within and beyond disciplinary boundaries. However, there are no widely agreed-upon standards for sharing models. This paper suggests 10 simple rules for you to both (i) ensure you share models in a way that is at least “good enough,” and (ii) enable others to lead the change towards better model-sharing practices.

                <p>by Julien Laussu, Deborah Michel, Léa Magne, Stephane Segonds, Steven Marguet, Dimitri Hamel, Muriel Quaranta-Nicaise, Frederick Barreau, Emmanuel Mas, Vincent Velay, Florian Bugarin, Audrey Ferrand</p>

Understanding the interplay between biology and mechanics in tissue architecture is challenging, particularly in terms of 3D tissue organization. Addressing this challenge requires a biological model enabling observations at multiple levels from cell to tissue, as well as theoretical and computational approaches enabling the generation of a synthetic model that is relevant to the biological model and allowing for investigation of the mechanical stresses experienced by the tissue. Using a monolayer human colon epithelium organoid as a biological model, freely available tools (Fiji, Cellpose, Napari, Morphonet, or Tyssue library), and the commercially available Abaqus FEM solver, we combined vertex and FEM approaches to generate a comprehensive viscoelastic finite element model of the human colon organoid and demonstrated its flexibility. We imaged human colon organoid development for 120 hours, following the evolution of the organoids from an immature to a mature morphology. According to the extracted architectural/geometric parameters of human colon organoids at various stages of tissue architecture establishment, we generated organoid active vertex models. However, this approach did not consider the mechanical aspects involved in the organoids’ morphological evolution. Therefore, we applied a finite element method considering mechanical loads mimicking osmotic pressure, external solicitation, or active contraction in the vertex model by using the Abaqus FEM solver. Integration of finite element analysis (FEA) into the vertex model achieved a better fit with the biological model. Therefore, the FEM model provides a basis for depicting cell shape, tissue deformation, and cellular-level strain due to imposed stresses. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a combination of vertex and FEM approaches, combining geometrical and mechanical parameters, improves modeling of alterations in organoid morphology over time and enables better assessment of the mechanical cues involved in establishing the architecture of the human colon epithelium.

The structure of the early metabolic network is unknown. Here, we report that when considered together, pentose utilization pathways form all life-essential precursors. We speculate that the chemistry preserved in pentose metabolism could therefore have been a central structural element in early metabolism.

                This study explored the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce across Nigeria and selected developing countries, applying a holistic health perspective through a structured review and quantitative synthesis of available research published between 2006 and 2022. Following PRISMA standards, a pre-specified protocol for the review was designed and documented in PROSPERO (ID = CRD42024521833). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases yielded 12 eligible studies. Data were extracted using standardized protocols, and pooled prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model. The overall prevalence was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.3-10.8%), with higher contamination in West Africa (10.5%) compared to Southeast Asia (5.2%). Leafy vegetables exhibited the highest contamination (12.1%). Molecular detection via PCR had higher detecting sensitivity (11.6%) compared to traditional culture methods (7.3%). The analysis revealed significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 97.79%, p < 0.0001), indicating considerable variability in the reported prevalence of Listeria spp. Environmental factors, such as temperature and poor agricultural practices, contributed to contamination. These findings underscore the need for robust hygiene controls and monitoring to mitigate L. monocytogenes risks in fresh produce.

                Ayurveda is one of the oldest holistic healthcare approaches in the world, underpinning the interdependency of mind, body, and spirit in encouraging harmony and preventing disease. The safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda were explored systematically through this review in various global contexts, including its historical development, current practice, and epidemiological trends. This study assesses the integration of Ayurveda into healthcare systems by analyzing experiences in India, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East and its potential to contribute to global health challenges. As Ayurveda’s originator, India has established a robust regulatory framework, extensive clinical research, and government policy support for its integration into mainstream medicine. Evidence supports the efficacy of Ayurvedic therapies, such as Panchakarma and herbal formulations, for treating chronic diseases with minimal side effects. Ayurveda has entered the fold of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States and Germany. Ayurveda treatments have been shown to be effective in various conditions, such as diabetes and arthritis, although regulatory inconsistencies and quality assurance remain significant barriers. There is a cultural affinity towards traditional medicine in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, leading to a growing adoption supported by collaborative initiatives and research. Despite the globally relevant Ayurveda, the non-uniform nature of regulatory standards, lack of large-scale clinical trials, and standardization of formulations form barriers to its more general acceptance. Recommendations for the future include fostering interdisciplinary research, harmonizing regulation, and leveraging digital health in furthering personalized medicine. This study underscores Ayurveda’s transformative potential in global healthcare, advocating sustainable, patient-centered solutions to address chronic and emerging health issues.

                Background Behaviorally conditioned immune functions are suggested to be regulated by bidirectional interactions between CNS and peripheral immune system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the current knowledge about biochemical pathways triggering conditioned immune enhancement is limited, the aim of this pilot study was gaining more insights into that. Methods Rats were conditioned with camphor smell and poly I:C injection, mimicking a viral infection. Following stimulus re-exposure, animals were sacrificed at different time points, and neural tissues along the HPA axis was analyzed with a rat genome array together with plasma protein using Luminex analysis. Results In the hypothalamus, we observed a strong upregulation of genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Otx2, Spp1, Fzd6, Zic1), monoaminergic transporter Slc18a2 and opioid-inhibitory G-protein Gpr88 as well as downregulation of dopaminergic receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptide Vip, and pro-melanin-concentrating hormone Pmch. In the pituitary, we recognized mostly upregulation of steroid synthesis in combination with GABAergic, cholinergic and opioid related neurotransmission, in adrenal glands, altered genes showed a pattern of activated metabolism plus upregulation of adrenoceptors Adrb3 and Adra1a. Data obtained from spleen showed a strong upregulation of immunomodulatory genes, chemo-/cytokines and glutamatergic/cholinergic neurotransmission related genes, as also confirmed by increased chemokine and ACTH levels in plasma. Conclusions Our data indicate that in addition to the classic HPA axis, there could be additional pathways as e.g. the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), connecting brain and immune system, modulating and finetuning communication between brain and immune system.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Epidemiological data have identified traumatic brain injury (TBI) as an exogenous risk factor for ALS; however, the mechanisms by which TBI may worsen SOD1 ALS remain largely undefined.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We sought to determine whether repetitive TBI (rTBI) accelerates disease onset and progression in the transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse ALS model, and whether loss of the primary regulator of axonal degeneration sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (<i>Sarm1</i>) mitigates the histological and behavioral pathophysiology. We subjected wild-type (n = 23), <i>Sarm1</i> knockout (KO; n = 17), SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (n = 19), and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>xSarm1<sup>KO</sup> (n = 26) mice of both sexes to rTBI or sham surgery at age 64 days (62–68 days). Body weight and ALS-deficit score were serially assessed up to 17 weeks after surgery and histopathology assessed in layer V of the primary motor cortex at the study end point.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In sham injured SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, genetic ablation of <i>Sarm1</i> did not attenuate axonal loss, improve neurological deficits, or survival. The rTBI accelerated onset of G93A-SOD1 ALS, as indicated by accentuated body weight loss, earlier onset of hindlimb tremor, and shortened survival. The rTBI also triggered TDP-43 mislocalization, enhanced axonal and neuronal loss, microgliosis, and astrocytosis. Loss of <i>Sarm1</i> significantly diminished the impact of rTBI on disease progression and rescued rTBI-associated neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SARM1-mediated axonal death pathway promotes pathogenesis after TBI in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice suggesting that anti-SARM1 therapeutics are a viable approach to preserve neurological function in injury-accelerated G93A-SOD1 ALS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-59/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Surgical and cultural approaches to managing hematocolpos in adolescents: A Tunisian case report with video insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hematocolpos is a gynecological disorder characterized by the accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina due to anatomical obstruction, often resulting from an imperforate hymen (IH), the most common etiology in approximately 90% of cases. This condition can remain undiagnosed until adolescence, when menarche triggers clinical symptoms such as cyclical lower abdominal pain, primary amenorrhea, and in severe cases, a rapidly enlarging pelvic mass. Complications may include urinary retention, constipation, and infection if not promptly treated. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term consequences such as endometriosis, retrograde menstruation, and infertility. In Tunisia, the hymen holds significant cultural and social value, symbolizing virginity and moral purity, complicating the surgical management of hematocolpos. This case report discusses the surgical and cultural considerations involved in the treatment of a 13-year-old Tunisian girl diagnosed with hematocolpos. A hymen-sparing hymenotomy was selected, preserving the hymenal ring while creating an adequate orifice for menstrual flow, ensuring a balance between medical treatment and cultural sensitivities. The procedure, which included drainage of 600 ml of retained blood and meticulous suturing to maintain the hymen’s appearance, was successful. The patient experienced regular menstrual cycles and expressed satisfaction with the outcome 12 months postoperatively. This case highlights the importance of providing culturally sensitive care in regions where the hymen holds symbolic value. Virginity-sparing surgical techniques offer a suitable approach that addresses both medical and social concerns, ensuring patient well-being while respecting cultural beliefs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-58/v1?src=rss">Social pain: A systematic review on interventions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Social pain is emotional distress caused harm or threat to social connections that results in social exclusion, rejection, or loss. Social Pain is also a potentiator of physical pain. Supportive social relationships are widely recognized for their impact on maintaining health and well-being. The Passion of Jesus Christ serves as a quintessential example of social pain (i.e., desertion, betrayal, denial) potentiating physical pain (i.e., beatings, Crown of Thorns, crucifixion). Christ opts to forgive. Although forgiveness is one solution to reduce social pain, other interventions exist. This review seeks to identify and summarize interventions associated with reducing social pain. We conducted a systematic review using Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify relevant articles. Results: The database searches produced 548 articles. Fourteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review. Acetaminophen, both deceptive and open-label placebos, mindfulness training, and psilocybin were found to reduce social pain. Of note, the combination of acetaminophen and forgiveness yielded superior results compared to either acetaminophen or forgiveness alone. Pharmacological interventions operate on the premise that the neural pathways responsible for physical pain also play a role in social pain. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for reducing social pain.

                The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an important brain region for regulating both negative (fear and anxiety) and positive (reward) affective behaviors. The CeA has been proposed to encode affective information in the form of valence (whether the stimulus is good or bad) or salience (how significant is the stimulus), but the extent to which these two types of stimulus representation occur in the CeA is not known. Here, we used single cell calcium imaging in mice during appetitive and aversive conditioning and found that majority of CeA neurons (~65%) encode the valence of the unconditioned stimulus (US) with a smaller subset of cells (~15%) encoding the salience of the US. Valence and salience encoding of the conditioned stimulus (CS) was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings show that the CeA is a site of convergence for encoding oppositely valenced US information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/75393">Oversized cells activate global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to maintain cell size homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Proliferating animal cells maintain a stable size distribution over generations despite fluctuations in cell growth and division size. Previously, we showed that cell size control involves both cell size checkpoints, which delay cell cycle progression in small cells, and size-dependent regulation of mass accumulation rates (Ginzberg et al., 2018). While we previously identified the p38 MAPK pathway as a key regulator of the mammalian cell size checkpoint (S. Liu et al., 2018), the mechanism of size-dependent growth rate regulation has remained elusive. Here, we quantified global rates of protein synthesis and degradation in cells of varying sizes, both under unperturbed conditions and in response to perturbations that trigger size-dependent compensatory growth slowdown. We found that protein synthesis rates scale proportionally with cell size across cell cycle stages and experimental conditions. In contrast, oversized cells that undergo compensatory growth slowdown exhibit a superlinear increase in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, with accelerated protein turnover per unit mass, suggesting activation of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Both nascent and long-lived proteins contribute to the elevated protein degradation during compensatory growth slowdown, with long-lived proteins playing a crucial role at the G1/S transition. Notably, large G1/S cells exhibit particularly high efficiency in protein degradation, surpassing that of similarly sized or larger cells in S and G2, coinciding with the timing of the most stringent size control in animal cells. These results collectively suggest that oversized cells reduce their growth efficiency by activating global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to promote cell size homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101523">Parabrachial CGRP neurons modulate active defensive behavior under a naturalistic threat</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neuron during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amyplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92979">Surprising features of nuclear receptor interaction networks revealed by live-cell single-molecule imaging</a></h4>

              
                Type II nuclear receptors (T2NRs) require heterodimerization with a common partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), to bind cognate DNA recognition sites in chromatin. Based on previous biochemical and overexpression studies, binding of T2NRs to chromatin is proposed to be regulated by competition for a limiting pool of the core RXR subunit. However, this mechanism has not yet been tested for endogenous proteins in live cells. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT) and proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), we monitored interactions between endogenously tagged RXR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in live cells. Unexpectedly, we find that higher expression of RAR, but not RXR, increases heterodimerization and chromatin binding in U2OS cells. This surprising finding indicates the limiting factor is not RXR but likely its cadre of obligate dimer binding partners. SMT and PAPA thus provide a direct way to probe which components are functionally limiting within a complex TF interaction network providing new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo with implications for drug development targeting nuclear receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97731">Mapping patterns of thought onto brain activity during movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Movie-watching is a central aspect of our lives and an important paradigm for understanding the brain mechanisms behind cognition as it occurs in daily life. Contemporary views of ongoing thought argue that the ability to make sense of events in the ‘here and now’ depend on the neural processing of incoming sensory information by auditory and visual cortex, which are kept in check by systems in association cortex. However, we currently lack an understanding of how patterns of ongoing thoughts map onto the different brain systems when we watch a film, partly because methods of sampling experience disrupt the dynamics of brain activity and the experience of movie-watching. Our study established a novel method for mapping thought patterns onto the brain activity that occurs at different moments of a film, which does not disrupt the time course of brain activity or the movie-watching experience. We found moments when experience sampling highlighted engagement with multi-sensory features of the film or highlighted thoughts with episodic features, regions of sensory cortex were more active and subsequent memory for events in the movie was better—on the other hand, periods of intrusive distraction emerged when activity in regions of association cortex within the frontoparietal system was reduced. These results highlight the critical role sensory systems play in the multi-modal experience of movie-watching and provide evidence for the role of association cortex in reducing distraction when we watch films.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83973">Sensory experience controls dendritic structure and behavior by distinct pathways involving degenerins</a></h4>

              
                Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans'</i> arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics and by glass beads affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Calcium imaging of the PVD neurons in a micromechanical device revealed that controlled mechanical stimulation of the body wall produces similar calcium dynamics in both isolated and crowded animals. Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.

                Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from damage to the pancreatic β cells and an absolute deficiency of insulin, leading to multi-organ involvement and a poor prognosis. The progression of T1DM is significantly influenced by oxidative stress and apoptosis. The natural compound eugenol (EUG) possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, the potential effects of EUG on T1DM had not been investigated. In this study, we established the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model in vivo and STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model in vitro to investigate the protective effects of EUG on T1DM, and tried to elucidate its potential mechanism. Our findings demonstrated that the intervention of EUG could effectively induce the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), leading to an up-regulation in the expressions of downstream proteins NQO1 and HMOX1, which are regulated by NRF2. Moreover, this intervention exhibited a significant amelioration in pancreatic β cell damage associated with T1DM, accompanied by an elevation in insulin secretion and a reduction in the expression levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress-related markers. Furthermore, ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, reversed these effects of EUG. The present study suggested that EUG exerted protective effects on pancreatic β cells in T1DM by attenuating apoptosis and oxidative stress through the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Consequently, EUG holds great promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for T1DM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95135">The NeuroML ecosystem for standardized multi-scale modeling in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites, and the anatomical connectivity between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviors of brain circuits in health and disease. However, the inherent complexity of these biological processes makes the construction and reuse of biologically detailed models challenging. A wide range of tools have been developed to aid their construction and simulation, but differences in design and internal representation act as technical barriers to those who wish to use data-driven models in their research workflows. NeuroML, a model description language for computational neuroscience, was developed to address this fragmentation in modeling tools. Since its inception, NeuroML has evolved into a mature community standard that encompasses a wide range of model types and approaches in computational neuroscience. It has enabled the development of a large ecosystem of interoperable open-source software tools for the creation, visualization, validation, and simulation of data-driven models. Here, we describe how the NeuroML ecosystem can be incorporated into research workflows to simplify the construction, testing, and analysis of standardized models of neural systems, and supports the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, thus promoting open, transparent and reproducible science.

">Social dysfunction relates to altered default mode network functional integrity across neuropsychiatric disorders: A replication and generalization study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social dysfunction is an early manifestation of neuropsychiatric disorders that may relate to altered Default Mode Network (DMN) integrity. This study aimed to replicate previous findings linking social dysfunction with diminished resting-state DMN functional connectivity and altered task-based DMN functional activation in response to emotional faces across schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy controls (HC), and to extend these findings to major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI data on implicit facial emotional processing were acquired in an overlapping cohort (resting-state fMRI: N=167; SZ=32, MDD=44, AD=29, HC=62. Task-based fMRI: N=152; SZ=30, MDD=42, AD=26, HC=54). Additionally, mega-analyses (N=317 for resting-state fMRI; N=291 for task-based fMRI) of the current and a prior independent sample were conducted. Social dysfunction was indexed with the Social Functioning Scale (SFS) and the De Jong-Gierveld Loneliness (LON) scale. Results: The association between higher mean SFS+LON social dysfunction scores and diminished DMN connectivity within the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex across SZ/AD/HC participants was replicated, and extended to MDD patients. Similar observations within the dorsomedial and rostromedial prefrontal cortex were found in the mega-analysis. Associations between social dysfunction and DMN activation in response to sad and happy faces were not replicated or found in the mega-analysis. Conclusions: Diminished dorsomedial prefrontal cortex DMN connectivity emerged as a transdiagnostic neurobiological marker for social dysfunction, suggesting a potential treatment target for precision medicine approaches. DMN functional responses to emotional faces may not be a sensitive biomarker for social dysfunction.

">Neural mechanisms of object prioritization in vision</a></h4>

              
                Selective attention is widely thought to be sensitive to visual objects. This is commonly demonstrated in cueing studies, which show that when attention is deployed to a known target location that happens to fall on a visual object, responses to targets that unexpectedly appear at other locations on that object are faster and more accurate, as if the object in its entirety has been visually prioritized. However, this notion has recently been challenged by results suggesting that putative object-based effects may reflect the influence of hemifield anisotropies in attentional deployment, or of unacknowledged influences of perceptual complexity and visual clutter. Studies employing measures of behaviour provide limited opportunity to address these challenges. Here, we used EEG to directly measure the influence of task-irrelevant objects on the deployment of visual attention. We had participants complete a simple visual cueing task involving identification of a target that appeared at either a cued location or elsewhere. Throughout each experimental trial, displays contained task-irrelevant rectangle stimuli that could be oriented horizontally or vertically. We derived two cue-elicited indices of attentional deployment (lateralized alpha oscillations and the ADAN component of the event-related potential) and found that these were sensitive to the otherwise irrelevant orientation of the rectangles. Our results demonstrate that the allocation of visual attention is influenced by objects boundaries, supporting models of object-based attentional prioritization.

">Epigenome-wide analysis reveals novel DNA methylation signatures significantly associated with the infant pupillary light reflex, a candidate intermediate phenotype for autism.</a></h4>

              
                Autism is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition, currently diagnosed based on behavioural characteristics. Candidate early intermediate phenotypes, such as the Pupillary Light Reflex (PLR), a reflexive constriction of the pupil in response to increased optical luminance, may provide insights into etiological factors and potential biomarkers, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), involved in the emergence of autism. We conducted epigenome-wide DNAm association analyses of 9-, 14-, 24-month PLR onset latency and constriction amplitude in a sample of 51 infants enriched for autism family history, using buccal DNA collected at 9-months. Our epigenome-wide analysis (EWAS) identified four stringently significant differentially methylated probes (p < 2.4 x 10-7) associated with cross-section PLR latency measurements at 14- and 24-months, and with 14- to 24-month PLR latency developmental change. Differentially methylated probes associated with PLR amplitude were identified, but at a less stringent discovery threshold (p < 5 x 10-5). Our region analyses identified several significant differentially methylated regions associated with both PLR latency and amplitude Downstream exploratory pathway analysis identified enrichment for multiple developmental biological processes, as well as several susceptibility genes to autism and related neurodevelopmental conditions including NR4A2, HNRNPU and NAV2. Our findings provide novel insight into the role of DNAm in PLR development and illuminate biological mechanisms underpinning altered PLR in infancy in emerging autism.

">Monocarboxylate transporter 2 is required for the maintenance of myelin and axonal integrity by oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative pathologies including multiple sclerosis (MS) are consistently associated with energy deficit in the central nervous system (CNS). This might directly impact myelinating oligodendrocytes as these are particularly vulnerable to metabolic insults. Importantly, oligodendroglial dysfunction and myelin alterations occur in most, if not all neurodegenerative diseases, and are associated with axonal pathology/loss. Thus, elucidating metabolic mechanisms required for oligodendroglial myelin maintenance and axonal support might be crucial to identify therapeutic targets to achieve neuroprotection. While monocarboxylates are important energy fuels for the CNS, their role in myelinating oligodendrocyte function remains unclear. Here we show that, just like neurons, myelinating oligodendrocytes express high affinity monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) both in mice and humans, which is downregulated in progressive MS. While deletion of MCT2 in mouse oligodendrocytes did not affect the survival of these cells, it resulted in downregulation of lipid synthesis-associated enzymes and failure of myelin maintenance. Moreover, axonal upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase A concomitant with axonal damage was observed but could be alleviated by ketogenic diet. We conclude that oligodendroglial MCT2 is required for myelin maintenance and axonal support, which becomes altered in progressive MS, but may be compensated for by specific metabolic therapies.

                As social species, perception of body motion is crucial to daily interactions, yet the underlying neural processes and their dynamics are not fully understood. While well-established EEG evidence has identified temporal markers of biological body motion, and recent fMRI research points to naturalistic body networks, the temporal markers of higher-level, naturalistic body motion processes remain unknown. The present study bridges this gap, showing that at the stage of P2, the cortex may already distinguish between the global motion of naturalistic bodies compared to objects. Exploratory analyses point to a similar body-specific modulation across stimulus species, namely human and monkey. The findings of the present study expand our understanding of body motion processes, in line with emerging, integrative models of multi-faceted body processes.

                In addition to small extracellular vesicles known as exosomes, cells release large extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria (EVMs). However, the molecular and functional characteristics of EVMs, as well as the impact of EVM secretion on the spreading of mitochondrial dysfunction between cells, remain unknown in the context of Alzheimer Disease (AD). Here, we provide an ultrastructural, biochemical, and functional characterization of EVMs isolated from cells expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the familial Swedish mutation (APPswe). We identified differential proteomic and lipidomic signatures in APPswe-derived EVMs compared to control EVMs and revealed a specific proteomic profile in EVMs isolated from conditioned media of fibroblasts from AD patients at the prodromal stage of the disease. Our findings show that APP-C terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) pathogenic accumulation in cells potentiates EVM secretion through the budding of the plasma membrane. We lastly demonstrated that APP-CTFs loaded EVMs are active carriers of dysfunctional mitochondria that transfer mitochondrial pathology to naive control recipient cells.

                Architectural experience involves processing the spatial layout of an environment and our emotional reaction to it. However, these two processes are largely studied separately. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and first-person movies of journeys through buildings and cities to determine the contribution of different brain regions to spatial and aesthetic aspects of the built environment. During scanning, participants watched 48 movies that show first-person-view travel through different spaces; immediately after each video, they either judged the spatial layout complexity or valence of the environment. After scanning, participants also reported the memorability of the spaces encountered. Activity in brain regions previously linked to valence processing (e.g. ventromedial prefrontal cortex) were modulated by aesthetic qualities of the stimuli (i.e. increased for pleasant spaces compared to unpleasant spaces) and the task (more active when judging valence), whereas activity in brain regions linked with spatial processing (e.g. parahippocampal regions) increased in complex layouts compared to simple layouts. The hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex were associated with the memorability of spaces and were modulated by both aesthetic and spatial qualities. We also tested for curvature, fascination, coherence and hominess - qualities linked to aesthetic judgement in architecture. We replicated findings activating right lingual gyrus for fascination, left inferior occipital gyrus for coherence, and left cuneus for hominess, and found inverse curvature (increasing rectilinearity) activated spatial, valence and visual processing regions. Overall, these findings provide important insights into how different brain regions respond whilst experiencing new buildings and city spaces, which is needed to advance the field of neuroarchitecture.

                Artificial neural networks learn faster if they are initialized well. Good initializations can generate high-dimensional macroscopic dynamics with long timescales. It is not known if biological neural networks have similar properties. Here we show that the eigenvalue spectrum and dynamical properties of large-scale neural recordings in mice (two-photon and electrophysiology) are similar to those produced by linear dynamics governed by a random symmetric matrix that is critically normalized. An exception was hippocampal area CA1: population activity in this area resembled an efficient, uncorrelated neural code, which may be optimized for information storage capacity. Global emergent activity modes persisted in simulations with sparse, clustered or spatial connectivity. We hypothesize that the spontaneous neural activity reflects a critical initialization of whole-brain neural circuits that is optimized for learning time-dependent tasks.

">Developmental axon diameter growth of central nervous system axons does not depend on ensheathment or myelination by oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Myelination facilitates the rapid conduction of action potentials along axons. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelinated axons vary over 100-fold in diameter, with conduction speed scaling linearly with increasing diameter. Axon diameter and myelination are closely interlinked, with axon diameter exerting a strong influence on myelination. Conversely, myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system can both positively and negatively affect axon diameter. However, whether axon diameter is regulated by CNS oligodendrocytes is less clear. Here, we investigated CNS axon diameter growth in the absence of myelin using mouse (Mbpshi/shi and Myrf conditional knockout) and zebrafish (olig2 morpholino) models. We find that neither the ensheathment of axons, nor the formation of compact myelin are required for CNS axons to achieve appropriate and diverse diameters. This indicates that developmental CNS axon diameter growth is independent of myelination, and shows that myelinating cells of CNS and PNS differentially influence axonal morphology.

	<p>Backgrounds and Objectives: Obesity presents a significant global public health challenge and is associated with declines in both general and food-related inhibitory control, crucial for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing obesity progression. An increasing body of research suggests that acute aerobic exercise may improve inhibitory function. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of acute aerobic exercise on both general and food-related inhibition in obese adults remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential impacts and underlying neuroelectronic mechanisms of a single session of aerobic exercise at varying intensities on general and food-related inhibitory functions among young adult males with obesity. Design: A within-subject design comprising three sessions (control, low-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise) &amp;amp;times; three picture types (high-calorie food, low-calorie food, neutral picture) was employed. Methods: Eighteen young adult males with obesity [body mass index (BMI): 34.60 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.21 kg/m2, aged 24.50 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.13 years (Mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD)] were recruited. They participated in three intervention sessions: acute aerobic exercise at low [40&amp;amp;ndash;50% maximal Heart Rate (HRmax)], moderate (65&amp;amp;ndash;70% HRmax), and a control session (sitting rest), separated by five-day intervals in a counterbalanced order. Following each session, participants performed a food-related Go/No-go task, and EEG recordings (N2 and P3 components) were conducted within 15 min. Results: Moderate-intensity exercise elicited larger N2 amplitudes compared to the control session across different picture types and task conditions. However, there was no significant effect on behavioral indicators or P3 amplitude across sessions. Additionally, food stimuli (both high- and low-calorie) resulted in lower No-go accuracy and smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli. Conclusions: Acute moderate-intensity exercise might influence general and food-related inhibitory function in obese individuals at the neuroelectric stage, potentially by enhancing attentional resources for managing cognitive control and conflict detection. Moreover, reduced N2 amplitudes and No-go accuracy in response to food stimuli compared to non-food stimuli indicate a diminished ability to allocate attentional and neural resources to manage food-related conflicts. However, due to the relatively small sample size, caution is advised when generalizing these findings to the broader population. The pilot test indicated that obese participants had difficulty sustaining high-intensity exercise at 80&amp;amp;ndash;90% of their maximum heart rate for a continuous or 20 min period, highlighting potential challenges in exercise adherence at high intensities within this population. Future research is needed to utilize interdisciplinary approaches and multimodal technologies to clarify how exercise influences food-related cognition, appetite regulation, and brain mechanisms in obesity, aiming to better contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) often requires surgical intervention, such as craniotomy, to relieve mass lesions and pressure. The extent of hematoma evacuation significantly impacts patient outcomes. This study utilizes 3D Slicer software to analyse post-craniotomy hematoma volume changes and evaluate their prognostic significance in aSDH patients. Methods: Among 178 adult patients diagnosed with aSDH from January 2015 to December 2022, 64 underwent hematoma evacuation via craniotomy. Initial scans were performed within 24 h of trauma, followed by routine postoperative scans to assess residual hematoma. We conducted radiomic analysis of preoperative and postoperative volumes, surface area, Feret diameter, sphericity, flatness, and elongation. Clinical parameters, including SOFA score, APACHE score, pupillary response, comorbidities, age, anticoagulation status, and preoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin levels, were also evaluated. Results: Changes in &amp;amp;Delta; surface area significantly correlated with 30-day outcomes (p = 0.03) and showed moderate predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.65). Patients with a &amp;amp;Delta; surface area &amp;amp;gt; 30,090 mm2 experienced poorer outcomes (OR = 6.66, p = 0.02). Significant features included preoperative surface area (p = 0.009), Feret diameter (p = 0.0012). In multivariate analysis, only the Feret diameter remained significant (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Postoperative &amp;amp;Delta; surface area is, among other variables, a strong predictor of 30-day outcomes, while in multivariate analysis, preoperative Feret diameter remains the only independent predictor. Radiomic analysis with 3D Slicer may enhance prognostic accuracy and inform tailored therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The study examined the relationships between specific Theory-of-Mind (ToM) dimensions, cognitive planning, and sleep duration in aging adults. Methods: The sample included 179 participants, comprising 46 cognitively healthy individuals, 75 diagnosed with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), and 58 with non-amnestic (naMCI). The mean age of the participants was 70.23 years (SD = 4.74), with a mean educational attainment of 12.35 years (SD = 3.22) and gender distribution of 53 men and 126 women. ToM assessment included tasks measuring the understanding and interpretation of non-literal speech, proverbs and metaphors, as well as an emotion-recognition test. For cognitive planning, a Tower Test was utilized. Sleep duration was measured using actigraphy. Results: We identified significant differences in various ToM tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; performance between the groups, particularly in non-literal speech tasks and third-order ToM stories. The HC group consistently outperformed both MCI groups in these tasks, with aMCI showing higher performance than naMCI. Mediation analysis applied to examine potential direct and indirect effects of sleep duration on ToM tasks indicated that total sleep time had significant indirect effects through cognitive planning&amp;amp;mdash;mainly as rule violation total score&amp;amp;mdash;on specific ToM aspects. Hence, besides the effects of MCI pathologies and especially of naMCI, sleep duration seems also to be associated with ToM performance in aging via specific executive functioning decrements. Conclusions: The findings underscore the social implications of ToM deficits due to MCI and/or sleep duration decrease, particularly in naMCI older adults, as they can seriously impair their social interactions. Targeted interventions could improve emotional understanding, communication, and overall quality of life.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize people by their faces. Developmental prosopagnosia is the hereditary or congenital variant of the condition. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the assessment of developmental prosopagnosia in a clinical context, using a combination of commercially available clinical assessment tools and experimental tools described in the research literature. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of a man with Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient (ON) had experienced difficulties with face identity recognition throughout his life but believed they were caused by a lack of interest in others. Results: The neuropsychological assessment revealed varying degrees of difficulties primarily related to executive functions, attention, reaction time, and memory processes, as expected in a person with Tourette&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome and ADHD. In addition, ON reported severe problems with face recognition on a prosopagnosia questionnaire and demonstrated severely impaired performance on tests of face memory and face perception commonly used to diagnose prosopagnosia. Interestingly, he reported familial face recognition problems on the maternal side of the family, while tics and ADHD symptoms occurred on the paternal side. This suggests that, in this case, the conditions were likely inherited through different genetic pathways. Conclusions: Proper assessment of face recognition problems, which includes a broad spectrum of clinical assessment tools, could help patients develop awareness and acceptance of themselves and their difficulties, and could serve as a basis for the development of clinical interventions. While ON&amp;amp;rsquo;s DP, Tourette syndrome, and ADHD may have distinct genetic origins, impairment in face identity recognition has been observed across several neurodevelopmental conditions and is likely more common than currently thought.</p>

                <p>The full complement of ion channels which influence insect auditory mechanotransduction and the mechanisms by which their influence is exerted remain unclear. <I>Shal</I> (K<SUB>v</SUB>4), a <I>Shaker</I> family member encoding voltage-gated potassium channels in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, has been shown to localize to dendrites in some neuron types, suggesting the potential role of <I>Shal</I> in <I>Drosophila</I> hearing, including mechanotransduction. A GFP trap was used to visualize the localization of the <I>Shal</I> channel in Johnston's organ neurons responsible for hearing in the antenna. <I>Shal</I> protein was localized strongly to the cell body and inner dendritic segment of sensory neurons. It was also detectable in the sensory cilium, suggesting its involvement not only in general auditory function but specifically in mechanotransduction. Electrophysiological recordings to assess neural responses to auditory stimuli in mutant <I>Shal</I> flies revealed significant decreases in auditory responses. Laser Doppler vibrometer recordings indicated abnormal antennal free fluctuation frequencies in mutant lines, indicating an effect on active antennal tuning, and thus active transduction mechanisms. This suggests that <I>Shal</I> participates in coordinating energy-dependent antennal movements in <I>Drosophila</I> that are essential for tuning the antenna to courtship song frequencies.</p>

                <p>The social environment has long been recognized to play an important role in substance use, which is often modeled in rodents using operant conditioning. However, most operant chambers only accommodate one rodent at a time. We present PeerPub&mdash;a unique social operant chamber. PeerPub employs touch sensors to track the licking behavior on drinking spouts. When the number of licks meets a set reinforcement schedule, it dispenses a drop of solution with a fixed volume as a reward at the tip of the spout. A radio frequency identification (RFID) chip implanted in each rat&rsquo;s skull identifies it throughout the experiment. The system is managed by a Raspberry Pi computer. We evaluated PeerPub using Sprague Dawley rats in daily 1&nbsp;h sessions, where supersac (a glucose and saccharin solution) was provided under a fixed-ratio five schedule. We discovered that male rats consumed more supersac in dual rat conditions compared with single rat conditions. These findings illustrate PeerPub&rsquo;s effectiveness in modeling the interaction between motivated behavior and social context. We expect devices like PeerPub will help highlight the role of social environments in substance use disorder phenotypes. All computer code, 3D design, and build instructions for PeerPub can be found at <A HREF="http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub">http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub</A>.</p>

                Background Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, often leading to disabilities, including trophic ulcers (TU). The role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the development of TU among leprosy patients remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the frequency of VDR gene FokI polymorphism between leprosy patients with and without TU, and to evaluate their association with the occurrence of TU. Methods This Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center, observational, analytic case-control study will enroll adult leprosy patients from the Dermatology and Venereology Clinic at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants will be divided into cases (patients with TU) and controls (patients without TU). Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and FokI polymorphism detection is conducted through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences and associations. Results Data collection commenced in March 2024 and was completed in September 2024. Data analysis and reporting are expected to be finalized by January 2025. Discussion The findings of this study will enhance the current understanding of the role of the vitamin D axis in the development of TU among leprosy patients. This could lead to new therapeutic strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation or personalized medicine based on genetic profiling, potentially reducing the burden of TU among leprosy patients.

                Background The quality of registry based studies depends largely on the data accuracy of the registries. The Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) is a nationwide database comprising perinatal data digitally provided by different healthcare providers. Perined data are used for comparing outcomes across regions and healthcare institutions as well as for quality analyses and research purposes. However, little is known about the data quality of the Perined database. Therefore, this research protocol depicts our proposed study assessing the quality of Perined data compared to hospital records and case report forms (CRFs) that were part of the IUGR Risk Selection (IRIS) study. Methods In the planned comparison study data from Perined and the IRIS Study will be used. The IRIS study was a large cluster-randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of routine third trimester ultrasonography in reducing severe adverse perinatal outcomes among Dutch low-risk pregnant women. A subsample of the IRIS study of neonates being at risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes and their mothers will be used. Baseline demographic data were collected by midwives from participating women at inclusion (around 22 weeks’ gestation) using CRFs, and in-depth neonatal and maternal clinical data were retrieved from hospital records by trained research assistants. These latter IRIS study data were linked and compared to Perined data. Completeness of Perined data will be calculated for every variable. The reliability will be assessed as the percent of agreement between Perined and hospital record data or the CRF-based data. Additionally, intra-class correlation coefficients will be calculated for continuous variables, and Kappa and ‘Prevalence-and-Bias-Adjusted Kappa’ will be calculated for categorical variables. Discussion The results of the planned comparison study will provide users of Perined data insight in its data quality. This will serve as an example of the accuracy of registry based data used in maternal and neonatal care research.

                Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among children and adolescents is crucial for the prevention of HPV-related diseases later in life. However, HPV vaccination uptake remains suboptimal in this population. This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting parents and parent-adolescent dyads in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the impact of parent-directed and parent-adolescent dyad interventions on HPV vaccination uptake in children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Specific objectives include reviewing existing literature on parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions, assessing vaccination uptake, identifying influencing factors, and providing evidence-based recommendations for intervention development and implementation. Methods A systematic review will be conducted, encompassing literature published up to the present day. Various databases will be searched for relevant studies on parent-focused and parent-adolescent dyad interventions aimed at improving HPV vaccination uptake. Data extraction and analysis will be performed to assess the proportion of children and adolescents receiving HPV vaccination following interventions, factors influencing vaccination uptake, and completion rates of the recommended vaccine series. Results The review findings will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including meta-analysis to estimate the overall effect size of interventions. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of the results. Conclusion This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents. The findings will inform the development and implementation of targeted interventions to address barriers and improve vaccination coverage, ultimately reducing the burden of HPV-related diseases.

                Background Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in improving clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients has gained significant attention; however, its impact on long-term survival and recurrence rates remains under investigation. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of NAC on metastasis, recurrence rates, and overall survival in BC patients. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were employed to assess differences between groups. Methods In this retrospective study, 46 Sudanese patients with locally advanced BC were consecutively collected attending Alsharif Specialized Hospital during the period from 2015 to 2016, comprising 28 patients who received NAC (case group) and 18 patients who underwent upfront surgery (control group). Data regarding demographics, histological types, treatment regimens, prognostic markers, survival, recurrence and metastasis were collected Results Most of patients in both groups were > 40 years old. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was the predominant histological type observed. Notably, the metastasis rate was lower in the case group than in the control group (n=6; 21.4% vs. n=9; 50%, P = 0.043). However, the recurrence rates and overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.353 and P = 0.454, respectively). The estimated mean survival time was 74.1 months for the case group compared to 82.0 months for the control group, but without significant difference (log-rank P = 0.973). Conclusion While NAC appears to reduce metastasis rates in breast cancer patients, it does not significantly impact recurrence rates or overall survival. These results underscore the need for further research to explore additional factors that influence long-term outcomes of breast cancer management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-54/v1?src=rss">Applications of MR Finger printing derived T1 and T2 values in Adult brain: A Systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for brain imaging, but conventional methods rely on qualitative contrast, are time-intensive, and prone to variability. Magnetic resonance finger printing (MRF) addresses these limitations by enabling fast, simultaneous mapping of multiple tissue properties like T1, T2. Using dynamic acquisition parameters and a precomputed signal dictionary, MRF provides robust, qualitative maps, improving diagnostic precision and expanding clinical and research applications in brain imaging. Methods Database searches were performed through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of science to identify relevant articles focusing on the application of MR finger printing in the adult brain. We utilized the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines to extract data from the selected studies. Results Nine articles were included in the final review, with a total sample size of 332 participants. In healthy brains, notable regional, sex, age, and hemispheric variations were identified, particularly in the corpus callosum and thalamus. MRF effectively differentiated meningioma subtypes, glioma grades, and IDH mutation status, with T2 values providing particularly predictive for glioma classification. In brain metastases, significant relaxometry differences were noted between normal and lesional tissues. For multiple sclerosis, MRF values correlated with clinical and disability measures, distinguishing relapsing-remitting secondary progressive forms. In traumatic brain injury, longitudinal T1 changes strongly correlated with clinical recovery, surpassing T2 values. Conclusions The systematic review highlighted MRD as a groundbreaking technique that enhances neurological diagnosis by simultaneously quantifying T1 and T2 relaxation times. With reduced acquisition times, MRF outperforms conventional MRI in detecting subtle pathologies, distinguishing properties, and providing reliable biomarkers.

                Background Good animal welfare is important ethically but also to ensure animals provide valid scientific models. Despite thousands of amphibians in research laboratories there is minimal quantitative evidence pertaining to their management and welfare. This study validated methods to non-invasively measure corticosterone, the amphibian ‘stress’ hormone, from tank water to provide a robust and reliable welfare assessment tool. Methods We report experiments (A) that evaluate parameters linked to the performance of our biochemical extraction methods for waterborne corticosterone and, importantly, associated sampling procedures. We evaluate appropriate sampling water type, sampling vessel, filtration methods, potential degradation of waterborne corticosterone over time and the impact of sampling procedures on animal corticosterone levels. We wanted to determine sampling parameters that yielded the least background corticosterone and had minimum negative impact on the animals. The second series of experiments (B) evaluated parameters linked to the biology of Xenopus, including the influence of circadian rhythm, sex and snout-vent length on waterborne corticosterone levels, since fundamental knowledge of a species’ biology is essential for designing robust experiments and in the interpretation of the results. Results We propose collecting corticosterone samples in deionised water in either plastic or glass containers. The filtering process does not impact the amount of corticosterone measured in the water sample. Levels of corticosterone collected in the water change over a 48-hr period so we advocate standardising time from hormone collection to storage at - 20 °C. Repeated transfer of frogs to sampling containers does not increase corticosterone, suggesting our methods are not cumulatively stressful. Corticosterone levels were not impacted by circadian phase, sex or snout-vent length. Conclusion We have developed and validated robust methods to quantify waterborne corticosterone. We hope they provide a template for researchers wishing to develop methods to measure waterborne corticosterone in aquatic amphibians.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early stage of Parkinson's disease or related disorders. Diagnosis requires an overnight video-polysomnogram (vPSG), however, even for sleep experts, interpreting vPSG data is challenging. Using a 3D camera, automated analysis of movements has yielded high accuracy. We aimed to replicate and extend prior work using a conventional 2D camera.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The dataset included 172 vPSG recordings from a clinical sleep center, 81 patients with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls (63 with a range of other sleep disorders and 28 healthy sleepers). An optical flow computer vision algorithm automatically detected movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, from which features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility were extracted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD exhibited an increased number of shorter movements and immobility periods. Accuracies for detecting iRBD ranged from 84.9% (with 2 features) to 87.2% (with 5 features). Combining all 5 features but only analyzing short (0.1–2 second duration) movements achieved the highest accuracy at 91.9%. Of the 11 patients with iRBD without noticeable movements during vPSG, 7 were correctly identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work improves prior art by using a 2D camera routinely used in sleep laboratories and improving performance by adding only 3 features. This approach could be implemented in clinical sleep laboratories to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of iRBD. Coupled with automated detection of REM sleep, it should also be tested in the home environment using conventional infrared cameras to detect and/or monitor RBD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>by Xiaoyi Wang, Zhen Jin</p>

Human mobility between different regions is a major factor in large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases. Deep learning models incorporating infectious disease transmission dynamics for predicting the spread of multi-regional outbreaks due to human mobility have become a hot research topic. In this study, we incorporate the Graph Transformer Neural Network and graph learning mechanisms into a metapopulation SIR model to build a hybrid framework, Metapopulation Graph Transformer Neural Network (M-Graphormer), for high-dimensional parameter estimation and multi-regional epidemic prediction. The framework effectively solves the problem that existing models may lose some hidden spatial dependencies in the data when dealing with the dynamic graph structure of the network due to human mobility. We performed multi-wave infectious disease prediction in multiple regions based on real epidemic data. The results show that the framework is capable of performing high-dimensional parameter estimation and accurately predicting epidemic transmission dynamics in multiple regions even with low data quality. In addition, we retrospectively extrapolate the temporal evolution patterns of contact rate under different interventions implemented in different regions, reflecting the dynamics of intervention intensity and the need for flexibility in adjusting interventions in different regions. To provide early warning of infectious disease transmission, we retrospectively predicted the arrival time of infectious diseases using data from the early stages of outbreaks.

                <p>by Luca Oneto, Davide Chicco</p>

Machine learning has become a powerful tool for computational analysis in the biomedical sciences, with its effectiveness significantly enhanced by integrating domain-specific knowledge. This integration has give rise to informed machine learning, in contrast to studies that lack domain knowledge and treat all variables equally (uninformed machine learning). While the application of informed machine learning to bioinformatics and health informatics datasets has become more seamless, the likelihood of errors has also increased. To address this drawback, we present eight guidelines outlining best practices for employing informed machine learning methods in biomedical sciences. These quick tips offer recommendations on various aspects of informed machine learning analysis, aiming to assist researchers in generating more robust, explainable, and dependable results. Even if we originally crafted these eight simple suggestions for novices, we believe they are deemed relevant for expert computational researchers as well.

                <p>by Amrit Bagchi, Bapi Sarker, Jialiang Zhang, Marcus Foston, Amit Pathak</p>

Cell collectives, like other motile entities, generate and use forces to move forward. Here, we ask whether environmental configurations alter this proportional force-speed relationship, since aligned extracellular matrix fibers are known to cause directed migration. We show that aligned fibers serve as active conduits for spatial propagation of cellular mechanotransduction through matrix exoskeleton, leading to efficient directed collective cell migration. Epithelial (MCF10A) cell clusters adhered to <i>soft</i> substrates with aligned collagen fibers (AF) migrate faster with much lesser traction forces, compared to random fibers (RF). Fiber alignment causes higher motility waves and transmission of normal stresses deeper into cell monolayer while minimizing shear stresses and increased cell-division based fluidization. By contrast, fiber randomization induces cellular jamming due to breakage in motility waves, disrupted transmission of normal stresses, and heightened shear driven flow. Using a novel motor-clutch model, we explain that such ‘force-effective’ fast migration phenotype occurs due to rapid stabilization of contractile forces at the migrating front, enabled by higher frictional forces arising from simultaneous compressive loading of parallel fiber-substrate connections. We also model ‘<i>haptotaxis</i>’ to show that increasing ligand connectivity (but not continuity) increases migration efficiency. According to our model, increased rate of front stabilization via higher resistance to substrate deformation is sufficient to capture ‘<i>durotaxis’</i>. Thus, our findings reveal a new paradigm wherein the rate of leading-edge stabilization determines the efficiency of supracellular collective cell migration.

                <p>by Kwang Su Kim, Masashi Iwamoto, Kosaku Kitagawa, Hyeongki Park, Sanae Hayashi, Senko Tsukuda, Takeshi Matsui, Masanori Atsukawa, Kentaro Matsuura, Natthaya Chuaypen, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Lena Allweiss, Takara Nishiyama, Naotoshi Nakamura, Yasuhisa Fujita, Eiryo Kawakami, Shinji Nakaoka, Masamichi Muramatsu, Kazuyuki Aihara, Takaji Wakita, Alan S.

Quantification of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a key for evaluating an elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in infected patients. However, quantifying cccDNA requires invasive methods such as a liver biopsy, which makes it impractical to access the dynamics of cccDNA in patients. Although HBV RNA and HBV core-related antigens (HBcrAg) have been proposed as surrogate markers for evaluating cccDNA activity, they do not necessarily estimate the amount of cccDNA. Here, we employed a recently developed multiscale mathematical model describing intra- and intercellular viral propagation and applied it in HBV-infected patients under treatment. We developed a model that can predict intracellular HBV dynamics by use of extracellular viral markers, including HBsAg, HBV DNA, and HBcrAg in peripheral blood. Importantly, the model prediction of the amount of cccDNA in patients over time was confirmed to be well correlated with the data for quantified cccDNA by paired liver biopsy. Thus, our method combining classic and emerging surrogate markers enables us to predict the decay dynamics of cccDNA in patients undergoing treatment.

<p>Fossils work well for reconstructing the evolutionary history of brain shape and size but are mute to the evolution of subcortical structures. Leveraging the use of scaling attributes, simulation and 3D mapping we predict subcortical anatomy for fossil Carnivora. These data help to expand the search space for paleoneurological study.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Paleoneurology reconstructs the evolutionary history of nervous systems through direct observations from the fossil record and comparative data from extant species. Although this approach can provide direct evidence of phylogenetic links among species, it is constrained by the availability and quality of data that can be gleaned from the fossil record. Here, we sought to translate brain component relationships in a sample of extant Carnivora to make inferences about brain structure in fossil species. Using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging on extant canids and felids and 3D laser scanning on fossil Carnivora, spanning some 40 million years of evolution, we derived measurements for select brain components. From these primary data, predictive equations of cortical (gray matter mass, cortical thickness, and gyrification index) and subcortical structures (caudate nucleus, putamen, and external globus pallidus mass) were used to derive estimates for select fossil Carnivora. We found that regression equations based on both extant and simulation samples provided moderate to high predictability of subcortical masses for fossil Carnivora. We also found that using exploratory probabilistic mapping of subcortical structures in extant Carnivora, a reasonable prediction could be made of the 3D subcortical morphospace of fossil endocasts. These results identify allometric departures and establish adult species ranges in brain component size for fossil species. The integrative approach taken in this study may serve as a model to promote further dialog between neurobiologists working on extant Carnivora models and paleoneurologists describing the nervous system of fossils from this understudied group of mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27161?af=R">Early‐Life Adversity Predicts Markers of Aging‐Related Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Cognitive Impairment in Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence for profound and longstanding effects of early-life stress (ELS) on inflammation, brain structure, and molecular aging, its impact on human brain aging and risk for neurodegenerative disease is poorly understood. We examined the impact of ELS severity in interaction with age on blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, brain volumes, and cognitive function in middle-aged women.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 179 women (aged 30–60 years) with and without ELS exposure before the onset of puberty. Using Simoa technology, we assessed blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We further obtained T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to assess brain volumes and we assessed cognitive performance sensitive to early impairments associated with the development of dementia, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery. We used generalized additive models to examine nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on these outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Analyses revealed significant nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on NfL and GFAP serum concentrations, total and subcortical gray matter volume loss, increased third ventricular volume, and cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that ELS profoundly exacerbates peripheral, neurostructural, and cognitive markers of brain aging. Our results are critical for the development of novel early prevention strategies that target the impact of developmental stress on the brain to mitigate aging-related neurological diseases.

                Background Glaucoma, the primary cause of irreversible blindness globally, mainly presents as primary open-angle glaucoma and is more common in sub-Saharan Africa. This chronic disease of the optic nerve often goes undiagnosed due to its asymptomatic early stages. Increased awareness and regular eye exams can help in early detection and management. Purpose/Objectives This study aims to comprehensively identify the existing literature on screening programs or interventions for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) at the primary healthcare level. Additionally, the study aims to outline the characteristics of these screening programs/interventions and emphasize the most successful programs that have been implemented at the primary healthcare level. Methods The scoping review will be conducted following the framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al. (2010) methodological enhancement for conducting a scoping review project. The search will cover peer-reviewed articles published in English between the inception and May 2024 from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and the WHO Global Database. The search on the EBSCOhost platform will include databases such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycInfo, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE with full text, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analyzed using QualCoder 1.9 version. The study findings will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and a checklist will be completed to ensure adherence to reporting guidelines. Conclusion This review will help identify research gaps in primary healthcare POAG screening programs and recommend effective interventions.

                Background Trichoderma spp. hold significant potential as biocontrol agents in agriculture due to their antagonistic properties against plant pathogens. The study aimed to characterize and identify Trichoderma isolates from rhizospheric regions of vegetable crops. Methods In this study, Trichoderma isolates were collected from rhizospheric soil samples of vegetable crops from different ecological zones and were selected for comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization. The isolates were visually assessed for colony color, growth pattern, aerial mycelium presence, phialide and conidial morphology, and chlamydospore presence. Molecular analysis was employed based on ITS and tef-1α sequences. Diversity indices were also computed for different ecological zones. Results The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic trees for both regions provided a clear species resolution, with four main clades: Harzianum, Viride, Brevicompactum and Longibrachiatum with 12 species T. harzinaum, T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. inhamatum, T. camerunense, T. azevedoi, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. asperelloides, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. brevicompactum and nine species as a new country record. Diversity indices indicated that high mountain regions displayed the highest species diversity and evenness (H = 1.724 [0.28], J = 0.84, D = 0.28), followed by hilly regions (H = 1.563 [0.28], J = 0.72, D = 0.28). Plains, on the other hand, exhibited lower species diversity (H = 1.515, J = 0.66, D = 0.33). The calculated species abundance values showed that plains (E = 2.11), mid-hills (E = 1.95), and high mountains (E = 1.99) each had their unique diversity profiles. Notably, T. afroharzianum and T. asperellum were predominant. Conclusions Overall, the study unveiled a rich diversity of Trichoderma species in different agricultural zones of Nepal. These findings shed light on the ecological distribution and diversity of Trichoderma spp., which could have significant implications for sustainable agriculture and biological control strategies.

                Background Radiological case reports summarize the imaging characteristics of individual cases to identify patterns and valuable lessons. Their writing can be guided by the CARE reporting guidelines or the CARE-radiology reporting guidelines. However, the impact of following these guidelines, or not following them, on the quality and efficiency of radiological case reports writing remain unclear. Objective To examine whether following the CARE reporting guidelines or the CARE-radiology reporting guidelines, or not following any reporting guidelines, affects the quality and writing efficiency of radiological case reports. Protocol The purpose of this protocol is to outline the background and objectives of this study, as well as the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT). We will design a three-arm, multicentre cRCT, targeting radiologists or radiology students from different medical institutions. The intervention include training on the CARE-radiology checklist; the second intervention involves training on the CARE checklist. The control group will follow standard procedures without any intervention. After the intervention, participants will be required to write a case report within a period of 10 days. The primary outcome measures will be the completeness and clarity of the case reports. Discussion This study aims to enhance the adherence of researchers to reporting guidelines for case reports through rigorous design. The results will be further explained and interpreted in the final trial outcomes. Registration This study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, with the registration number: ChiCTR2400089973.

                Background Intestinal parasitoses are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in Africa, with a prevalence of 42.18%. The tropical climate in the D.R. Congo provides parasites with an environment conducive to their proliferation. The prevalence rates of intestinal parasitoses remain poorly understood in the D.R. Congo. Objective This study aims to estimate the overall and specific prevalence of intestinal parasitosis and to determine an association between intestinal parasitosis and the season. Methods From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, patients for whom a direct stool examination was requested at the Notre Dame de l’Espérance University Hospital Center were included in this study. Stool samples were collected and examined under an optical microscope. Results During the period of the study, we recorded 187 patients aged 2 to 77 years. The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 75.40%. The specific prevalence rates for parasites were as follows: Entamoeba H., the most common, with a prevalence of 55.08%, followed by Trichomonas I. and Giardia L. with respective prevalence rates of 9.09% and 6.24%. Ascaris L. had a prevalence of 27.81%, followed by Schistosoma M., Ankylostoma D., and Enterobius V. with respective prevalence rates of 3.74%, 1.60%, and 1.07%. There was no association between the season and the overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis. Conclusion The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was higher during the dry season. There is no statistically valid association between the season and the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis.

                Objective To develop predictive models for healthcare workforce transition success under decentralization using Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis and identify key determinants across organizational support domains. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare personnel (n=430) who transferred from Ministry of Public Health facilities to Provincial Administrative Organizations in Thailand during 2023-2024. The SVM model evaluated 37 predictor variables spanning demographic characteristics, benefits, and welfare domains. Four kernel functions were compared to identify optimal model performance, and feature importance analysis was conducted to determine key predictors. Results The linear kernel demonstrated superior performance (accuracy: 71.43%, sensitivity: 49.02%, specificity: 85.37%) compared to other kernel functions. Analysis revealed five key predictors (feature weights >0.25): competitive compensation (0.427), career development opportunities (0.358), fair promotion processes (0.336), hazardous work compensation (0.285), and educational leave opportunities (0.252). While employee qualifications (0.236) emerged as a significant demographic predictor, organizational support factors, particularly financial incentives and professional development opportunities, showed stronger predictive power for transition success. Conclusions This study represents the first application of machine learning techniques to predict healthcare personnel transition success in decentralization contexts. The SVM model effectively identified critical factors influencing workforce transitions, emphasizing the importance of balanced organizational support mechanisms. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for healthcare administrators implementing decentralization policies, offering generalizable insights for workforce management during health system reforms.

                Fu et al. discover a non-metabolic function of TKT in gliomas. Mechanistically, TKT undergoes translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following chemotherapy. Nuclear TKT interacts with XRN2 to prevent excessive R-loop accumulation, while depletion of TKT leads to increased R-loop accumulation and genome instability, potentiating chemotherapy efficacy.

                Novak et al. show how Miro1 regulates mitochondrial transfer from the tumor microenvironment to mtDNA-deficient melanoma cells. The authors argue that delayed tumor formation observed in Miro1KO mice results from impaired mitochondrial transfer, which involves reduced microtubule association, disruption of the mitochondrial network, and TNT formation.

                Transcription factor partners can cooperatively bind to DNA composite elements to augment gene transcription. Here, we report a novel protein-DNA binding screening pipeline, termed Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements (SPICE), that can systematically predict protein binding partners and DNA motif spacing preferences. Using SPICE, we successfully identified known composite elements, such as AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs) and STAT5 tetramers, and also uncovered several novel binding partners, including JUN-IKZF1 composite elements. One such novel interaction was identified at CNS9, an upstream conserved noncoding region in the human <i>IL10</i> gene, which harbors a non-canonical IKZF1 binding site. We confirmed the cooperative binding of JUN and IKZF1 and showed that the activity of an <i>IL10</i>-luciferase reporter construct in primary B and T cells depended on both this site and the AP1 binding site within this composite element. Overall, our findings reveal an unappreciated global association of IKZF1 and AP1 and establish SPICE as a valuable new pipeline for predicting novel transcription binding complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96784">Fractal cycles of sleep, a new aperiodic activity-based definition of sleep cycles</a></h4>

              
                Sleep cycles are defined as episodes of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep followed by an episode of REM sleep. Fractal or aperiodic neural activity is a well-established marker of arousal and sleep stages measured using electroencephalography. We introduce a new concept of ‘fractal cycles’ of sleep, defined as a time interval during which time series of fractal activity descend to their local minimum and ascend to the next local maximum. We assess correlations between fractal and classical (i.e. non-REM – REM) sleep cycle durations and study cycles with skipped REM sleep. The sample comprised 205 healthy adults, 21 children and adolescents and 111 patients with depression. We found that fractal and classical cycle durations (89±34 vs 90±25 min) correlated positively (<i>r</i>=0.5, p&lt;0.001). Children and adolescents had shorter fractal cycles than young adults (76±34 vs 94±32 min). The fractal cycle algorithm detected cycles with skipped REM sleep in 91–98% of cases. Medicated patients with depression showed longer fractal cycles compared to their unmedicated state (107±51 vs 92±38 min) and age-matched controls (104±49 vs 88±31 min). In conclusion, fractal cycles are an objective, quantifiable, continuous and biologically plausible way to display sleep neural activity and its cycles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95528">High-resolution awake mouse fMRI at 14 tesla</a></h4>

              
                High-resolution awake mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains challenging despite extensive efforts to address motion-induced artifacts and stress. This study introduces an implantable radio frequency (RF) surface coil design that minimizes image distortion caused by the air/tissue interface of mouse brains while simultaneously serving as a headpost for fixation during scanning. Furthermore, this study provides a thorough acclimation method used to accustom animals to the MRI environment minimizing motion-induced artifacts. Using a 14 T scanner, high-resolution fMRI enabled brain-wide functional mapping of visual and vibrissa stimulation at 100 µm×100 µm×200 µm resolution with a 2 s per frame sampling rate. Besides activated ascending visual and vibrissa pathways, robust blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses were detected in the anterior cingulate cortex upon visual stimulation and spread through the ventral retrosplenial area (VRA) with vibrissa air-puff stimulation, demonstrating higher-order sensory processing in association cortices of awake mice. In particular, the rapid hemodynamic responses in VRA upon vibrissa stimulation showed a strong correlation with the hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortical areas. Cross-correlation analysis with designated VRA responses revealed early positive BOLD signals at the contralateral barrel cortex (BC) occurring 2 s prior to the air-puff in awake mice with repetitive stimulation, which was not detected using a randomized stimulation paradigm. This early BC activation indicated a learned anticipation through the vibrissa system and association cortices in awake mice under continuous exposure of repetitive air-puff stimulation. This work establishes a high-resolution awake mouse fMRI platform, enabling brain-wide functional mapping of sensory signal processing in higher association cortical areas.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98742">Nitric oxide modulates contrast suppression in a subset of mouse retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators have major influences on the regulation of neural circuit activity across the nervous system. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be a prominent neuromodulator in many circuits and has been extensively studied in the retina. Here, it has been associated with the regulation of light adaptation, gain control, and gap junctional coupling, but its effect on the retinal output, specifically on the different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is still poorly understood. In this study, we used two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings to measure light-evoked activity of RGCs in the ganglion cell layer in the ex vivo mouse retina. This approach allowed us to investigate the neuromodulatory effects of NO on a cell type-level. Our findings reveal that NO selectively modulates the suppression of temporal responses in a distinct subset of contrast-suppressed RGC types, increasing their activity without altering the spatial properties of their receptive fields. Given that under photopic conditions, NO release is triggered by quick changes in light levels, we propose that these RGC types signal fast contrast changes to higher visual regions. Remarkably, we found that about one-third of the RGC types, recorded using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, exhibited consistent, cell type-specific adaptational response changes throughout an experiment, independent of NO. By employing a sequential-recording paradigm, we could disentangle those additional adaptational response changes from drug-induced modulations. Taken together, our research highlights the selective neuromodulatory effects of NO on RGCs and emphasizes the need of considering non-pharmacological activity changes, like adaptation, in such study designs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93183">A high-throughput platform for single-molecule tracking identifies drug interaction and cellular mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of cell physiology depends largely upon interactions of functionally distinct proteins and cellular components. These interactions may be transient or long-lived, but often affect protein motion. Measurement of protein dynamics within a cellular environment, particularly while perturbing protein function with small molecules, may enable dissection of key interactions and facilitate drug discovery; however, current approaches are limited by throughput with respect to data acquisition and analysis. As a result, studies using super-resolution imaging are typically drawing conclusions from tens of cells and a few experimental conditions tested. We addressed these limitations by developing a high-throughput single-molecule tracking (htSMT) platform for pharmacologic dissection of protein dynamics in living cells at an unprecedented scale (capable of imaging &gt;10<sup>6</sup> cells/day and screening &gt;10<sup>4</sup> compounds). We applied htSMT to measure the cellular dynamics of fluorescently tagged estrogen receptor (ER) and screened a diverse library to identify small molecules that perturbed ER function in real time. With this one experimental modality, we determined the potency, pathway selectivity, target engagement, and mechanism of action for identified hits. Kinetic htSMT experiments were capable of distinguishing between on-target and on-pathway modulators of ER signaling. Integrated pathway analysis recapitulated the network of known ER interaction partners and suggested potentially novel, kinase-mediated regulatory mechanisms. The sensitivity of htSMT revealed a new correlation between ER dynamics and the ability of ER antagonists to suppress cancer cell growth. Therefore, measuring protein motion at scale is a powerful method to investigate dynamic interactions among proteins and may facilitate the identification and characterization of novel therapeutics.

	<p>Acute vertigo or dizziness is a frequent presentation to the emergency department (ED), making up between 2.1% and 4.4% of all consultations. Given the nature of the ED where the priority is triage, diagnostic delays and misdiagnoses are common, with as many as a third of vertebrobasilar strokes presenting with acute vertigo or dizziness being missed. Here, we review diagnostic errors identified in the evaluation and treatment of the acutely dizzy patient and discuss strategies to overcome them. Lessons learned include focusing on structured history taking, asking about timing and triggers to inform a targeted examination, assessing subtle ocular motor findings (e.g., by use of HINTS(+)), and avoiding overreliance on brain imaging (including early magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted sequences [DWI-MRI]). Importantly, up to 20% of DWI-MRI may be false negatives if obtained within the first 24&amp;amp;ndash;48 h after symptom onset. Likewise, overreliance on focal neurologic findings to confirm a stroke diagnosis should be avoided because isolated dizziness, vertigo, or even unsteadiness may be the only symptoms in some patients with vertebrobasilar stroke. Furthermore, in patients with triggered episodic vestibular symptoms provocation maneuvers should be preferred over HINTS(+), and a potential diagnosis of stroke should not be immediately dismissed in younger patients presenting with a headache (where migraine may be more common), but the possibility of a vertebral artery dissection should be further evaluated. Importantly, moderate training of non-experts allows for significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy in the acutely dizzy patient and thus should be prioritized.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: A neurobiological framework of bi- or multilingual neurocognitive development must consider the following: (i) longitudinal behavioral and neural measures; (ii) brain developmental constraints across structure and function; and (iii) the development of global multilingual competence in a homogeneous social environment. In this study, we investigated whether multilingual competence yields early changes in executive attention control mechanisms and their underlying neural structures in the frontal&amp;amp;ndash;striatal system, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplemental area and the left caudate. Methods: We employed longitudinal neuroimaging and functional connectivity methods in a small group of multilingual children over two years. Results: We found that the dACC/preSMA is functionally influenced by changes in multilingual competence but not yet structurally adapted, while the left caudate, in a developmental stage, is influenced, adapts, and specializes due to multilingual experience. Furthermore, increases in multilingual competence strengthen connections between the dACC/preSMA, left caudate, and other structures of the cognitive control network, such as the right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. Conclusions: These findings suggest that multilingual competence impacts brain &amp;amp;ldquo;adaptation&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;specialization&amp;amp;rdquo; during childhood. The results may provide insights and guide future research on experience-expectant and experience-dependent brain plasticity to explain the &amp;amp;ldquo;interaction&amp;amp;rdquo; between multilingualism and neurodevelopment.</p>

                <p>Status epilepticus (SE) links to high mortality and morbidity. Considering the neuroprotective property of baicalein (BA), we investigated its effects on post-SE neuronal injury via the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. Mice were subjected to SE modeling and BA interference, with seizure severity and learning and memory abilities evaluated. The histological changes, neurological injury and neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-positive cell number in hippocampal CA1 region, and cell death were assessed. Levels of the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)/gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pathway-related proteins, inflammatory factors, and Iba-1 + NLRP3+ and Iba-1 + GSDMD-N+ cells were determined. BA ameliorated post-SE cognitive dysfunction and neuronal injury in mice, as evidenced by shortened escape latency, increased number of crossing the target quadrant within 60&nbsp;s and the time staying in the target quadrant, alleviated hippocampal damage, increased viable cell number, decreased neuronal injury, and increased NSE-positive cells. Mechanistically, BA repressed microglial pyroptosis, reduced inflammatory factor release, and attenuated neuronal injury by inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. The NLRP3 inhibitor exerted similar effects as BA on SE mice, while the NLRP3 activator partially reversed BA-improved post-SE neuronal injury in mice. Conjointly, BA reduced microglial pyroptosis in hippocampal CA1 area by inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway, thereby ameliorating post-SE neuronal injury in mice.</p>

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction A major obstacle in understanding the relationship between diet and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) lies in the subjectivity and the bias in traditional dietary intake assessment methods. Food diaries, 24-hour food recall interviews, and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) result in under- and over-reporting of nutrient and energy intake, compromising the accuracy of studies linking diet to NCDs. The emergence of image classification technology has facilitated a new approach to dietary intake assessment which addresses the subjective limitations associated with traditional self-reporting methods. Furthermore, a need to integrate multi-omics and advanced health analyses to comprehensively characterise NCD risk presents an opportunity to combine a range of technologies to better understand diet-induced NCD. Method This observational study will adopt an enhanced surveillance method, whereby we will utilise wearable cameras and activity monitors to record dietary intake, physical activity, and sleep. Participants will wear these for 3 separate one-week periods at home (with a 2 and 3-week break in between each period). At the end of each monitoring period, participants will attend a study visit at the clinical research facility, where they will undergo body composition assessments, as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and autonomic nervous system health analysis using state-of-the-art technologies that measure Advanced Glycation End products (AGE) and accelerated photoplethysmography (APG). At the end of the first and last monitoring period, participants will also provide blood, urine, stool, and breath samples, and an in-depth interview will also be conducted during the final visit to assess participants’ perceptions towards the novel technologies. The study parameters will be integrated to advance our insights into how diet intricately influences the mechanisms underlying NCDs.

                Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Additionally, advancements in long-read RNA sequencing are expected to drive the evolution of differential splicing tools, reducing the need for isoform deconvolution and prompting further innovation.

                <p>by José María Salazar Campos, Lena F. Burbulla, Sarah Jäkel</p>

The major pathological feature of Parkinson ‘s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease and most common movement disorder, is the predominant degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a part of the midbrain. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms of the origin of the disease remain unknown. While the disease was initially viewed as a purely neuronal disorder, results from single-cell transcriptomics have suggested that oligodendrocytes may play an important role in the early stages of Parkinson’s. Although these findings are of high relevance, particularly to the search for effective disease-modifying therapies, the actual functional role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson’s disease remains highly speculative and requires a concerted scientific effort to be better understood. This Unsolved Mystery discusses the limited understanding of oligodendrocytes in PD, highlighting unresolved questions regarding functional changes in oligodendroglia, the role of myelin in nigral dopaminergic neurons, the impact of the toxic environment, and the aggregation of alpha-synuclein within oligodendrocytes.

                <p>by Jeff Maltas, Anh Huynh, Kevin B. Wood</p>

As failure rates for traditional antimicrobial therapies escalate, recent focus has shifted to evolution-based therapies to slow resistance. Collateral sensitivity—the increased susceptibility to one drug associated with evolved resistance to a different drug—offers a potentially exploitable evolutionary constraint, but the manner in which collateral effects emerge over time is not well understood. Here, we use laboratory evolution in the opportunistic pathogen <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> to phenotypically characterize collateral profiles through evolutionary time. Specifically, we measure collateral profiles for 400 strain-antibiotic combinations over the course of 4 evolutionary time points as strains are selected in increasing concentrations of antibiotic. We find that at a global level—when results from all drugs are combined—collateral resistance dominates during early phases of adaptation, when resistance to the selecting drug is lower, while collateral sensitivity becomes increasingly likely with further selection. At the level of individual populations; however, the trends are idiosyncratic; for example, the frequency of collateral sensitivity to ceftriaxone increases over time in isolates selected by linezolid but decreases in isolates selected by ciprofloxacin. We then show experimentally how dynamic collateral sensitivity relationships can lead to time-dependent dosing windows that depend on finely timed switching between drugs. Finally, we develop a stochastic mathematical model based on a Markov decision process consistent with observed dynamic collateral profiles to show measurements across time are required to optimally constrain antibiotic resistance.

                <p>by Weifeng Dai, Tian Wang, Yang Li, Yi Yang, Yange Zhang, Yujie Wu, Tingting Zhou, Hongbo Yu, Liang Li, Yizheng Wang, Gang Wang, Dajun Xing</p>

Sensitivity to motion direction is a feature of visual neurons that is essential for motion perception. Recent studies have suggested that direction selectivity is re-established at multiple stages throughout the visual hierarchy, which contradicts the traditional assumption that direction selectivity in later stages largely derives from that in earlier stages. By recording laminar responses in areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats of both sexes, we aimed to understand how direction selectivity is processed and relayed across 2 successive stages: the input layers and the output layers within the early visual cortices. We found a strong relationship between the strength of direction selectivity in the output layers and the input layers, as well as the preservation of preferred directions across the input and output layers. Moreover, direction selectivity was enhanced in the output layers compared to the input layers, with the response strength maintained in the preferred direction but reduced in other directions and under blank stimuli. We identified a direction-tuned gain mechanism for interlaminar signal transmission, which likely originated from both feedforward connections across the input and output layers and recurrent connections within the output layers. This direction-tuned gain, coupled with nonlinearity, contributed to the enhanced direction selectivity in the output layers. Our findings suggest that direction selectivity in later cortical stages partially inherits characteristics from earlier cortical stages and is further refined by intracortical connections.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Interneurons (INs) play a crucial role in the regulation of neural activity within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region critically involved in executive functions and behavioral control. In recent preclinical studies, dysregulation of INs in the mPFC has been implicated in the pathophysiology of substance use disorder, characterized by vulnerability to chronic drug use. Here, we explore the diversity of mPFC INs and their connectivity and roles in vulnerability to addiction. We also discuss how these INs change over time with drug exposure. Finally, we focus on noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic approach for targeting INs in substance use disorder, highlighting its potential to restore neural circuits.

                Introduction Fluimucil, also known as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has been used as a medicinal drug for treating Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Recent research has shown NAC’s potential as a neuroprotective agent, preventing oxidative damage and promoting neurodegenerative treatment. This study conducted bibliometric analysis of articles related to NAC use, identifying research trends, current trends, and correlations between research and institutions. The findings can help identify unpublished research and guide future research strategies. This research not only provides public interest in NAC research but also offers valuable insights for future research. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords fluimucil, nac, n-acetylcystein, and neuroprotective. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are Documents by Year, Documents by Author, Documents by Affiliations, Documents by country or territory, Documents by funding sponsor, Factorial Map Of The Documents With The Highest Contributes, Documents by Subject Area, Network Visualization, Overlay visualization of scopus database using Vosviewer, Density Visualization, Thematic Map, and Qualitative Analysis. Conclusions Research on the neuroprotective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or fluimucil has several limitations and strengths. It uses quantitative and qualitative analysis to identify research trends and mechanisms of NAC action. However, the data may be biased and the methodology may differ. The study has significant potential for future research, particularly in treating neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson and Alzheimer. It also contributes to the understanding of NAC mechanisms.

                Background Cervical spondylosis is the common degenerative disease of the vertebrae in adults which can lead to change in sagittal alignment of cervical spine. Radiograph and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used imaging modalities for measuring the sagittal parameters. However sagittal parameters measured using radiograph and MRI can be influence by patient positioning and imaging technique. The study aims to compare sagittal parameters measured using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and radiograph in cervical spondylosis patients. Methods The study was done retrospectively. 77 patients who underwent both MRI and radiograph were included in the study. The sagittal parameters such as Neck Tilt (NT), T1 slope (T1S), thoracic inlet angle (TIA), C2-C7 angle (C2-C7A) and C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (C2-C7 SVA) were measured on sagittal MRI and lateral cervical spine radiograph. Paired t-test was used to compare cervical sagittal measurements between MRI and radiography. Results The cervical sagittal parameters such as NT, T1S, TIA and C2-7 SVA showed significant difference between MRI and radiograph (p < 0.05). But C2-C7A did not show significant difference (p > 0.05) Conclusion The study concludes that MRI cannot be used as an alternative to cervical spine radiograph in spondylosis patient for measuring the sagittal balance as there was significant difference between sagittal parameters except C2-C7 A.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-44/v1?src=rss">Exploring the clinical utility of postural outcome tools for back and neck pain clinical outcomes: a systematic scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The role of posture in spinal pain is unclear which might be linked to characteristics of postural outcome measures. This systematic scoping review mapped the clinical utility of postural outcome tools for spinal pain. Following Joanna Briggs Institute framework, twelve bibliographic databases were searched until 8th August 2023. Article selection, characterisation/mapping and synthesis using qualitative content analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. Clinical utility was defined by psychometric and clinimetric criteria. 85 eligible studies were identified from 89 publications. Twenty-eight distinct postural outcome tools plus bespoke measures were identified. Most tools were sophisticated computer-based electronic devices or complex time-consuming questionnaires, with limited applicability in non-occupational settings. Clinical utility domains most achieved were construct validity and inter/intra-rater reliability. Tools being underpinned by the biopsychosocial model of pain, sensitivity to clinical change, and predictive validity were the least achieved. Tools had limited clinical utility and were based on postural-structural-biomechanical pain model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-43/v1?src=rss">Income-Based analysis of health security in Western Asia through an integrated GHSI, MCDM, and Clustering Model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives Infectious diseases present significant challenges to global health security in contemporary, interconnected global environments. This study aimed to evaluate and compare health security performance in Western Asia (WA), with a focus on income group-based disparities and region-specific insights. Methods This study utilized the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) to assess health security across 17 WA countries categorized by income level. Health security indicators for 2019 and 2021 were analyzed using the D-CRITIC method to determine the relative importance of each indicator (Global Health Security Index, 2021): https://ghsindex.org/report-model/). A combined D-CRITIC-CoCoSo framework was employed to rank the countries, followed by K-means clustering for grading. The study also investigated correlations between financial allocation’s indicators and health security outcomes using Spearman’s rank correlation. A comparative analysis elucidated regional disparities across income categories. Results This study highlights WA’s progress in health security by prioritizing foundational health systems, detection/reporting, rapid response, and risk management. From 2019 to 2021, priorities varied by income group, with high-income countries focusing on detection, upper-middle-income countries focusing on risk environments, and low-income countries focusing on prevention. While some nations demonstrated improvement, others, such as Armenia, experienced decline, revealing persistent vulnerabilities. This study revealed significant variability in health security capacity, with both progress and setbacks among countries in different clusters. High- and upper-middle-income countries, such as Qatar and Georgia, leverage investments and international partnerships to improve their rankings, while conflict-affected, low-resource countries, including Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, face stagnation or decline. Strong correlations were observed between financial resource allocation indicators and health performance. Higher investments in countries like Armenia and Georgia led to significantly improved health outcomes, while minimal spending in Syria and Yemen weakened their resilience to health threats. Conclusion Disparities in health resilience persist, underscoring the need for equitable resource allocation and regional cooperation to enhance public health security.
