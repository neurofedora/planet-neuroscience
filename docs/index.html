	<p>The potential for the misdiagnosis of giftedness as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been well documented, as has the clinical diagnostic profile of individuals with both giftedness and ADHD. This study aimed to examine parents&amp;amp;rsquo; and teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; responses to the Conners 3 behavioral rating scale of gifted students with ADHD compared to gifted students without ADHD and non-gifted students with ADHD. Ninety-two children aged 6 to 12 years were included in the study. On the basis of clinical assessments utilizing the K-SADS, the WISC-V, and other neurocognitive tests, the students were split into three groups: gifted/ADHD (n = 35), ADHD (n = 35), and gifted (n = 22). The results revealed that mothers&amp;amp;rsquo;, fathers&amp;amp;rsquo;, and teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; responses to the Conners 3 rating scale distinguished well between the gifted group and the other two groups, but not between the gifted/ADHD and ADHD groups. The learning difficulties observed by teachers was the most significant element that distinguished gifted/ADHD students from non-gifted ADHD students. Other results indicated that mothers and fathers reported more inattention problems in their gifted/ADHD children than teachers. Additionally, mothers tended to observe more learning and executive function problems in their gifted/ADHD children than teachers did. These findings highlight the importance of multiple informants complementing each other in the assessment process for ADHD in a gifted context to counteract the masking effect between giftedness and ADHD.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep is considered an essential component related to physiological and psychological recovery in athletes and particularly in basketball, given the impact of condensed travel and game schedules on player health and performance. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to examine studies published to date on sleep and basketball performance. Methodology: All scientific articles that reported a relationship between sleep and its possible impact on performance in basketball are included. The research processes followed the PRISMA criteria, and the relevant articles were extracted (PubMed, WOS, Scopus) as of December 31, 2021. Results: Twenty-eight articles were selected for inclusion and data extraction, with 27 demonstrating that sleep is a vital component in the recovery of basketball players and their corresponding on-court performance. Three central themes that we identified: (1) the quality and extension of sleep (the better quality and more extension of sleep, better performance and lower probability of injury); (2) influence of the players circadian rhythm (travel and game scheduling do not currently facilitate or take this into account); and (3) higher training loads and/or increased stress may jeopardize a subsequent good night&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep, which should be taken into account when scheduling practices and workouts. Conclusion: The current systematic review regarding sleep and basketball performance and highlights that there is a strong relationship between both variables. Collectively, the evidence supports the critical influence of sleep on player recovery and basketball performance and risk for injury.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) on the primary motor cortex (M1) has been reported to be effective in fibromyalgia (FM). Our previous works have shown hypometabolism of motor networks in FM using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), which could contribute to pain symptoms. To investigate if a single Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) session can restore the reduced metabolism expected in FM patients, we compared metabolic activity in FM patients and controls during a finger-tapping task in basal condition, sham condition, and under anodal TDCS on M1. During the finger tapping task, a continuous wave 20 channel fNIRS system was placed across the bilateral central-frontal areas in 22 healthy controls and 54 FM patients. Subjects were randomly assigned to real TDCS or sham stimulation. The finger-tapping slowness did not change after real and sham stimulation. After real TDCS stimulation, FM patients showed an increased activation of cortical motor regions (t-statistic = &amp;amp;minus;2.5246, p-value = 0.0125 for the stimulated hemisphere and t-statistic = &amp;amp;minus;4.6638, p-value = 0.0001 for the non-stimulated hemisphere). The basal differences between FM and controls reverted after real TDCS, while this effect was not observed for sham stimulation. A single TDCS session of the cortical motor network seemed able to restore basic cortical hypometabolism in FM patients. Further studies could clarify the long-term effect of M1 stimulation on cortical metabolism, and its relevance in pain processing and clinical features.</p>

	<p>Children and youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) display difficulties recognizing and interacting with behavioral expressions of emotion, a deficit that makes social interaction problematic. Social skills training is foundational to the treatment of ASD, yet this intervention is costly, time-consuming, lacks objectivity, and is difficult to deliver in real-world settings. This pilot project investigated the use of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) headset to simulate real-world social interactions for children/youth with ASD. The primary objective was to describe gaze fixation and visual search behaviors during the simulated activity. Ten participants were enrolled and completed one social-skills training session in the IVR. The results demonstrate differential patterns between participants with mild, moderate, and severe ASD in the location and duration of gaze fixation as well as the patterns of visual searching. Although the results are preliminary, these differences may shed light on phenotypes within the continuum of ASD. Additionally, there may be value in quantifying gaze and visual search behaviors as an objective metric of interventional effectiveness for social-skills training therapy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of beliefs, knowledge, and attitude on herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in Indonesia [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicines are gaining a greater degree of popularity as complementary and alternative medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, there is a lack of data concerning the rationale for and factors influencing their use. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based online study involving 1,621 participants was conducted to explore the effects of magical health beliefs, holistic health beliefs, knowledge, and pro- complementary alternative medicine (CAM) attitudes on herbal medicine use in the Indonesian population. Results: Logistic regression findings showed that knowledge about herbal medicines was independently and positively associated with herbal medicine use to a greater extent than herbal medicine non-use (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval; CI = 1.16 to 1.24). The participants who used herbal medicines had a greater magical health belief score than herbal medicine non-users, with AOR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.06. Moreover, holistic health beliefs and pro-CAM attitudes were also found to be independently associated with herbal medicine use. Conclusion: Magical health beliefs, holistic health belief, knowledge, and attitudes are key factor in determining the herbal medicine use. Our findings offer crucial implications for health policymakers to encourage the use of herbal medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determining staffing needs for improving primary health care service delivery in Kaduna State, Nigeria [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The equitable distribution of a skilled health workforce is critical to health service delivery. Kaduna state has taken significant steps to revamp the primary health care system to ensure access to health care for its populace. However, these investments are yet to yield the desired outcomes due to health workforce shortages and the inequitable distribution of those available. Methods: A Workload Indicator for Staffing Need (WISN) study was conducted at Kaduna state's primary health care level. The study focused on estimating staffing requirements; Nurses/Midwives and Community Health Worker practitioners, Community Health Officers, Community Health Extension Workers, and Junior Community Health Extension Workers in all government-prioritised primary health care facilities. A total of ten focal primary health care facilities in Kaduna North Local Government Area (LGA) were included in the study. Results: Findings from the study revealed a shortage of Nurses/Midwives and Community Health Workers across the study facilities. For the Nurse/Midwife staffing category, nine of the ten PHCs have a WISN ratio < 1, indicating that the number of staff in the Nurse/Midwife category is insufficient to cope with the workload. In two of the ten primary health care facilities, there is an excess in the number of CHWs available; a WISN ratio > 1 was calculated. Conclusion: The WISN study highlights staffing needs in Kaduna State's government-prioritised primary health care facilities. This evidence establishes the basis for applying an evidence-based approach to determining staffing needs across the primary health care sector in the State to guide workforce planning strategies and future investments in the health sector. The World Health Organisation (WHO) WISN tool is useful for estimating staffing needs required to cope with workload pressures, particularly in a resource-constrained environment like Kaduna State.

                Background: Wound-healing in the skin is one mechanism that maintains homeostasis. Ineffective skin wound healing is a significant health problem that ultimately causes morbidity and mortality. The process of wound healing using traditional medicine has a good effect with various mechanisms of action. This review aims to provide insights related to the wound-healing mechanisms of several plants in HaCat cells. Methods: The literature study method was used from primary and secondary libraries. The library search was conducted using online-based library search instruments from 1988 to 2021, such as NCBI-PubMed, Google Scholar, and Elsevier. Results: The wound-healing mechanism includes processes that restore skin integrity through four stages: hemostasis, inflammation, multiplication, and remodeling. Many plants have been studied to have activity in wound healing by various mechanisms. Conclusions: Several compounds in plants have shown the activity in wound healing in keratinocyte cells  by various mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Outward investment of Portuguese small and medium enterprises in the Central and Eastern European countries: motivations and challenges [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper identifies the determinant factors of Portuguese investment in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. We assume that investment abroad is motivated by business opportunities, and the quality-price ratio of the workforce. Methods: To this end, we used a qualitative methodology composed of 6 case studies, based on interviews and surveys with the managers of the Portuguese firms investing in those three economies. Results: Despite the business opportunities, Portuguese investment directed towards these economies is negligible, due, in part, to the geographic and cultural distance. However, the economic and political stability, combined with market size and growth potential are undeniable attraction factors for Portuguese investors. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), due to their flexible conditions that allow changes in the activity, and the strong trend towards outsourcing, to the detriment of the manufacturing industry, are the primary focus of international investment. This trend, although common to several sectors, has shown greater dynamism in the banking and financial sector. Conclusions: The results suggest market-oriented investments aiming at growth and expansion.  The vast Polish market is the one that most attracted Portuguese investors. The hybrid feature of some strategies can align with the cautious attitude towards the investment translated into cooperation agreements with financial institutions for funding, the market learning process, and the training of the personnel. The anticipation of the installation over potential competitors, the experience in production and international markets, the price-quality ratio, the capacity of product adaptation and the design were considered important sources of competitive advantage that motivated the investment. The greatest difficulties during this process were language and the complexity of legislation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 and the role of close contact in transmission: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been reported to be associated with close contact with infected individuals. However, the mechanistic pathway for transmission in close contact settings is unclear. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies assessing the role of close contact in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, PubMed and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on the QUADAS-2 criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We included 278 studies: 258 primary studies and 20 systematic reviews. The settings for primary studies were predominantly in home/quarantine facilities (39.5%) and acute care hospitals (12%). The overall reporting quality of the studies was low-to-moderate. There was significant heterogeneity in design and methodology. The frequency of attack rates (PCR testing) varied between 2.1-75%; attack rates were highest in prison and wedding venues, and in households. The frequency of secondary attack rates was 0.3-100% with rates highest in home/quarantine settings. Three studies showed no transmission if the index case was a recurrent infection. Viral culture was performed in four studies of which three found replication-competent virus; culture results were negative where index cases had recurrent infections. Eighteen studies performed genomic sequencing with phylogenetic analysis – the completeness of genomic similarity ranged from 77-100%. Findings from systematic reviews showed that children were significantly less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 and household contact was associated with a significantly increased risk of infection. Conclusions: The evidence from published studies demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in close contact settings. The risk of transmission is greater in household contacts. There was a wide variation in methodology. Standardized guidelines for reporting transmission in close contact settings should be developed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Saudi Arabian students in postgraduate dental programs: Investigating factors associated with burnout [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout related to emotional and physical study or work demands affects an individual’s performance and wellbeing. This study focused on Saudi Arabian dental residents studying in the United States and the United Kingdom who are faced with many challenges in the pursuit of a higher education degree.  Methods: A survey including demographic and Maslach Burnout inventory (MBI) questions was distributed to assess this population’s level of burnout. The MBI has been widely used in the literature to assess three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DEP), and (diminished) personal accomplishment (PA). Potential predictors of burnout level, tested for statistical significance, included: (1) country (US vs UK), (2) hours of work, (3) sponsorship status, (4) marital status (5) gender, and (6) prior work experience.  Results: The number of participants from the UK was 29 and from the US was 64 (n=93). The total number of participants who completed the survey was 87. Using multiple regression analyses, those found to predict EE included hours of work, sponsorship status, and gender. Only gender was found to predict PA. None of the variables were predictive of DEP. Moreover, after controlling for the demographic variables, the country where studying did not help account for the level of burnout.  Conclusion: In the literature, burnout was found to be prevalent among dental postgraduate students. This study suggests that Saudi Arabian dental residents experience high burnout due to emotional exhaustion when compared to other medical professionals. Moreover, Female residents are more likely to report experiencing burnout than their male counterparts. Limitations of the study, implications for practice and suggestions for further research are offered in the discussion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring a spatial code of cell-cell interactions across a whole animal body</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erick Armingol, Abbas Ghaddar, Chintan J. Joshi, Hratch Baghdassarian, Isaac Shamie, Jason Chan, Hsuan-Lin Her, Samuel Berhanu, Anushka Dar, Fabiola Rodriguez-Armstrong, Olivia Yang, Eyleen J. O’Rourke, Nathan E. Lewis</p>

Cell-cell interactions shape cellular function and ultimately organismal phenotype. Interacting cells can sense their mutual distance using combinations of ligand-receptor pairs, suggesting the existence of a spatial code, i.e., signals encoding spatial properties of cellular organization. However, this code driving and sustaining the spatial organization of cells remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions from the transcriptomes of the cell types across the whole body of a multicellular organism. As core of this framework, we introduce our tool <i>cell2cell</i>, which uses the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs to compute the potential for intercellular interactions, and we test it across the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>’ body. Leveraging a 3D atlas of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>’ cells, we also implement a genetic algorithm to identify the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells across the whole body. Validating the spatial code extracted with this strategy, the resulting intercellular distances are negatively correlated with the inferred cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, for selected cell-cell and ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm the communicatory behavior inferred with <i>cell2cell</i> and the genetic algorithm. Thus, our framework helps identify a code that predicts the spatial organization of cells across a whole-animal body.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Soft disorder modulates the assembly path of protein complexes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Beatriz Seoane, Alessandra Carbone</p>

The relationship between interactions, flexibility and disorder in proteins has been explored from many angles over the years: folding upon binding, flexibility of the core relative to the periphery, entropy changes, etc. In this work, we provide statistical evidence for the involvement of highly mobile and disordered regions in complex assembly. We ordered the entire set of X-ray crystallographic structures in the Protein Data Bank into hierarchies of progressive interactions involving identical or very similar protein chains, yielding 40205 hierarchies of protein complexes with increasing numbers of partners. We then examine them as proxies for the assembly pathways. Using this database, we show that upon oligomerisation, the new interfaces tend to be observed at residues that were characterised as softly disordered (flexible, amorphous or missing residues) in the complexes preceding them in the hierarchy. We also rule out the possibility that this correlation is just a surface effect by restricting the analysis to residues on the surface of the complexes. Interestingly, we find that the location of soft disordered residues in the sequence changes as the number of partners increases. Our results show that there is a general mechanism for protein assembly that involves soft disorder and modulates the way protein complexes are assembled. This work highlights the difficulty of predicting the structure of large protein complexes from sequence and emphasises the importance of linking predictors of soft disorder to the next generation of predictors of complex structure. Finally, we investigate the relationship between the Alphafold2’s confidence metric pLDDT for structure prediction in unbound versus bound structures, and soft disorder. We show a strong correlation between Alphafold2 low confidence residues and the union of all regions of soft disorder observed in the hierarchy. This paves the way for using the pLDDT metric as a proxy for predicting interfaces and assembly paths.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational analysis of 5-fluorouracil anti-tumor activity in colon cancer using a mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chenhui Ma, Alex Almasan, Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu</p>

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a standard chemotherapeutic agent to treat solid cancers such as breast, colon, head, and neck. Computational modeling plays an essential role in predicting the outcome of chemotherapy and developing optimal dosing strategies. We developed an integrated mechanistic pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model examining the influence of 5-FU, as an S-phase specific double-strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, on tumor proliferation. The proposed mechanistic PK/PD model simulates the dynamics of critical intermediate components and provides the accurate tumor response prediction. The integrated model is composed of PK, cellular, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) sub-models, quantitatively capturing the essential drug-related physiological processes. In the cellular model, thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition, resultant deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool imbalance, and DSB induction are considered, as well as 5-FU incorporation into RNA and DNA. The amount of 5-FU anabolites and DSBs were modeled to drive the kinetics of the pharmacological tumor response. Model parameters were estimated by fitting to literature data. Our simulation results successfully describe the kinetics of the intermediates regulating the 5-FU cytotoxic events and the pattern of tumor suppression. The comprehensive model simulated the tumor volume change under various dose regimens, and its generalizability was attested by comparing it with literature data. The potential causes of the tumor resistance to 5-FU are also investigated through Monte Carlo analysis. The simulation of various dosage regimens helps quantify the relationship between treatment protocols and chemotherapy potency, which will lead to the development of efficacy optimization.

Scientific research increasingly relies on open source software (OSS). Funding OSS development requires intentional focus on issues of scholarly credit, unique forms of labor, maintenance, governance, and inclusive community-building. Such issues cut across different scientific disciplines that make them of interest to a variety of funders and institutions but may present challenges in understanding generalized needs. Here we present 10 simple rules for investing in scientific OSS and the teams who build and maintain it.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A neurocomputational theory of action regulation predicts motor behavior in neurotypical individuals and patients with Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shan Zhong, Jeong Woo Choi, Nadia G. Hashoush, Diana Babayan, Mahsa Malekmohammadi, Nader Pouratian, Vassilios Christopoulos</p>

Surviving in an uncertain environment requires not only the ability to select the best action, but also the flexibility to withhold inappropriate actions when the environmental conditions change. Although selecting and withholding actions have been extensively studied in both human and animals, there is still lack of consensus on the mechanism underlying these action regulation functions, and more importantly, how they inter-relate. A critical gap impeding progress is the lack of a computational theory that will integrate the mechanisms of action regulation into a unified framework. The current study aims to advance our understanding by developing a neurodynamical computational theory that models the mechanism of action regulation that involves suppressing responses, and predicts how disruption of this mechanism can lead to motor deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. We tested the model predictions in neurotypical individuals and PD patients in three behavioral tasks that involve free action selection between two opposed directions, action selection in the presence of conflicting information and abandoning an ongoing action when a stop signal is presented. Our results and theory suggest an integrated mechanism of action regulation that affects both action initiation and inhibition. When this mechanism is disrupted, motor behavior is affected, leading to longer reaction times and higher error rates in action inhibition.

                <p>by Lotus A. Lofgren, Brandon S. Ross, Robert A. Cramer, Jason E. Stajich</p>

<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is a deadly agent of human fungal disease where virulence heterogeneity is thought to be at least partially structured by genetic variation between strains. While population genomic analyses based on reference genome alignments offer valuable insights into how gene variants are distributed across populations, these approaches fail to capture intraspecific variation in genes absent from the reference genome. Pan-genomic analyses based on de novo assemblies offer a promising alternative to reference-based genomics with the potential to address the full genetic repertoire of a species. Here, we evaluate 260 genome sequences of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> including 62 newly sequenced strains, using a combination of population genomics, phylogenomics, and pan-genomics. Our results offer a high-resolution assessment of population structure and recombination frequency, phylogenetically structured gene presence–absence variation, evidence for metabolic specificity, and the distribution of putative antifungal resistance genes. Although <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> disperses primarily via asexual conidia, we identified extraordinarily high levels of recombination with the lowest linkage disequilibrium decay value reported for any fungal species to date. We provide evidence for 3 primary populations of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i>, with recombination occurring only rarely between populations and often within them. These 3 populations are structured by both gene variation and distinct patterns of gene presence–absence with unique suites of accessory genes present exclusively in each clade. Accessory genes displayed functional enrichment for nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism suggesting that populations may be stratified by environmental niche specialization. Similarly, the distribution of antifungal resistance genes and resistance alleles were often structured by phylogeny. Altogether, the pan-genome of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> represents one of the largest fungal pan-genomes reported to date including many genes unrepresented in the Af293 reference genome. These results highlight the inadequacy of relying on a single-reference genome-based approach for evaluating intraspecific variation and the power of combined genomic approaches to elucidate population structure, genetic diversity, and putative ecological drivers of clinically relevant fungi.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A qualitative study of the barriers to using blinding in in vivo experiments and suggestions for improvement</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natasha A. Karp, Esther J. Pearl, Emma J. Stringer, Chris Barkus, Jane Coates Ulrichsen, Nathalie Percie du Sert</p>

In animal experiments, blinding (also known as masking) is a methodological strategy to reduce the risk that scientists, animal care staff, or other staff involved in the research may consciously or subconsciously influence the outcome. Lack of masking has been shown to correlate with an overestimation of treatment efficacy and false positive findings. We conducted exploratory interviews across academic and a commercial setting to discuss the implementation of masking at four stages of the experiment: during allocation and intervention, during the conduct of the experiment, during the outcome assessment, and during the data analysis. The objective was to explore the awareness, engagement, perceptions, and the barriers to implementing masking in animal experiments. We conducted multiple interviews, to explore 30 different experiments, and found examples of excellent practice but also areas where masking was rarely implemented. Significant barriers arose from the operational and informatic systems implemented. These systems have prioritised the management of welfare without considering how to allow researchers to use masking in their experiments. For some experiments, there was a conflict between the management of welfare for an individual animal versus delivering a robust experiment where all animals are treated in the same manner. We identified other challenges related to the level of knowledge on the purpose of masking or the implementation and the work culture. The exploration of these issues provides insight into how we, as a community, can identify the most significant barriers in a given research environment. Here, we offer practical solutions to enable researchers to implement masking as standard. To move forward, we need both the individual scientists to embrace the use of masking and the facility managers and institutes to engage and provide a framework that supports the scientists.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Human striatal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells recapitulate striatal development and compartments</a></h4>

The striatum links neuronal circuits in the human brain, and its malfunction causes neuronal disorders such as Huntington’s disease (HD). A human striatum model that recapitulates fetal striatal development is vital to decoding the pathogenesis of striatum-related neurological disorders and developing therapeutic strategies. Here, we developed a method to construct human striatal organoids (hStrOs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including hStrOs-derived assembloids. Our hStrOs partially replicated the fetal striatum and formed striosome and matrix-like compartments in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct striatal lineages in hStrOs, diverging from dorsal forebrain fate. Using hStrOs-derived assembloids, we replicated the striatal targeting projections from different brain parts. Furthermore, hStrOs can serve as hosts for striatal neuronal allografts to test allograft neuronal survival and functional integration. Our hStrOs are suitable for studying striatal development and related disorders, characterizing the neural circuitry between different brain regions, and testing therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">PTRN-1 (CAMSAP) and NOCA-2 (NINEIN) are required for microtubule polarity in Caenorhabditis elegans dendrites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Liu He, Lotte van Beem, Berend Snel, Casper C. Hoogenraad, Martin Harterink</p>

The neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton is key to establish axon-dendrite polarity. Dendrites are characterized by the presence of minus-end out microtubules. However, the mechanisms that organize these microtubules with the correct orientation are still poorly understood. Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model system for microtubule organization, we characterized the role of 2 microtubule minus-end related proteins in this process, the microtubule minus-end stabilizing protein calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated <i>protein</i> (CAMSAP/PTRN-1), and the NINEIN homologue, NOCA-2 (noncentrosomal microtubule array). We found that CAMSAP and NINEIN function in parallel to mediate microtubule organization in dendrites. During dendrite outgrowth, RAB-11-positive vesicles localized to the dendrite tip to nucleate microtubules and function as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC). In the absence of either CAMSAP or NINEIN, we observed a low penetrance MTOC vesicles mislocalization to the cell body, and a nearly fully penetrant phenotype in double mutant animals. This suggests that both proteins are important for localizing the MTOC vesicles to the growing dendrite tip to organize microtubules minus-end out. Whereas NINEIN localizes to the MTOC vesicles where it is important for the recruitment of the microtubule nucleator γ-tubulin, CAMSAP localizes around the MTOC vesicles and is cotranslocated forward with the MTOC vesicles upon dendritic growth. Together, these results indicate that microtubule nucleation from the MTOC vesicles and microtubule stabilization are both important to localize the MTOC vesicles distally to organize dendritic microtubules minus-end out.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cbln1 regulates axon growth and guidance in multiple neural regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peng Han, Yuanchu She, Zhuoxuan Yang, Mengru Zhuang, Qingjun Wang, Xiaopeng Luo, Chaoqun Yin, Junda Zhu, Samie R. Jaffrey, Sheng-Jian Ji</p>

The accurate construction of neural circuits requires the precise control of axon growth and guidance, which is regulated by multiple growth and guidance cues during early nervous system development. It is generally thought that the growth and guidance cues that control the major steps of axon development have been defined. Here, we describe cerebellin-1 (Cbln1) as a novel cue that controls diverse aspects of axon growth and guidance throughout the central nervous system (CNS) by experiments using mouse and chick embryos. Cbln1 has previously been shown to function in late neural development to influence synapse organization. Here, we find that Cbln1 has an essential role in early neural development. Cbln1 is expressed on the axons and growth cones of developing commissural neurons and functions in an autocrine manner to promote axon growth. Cbln1 is also expressed in intermediate target tissues and functions as an attractive guidance cue. We find that these functions of Cbln1 are mediated by neurexin-2 (Nrxn2), which functions as the Cbln1 receptor for axon growth and guidance. In addition to the developing spinal cord, we further show that Cbln1 functions in diverse parts of the CNS with major roles in cerebellar parallel fiber growth and retinal ganglion cell axon guidance. Despite the prevailing role of Cbln1 as a synaptic organizer, our study discovers a new and unexpected function for Cbln1 as a general axon growth and guidance cue throughout the nervous system.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Synaptic loss is an early feature of neurodegenerative disease models, and is severe in post mortem clinical studies, including frontotemporal dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiotracers that bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A enables quantification of synaptic density in vivo. This study used [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET in participants with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), testing the hypothesis that synaptic loss is severe and related to clinical severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eleven participants with clinically probable bvFTD and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Participants underwent dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and a neuropsychological battery, including the revised Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination, and INECO frontal screening. General linear models compared [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential maps and gray matter volume between groups, and assessed associations between synaptic density and clinical severity in patients. Analyses were also performed using partial volume corrected [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential from regions of interest (ROIs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with bvFTD showed severe synaptic loss compared to controls. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding was reduced bilaterally in medial and dorsolateral frontal regions, inferior frontal gyri, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, and medial temporal lobe. Synaptic loss in the frontal and cingulate regions correlated significantly with cognitive impairments. Synaptic loss was more severe than atrophy. Results from ROI-based analyses mirrored the voxelwise results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In accordance with preclinical models, and human postmortem evidence, there is widespread frontotemporal loss of synapses in symptomatic bvFTD, in proportion to severity. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET could support translational studies and experimental medicine strategies for new disease-modifying treatments for neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is associated with focal brain “tubers” and a high incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The location of brain tubers associated with autism may provide insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of ASD symptoms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We delineated tuber locations for 115 TSC participants with ASD (n = 31) and without ASD (n = 84) from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network. We tested for associations between ASD diagnosis and tuber burden within the whole brain, specific lobes, and at eight regions of interest derived from the ASD neuroimaging literature including the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and posterior parietal cortices, the inferior frontal and fusiform gyri, the superior temporal sulcus, the amygdala, and the supplemental motor area. Next, we performed an unbiased data-driven voxel-wise lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analysis. Finally, we calculated the risk of ASD associated with positive findings from the above analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were no significant ASD-related differences in tuber burden across the whole-brain, within specific lobes, or within <i>a priori</i> regions derived from the ASD literature. However, using VLSM analysis we found that tubers involving the right fusiform face area (FFA) were associated with a 3.7-fold increased risk of developing ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>While TSC is a rare cause of ASD, there is a strong association between tuber involvement of the right FFA and ASD diagnosis. This highlights a potentially causative mechanism for developing autism in TSC that may guide research into ASD symptoms more generally.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tenecteplase Improves Reperfusion Across Time in Large Vessel Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Background and Aims</h2>
<p>Tenecteplase improves reperfusion compared to alteplase in patients with large vessel occlusions. To determine whether this improvement varies across the spectrum of thrombolytic to reperfusion assessment times, we performed a comparative analysis of tenecteplase and alteplase reperfusion rates.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with large vessel occlusion and treatment with thrombolysis were pooled from the Melbourne Stroke Registry, the EXTEND-IA, and EXTEND-IA TNK trials. The primary outcome, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion, was defined as the absence of retrievable thrombus or &gt;50% reperfusion at imaging reassessment. We compared the treatment effect of tenecteplase and alteplase, accounting for thrombolytic-to-assessment as exposure times, via Poisson modelling. We compared 90-day outcomes of patients who achieved reperfusion with a thrombolytic to patients who achieved reperfusion via endovascular therapy using ordinal logistic regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 893 patients included in the primary analysis, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion was observed in 184 (21%) patients. Tenecteplase was associated with higher rates of reperfusion (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]:1.50 [95%CI:1.09-2.07], p=0.01). Findings were consistent in patient sub-groups with M1 (aIRR:1.41 [95%CI:0.93-2.14]) and M2 (aIRR:2.07 [95%CI:0.98-4.37]) occlusions. Increased thrombolytic to reperfusion assessment times were associated with reperfusion (tenecteplase: adjusted risk ratio [aRR]:1.08 per 15min [95%CI:1.04-1.13] versus alteplase: aRR:1.06 per 15min [95%CI:1.00-1.13]). No significant treatment-by-time interaction was observed (p=0.87). Reperfusion via thrombolysis was associated with improved 90-day mRS scores, (acOR:2.15 [95%CI:1.54-3.01]) compared to patients who achieved reperfusion following endovascular therapy.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Tenecteplase, compared to alteplase, increases pre-thrombectomy reperfusion, regardless of the time from administration to reperfusion assessment. Pre-thrombectomy reperfusion is associated with better clinical outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A combined panel of salivary biomarkers in de novo Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate molecular biomarkers of a-synuclein and tau aggregation, autophagy, and inflammation in the saliva of de novo Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in comparison to healthy subjects (HS), and to correlate molecular data with clinical features of PD patients, in order to establish whether abnormalities of these parameters are associated with specific clusters of de novo PD patients, and their potential diagnostic power in differentiating PD patients from HS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured total and oligomeric a-synuclein, total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, MAP-LC3beta, and TNFalpha in the saliva of 80 de novo PD patients and 62 HS, using quantitative Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Oligomeric a-synuclein, total-tau, MAP-LC3beta, and TNFalpha levels resulted significantly higher in patients with respect to HS, while no significant differences were detected for total a-synuclein or phosphorylated-tau. Phosphorylated-tau directly correlated with MAP-LC3beta, whereas it inversely correlated with TNFalpha in PD patients. An inverse correlation was detected between MAP-LC3beta and non-motor symptoms severity. Principal Component Analysis showed that molecular and clinical parameters were independent of each other in de novo PD patients. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis reported an accurate diagnostic performance of oligomeric a-synuclein and MAP-LC3beta. The diagnostic accuracy of total a-synuclein increased when it was combined with other salivary biomarkers targeting different molecular pathways.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study proposes a novel biomarker panel using saliva, a non-invasive biofluid, in de novo PD patients, with implications in understanding the molecular pathways involved in PD pathogenesis and the relevance of different molecular pathways in determining clinical PD subtypes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Three-dimensional flagella structures from animals’ closest unicellular relatives, the Choanoflagellates</a></h4>

              
                In most eukaryotic organisms, cilia and flagella perform a variety of life-sustaining roles related to environmental sensing and motility. Cryo-electron microscopy has provided considerable insight into the morphology and function of flagellar structures, but studies have been limited to less than a dozen of the millions of known eukaryotic species. Ultrastructural information is particularly lacking for unicellular organisms in the Opisthokonta clade, leaving a sizeable gap in our understanding of flagella evolution between unicellular species and multicellular metazoans (animals). Choanoflagellates are important aquatic heterotrophs, uniquely positioned within the opisthokonts as the metazoans’ closest living unicellular relatives. We performed cryo-focused ion beam milling and cryo-electron tomography on flagella from the choanoflagellate species <i>Salpingoeca rosetta</i>. We show that the axonemal dyneins, radial spokes, and central pair complex in <i>S. rosetta</i> more closely resemble metazoan structures than those of unicellular organisms from other suprakingdoms. In addition, we describe unique features of <i>S. rosetta</i> flagella, including microtubule holes, microtubule inner proteins, and the flagellar vane: a fine, net-like extension that has been notoriously difficult to visualize using other methods. Furthermore, we report barb-like structures of unknown function on the extracellular surface of the flagellar membrane. Together, our findings provide new insights into choanoflagellate biology and flagella evolution between unicellular and multicellular opisthokonts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phox2b mutation mediated by Atoh1 expression impaired respiratory rhythm and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the transcription factor <i>Phox2b</i> cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The syndrome is characterized by hypoventilation and inability to regulate breathing to maintain adequate O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2 </sub>levels. The mechanism by which CCHS impact respiratory control are incompletely understood, and even less is known about the impact of the non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (NPARM) form. Our goal was to investigate the extent by which NPARM <i>Phox2b</i> mutation affect a) respiratory rhythm; b) ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (HCVR) and hypoxia (HVR) and c) number of chemosensitive neurons in mice. We used a transgenic mouse line carrying a conditional <i>Phox2b<sup>Δ</sup><sup>8</sup></i> mutation (same found in humans with NPARM CCHS). We crossed them with <i>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></i> mice to introduce mutation in regions involved with respiratory function and central chemoreflex control. Ventilation was measured by plethysmograph during neonatal and adult life. In room air, mutation in neonates and adult did not greatly impact basal ventilation. However, <i>Phox2b<sup>Δ</sup><sup>8</sup></i>, <i>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></i> increased breath irregularity in adults. The HVR and HCVR were impaired in neonates. The HVR, but not HCVR was still partially compromised in adults. The mutation reduced the number of Phox2b<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup> expressing neurons as well as the number of fos-activated cells within the ventral parafacial region (also named retrotrapezoid region - RTN) induced by hypercapnia. Our data indicates that <i>Phox2b<sup>Δ</sup><sup>8</sup></i> mutation in <i>Atoh1</i>-expressing cells impaired RTN neurons, as well as chemoreflex under hypoxia and hypercapnia specially early in life. This study provided new evidence for mechanisms related to NPARM form of CCHS neuropathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unleashing a novel function of endonuclease G in mitochondrial genome instability</a></h4>

              
                Having its genome makes the mitochondrion a unique and semiautonomous organelle within cells. Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a double-stranded closed circular molecule of about 16 kb coding for 37 genes. Mutations, including deletions in the mitochondrial genome, can culminate in different human diseases. Mapping the deletion junctions suggests that the breakpoints are generally seen at hotspots. '9-bp deletion' (8271-8281), seen in the intergenic region of cytochrome c oxidase II/tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, is the most common mitochondrial deletion. While it is associated with several diseases like myopathy, dystonia, and hepatocellular carcinoma, it has also been used as an evolutionary marker. However, the mechanism responsible for its fragility is unclear. In the current study, we show that Endonuclease G, a mitochondrial nuclease responsible for nonspecific cleavage of nuclear DNA during apoptosis, can induce breaks at sequences associated with '9-bp deletion' when it is present on a plasmid or in the mitochondrial genome. Through a series of <i>in vitro</i> and intracellular studies, we show that Endonuclease G binds to G-quadruplex structures formed at the hotspot and induces DNA breaks. Therefore, we uncover a new role for Endonuclease G in generating mtDNA deletions, which depends on the formation of G4 DNA within the mitochondrial genome. In summary, we identify a novel property of Endonuclease G, besides its role in apoptosis and the recently described elimination of paternal mitochondria during fertilisation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phase separation of competing memories along the human hippocampal theta rhythm</a></h4>

              
                Competition between overlapping memories is considered one of the major causes of forgetting, and it is still unknown how the human brain resolves such mnemonic conflict. In the present magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we empirically tested a computational model that leverages an oscillating inhibition algorithm to minimise overlap between memories. We used a proactive interference task, where a reminder word could be associated with either a single image (non-competitive condition) or two competing images, and participants were asked to always recall the most recently learned word–image association. Time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect the reactivated content of target and competitor memories from MEG sensor patterns, and the timing of these neural reactivations was analysed relative to the phase of the dominant hippocampal 3 Hz theta oscillation. In line with our pre-registered hypotheses, target and competitor reactivations locked to different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm after several repeated recalls. Participants who behaviourally experienced lower levels of interference also showed larger phase separation between the two overlapping memories. The findings provide evidence that the temporal segregation of memories, orchestrated by slow oscillations, plays a functional role in resolving mnemonic competition by separating and prioritising relevant memories under conditions of high interference.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Insulin sensitivity is preserved in mice made obese by feeding a high starch diet</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is generally associated with insulin resistance in liver and muscle and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, however there is a population of obese people that remain insulin sensitive. Similarly, recent work suggests that mice fed high carbohydrate diets can become obese without apparent glucose intolerance. To investigate this phenomenon further, we fed mice either a high fat (Hi-F) or high starch (Hi-ST) diet and measured adiposity, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and tissue lipids compared to control mice fed a standard laboratory chow. Both Hi-ST and Hi-F mice accumulated a similar amount of fat and tissue triglyceride compared to chow-fed mice. However while Hi-F diet mice developed glucose intolerance as well as liver and muscle insulin resistance (assessed via euglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamp), obese Hi-ST mice maintained glucose tolerance and insulin action similar to lean, chow-fed controls. This preservation of insulin action despite obesity in Hi-ST mice was associated with differences in de novo lipogenesis and levels of C22:0 ceramide in liver and C18:0 ceramide in muscle. This indicates that dietary manipulation can influence insulin action independently of the level of adiposity and that the presence of specific ceramide species correlate with these differences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neonatal brain dynamic functional connectivity: impact of preterm birth and association with early childhood neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                Brain functional dynamics have been linked to emotion and cognition in mature individuals, where alterations are associated with mental ill-health and neurodevelopmental conditions (such as autism spectrum disorder). Although reliable resting-state networks have been consistently identified in neonates, little is known about the early development of dynamic brain functional connectivity and whether it is linked to later neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood. In this study we characterised dynamic functional connectivity in the first few weeks of postnatal life and evaluated whether early dynamic functional connectivity: i) changes with age in the neonatal period ii) is altered by preterm birth and iii) is associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes at 18 months. We used the Kuramoto Order Parameter as a metric of global brain synchrony and defined transient brain states (modules) using Leading Eigenvector Analysis (LEiDA) in a cohort of term-born (n=324) and preterm-born babies (n=66) scanned at term equivalent age from the developing Human Connectome Project. We assessed whether neonatal brain state features (mean synchrony, metastability, entropy, fractional occupancy, dwelling times) and state transition probabilities were associated with postmenstrual age at scan , postnatal days at scan and preterm-birth; and correlate with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, and atypical social, sensory and repetitive behaviours measured by the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT). On a global scale, preterm-born infants had lower mean synchronisation and metastability, with reduced mean synchronisation associated with higher Q-CHAT scores at 18 months of age. On a modular scale, we identified six transient states of neonatal dynamic functional connectivity: three whole-brain synchronisation states and three regional synchrony states occupying occipital, sensory-motor, and frontal regions. Mean synchrony, metastability, fractional occupancy and dwelling times of these brain states were correlated with postmenstrual age and postnatal days at scan. Preterm-born infants had increased fractional occupancy of frontal and occipital states. Higher neonatal sensory-motor synchronisation was associated with lower motor and language outcome scores at 18 months. Lower frequency of occurrence of whole-brain synchronisation states and higher frequency of occurrence of the sensory-motor state were associated with higher Q-CHAT scores at 18 months. Thus, we have shown for the first time that a dynamic landscape of brain connectivity is already established by the time of birth in the human brain. This landscape is altered by preterm birth and its profile is linked to neurodevelopmental outcomes in toddlerhood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration of event experiences to build relational knowledge in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                We investigated how the human brain integrates experiences of specific events to build general knowledge about typical event structure. We examined an episodic area important for temporal relations, anterior-lateral entorhinal cortex (alEC), and a semantic area important for action concepts, middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Participants underwent fMRI while watching sequences of novel events and recalling their temporal relations over two sessions one week apart. Across different contexts, the roles of these events could either be consistent, or conflict; integrative representations should weaken in the conflicting condition. We found integrative representations that emerged quickly in alEC, and only subsequently in MTG, which showed a significant change across sessions. Thus, alEC is important in building integrative representations early in learning and may be a gateway to semantic knowledge in MTG. We suggest that both episodic and semantic systems participate in integrating new information when it is aligned with their content specializations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semaphorin7A patterns neural circuitry in the lateral line of the zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                In a developing nervous system, axonal arbors often undergo complex rearrangements before neural circuits attain their final innervation topology. In the lateral line sensory system of the zebrafish, developing sensory axons reorganize their terminal arborization patterns to establish precise neural microcircuits around the mechanosensory hair cells. However, a quantitative understanding of the changes in the sensory arbor morphology and the regulators behind the microcircuit assembly remain enigmatic. Here, we report that Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) acts as an important mediator of these processes. Utilizing a semi-automated three-dimensional neurite tracing methodology and computational techniques, we have quantitatively analyzed the morphology of the sensory arbors in wild-type and Sema7A loss-of-function mutants. In contrast to those of wild-type animals, the sensory axons in Sema7A mutants display aberrant arborizations with diminished contacts to hair cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a secreted form of Sema7A by non-hair cells induces chemotropic guidance of sensory axons. Our findings demonstrate that Sema7A functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DNAJB6 Isoform Specific Knockdown: Therapeutic Potential for LGMDD1</a></h4>

              
                Dominant missense mutations in DNAJB6, an HSP40 co-chaperone, cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) D1. No treatments are currently available. Two isoforms exist, DNAJB6a and DNAJB6b, each with distinct localizations in muscle. Mutations reside in both isoforms, yet evidence suggests only DNAJB6b is responsible for disease pathogenesis. Mechanistic data supports either a toxic gain of function, a dominant negative mechanism, or a combination of both. Knockdown treatment strategies involving both isoforms carry risk as DNAJB6 knockout is embryonic lethal. We therefore developed an isoform specific knockdown approach using morpholinos. Selective reduction of each isoform was achieved in-vitro in primary mouse myotubes and human myoblasts, as well as in-vivo in mouse skeletal muscle. To assess isoform specific knockdown in LGMDD1, we created primary myotube cultures from a knock-in LGMDD1 mouse model. Using mass spectrometry, we identified an LGMDD1 protein signature related to protein homeostasis and myofibril structure. Selective reduction of DNAJB6b levels in LGMDD1 myotubes corrected much of the proteomic disease signature towards wild type levels. While additional in-vivo functional data is required, these findings suggest selective reduction of DNAJB6b may be a viable therapeutic target for LGMDD1.

                While there is a wealth of knowledge about core object recognition--our ability to recognize clear, high-contrast object images, how the brain accomplishes object recognition tasks under increased uncertainty remains poorly understood. We investigated the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying object recognition under increased uncertainty by combining MEG and 7 Tesla fMRI in humans during a threshold-level object recognition task. We observed an early, parallel rise of recognition-related signals across ventral visual and frontoparietal regions that preceded the emergence of category-related information. Recognition-related signals in ventral visual regions were best explained by a two-state representational format whereby brain activity bifurcated for recognized and unrecognized images. By contrast, recognition-related signals in frontoparietal regions exhibited a reduced representational space for recognized images, yet with sharper category information. These results provide a spatiotemporally resolved view of neural activity supporting object recognition under uncertainty, revealing a pattern distinct from that underlying core object recognition.

                Neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are strongly influenced by inherited genetic variation, but environmental and epigenetic factors also play key roles in the course of these diseases. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 (C9) gene is the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD. To determine the cellular alterations associated with the C9 repeat expansion, we performed single nucleus transcriptomics (snRNA-seq) and epigenomics (snATAC-seq) in postmortem samples of motor and frontal cortices from C9-ALS and C9-FTD donors. We found pervasive alterations of gene expression across multiple cortical cell types in C9-ALS, with the largest number of affected genes in astrocytes and excitatory neurons. Astrocytes increased expression of markers of activation and pathways associated with structural remodeling. Excitatory neurons in upper and deep layers increased expression of genes related to proteostasis, metabolism, and protein expression, and decreased expression of genes related to neuronal function. Epigenetic analyses revealed concordant changes in chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression in specific cell types. C9-FTD patients had a distinct pattern of changes, including loss of neurons in frontal cortex and altered expression of thousands of genes in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. Overall, these findings demonstrate a context-dependent molecular disruption in C9-ALS and C9-FTD, resulting in distinct effects across cell types, brain regions, and disease phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representational geometries reveal differential effects of response correlations on population codes in neurophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                Two sensory neurons usually display trial-by-trial response correlations given the repeated representations of an identical stimulus. The effects of such response correlations on population-level sensory coding have been the focal contention in computational neuroscience over the past few years. In the meantime, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been the leading analysis approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but the effects of response correlations in voxel populations remain underexplored. Here, instead of conventional MVPA analysis, we calculate linear Fisher information of population responses in human visual cortex and hypothetically remove response correlations between voxels. We found that voxelwise response correlations generally enhance stimulus information, a result standing in stark contrast to the detrimental effects of response correlations reported in neurophysiological literature. By voxel-encoding modeling, we further show that these two seemingly opposite effects actually can coexist. Furthermore, we use principal component analysis to decompose stimulus information in population responses onto different principal dimensions in a high representational space. Interestingly, response correlations simultaneously reduce and enhance information on information on high- and low-variance principal dimensions, respectively. The relative strength of the two antagonistic effects within the same computational framework produces the apparent discrepancy in the effect of response correlations in neuronal and voxel populations. Our results suggest that multivariate fMRI data contain rich statistical structures that are directly related to sensory information representation, and the general computational framework to analyze neuronal and voxel population responses can be applied in many types of neural measurements.

                Humans consider the parameters linked to movement goal during reaching to adjust their control strategy online. Indeed, rapid changes in target structure or disturbances interfering with their initial plan elicit rapid changes in behavior. Here, we hypothesize that these changes could result from the continuous use of a decision variable combining motor and cognitive components. We combine an optimal feedback controller with a real-time monitoring of the expected cost-to-go, which considers target- and movement-related costs, in a novel theoretical framework. This model reproduces reaching behaviors in presence of changes in the target structure occurring during movement and of online decisions to flexibly change target following external perturbations. It also predicts that the time taken to decide to select a novel goal after a perturbation depends on the amplitude of the disturbance and on the rewards of the different options, which is a direct result of the continuous monitoring of the cost-to-go. We show that this result was present in our previously collected dataset. Together our developments point towards a continuous monitoring of the cost-to-go during reaching to update control online and make efficient decisions about movement goal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-age prediction: a systematic comparison of machine learning workflows</a></h4>

              
                The difference between age predicted using anatomical brain scans and chronological age, i.e., the brain-age delta, provides a proxy for atypical aging. Various data representations and machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used for brain-age estimation. However, how these choices compare on performance criteria important for real-world applications, such as; (1) within-site accuracy, (2) cross-site generalization, (3) test-retest reliability, and (4) longitudinal consistency, remains uncharacterized. We evaluated 128 workflows consisting of 16 feature representations derived from gray matter (GM) images and eight ML algorithms with diverse inductive biases. Using four large neuroimaging databases covering the adult lifespan (total N = 2953, 18-88 years), we followed a systematic model selection procedure by sequentially applying stringent criteria. The 128 workflows showed a within-site mean absolute error (MAE) between 4.73-8.38 years, from which 32 broadly sampled workflows showed a cross-site MAE between 5.23-8.98 years. The test-retest reliability and longitudinal consistency of the top 10 workflows were comparable. The choice of feature representation and the ML algorithm both affected the performance. Specifically, voxel-wise feature spaces (smoothed and resampled), with and without principal components analysis, with non-linear and kernel-based ML algorithms performed well. Strikingly, the correlation of brain-age delta with behavioral measures disagreed between within-site and cross-site predictions. Application of the best-performing workflow on the ADNI sample showed a significantly higher brain-age delta in Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment patients. However, in the presence of age bias, the delta estimates in the diseased population varied depending on the sample used for bias correction. Taken together, brain-age shows promise, but further evaluation and improvements are needed for its real-world application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reconceptualizing the retrieval state as an internal attention state</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale brain states or distributed patterns of brain activity modulate downstream processing and behavior. Sustained attention and memory retrieval states impact subsequent memory, yet how these states relate to one another is unclear. We hypothesize that the retrieval state reflects internal attention. The alternative is that the retrieval state reflects a controlled, episodic retrieval mode, specifically engaged when intentionally accessing events situated within a spatiotemporal context. To test our hypothesis, we developed a mnemonic state classifier independently trained to measure retrieval state evidence and applied this classifier to a spatial attention task. We find that retrieval state evidence increases during delay and response intervals when participants are maintaining spatial information. Critically, retrieval state evidence is positively related to the amount of maintained spatial location information and predicts target detection reaction times. Together, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the retrieval state constitutes internal attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consciousness is indexed by analogous cortical reorganization during sleep and anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Although sleep and anesthesia are predicted to share common neural signatures of transitions into and out of unconsciousness, supportive evidence has been elusive. We identified these signatures using intracranial electroencephalography in neurosurgical patients. We applied diffusion map embedding to map cortical location into a space where proximity indicates functional similarity using a normalized connectivity ('diffusion') matrix, itself a rich source of information about network properties. During reduced consciousness, diffusion matrices exhibited decreased effective dimensionality, reflecting reduced network entropy. Furthermore, functional brain regions exhibited tighter clustering in embedding space with greater distances between regions, corresponding to decreased differentiation and functional integration. These changes were not region-specific, suggesting global network reorganization. These results strongly suggest common neural substrates for loss and recovery of consciousness during anesthesia and sleep, providing a systems-level mechanistic understanding within an intuitive geometric context and laying the foundation for evaluation of cortical state transitions in clinical settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Histone H2A monoubiquitination in the thalamus regulates cocaine effects and addiction risk</a></h4>

              
                The individual risk of developing drug addiction is highly determined by the epigenetic landscape. Chromatin remodeling regulates drug-induced transcriptional and behavioral effects and the consequent development of addictive behaviors. Several chromatin modifications in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, including histone H3 methylation, H3 and H4 acetylation, have been implicated in drug addiction. Still, the contribution of other histones and their post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as monoubiquitination is unknown. Here we found that H2A monoubiquitination in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) plays a major role in cocaine-adaptive behaviors and local cocaine-evoked transcriptional repression. Mice undergoing chronic cocaine administration showed a specific increased monoubiquitination of H2A. Furthermore, we showed that this histone PTM is controlled, in the PVT, by an interaction between melanoma-associated antigen D1 (Maged1), a scaffold protein involved in drug addiction, and USP7, a deubiquitinase. Accordingly, Maged1 specific inactivation in thalamic vGluT2 neurons, or USP7 inhibition, blocked cocaine-evoked H2A monoubiquitination and abolished cocaine locomotor sensitization. Finally, we identified genetic variations of MAGED1 and USP7 associated with modified transition to cocaine addiction and cocaine-induced aggressive behavior in human subjects. These findings identified a new epigenetic modification in a noncanonical reward pathway of the brain and a potent marker of epigenetic risk factor for drug addiction in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting Staufen 1 with antisense oligonucleotides for treating ALS and SCA2</a></h4>

              
                Staufen1 (STAU1) is a multifunctional RNA binding protein that controls mRNA degradation and subcellular localization. STAU1 interacts with the ATXN2 protein, that is polyglutamine expanded in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). We previously showed that STAU1 is elevated and aggregated in cells from SCA2 patients, cells from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, and in SCA2 and ALS mouse models. We also found that reduction of STAU1 abundance in vivo by genetic interaction improved motor behavior in an SCA2 mouse model, normalized the levels of several SCA2-related proteins, and reduced aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded ATXN2. Here we developed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) lowering STAU1 expression toward developing a therapeutic that may be effective for treating SCA2 and ALS. We performed a screen of 118 20mer phosphorothioate 2-prime-O-methoxyethyl (MOE) ASO gapmers targeting across the STAU1 mRNA coding region for lowering STAU1 expression in HEK-293 cells. ASO hits lowering STAU1 by >45 % were rescreened in SCA2 patient fibroblasts, and 10 of these were tested for lowering STAU1 abundance in vivo in a new BAC-STAU1 mouse model. This identified efficacious ASOs targeting human STAU1 in vivo that normalized autophagy marker proteins, including ASO-45 that also targets mouse Stau1. When delivered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection, ASO-45 normalized autophagy markers and abnormal mRNA abundances in cerebella of ATXN2-Q127 SCA2 mice, as well as ChAT, NeuN and cleaved caspase-3 in spinal cord of Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mice. Targeting STAU1 may be an effective strategy for treating ALS and SCA2 as well as other disorders characterized by its overabundance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-or-None Evaluation of Prediction Certainty in Autism</a></h4>

              
                The brain generates predictions to prepare for upcoming events. As life is not always 100% predictable, it also estimates a level of certainty for these predictions. Given that autistic individuals resist even small changes in everyday life, we hypothesized impaired tuning of prediction certainty in autism. To study this, EEG was recorded from adolescents and young adults with autism while they performed a probabilistic prediction task in which cue validity was parametrically manipulated. A fully predictable condition (100% cue validity) was contrasted with less predictable conditions (84, 67 and 33% cue validity). Well characterized brain potentials were examined to assess the influence of cue validity on target anticipation (contingent negative variation; CNV), the evaluation of target statistics (P3), and prediction model updating (slow wave; SW). As expected, cue validity systematically influenced the amplitudes of the CNV, P3 and SW in controls. In contrast, cue-validity effects on CNV and SW were substantially reduced in autism. This suggests that although target statistics are accurately registered in autism, as indicated by intact modulation of the P3, they are not effectively applied to generate expectations for upcoming input or model updating. Contrasting the fully predictable with the less predictable conditions, our data suggest that autistic individuals adopted an all-or-none evaluation of certainty of their environment, rather than adjusting certainty of predictions to different levels of environmental statistics. Social responsiveness scores were associated with flexibility in representing prediction certainty, suggesting that impaired representation and updating of prediction certainty may contribute to social difficulties in autism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Geometry of visual working memory information in human gaze patterns</a></h4>

              
                In decoding visual working memory information from neural signals, stimulus-dependent eye movements have been considered a confound. Here, we combined eye-tracking with representational geometry analyses to uncover this very information in miniature gaze patterns while participants (n = 41) were cued to maintain visual object orientations. Although participants were discouraged from breaking fixation via real-time feedback, small gaze shifts (< 1 degree) robustly encoded the to-be-maintained stimulus orientation, with evidence for encoding two sequentially presented orientations at the same time. While the orientation encoding upon stimulus presentation was object-specific, it changed to a more object-independent format during cued maintenance, particularly when attention had been temporarily withdrawn from the memorandum. Finally, categorical reporting biases increased after unattended storage, with indications of biased gaze geometries emerging already during the maintenance periods prior to behavioral reporting. These findings disclose a wealth of information in gaze patterns during visuospatial working memory, and suggest systematic changes in representational format when memory contents have been unattended.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell type-specific assessment of cholesterol distribution in models of neurodevelopmental disorders</a></h4>

              
                Most nervous system disorders manifest through alterations in neuronal signaling based on abnormalities in neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and cell survival. However, such neuronal phenotypes are frequently accompanied or even caused by metabolic dysfunctions in neuronal or nonneuronal cells. The tight packing and highly heterogenous properties of neural, glial and vascular cell types pose significant challenges to dissecting metabolic aspects of brain disorders. Perturbed cholesterol homeostasis has recently emerged as key parameter associated with sub-sets of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, approaches for tracking and visualizing endogenous cholesterol distribution in the brain have limited capability of resolving cell type-specific differences. We here develop tools for genetically-encoded sensors that report on cholesterol distribution in the mouse brain with cellular resolution. We apply these probes to examine sub-cellular cholesterol accumulation in two genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, Npc1 and Ptchd1 knock-out mice. While both genes encode proteins with sterol-sensing domains that have been implicated in cholesterol transport, we uncover highly selective and cell type-specific phenotypes in cholesterol homeostasis. The tools established in this work should facilitate probing sub-cellular cholesterol distribution in complex tissues like the mammalian brain and enable capturing cell type-specific alterations in cholesterol flow between cells in models of brain disorders.

                Speech production and perception are fundamental processes of human cognition that both rely on an internal forward model that is still poorly understood. Here, we study this forward model by using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to comprehensively map connectivity of regional brain activity within the brain and to the speech envelope during continuous speaking and listening. Our results reveal a partly shared neural substrate for both processes but also a dissociation in space, delay and frequency. Neural activity in motor and frontal areas is coupled to succeeding speech in delta band (1-3 Hz), whereas coupling in the theta range follows speech in temporal areas during speaking. Neural connectivity results showed a separation of bottom-up and top-down signalling in distinct frequency bands during speaking. Here, we show that frequency-specific connectivity channels for bottom-up and top-down signalling support continuous speaking and listening in a way that is consistent with the predictive coding framework.

	<p>Scarcity goods have generally been perceived as high in value in real-world and empirical studies. However, few studies have investigated this value over time, such as performance in intertemporal decision making. This study&amp;amp;rsquo;s chief objective was to determine how scarcity evaluation changes temporally. We used the electroencephalogram technique and an outcome evaluation task with the valuation of scarcity and ordinary rewards delivered at different times to explore the effect of scarcity on delay discounting. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) results show that ordinary goods were associated with a more negative amplitude than scarcity goods, and that rewards delivered in the future evoked more negative deflection compared to those delivered immediately. The prominent FRN effect was derived mainly from ordinary trials rather than scarcity trials in the immediate condition and in the future rather than only in the immediate condition. The Frontal Asymmetry Index (FAI) results show that the scarcity condition was associated with greater relative left frontal cortical activity than the ordinary condition when delivered immediately. The frontal asymmetry indicated greater approach motivation. Our electrophysiology data indicate that scarcity goods have a perceived high value, particularly when delivered immediately.</p>

	<p>Using the arousal and mood hypothesis as a theoretical framework, we examined whether community-dwelling older adults (N = 132) exhibited cognitive benefits after listening to music. Participants listened to shorter (&amp;amp;asymp;2.5 min) or longer (&amp;amp;asymp;8 min) excerpts from recordings of happy- or sad-sounding music or from a spoken-word recording. Before and after listening, they completed tasks measuring visuospatial working memory (WM), cognitive flexibility and speed, verbal fluency, and mathematical ability, as well as measures of arousal and mood. In general, older adults improved from pre- to post-test on the cognitive tasks. For the test of WM, the increase was greater for participants who heard happy-sounding music compared to those in the other two groups. The happy-sounding group also exhibited larger increases in arousal and mood, although improvements in mood were evident only for the long-duration condition. At the individual level, however, improvements in WM were unrelated to changes in arousal or mood. In short, the results were partially consistent with the arousal and mood hypothesis. For older adults, listening to happy-sounding music may optimize arousal levels and mood, and improve performance on some cognitive tasks (i.e., WM), even though there is no direct link between changes in arousal/mood and changes in WM.</p>

	<p>Conflicts between groups are difficult to resolve, partly because humans tend to be biased in judging outgroup members. The aim of the current article is to review findings on the link between creativity and conflict-related biases and to offer a model that views creative cognition as an ability that may contribute to overcoming conflict-related biases. Our proposed model conforms to the twofold model of creativity. According to this model, creativity involves a generation phase and an evaluation phase, and these phases correspond to the neural mechanisms that underlie conflict-related biases. Specifically, we contend that the generation phase of creativity affects conflict-related biases by exerting an influence on stereotypes and prejudice, outgroup-targeted emotions, and ingroup empathy biases, all of which rely on the default mode network. Conversely, the evaluation phase of creativity, which is usually associated with activation in the executive control network and action-observation system, may be related to herding behaviors. Building on the shared mechanisms of creativity and conflicts, we propose that studies examining creativity-based interventions may be effective in promoting reconciliation.</p>

	<p>This article evaluates an educational experience that uses art to develop empathy. The artistic educational project is called &amp;amp;ldquo;stepping into others&amp;amp;rsquo; shoes&amp;amp;rdquo; and is carried out with 71 students enrolled in the Early Childhood Education and Primary Education degree programs of the University of Vigo. The main objective is to analyze the students&amp;amp;rsquo; experiences in processes of empathic pedagogical relationships that allow empowerment dynamics of oneself and others. An ethnographic approach is used to evaluate the experience through a group case study design with different qualitative instruments: analysis of artistic production, field diary and life stories. The main results indicate that when art is used for the construction of an empathic identity, the participants of these creative dynamics find it difficult to express their feelings and emotions. However, these processes favor social relationships and mutual recognition, as well as self-knowledge. It facilitates the creation of alternative meeting spaces and the promotion of creativity. Based on these results and their discussion, lines of action are suggested which should allow using art as a resource to develop empathy and promote increased motivation in the classroom.</p>

	<p>Dysfunctional brain networks have been found in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, to verify this in a more straightforward way, we investigated the intrinsic organization of brain networks in MDD by leveraging the resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rs-fNIRS). Thirty-four MDD patients (24 females, 38.41 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.14 years old) and thirty healthy controls (22 females, 34.43 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.03 years old) underwent a 10 min rest while their brain activity was recorded via fNIRS. The results showed that MDD patients and healthy controls exhibited similar resting-state functional connectivity. Moreover, the depression group showed lower small-world Lambda (1.12 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.04 vs. 1.16 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.10, p = 0.04) but higher global efficiency (0.51 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.03 vs. 0.48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.05, p = 0.03) than the control group. Importantly, MDD patients, as opposed to healthy controls, showed a significantly lower nodal local efficiency at the left middle occipital gyrus (0.56 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.36 vs. 0.81 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.20, pFDR &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), which predicted the level of depression in MDD (r = 0.45, p = 0.01, R2 = 0.15). In sum, we found a more integrated brain network in MDD patients with a lower nodal local efficiency at the occipital hub, which could predict depressive symptoms.</p>

	<p>The correct use of punctuation marks in secondary-school students is essential for the comprehension of written texts and, therefore, for the students&amp;amp;rsquo; academic success. However, the examination of this issue has often been overlooked in the literature. In the present study, we focused on the progression of comma usage (i.e., a punctuation mark that is often challenging to master) and examined its relation to reading comprehension. A sample of first- and fourth-year secondary-education students from Spain (N = 115) punctuated brief texts in which commas had been previously omitted. The original texts included various types of mandatory commas in Spanish. We also obtained a reading comprehension score from a standardized reading test. Results show that secondary-education students often did not correctly place the commas, with first-year secondary-education students only succeeding in the correct placement of commas 54.5% of the time in (Year 8 in the UK system). This figure increased to 80.9% in fourth-year secondary-education students (Year 11 in the UK system). As a control, this figure rose to 91.5% in first-year university students. Critically, better comprehenders were the ones with better use of punctuation marks (r = 0.33). These results are useful for developing teaching methods to improve writing/reading skills in secondary-school students.</p>

	<p>Background: Drug addiction may play an important role in chronic migraine (CM) with medication-overuse headache (MOH). Psychiatric diseases are associated with CM, but data regarding obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) are lacking. We aimed to establish the prevalence of OCD traits in CM patients with MOH and the impact on onabotulinum toxin A (OBT-A) treatment. Methods: A total of 75 patients with CM and MOH undergoing treatment with OBT-A in our Headache Centre were evaluated. At baseline and after four injection sessions, we assessed the migraine burden and the presence of OCD traits with the Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Inventory&amp;amp;mdash;Revised (OCI-R) test. Results: At baseline, 28% of patients had OCI-R scores compatible with borderline OCD aspects, while 22.7% were pathological. An improvement in headache was significantly associated with an increase in the number of subjects with a normal OCI-R score at T0 and T1, whereas patients with a pathological OCI-R score at T0 showed a significantly higher prevalence of CM at T1. Conclusions: Our data showed a significant rate of OCD traits at baseline, which could strengthen the hypothesis of an addictive disorder underlying CM with MOH. OCD traits seem to influence the OBT-A response. An OCD assessment could be useful in improving patients&amp;amp;rsquo; selections before starting treatments.</p>

	<p>Background: Mapping memory ability is highly correlated with an orienteer&amp;amp;rsquo;s level, and spatial memory tasks of different difficulties can reveal the spatial cognitive characteristics of high-level athletes. Methods: An &amp;amp;ldquo;expert&amp;amp;ndash;novice&amp;amp;rdquo; experimental paradigm was used to monitor behavioral performance and changes in cerebral blood oxygen concentration in orienteering athletes with tasks of different difficulty and cognitive load using functional near-infrared spectroscopic imaging (fNIRS). Results: (1) there was no difference between high-/low-level athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; map recognition and memory abilities in the non-orienteering scenario; (2) with increasing task difficulty, both high-/low-level athletes showed significantly decreasing behavioral performance, reduced correctness, longer reaction time, and strengthened cerebral blood oxygen activation concentration. There was no significant difference in L-DLPFC cerebral oxygen concentration between high-/low-level athletes in the simple map task, and the cerebral oxygen concentration in all brain regions was lower in the expert group than in the novice group in the rest of the task difficulty levels; (3) the correctness rate in the expert group in the complex task was closely related to the activation of the right hemisphere (R-DLPFC, R-VLPFC). Conclusions: Experts have a specific cognitive advantage in map-recognition memory, showing higher task performance and lower cerebral blood oxygen activation; cognitive load constrains map-recognition memory-specific ability and produces different performance effects and brain activation changes on spatial memory processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Conditional Degradation of UNC-31/CAPS Enables Spatiotemporal Analysis of Neuropeptide Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropeptide release from dense-core vesicles in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> is promoted by UNC-31, ortholog of the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS). Loss of UNC-31 causes multiple phenotypes in <I>C. elegans</I> including reduced motility, retention of late-stage eggs, and reduction in evoked synaptic release. However, the ability to analyze UNC-31 function over discrete timescales and in specific neurons is lacking. Here, we generated and validated a tool to enable UNC-31 expression and spatiotemporal functional analysis. We show that endogenously tagged UNC-31 is expressed in major ganglia and nerve cords from late embryonic stages through to adult. Using the auxin-inducible degradation system, we depleted UNC-31 postembryonically from the hermaphrodite nervous system and revealed defects in egg laying, locomotion, and vesicle release that were comparable to those in <I>unc-31</I> null mutant animals. In addition, we found that depleting UNC-31 specifically from the BAG sensory neurons causes increased intestinal fat storage, highlighting the spatial sensitivity of this system. Together, this protein degradation tool may be used to facilitate studies of neuropeptide function at precise cellular and temporal scales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal behavior and physiology is controlled by neuropeptides that are released from specific neuronal sources. The ability to dissect discrete neuropeptide functions requires precise manipulation of neuropeptide release. We have developed and validated a tool that enables precise spatiotemporal regulation of neuropeptide release that will enable researchers to examine neuropeptide function at exceptional resolution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictable Fluctuations in Excitatory Synaptic Strength Due to Natural Variation in Presynaptic Firing Rate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many controlled <I>in vitro</I> studies have demonstrated how postsynaptic responses to presynaptic spikes are not constant but depend on short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) and the detailed timing of presynaptic spikes. However, the effects of short-term plasticity (depression and facilitation) are not limited to short, subsecond timescales. The effects of STP appear on long timescales as changes in presynaptic firing rates lead to changes in steady-state synaptic transmission. Here, we examine the relationship between natural variations in the presynaptic firing rates and spike transmission <I>in vivo</I>. Using large-scale spike recordings in awake male and female mice from the Allen Institute Neuropixels dataset, we first detect putative excitatory synaptic connections based on cross-correlations between the spike trains of millions of pairs of neurons. For the subset of pairs where a transient, excitatory effect was detected, we use a model-based approach to track fluctuations in synaptic efficacy and find that efficacy varies substantially on slow (~1 min) timescales over the course of these recordings. For many connections, the efficacy fluctuations are correlated with fluctuations in the presynaptic firing rate. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, we then model the detailed probability of postsynaptic spiking on a millisecond timescale, including both slow changes in postsynaptic excitability and monosynaptic inputs with short-term plasticity. The detailed model reproduces the slow efficacy fluctuations observed with many putative excitatory connections, suggesting that these fluctuations can be both directly predicted based on the time-varying presynaptic firing rate and, at least partly, explained by the cumulative effects of STP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The firing rates of individual neurons naturally vary because of stimuli, movement, and brain state. Models of synaptic transmission predict that these variations in firing rates should be accompanied by slow fluctuations in synaptic strength because of short-term depression and facilitation. Here, we characterize the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in synaptic strength <I>in vivo</I> using large-scale spike recordings. For putative excitatory connections from a wide range of brain areas, we find that typical synaptic efficacy varies as much as ~70%, and in many cases the fluctuations are well described by models of short-term synaptic plasticity. These results highlight the dynamic nature of <I>in vivo</I> synaptic transmission and the interplay between synaptic strength and firing rates in awake animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Nonsynaptic Transmission Mediates Light Context-Dependent Odor Responses in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent connectome analyses of the entire synaptic circuit in the nervous system have provided tremendous insights into how neural processing occurs through the synaptic relay of neural information. Conversely, the extent to which ephaptic transmission which does not depend on the synapses contributes to the relay of neural information, especially beyond a distance between adjacent neurons and to neural processing remains unclear. We show that ephaptic transmission mediated by extracellular potential changes in female <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> can reach &gt;200 &micro;m, equivalent to the depth of its brain. Furthermore, ephaptic transmission driven by retinal photoreceptor cells mediates light-evoked firing rate increases in olfactory sensory neurons. These results indicate that ephaptic transmission contributes to sensory responses that can change momentarily in a context-dependent manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although extracellular field potential activities are commonly observed in many nervous systems, this activity has been generally considered as a side effect of synchronized spiking of neurons. This study, however, shows that field potential changes in retinae evoked by a sensory stimulus can control the excitability of distant neurons <I>in vivo</I> and mediates multimodal sensory integration in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>. As such ephaptic transmission is more effective at a short distance, the ephaptic transmission from the retinae may contribute significantly to firing rate changes in downstream neurons of the photoreceptor cells in the optic lobe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Variability of the Surface Area of the V1, V2, and V3 Maps in a Large Sample of Human Observers</a></h4>

              
                <p>How variable is the functionally defined structure of early visual areas in human cortex and how much variability is shared between twins? Here we quantify individual differences in the best understood functionally defined regions of cortex: V1, V2, V3. The Human Connectome Project 7T Retinotopy Dataset includes retinotopic measurements from 181 subjects (109 female, 72 male), including many twins. We trained four "anatomists" to manually define V1-V3 using retinotopic features. These definitions were more accurate than automated anatomical templates and showed that surface areas for these maps varied more than threefold across individuals. This threefold variation was little changed when normalizing visual area size by the surface area of the entire cerebral cortex. In addition to varying in size, we find that visual areas vary in how they sample the visual field. Specifically, the cortical magnification function differed substantially among individuals, with the relative amount of cortex devoted to central vision varying by more than a factor of 2. To complement the variability analysis, we examined the similarity of visual area size and structure across twins. Whereas the twin sample sizes are too small to make precise heritability estimates (50 monozygotic pairs, 34 dizygotic pairs), they nonetheless reveal high correlations, consistent with strong effects of the combination of shared genes and environment on visual area size. Collectively, these results provide the most comprehensive account of individual variability in visual area structure to date, and provide a robust population benchmark against which new individuals and developmental and clinical populations can be compared.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Areas V1, V2, and V3 are among the best studied functionally defined regions in human cortex. Using the largest retinotopy dataset to date, we characterized the variability of these regions across individuals and the similarity between twin pairs. We find that the size of visual areas varies dramatically (up to 3.5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>) across healthy young adults, far more than the variability of the cerebral cortex size as a whole. Much of this variability appears to arise from inherited factors, as we find very high correlations in visual area size between monozygotic twin pairs, and lower but still substantial correlations between dizygotic twin pairs. These results provide the most comprehensive assessment of how functionally defined visual cortex varies across the population to date.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tunable Action Potential Repolarization Governed by Kv3.4 Channels in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Kv3.4 channel regulates action potential (AP) repolarization in nociceptors and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord. We hypothesize that this is a tunable role governed by protein kinase-C-dependent phosphorylation of the Kv3.4 cytoplasmic N-terminal inactivation domain (NTID) at four nonequivalent sites. However, there is a paucity of causation evidence linking the phosphorylation status of Kv3.4 to the properties of the AP. To establish this link, we used adeno-associated viral vectors to specifically manipulate the expression and the effective phosphorylation status of Kv3.4 in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from mixed-sex rat embryos at embryonic day 18. These vectors encoded GFP (background control), wild-type (WT) Kv3.4, phosphonull (PN) Kv3.4 mutant (PN = S[8,9,15,21]A), phosphomimic (PM) Kv3.4 mutant (PM = S[8,9,15,21]D), and a Kv3.4 nonconducting dominant-negative (DN) pore mutant (DN = W429F). Following viral infection of the DRG neurons, we evaluated transduction efficiency and Kv3.4 expression and function via fluorescence microscopy and patch clamping. All functional Kv3.4 constructs induced current overexpression with similar voltage dependence of activation. However, whereas Kv3.4-WT and Kv3.4-PN induced fast transient currents, the Kv3.4-PM induced currents exhibiting impaired inactivation. In contrast, the Kv3.4-DN abolished the endogenous Kv3.4 current. Consequently, Kv3.4-DN and Kv3.4-PM produced APs with the longest and shortest durations, respectively, whereas Kv3.4-WT and Kv3.4-PN produced intermediate results. Moreover, the AP widths and maximum rates of AP repolarization from these groups are negatively correlated. We conclude that the expression and effective phosphorylation status of the Kv3.4 NTID confer a tunable mechanism of AP repolarization, which may provide exquisite regulation of pain signaling in DRG neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The AP is an all-or-none millisecond-long electrical impulse that encodes information in the frequency and patterns of repetitive firing. However, signaling may also depend on the plasticity and diversity of the AP waveform. For instance, the shape and duration of the AP may regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission between a primary sensory afferent to a secondary neuron in the spinal cord. Here, we used mutants of the Kv3.4 voltage-gated potassium channel to manipulate its expression and effective phosphorylation status in dorsal root ganglion neurons and directly show how the expression and malleable inactivation properties of Kv3.4 govern the AP duration and repolarization rate. These results elucidate a mechanism of neural AP plasticity that may regulate pain signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Active Licking Shapes Cortical Taste Coding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) represent taste through time-varying changes in their spiking activity. The predominant view is that the neural firing rate represents the sole unit of taste information. It is currently not known whether the phase of spikes relative to lick timing is used by GC neurons for taste encoding. To address this question, we recorded spiking activity from &gt;500 single GC neurons in male and female mice permitted to freely lick to receive four liquid gustatory stimuli and water. We developed a set of data analysis tools to determine the ability of GC neurons to discriminate gustatory information and then to quantify the degree to which this information exists in the spike rate versus the spike timing or phase relative to licks. These tools include machine learning algorithms for classification of spike trains and methods from geometric shape and functional data analysis. Our results show that while GC neurons primarily encode taste information using a rate code, the timing of spikes is also an important factor in taste discrimination. A further finding is that taste discrimination using spike timing is improved when the timing of licks is considered in the analysis. That is, the interlick phase of spiking provides more information than the absolute spike timing itself. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the ability of GC neurons to distinguish among tastes is best when spike rate and timing is interpreted relative to the timing of licks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons represent information from the outside world via changes in their number of action potentials (spikes) over time. This study examines how neurons in the mouse gustatory cortex (GC) encode taste information when gustatory stimuli are experienced through the active process of licking. We use electrophysiological recordings and data analysis tools to evaluate the ability of GC neurons to distinguish tastants and then to quantify the degree to which this information exists in the spike rate versus the spike timing relative to licks. We show that the neuron's ability to distinguish between tastes is higher when spike rate and timing are interpreted relative to the timing of licks, indicating that the lick cycle is a key factor for taste processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Subcellular Distribution and Release Dynamics of Cotransmitted Cholinergic and GABAergic Synaptic Inputs Modify Dopaminergic Neuronal Excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>We identified three types of monosynaptic cholinergic inputs spatially arranged onto medial substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons in male and female mice: cotransmitted acetylcholine (ACh)/GABA, GABA-only, and ACh only. There was a predominant GABA-only conductance along lateral dendrites and soma-centered ACh/GABA cotransmission. In response to repeated stimulation, the GABA conductance found on lateral dendrites decremented less than the proximally located GABA conductance, and was more effective at inhibiting action potentials. While soma-localized ACh/GABA cotransmission showed depression of the GABA component with repeated stimulation, ACh-mediated nicotinic responses were largely maintained. We investigated whether this differential change in inhibitory/excitatory inputs leads to altered neuronal excitability. We found that a depolarizing current or glutamate preceded by cotransmitted ACh/GABA was more effective in eliciting an action potential compared with current, glutamate, or ACh/GABA alone. This enhanced excitability was abolished with nicotinic receptor inhibitors, and modulated by T- and L-type calcium channels, thus establishing that activity of multiple classes of ion channels integrates to shape neuronal excitability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our laboratory has previously discovered a population of substantia nigra dopaminegic neurons (DA) that receive cotransmitted ACh and GABA. This study used subcellular optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic presynaptic terminals to map the functional ACh and GABA synaptic inputs across the somatodendritic extent of substantia nigra DA neurons. We determined spatially clustered GABA-only inputs on the lateral dendrites while cotransmitted ACh and GABA clustered close to the soma. We have shown that the action of GABA and ACh in cotransmission spatially clustered near the soma play a critical role in enhancing glutamate-mediated neuronal excitability through the activation of T- and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Functional Intraregional and Interregional Heterogeneity between Myenteric Glial Cells of the Colon and Duodenum in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Enteric glia are a unique population of peripheral neuroglia that regulate homeostasis in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and intestinal functions. Despite existing in functionally diverse regions of the gastrointestinal tract, enteric glia have been approached scientifically as a homogeneous group of cells. This assumption is at odds with the functional specializations of gastrointestinal organs and recent data suggesting glial heterogeneity in the brain and ENS. Here, we used calcium imaging in transgenic mice of both sexes expressing genetically encoded calcium sensors in enteric glia and conducted contractility studies to investigate functional diversity among myenteric glia in two functionally distinct intestinal organs: the duodenum and the colon. Our data show that myenteric glia exhibit regionally distinct responses to neuromodulators that require intercellular communication with neurons to differing extents in the duodenum and colon. Glia regulate intestinal contractility in a region-specific and pathway-specific manner, which suggests regionally diverse engagement of enteric glia in local motor patterns through discrete signaling pathways. Further, functional response profiles delineate four unique subpopulations among myenteric glia that are differentially distributed between the colon and duodenum. Our findings support the conclusion that myenteric glia exhibit both intraregional and interregional heterogeneity that contributes to region-specific mechanisms that regulate digestive functions. Glial heterogeneity adds an unexpected layer of complexity in peripheral neurocircuits, and understanding the specific functions of specialized glial subtypes will provide new insight into ENS physiology and pathophysiology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Enteric glia modulate gastrointestinal functions through intercellular communication with enteric neurons. Whether heterogeneity exists among neuron&ndash;glia interactions in the digestive tract is not understood. Here, we show that myenteric glia display regional heterogeneity in their responses to neuromodulators in the duodenum and the colon, which are functionally distinct organs. Glial-mediated control of intestinal motility is region and pathway specific. Four myenteric glial subtypes are present within a given gut region that are differently distributed between gut regions. These data provide functional and regional insights into enteric circuit specificity in the adult enteric nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attentional Enhancement of Tracked Stimuli in Early Visual Cortex Has Limited Capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Keeping track of the location of multiple moving objects is one of the well documented functions of visual attention. However, the mechanism of attentional selection that supports such continuous tracking is unclear. In particular, it has been proposed that target selection in early visual cortex occurs in parallel, with tracking errors arising because of attentional limitations at later processing stages. Here, we examine whether, instead, total attentional capacity for enhancement of early visual processing of tracked targets is shared between all attended stimuli. If the magnitude of attentional facilitation of multiple tracked targets was a key limiting factor of tracking ability, then one should expect it to drop systematically with increasing set-size of tracked targets. Human observers (male and female) were instructed to track two, four, or six moving objects among a pool of identical distractors. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) recorded during the tracking period revealed that the processing of tracked targets was consistently amplified compared with the processing of the distractors. The magnitude of this amplification decreased with increasing set size, and at lateral occipital electrodes it closely followed inverse proportionality to the number of tracked items, suggesting that limited attentional resources must be shared among the tracked stimuli. Accordingly, the magnitude of attentional facilitation predicted the behavioral outcome at the end of the trial. Together, these findings demonstrate that the limitations of multiple object tracking (MOT) across set-sizes stem from the limitations of top-down selective attention already at the early stages of visual processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to selectively attend to relevant features or objects is the key to flexibility of perception and action in the continuously changing environment. This ability is demonstrated in the multiple object tracking (MOT) task where observers monitor multiple independently moving objects at different locations in the visual field. The role of early attentional enhancement in tracking was previously acknowledged in the literature, however, the limitations on tracking were thought to arise during later stages of processing. Here, we demonstrate that the strength of attentional facilitation depends on the number of tracked objects and predicts successful tracking performance. Thus, it is the limitations of attentional enhancement at the early stages of visual processing that determine behavioral performance limits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Social Play Behavior Is Critical for the Development of Prefrontal Inhibitory Synapses and Cognitive Flexibility in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory driven activity during early life is critical for setting up the proper connectivity of the sensory cortices. We ask here whether social play behavior, a particular form of social interaction that is highly abundant during postweaning development, is equally important for setting up connections in the developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). Young male rats were deprived from social play with peers during the period in life when social play behavior normally peaks [postnatal day 21&ndash;42] (SPD rats), followed by resocialization until adulthood. We recorded synaptic currents in layer 5 cells in slices from medial PFC of adult SPD and control rats and observed that inhibitory synaptic currents were reduced in SPD slices, while excitatory synaptic currents were unaffected. This was associated with a decrease in perisomatic inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin-positive GABAergic cells. In parallel experiments, adult SPD rats achieved more reversals in a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task, which depends on the integrity of the PFC, by using a more simplified cognitive strategy than controls. Interestingly, we observed that one daily hour of play during SPD partially rescued the behavioral performance in the PRL, but did not prevent the decrease in PFC inhibitory synaptic inputs. Our data demonstrate the importance of unrestricted social play for the development of inhibitory synapses in the PFC and cognitive skills in adulthood and show that specific synaptic alterations in the PFC can result in a complex behavioral outcome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study addressed the question whether social play behavior in juvenile rats contributes to functional development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that rats that had been deprived from juvenile social play (social play deprivation - SPD) showed a reduction in inhibitory synapses in the PFC and a simplified strategy to solve a complex behavioral task in adulthood. Providing one daily hour of play during SPD partially rescued the cognitive skills in these rats, but did not prevent the reduction in PFC inhibitory synapses. Our results demonstrate a key role for unrestricted juvenile social play in PFC development and emphasize the complex relation between PFC circuit connectivity and cognitive function.</p>

Which principles govern whether different senses share common or modality-specific brain networks for sensory target detection? We examined whether complex targets evoke sustained supramodal activity while simple targets rely on modality-specific networks with short-lived supramodal contributions. In a series of hierarchical multisensory target detection studies (<I>n</I> = 77, of either sex) using EEG, we applied a temporal cross-decoding approach to dissociate supramodal and modality-specific cortical dynamics elicited by rule-based global and feature-based local sensory deviations within and between the visual, somatosensory, and auditory modality. Our data show that each sense implements a cortical hierarchy orchestrating supramodal target detection responses, which operate at local and global timescales in successive processing stages. Across different sensory modalities, simple feature-based sensory deviations presented in temporal vicinity to a monotonous input stream triggered a mismatch negativity-like local signal which decayed quickly and early, whereas complex rule-based targets tracked across time evoked a P3b-like global neural response which generalized across a late time window. Converging results from temporal cross-modality decoding analyses across different datasets, we reveal that global neural responses are sustained in a supramodal higher-order network, whereas local neural responses canonically thought to rely on modality-specific regions evolve into short-lived supramodal activity. Together, our findings demonstrate that cortical organization largely follows a gradient in which short-lived modality-specific as well as supramodal processes dominate local responses, whereas higher-order processes encode temporally extended abstract supramodal information fed forward from modality-specific cortices.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Each sense supports a cortical hierarchy of processes tracking deviant sensory events at multiple timescales. Conflicting evidence produced a lively debate around which of these processes are supramodal. Here, we manipulated the temporal complexity of auditory, tactile, and visual targets to determine whether cortical local and global ERP responses to sensory targets share cortical dynamics between the senses. Using temporal cross-decoding, we found that temporally complex targets elicit a supramodal sustained response. Conversely, local responses to temporally confined targets typically considered modality-specific rely on early short-lived supramodal activation. Our finding provides evidence for a supramodal gradient supporting sensory target detection in the cortex, with implications for multiple fields in which these responses are studied (e.g., predictive coding, consciousness, and attention).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Entorhinal-Hippocampal Circuit Integrity Is Related to Mnemonic Discrimination and Amyloid-{beta} Pathology in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mnemonic discrimination, a cognitive process that relies on hippocampal pattern separation, is one of the first memory domains to decline in aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease. We tested whether functional connectivity (FC) within the entorhinal&ndash;hippocampal circuit, measured with high-resolution resting state fMRI, is associated with mnemonic discrimination and amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) pathology in a sample of 64 cognitively normal human older adults (mean age, 71.3 &plusmn; 6.4 years; 67% female). FC was measured between entorhinal&ndash;hippocampal circuit nodes with known anatomical connectivity, as well as within cortical memory networks. A&beta; pathology was measured with <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir-PET, and neurodegeneration was assessed with subregional volume from structural MRI. Participants performed both object and spatial versions of a mnemonic discrimination task outside of the scanner and were classified into low-performing and high-performing groups on each task using a median split. Low object mnemonic discrimination performance was specifically associated with increased FC between anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alEC) and dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3, supporting the importance of this connection to object memory. This hyperconnectivity between alEC and DG/CA3 was related to A&beta; pathology and decreased entorhinal cortex volume. In contrast, spatial mnemonic discrimination was not associated with altered FC. A&beta; was further associated with dysfunction within hippocampal subfields, particularly with decreased FC between CA1 and subiculum as well as reduced volume in these regions. Our findings suggest that A&beta; may indirectly lead to memory impairment through entorhinal&ndash;hippocampal circuit dysfunction and neurodegeneration and provide a mechanism for increased vulnerability of object mnemonic discrimination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mnemonic discrimination is a critical episodic memory process that is performed in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus, relying on input from entorhinal cortex. Mnemonic discrimination is particularly vulnerable to decline in older adults; however, the mechanisms behind this vulnerability are still unknown. We demonstrate that object mnemonic discrimination impairment is related to hyperconnectivity between the anterolateral entorhinal cortex and DG/CA3. This hyperconnectivity was associated with amyloid-&beta; pathology and neurodegeneration in entorhinal cortex, suggesting aberrantly increased network activity is a pathological process. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation of the vulnerability of object compared to spatial mnemonic discrimination in older adults and has translational implications for choice of outcome measures in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                \textit{Background} The proposed watermarking framework is based on the multi-resolution Walsh-Hadamard Transform (MR-WHT) along with Schur factorization. For embedding, the cover image is converted into a frequency domain using MR-WHT before Schur factorization is applied. \textit{Methods} The upper triangle's highest stable eigenvalues in the Schur factorization are employed as reliable embedding locations for the watermark. The singular values of these coefficients are updated with the singular values of the watermark, and the matrix array generated by the biggest eigenvalues is further factorised by singular value decomposition using multiple scaling factors and Differential evolution (DE). Later, an inverse SVD, inverse Schur, and inverse multiresolution Walsh-Hadamard transform is executed to obtain a watermarked image. \textit{Results} The simulation results show that the proposed method is imperceptible and robust against existing watermarking algorithms used in the literature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pattern changes of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi women preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: We compared the pattern of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi females of all ages between 4 months preceding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the same months 1 year later within the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, that targeted all female patients attending an outpatient clinic for dermatology and venereology in Al-Kindy teaching hospital, Baghdad between October 2019 to the end of January 2020, and the same 4-month duration 1 year later (October 2020 to the end of January 2021) after the COVID-19 peak period had passed and there was no or partial curfew to exclude seasonal impact. Results: A total of 2657 female-patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with 1314 females during the 4 months pre COVID-19, and 1343 females during the pandemic. The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was 27.2±16.6 years, while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was 28.1±15.6 years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages (P >0.05). Hair loss in general with telogen effluvium specifically increased significantly. Cutaneous contagious viral infections were reduced significantly and specifically of these molluscum contagiosum and condylomata accuminata. Other forms of infections including bacterial and parasitic were also reduced while dermatophytosis was increased but not to a significant level. Acne vulgaris, rosacea, lichen planus, urticaria, pityriasis rosea, seborrheic dermatitis, and vitiligo were increased, but psoriasis, alopecia areata, other types of dermatitis, and melasma were reduced but none to a significant level. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the pattern of diseases presented to an out-patient clinic for dermatology and venereology. This could be either related to COVID-19 infection or stress associated with the pandemic, because of curfew, or wearing facemasks which may cause a decrease or increase in certain diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 associated acute neurological manifestations in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND COVID-19 has become a major cause of concern globally for the past couple of years considering the number of lives it has claimed. The spectrum of clinical manifestations related to nervous system ranged from ageusia, anosmia to stroke and encephalopathies. The burden of follow-up and review currently lies in front of us, considering the rise of post COVID manifestations in patients. The objective of this research is to determine the neurological complications of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS The current study is a record-based retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital. The records of patients admitted to the hospital between January 2021 and July 2021 were reviewed. The information was assessed and analyzed using SPSS 25.0. The results are expressed in the form of mean, standard deviation and proportions. RESULTS 1,000 patients admitted with coronavirus were assessed, and 36 patients with a neurological diagnosis available were found. The mean age was 57.1±1.6 years. Most of the neurological diagnosis included cerebrovascular accidents in 44.4% patients followed by hypokalaemia in 25% of patients. Diabetes mellitus (58.3%) and hypertension (47.2%) were found to be the major contributing co-morbidities. There was a significant association seen between the final diagnosis and the age groups (p=0.039). CONCLUSIONS This research would aid in adapting to better management guidelines as well as an integrated approach to neurovascular complications of the same in future. This is vital considering the increase in various short-term and long-terms effects being reported in the hospitals.

The connectivity of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is different from the one observed in Biological Neural Networks (BNNs). Can the wiring of actual brains help improve ANNs architectures? Can we learn from ANNs about what network features support computation in the brain when solving a task? At a meso/macro-scale level of the connectivity, ANNs’ architectures are carefully engineered and such those design decisions have crucial importance in many recent performance improvements. On the other hand, BNNs exhibit complex emergent connectivity patterns at all scales. At the individual level, BNNs connectivity results from brain development and plasticity processes, while at the species level, adaptive reconfigurations during evolution also play a major role shaping connectivity. Ubiquitous features of brain connectivity have been identified in recent years, but their role in the brain’s ability to perform concrete computations remains poorly understood. Computational neuroscience studies reveal the influence of specific brain connectivity features only on abstract dynamical properties, although the implications of real brain networks topologies on machine learning or cognitive tasks have been barely explored. Here we present a cross-species study with a hybrid approach integrating real brain connectomes and Bio-Echo State Networks, which we use to solve concrete memory tasks, allowing us to probe the potential computational implications of real brain connectivity patterns on task solving. We find results consistent across species and tasks, showing that biologically inspired networks perform as well as classical echo state networks, provided a minimum level of randomness and diversity of connections is allowed. We also present a framework, <i>bio2art</i>, to map and scale up real connectomes that can be integrated into recurrent ANNs. This approach also allows us to show the crucial importance of the diversity of interareal connectivity patterns, stressing the importance of stochastic processes determining neural networks connectivity in general.

                <p>by Daniel J. VandenHeuvel, Christopher Drovandi, Matthew J. Simpson</p>

Parameter estimation for mathematical models of biological processes is often difficult and depends significantly on the quality and quantity of available data. We introduce an efficient framework using Gaussian processes to discover mechanisms underlying delay, migration, and proliferation in a cell invasion experiment. Gaussian processes are leveraged with bootstrapping to provide uncertainty quantification for the mechanisms that drive the invasion process. Our framework is efficient, parallelisable, and can be applied to other biological problems. We illustrate our methods using a canonical scratch assay experiment, demonstrating how simply we can explore different functional forms and develop and test hypotheses about underlying mechanisms, such as whether delay is present. All code and data to reproduce this work are available at https://github.com/DanielVandH/EquationLearning.jl.

Despite high mortality and morbidity, drug-resistant bacterial infections remain the forgotten pandemic. We argue for strengthening of diagnostics, WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) and infection prevention and control to reduce drug-resistant infections, as an integral part of sustainable high-quality health services, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

In a world of multiple crises, the momentum to tackle drug-resistant bacterial infections must not fall further behind. A renewed focus is needed on global infection prevention and control strategies, which are lagging behind in many countries, diagnosis and good antimicrobial stewardship.

Epidemiological data demonstrate that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha and Delta are more transmissible, infectious, and pathogenic than previous variants. Phenotypic properties of VOC remain understudied. Here, we provide an extensive functional study of VOC Alpha replication and cell entry phenotypes assisted by reverse genetics, mutational mapping of spike in lentiviral pseudotypes, viral and cellular gene expression studies, and infectivity stability assays in an enhanced range of cell and epithelial culture models. In almost all models, VOC Alpha spread less or equally efficiently as ancestral (B.1) SARS-CoV-2. B.1. and VOC Alpha shared similar susceptibility to serum neutralization. Despite increased relative abundance of specific sgRNAs in the context of VOC Alpha infection, immune gene expression in infected cells did not differ between VOC Alpha and B.1. However, inferior spreading and entry efficiencies of VOC Alpha corresponded to lower abundance of proteolytically cleaved spike products presumably linked to the T<sup>716</sup>I mutation. In addition, we identified a bronchial cell line, NCI-H1299, which supported 24-fold increased growth of VOC Alpha and is to our knowledge the only cell line to recapitulate the fitness advantage of VOC Alpha compared to B.1. Interestingly, also VOC Delta showed a strong (595-fold) fitness advantage over B.1 in these cells. Comparative analysis of chimeric viruses expressing VOC Alpha spike in the backbone of B.1, and vice versa, showed that the specific replication phenotype of VOC Alpha in NCI-H1299 cells is largely determined by its spike protein. Despite undetectable ACE2 protein expression in NCI-H1299 cells, CRISPR/Cas9 <i>knock-out</i> and antibody-mediated blocking experiments revealed that multicycle spread of B.1 and VOC Alpha required ACE2 expression. Interestingly, entry of VOC Alpha, as opposed to B.1 virions, was largely unaffected by treatment with exogenous trypsin or saliva prior to infection, suggesting enhanced resistance of VOC Alpha spike to premature proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular environment of the human respiratory tract. This property may result in delayed degradation of VOC Alpha particle infectivity in conditions typical of mucosal fluids of the upper respiratory tract that may be recapitulated in NCI-H1299 cells closer than in highly ACE2-expressing cell lines and models. Our study highlights the importance of cell model evaluation and comparison for in-depth characterization of virus variant-specific phenotypes and uncovers a fine-tuned interrelationship between VOC Alpha- and host cell-specific determinants that may underlie the increased and prolonged virus shedding detected in patients infected with VOC Alpha.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Low Heart Rate Is Associated with Cerebral Pulsatility after TIA or Minor Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Beta-blockers are beneficial in coronary artery disease but less so in stroke prevention and dementia, potentially due to reduced heart rate (HR). Cerebral pulsatility is strongly associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and may be increased by lower diastolic pressures resulting from longer cardiac cycles.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients 4–6 weeks after TIA or non-disabling stroke (Oxford Vascular Study) underwent 5 minutes continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), and middle cerebral artery flow velocity (transcranial ultrasound). Beat-to-beat relationships between HR, blood pressure and Gosling's pulsatility index (MCA-PI) are reported as beta-coefficients from general linear models for each individual.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Across 759 patients, average MCA-PI during monitoring was associated with lower HR and diastolic BP (DBP) and greater systolic BP (SBP) (∆MCA-PI per 10 bpm/mmHg: −0.02, −0.04, 0.03, all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with HR particularly associated with low end-diastolic cerebral velocity (0.86, <i>p</i> = 0.014). Beat-to-beat HR was strongly associated with concurrent low DBP and high SBP, potentially mediating the association with greater beat-to-beat cerebral pulsatility (average ∆MCA-PI vs HR/DBP/SBP unadjusted: −0.062, −0.052, 0.0092; adjusted for concurrent BP: −0.039, −0.11, 0.041). The beat-to-beat association between HR and MCA-PI increased with age, beta-blockers, arterial stiffness, low HR (age &gt; 70 + HR &lt; 65 vs age &lt; 70 + HR &gt; 65: −0.081 vs −0.024, interaction <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and severe SVD on MRI (age &gt; 70 + severe vs age &lt; 70 + none: −0.087 vs −0.047, interaction <i>p</i> = 0.03), with interactions between age, severe SVD, and low HR synergistically increasing MCA-PI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Low HR is associated with greater cerebral pulsatility in patients with SVD, potentially mediated by lower diastolic blood flow and representing a novel potential treatment target. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:909–920</p>

                <h2>Background and Objectives</h2>
<p>We sought to determine clinical significance of neuronal septin autoimmunity and evaluate for potential IgG effects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs; mouse tissue and cell based) or Western blot. IgG binding to (and internalization of) extracellular septin epitopes were evaluated for by live rat hippocampal neuron assay. The impact of purified patient IgGs on murine cortical neuron function was determined by recording extracellular field potentials in a multielectrode array platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were identified in 23 patients. All 8 patients with septin-5-IgG detected had cerebellar ataxia, and 7 had prominent eye movement disorders. One of 2 patients with co-existing septin-7-IgG had additional psychiatric phenotype (apathy, emotional blunting, and poor insight). Fifteen patients had septin-7 autoimmunity, without septin-5-IgG detected. Disorders included encephalopathy (11; 2 patients with accompanying myelopathy, and 2 were relapsing), myelopathy (3), and episodic ataxia (1). Psychiatric symptoms (≥1 of agitation, apathy, catatonia, disorganized thinking, and paranoia) were prominent in 6 of 11 patients with encephalopathic symptoms. Eight of 10 patients with data available (from 23 total) improved after immunotherapy, and a further 2 patients improved spontaneously. Staining of plasma membranes of live hippocampal neurons produced by patient IgGs (subclasses 1 and 2) colocalized with pre- and post-synaptic markers. Decreased spiking and bursting behavior in mixed cultures of murine glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical neurons produced by patient IgGs were attributable to neither antigenic crosslinking and internalization nor complement activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs are predictive of distinct treatment-responsive autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Live neuron binding and induced electrophysiologic effects by patient IgGs may support septin-specific pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:1090–1101</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal [<sup>18</sup>F]-flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) uptake in pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and to compare FTLD to cases with high and low levels of Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic changes (ADNC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred forty-three participants who had completed at least one flortaucipir PET and had autopsy-confirmed FTLD (n = 52) or high (n = 58) or low ADNC (n = 33) based on Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages 0–IV versus V–VI were included. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated for 9 regions of interest (ROIs): an FTLD meta-ROI, midbrain, globus pallidum, an AD meta-ROI, entorhinal, inferior temporal, orbitofrontal, precentral, and medial parietal. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare mean baseline SUVRs and annual rate of change in SUVR by group. Sensitivity and specificity to distinguish FTLD from high and low ADNC were calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline uptake in the FTLD meta-ROI, midbrain, and globus pallidus was greater in FTLD than high and low ADNC. No region showed a greater rate of flortaucipir accumulation in FTLD. Baseline uptake in the AD-related regions and orbitofrontal and precentral cortices was greater in high ADNC, and all showed greater rates of accumulation compared to FTLD. Baseline differences were superior to longitudinal rates in differentiating FTLD from high and low ADNC. A simple baseline metric of midbrain/inferior temporal ratio of flortaucipir uptake provided good to excellent differentiation between FTLD and high and low ADNC (sensitivities/specificities = 94%/95% and 71%/70%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There are cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in flortaucipir uptake between FTLD and high and low ADNC. However, optimum differentiation between FTLD and ADNC was achieved with baseline uptake rather than longitudinal rates. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:1016–1029</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We assessed whether hematoma expansion (HE) and favorable outcome differ according to type of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Among participants with ICH enrolled in the TICH-2 (Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Haemorrhage) trial, we assessed baseline scans for hematoma location and presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) using computed tomography (CT, simplified Edinburgh criteria) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Boston criteria) and categorized ICH as lobar CAA, lobar non-CAA, and nonlobar. The main outcomes were HE and favorable functional outcome. We constructed multivariate regression models and assessed treatment effects using interaction terms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 2,298 out of 2,325 participants were included with available CT (98.8%; median age = 71 years, interquartile range = 60-80 years; 1,014 female). Additional MRI was available in 219 patients (9.5%). Overall, 1,637 participants (71.2%) had nonlobar ICH; the remaining 661 participants (28.8%) had lobar ICH, of whom 202 patients had lobar CAA-ICH (8.8%, 173 participants according to Edinburgh and 29 participants according to Boston criteria) and 459 did not (lobar non-CAA, 20.0%). For HE, we found a significant interaction of lobar CAA ICH with time from onset to randomization (increasing risk with time, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001) and baseline ICH volume (constant risk regardless of volume, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001) but no association between type of ICH and risk of HE or favorable outcome. Tranexamic acid significantly reduced the risk of HE (adjusted odds ratio = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.6–1.0, <i>p</i> = 0.020) without statistically significant interaction with type of ICH (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.058). Tranexamic acid was not associated with favorable outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Risk of HE in patients with lobar CAA-ICH was not independently increased but seems to have different dynamics compared to other types of ICH. The time window for treatment of CAA-ICH to prevent HE may be longer. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:921–930</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rare inherited missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i>, the gene that encodes the vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter, have recently been shown to cause genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. We aimed to clarify if de novo missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i> can also cause epilepsy with impaired neurodevelopment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using exome sequencing, we identified four individuals with a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and de novo missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i>. To assess causality, we performed functional evaluation of the identified variants in a murine neuronal cell culture model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The main phenotype comprises moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, infantile-onset epilepsy within the first 18 months of life, and a choreiform, dystonic, or dyskinetic movement disorder. In silico modeling and functional analyses reveal that three of these variants, which are located in helices that line the putative GABA transport pathway, result in reduced quantal size, consistent with impaired filling of synaptic vesicles with GABA. The fourth variant, located in the vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid N-terminus, does not affect quantal size, but increases presynaptic release probability, leading to more severe synaptic depression during high-frequency stimulation. Thus, variants in vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid can impair GABAergic neurotransmission through at least two mechanisms, by affecting synaptic vesicle filling and by altering synaptic short-term plasticity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work establishes de novo missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i> as a novel cause of a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.</p>
<h2>Summary for Social Media If Published</h2>
<p>
@platzer_k @lemke_johannes @RamiJamra @Nirgalito @GeneDx
The SLC family 32 Member 1 (SLC32A1) is the only protein identified to date, that loads gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine into synaptic vesicles, and is therefore also known as the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) or vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT). Rare inherited missense variants in SLC32A1, the gene that encodes VGAT/vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter, have recently been shown to cause genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus.
We aimed to clarify if de novo missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i> can also cause epilepsy with impaired neurodevelopment.
We report on four individuals with de novo missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i> and a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with infantile onset epilepsy. We establish causality of the variants via in silico modeling and their functional evaluation in a murine neuronal cell culture model.
<i>SLC32A1</i> variants represent a novel genetic etiology in neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy and a new GABA-related disease mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Predicting Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson Disease through Incentive Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to evaluate whether the feedback-related negativity (FRN)—a neurophysiological marker of incentive processing—can be used to predict the development of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The longitudinal cohort consisted of consecutive nondemented PD patients with no ICD history. We recorded FRN signals while they performed a gambling task. We calculated the mean amplitude difference between losses and gains (FRNdiff) to be used as a predictor of future ICD development. We performed prospective biannual follow-up assessments for 30 months to detect incident ICDs. Finally, we evaluated how basal FRNdiff was associated with posterior development of ICDs using survival models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between October 7, 2015 and December 16, 2016, we screened 120 patients. Among them, 94 patients performed the gambling and 92 completed the follow-up. Eighteen patients developed ICDs during follow-up, whereas 74 remained free of ICDs. Baseline FRNdiff was greater in patients who developed ICDs than in those who did not (−2.33μV vs −0.84μV, <i>p</i> = 0.001). No other significant baseline differences were found. The FRNdiff was significantly associated with ICD development in the survival models both when not adjusted (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58–0.91, <i>p</i> = 0.006) and when controlling for dopamine replacement therapy, sex, and age (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55–0.97, <i>p</i> = 0.035). None of the impulsivity measures evaluated was related to ICD development.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Reward-processing differences measured by FRN signals precede ICD development in PD. This neurophysiological marker permits identification of patients with high risk of ICD development. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:974–984</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Current recommendations for regional stroke destination suggest that patients with severe acute stroke in non-urban areas should be triaged based on the estimated transport time to a referral thrombectomy-capable center.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post hoc analysis to evaluate the association of pre-hospital workflow times with neurological outcomes in patients included in the RACECAT trial. Workflow times evaluated were known or could be estimated before transport allocation. Primary outcome was the shift analysis on the modified Rankin score at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 1,369 patients included, the median time from onset to emergency medical service (EMS) evaluation, the estimated transport time to a thrombectomy-capable center and local stroke center, and the estimated transfer time between centers were 65 minutes (interquartile ratio [IQR] = 43–138), 61 minutes (IQR = 36–80), 17 minutes (IQR = 9–27), and 62 minutes (IQR = 36–73), respectively. Longer time intervals from stroke onset to EMS evaluation were associated with higher odds of disability at 90 days in the local stroke center group (adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) for each 30-minute increment = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.06), with no association in the thrombectomy-capable center group (acOR for each 30-minute increment = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.98–1.01, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.021). No significant interaction was found for other pre-hospital workflow times. In patients evaluated by EMS later than 120 minutes after stroke onset, direct transport to a thrombectomy-capable center was associated with better disability outcomes (acOR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.03–2.17).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We found a significant heterogeneity in the association between initial transport destination and neurological outcomes according to the elapse of time between the stroke onset and the EMS evaluation (<a target="_blank"

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MRI Clustering Reveals Three ALS Subtypes With Unique Neurodegeneration Patterns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by comparing patterns of neurodegeneration using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and explore their phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging in 488 clinically well-characterized patients with ALS and 338 control subjects. Measurements of whole-brain cortical thickness and white matter connectome fractional anisotropy were adjusted for disease-unrelated variation. A probabilistic network-based clustering algorithm was used to divide patients into subgroups of similar neurodegeneration patterns. Clinical characteristics and cognitive profiles were assessed for each subgroup. In total, 512 follow-up scans were used to validate clustering results longitudinally.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The clustering algorithm divided patients with ALS into 3 subgroups of 187, 163, and 138 patients. All subgroups displayed involvement of the precentral gyrus and are characterized, respectively, by (1) pure motor involvement (pure motor cluster [PM]), (2) orbitofrontal and temporal involvement (frontotemporal cluster [FT]), and (3) involvement of the posterior cingulate cortex, parietal white matter, temporal operculum, and cerebellum (cingulate-parietal–temporal cluster [CPT]). These subgroups had significantly distinct clinical profiles regarding male-to-female ratio, age at symptom onset, and frequency of bulbar symptom onset. FT and CPT revealed higher rates of cognitive impairment on the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral ALS screen (ECAS). Longitudinally, clustering remained stable: at 90.4% of their follow-up visits, patients clustered in the same subgroup as their baseline visit.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ALS can manifest itself in 3 main patterns of cerebral neurodegeneration, each associated with distinct clinical characteristics and cognitive profiles. Besides the pure motor and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-like variants of ALS, a new neuroimaging phenotype has emerged, characterized by posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and cerebellar involvement.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Venous Collagenosis as Pathogenesis of White Matter Hyperintensity</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Periventricular white matter hyperintensities (pvWMHs) are commonly observed on MRI in older individuals and are associated with cognitive and motor decline. The etiology of pvWMH remains unknown. Venous collagenosis has been implicated, which may also interfere with perivascular fluid flow leading to dilation of perivascular spaces (PVS). Here, we examine relationships between in vivo pvWMH volume and ex vivo morphological quantification of collagenosis and the PVS in veins and arteries.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain tissue from 25 Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Research Center subjects was selected to cover the full range of WMH burden. Tissue from white matter abutting the ventricle was stained with Masson's trichrome and smooth muscle actin. An automated hue based algorithm identified and segmented vessel into collagenized vessel walls, lumen, and PVS. Multiple linear regressions with pvWMH volume as the dependent variable and either collagen thickness or PVS width were performed with covariates of vessel diameter, age at death, sex, and interval between MRI and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PVS width and collagen thickness were significantly correlated in both arteries (r = 0.21, p = 0.001) and veins (r = 0.23, p = 0.001). Increased venous collagen (p = 0.017) was a significant predictor of higher pvWMH burden while arterial collagen was not (p = 0.128). Neither PVS width in arteries (p = 0.937) nor veins (p = 0.133) predicted pvWMH burden.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings are consistent with a model in which venous collagenosis mediates the relationship between vascular risk factors and pvWMH. This study confirms the importance of changes to the venous system in contributing to MRI white matter lesions commonly observed with advanced age. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:992–1000</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Transverse myelitis (TM) has recently been associated by health authorities with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), one of the 5 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) labeled severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. It is unknown whether a similar association exists for the other FDA or EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer/BioNTech], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1nCov-19 [Oxford–AstraZeneca], and NVX-CoV2373 [Novavax]). This study aimed to evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine class and TM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study examined individual case safety reports from VigiBase, the World Health Organization's pharmacovigilance database. We first conducted a disproportionality analysis with the information component (IC) using the reports of TM that occurred within 28 days following exposure to the FDA or EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, from December 1, 2020 (first adverse event related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) to March 27, 2022. Second, we analyzed the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TM cases reported in VigiBase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TM was significantly associated both with the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based (n = 364; IC<sub>025</sub> = 0.62) and vector-based (n = 136; IC<sub>025</sub> = 0.52) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are authorized by the FDA or the EMA.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Findings from this observational, cross-sectional pharmacovigilance study showed that mRNA-based and vector-based FDA/EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be associated with TM. However, because TM remains a rare event, with a previously reported rate of 0.28 cases per 1 million vaccine doses, the risk–benefit ratio in favor of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unchallenged. Rather, this study suggests that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of TM in patients presenting with early signs of spinal cord dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">External Validation of e‐ASPECTS Software for Interpreting Brain CT in Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to test e-ASPECTS software in patients with stroke. Marketed as a decision-support tool, e-ASPECTS may detect features of ischemia or hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) imaging and quantify ischemic extent using Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using CT from 9 stroke studies, we compared software with masked experts. As per indications for software use, we assessed e-ASPECTS results for patients with/without middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemia but no other cause of stroke. In an analysis outside the intended use of the software, we enriched our dataset with non-MCA ischemia, hemorrhage, and mimics to simulate a representative “front door” hospital population. With final diagnosis as the reference standard, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS for identifying stroke features (ischemia, hyperattenuated arteries, and hemorrhage) in the representative population.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 4,100 patients (51% women, median age = 78 years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] = 10, onset to scan = 2.5 hours). Final diagnosis was ischemia (78%), hemorrhage (14%), or mimic (8%). From 3,035 CTs with expert-rated ASPECTS, most (2084/3035, 69%) e-ASPECTS results were within one point of experts. In the representative population, the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70–72%) for detecting ischemic features, 85% (83–86%) for hemorrhage. Software identified more false positive ischemia (12% vs 2%) and hemorrhage (14% vs &lt;1%) than experts.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>On independent testing, e-ASPECTS provided moderate agreement with experts and overcalled stroke features. Therefore, future prospective trials testing impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) software on patient care and outcome are required before widespread implementation of stroke decision-support software.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Characteristics and Neural Correlates of Emotional Behavior during Prefrontal Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to characterize clinical expression and intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of emotional expression during prefrontal epileptic seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a descriptive analysis of seizure semiology in patients explored with stereo-EEG (SEEG) for pharmacoresistant prefrontal epilepsy, using a semiquantitative score for seizure-related emotional behavior. Two independent observers scored occurrence and intensity of objective emotional features (face/body movements/vocalization/overall appearance), testing interobserver reliability. Intracerebral electrophysiological changes were documented. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) compared behavioral signs with neural SEEG correlates. For each patient, the clinical and anatomoelectrophysiological scores were established, based on a prototypical emotional seizure.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-two patients (469 seizures) were included. Interobserver correlation for emotional signs was satisfactory (kappa = 0.6–0.8). Prevalence of any subjective and/or objective ictal emotional phenomena was 79% (33/42); objective emotional signs occurred in 27 of 42 subjects (64%). Negatively valenced emotional semiology (ictal feeling of fear, defensive and/or aggressive behaviors) was much more prevalent than positively valenced, prosocial behaviors. Cluster analysis and PCA identified 4 groups with different occurrence of emotional signs and cerebral correlates. Two main clusters of negatively valenced behavior were identified: “active threat response,” associated with seizure organizations involving posterior orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral and/or ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; and “passive fear,” associated with amygdala, other mesial temporal structures, and posterior orbitofrontal cortex.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Emotional behaviors, especially fear/threat response, are common in prefrontal seizures, reflecting the role of the prefrontal cortex in emotional control. Different cortical seizure localizations were associated with “passive fear” and “active threat response” seizure behaviors at the group level. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:1052–1065</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Ganaxolone versus Phenobarbital for Neonatal Seizure Management</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures are more common in the neonatal period than at any other stage of life. Phenobarbital is the first-line treatment for neonatal seizures and is at best effective in approximately 50% of babies, but may contribute to neuronal injury. Here, we assessed the efficacy of phenobarbital versus the synthetic neurosteroid, ganaxolone, to moderate seizure activity and neuropathology in neonatal lambs exposed to perinatal asphyxia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Asphyxia was induced via umbilical cord occlusion in term lambs at birth. Lambs were treated with ganaxolone (5mg/kg/bolus then 5mg/kg/day for 2 days) or phenobarbital (20mg/kg/bolus then 5mg/kg/day for 2 days) at 6 hours. Abnormal brain activity was classified as stereotypic evolving (SE) seizures, epileptiform discharges (EDs), and epileptiform transients (ETs) using continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalographic recordings. At 48 hours, lambs were euthanized for brain pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Asphyxia caused abnormal brain activity, including SE seizures that peaked at 18 to 20 hours, EDs, and ETs, and induced neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation. Ganaxolone treatment was associated with an 86.4% reduction in the number of seizures compared to the asphyxia group. The total seizure duration in the asphyxia+ganaxolone group was less than the untreated asphyxia group. There was no difference in the number of SE seizures between the asphyxia and asphyxia+phenobarbital groups or duration of SE seizures. Ganaxolone treatment, but not phenobarbital, reduced neuronal degeneration within hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, and cortical neurons, and ganaxolone reduced neuroinflammation within the thalamus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Ganaxolone provided better seizure control than phenobarbital in this perinatal asphyxia model and was neuroprotective for the newborn brain, affording a new therapeutic opportunity for treatment of neonatal seizures. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:1066–1079</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of Presynaptic Loss with Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Increased presynaptic dysfunction measured by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43) may be observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how CSF GAP43 increases relate to AD-core pathologies, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in AD requires further investigation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 731 older adults with baseline β-amyloid (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET), CSF GAP43, CSF phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau<sub>181</sub>), and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and longitudinal residual hippocampal volume and cognitive assessments. Among them, 377 individuals had longitudinal <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and 326 individuals had simultaneous longitudinal CSF GAP43, Aβ PET, and CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> data. We compared baseline and slopes of CSF GAP43 among different stages of AD, as well as their associations with Aβ PET, CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>, residual hippocampal volume, <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and cognition cross-sectionally and longitudinally.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Regardless of Aβ positivity and clinical diagnosis, CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>-positive individuals showed higher CSF GAP43 concentrations (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and faster rates of CSF GAP43 increases (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) compared with the CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>-negative individuals. Moreover, higher CSF GAP43 concentrations and faster rates of CSF GAP43 increases were strongly related to CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> independent of Aβ PET. They were related to more rapid hippocampal atrophy, hypometabolism, and cognitive decline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and predicted the progression from MCI to dementia (area under the curve for baseline 0.704; area under the curve for slope 0.717) over a median 4 years of follow up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tau aggregations rather than Aβ plaques primarily drive presynaptic dysfunction measured by CSF GAP43, which may lead to sequential neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD or neurodegenerative diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:1001–1015</p>

                <p>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease in which pathogenic immunoglobulin G antibodies bind to acetylcholine receptors (or to functionally related molecules at the neuromuscular junction). B cell expression of the inhibitory immunoglobulin G receptor, Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) IIB, maintains peripheral immune tolerance, and its absence renders B cells hyperresponsive to autoantigen. Here, we report that FcγRIIB expression levels are substantially reduced in B lineage cells derived from immunotherapy-naïve patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive early-onset MG. In contrast, genetic variants associated with impaired FcγRIIB expression are not enriched in MG, indicating post-transcriptional dysregulation. FcγR-targeted therapies could have therapeutic benefits in MG. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:1046–1051</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Causal Classification System for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Subtypes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Determining the underlying causes of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is of major importance, because risk factors, prognosis, and management differ by ICH subtype. We developed a new causal CLASsification system for ICH Subtypes, termed CLAS-ICH, based on recent advances in neuroimaging.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>CLAS-ICH defines 5 ICH subtypes: arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, mixed small vessel disease (SVD), other rare forms of SVD (genetic SVD and others), and secondary causes (macrovascular causes, tumor, and other rare causes). Every patient is scored in each category according to the level of diagnostic evidence: (1) well-defined ICH subtype; (2) possible underlying disease; and (0) no evidence of the disease. We evaluated CLAS-ICH in a derivation cohort of 113 patients with ICH from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA, and in a derivation cohort of 203 patients from Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the derivation cohort, a well-defined ICH subtype could be identified in 74 (65.5%) patients, including 24 (21.2%) with arteriolosclerosis, 23 (20.4%) with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 18 (15.9%) with mixed SVD, and 9 (8.0%) with a secondary cause. One or more possible causes were identified in 42 (37.2%) patients. Interobserver agreement was excellent for each category (kappa value ranging from 0.86 to 1.00). Despite substantial differences in imaging modalities, we obtained similar results in the validation cohort.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CLAS-ICH is a simple and reliable classification system for ICH subtyping, that captures overlap between causes and the level of diagnostic evidence. CLAS-ICH may guide clinicians to identify ICH causes, and improve ICH classification in multicenter studies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Survival status and predictors of mortality among mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa COVID-19 Care Centers, Ethiopia: A survival analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress on the health care system of many countries worldwide. To accommodate the growing number of critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, hospitals expanded and tried to meet overwhelming demands. Despite this, outcomes of patients after mechanical ventilation were devastating, with high mortality rates. Therefore, this study investigated the survival status and predictors of mortality among mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was applied on the patient charts of 496 critically ill and mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients at intensive care units of Addis Ababa COVID-19 Care Centers from September 2020 to October 2021. Data were collected using a data extraction checklist and entered into Epi data manager. Then, data were transferred to STATA V-14 for cleaning and analysis. The cox-proportional hazard regression model was used for analysis. Covariates with p-value ≤0.20 in the bivariate analysis were fitted to multivariate analysis after the model fitness test. Finally, statistical significance was decided at p-value <0.05, and hazard ratios were used to determine the strength of associations. Results: Of the 496 patients, 63.3% had died. The incidence rate of mortality was 56.7 (95% CI: 50.80, 63.37) per 1,000 person-days of observation, with 5534 person-day observations recorded. Advanced age (>60 years old) (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=1.86; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.15) and being invasively ventilated (AHR=2.02; 95% CI: 1.25, 3.26) were associated with increased risk of mortality. Furthermore, presence of diabetes (AHR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.08), shock (AHR=1.99; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.52), and delirium (AHR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.44) were significantly associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: Clear directions are needed in the recommendation of non-invasive versus invasive ventilation, especially among elderly patients. The controversy of when to intubate (early versus late) needs to be clarified as well. Early detection and prompt management of shock is paramount.

                Background: Spiroleucettadine is an alkaloid originally derived from the yellow Leucetta sea sponge. Spiroleucettadine has previously been shown to inhibit the growth of various cancer cell lines and has a high anti-proliferative activity against a non-small cell lung cancer cell line (H522). The mediators of these anti-proliferative effects have not been determined. Therefore, in this study we measured changes in cell death and cell proliferation and their immediate protein mediators in response to spiroleucettadine, toward the aim of ultimately determining target(s) for spiroleucettadine in cancer cells and a more precise description of its mechanism of action. Methods: We used flow cytometry to investigate changes in the cell cycle apoptosis and Western blot to investigate associated protein changes following exposure of H522 cells to varying concentrations of spiroleucettadine. Results: We found evidence for cell cycle arrest at G2/M and associated increases in cyclin B1 expression and CDK1 phosphorylation, as well as an increase in apoptosis alongside marked increase in Bim expression, consistent with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway Conclusions: Any targets for spiroleucettadine that may be proposed are constrained to those with mechanisms of actions that lead to G2/M arrest, induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and changes in the expression of associated proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cortical auditory potentials and cognitive potentials in individuals with and without vestibular dysfunction [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vestibular dysfunction is known to affect cognitive abilities related to the processing of spatial and non-spatial information. P300 is an event-related potential (ERP) used to assess cognitive function. Studies have shown abnormalities in P300 in individuals with vestibular hypofunction.  However, the literature shows equivocal findings for P300 in individuals with vestibular dysfunction. The aim of present study was to compare the latency and amplitude of cortical auditory evoked potential and P300 between individuals with vestibular dysfunction and individuals with no vestibular dysfunction. Methods: Forty adults with a mean age of 40.5 years participated in the study. Group I included 20 adults diagnosed with vestibular dysfunction and group II included 20 age-matched adults with no vestibular dysfunction. The P300 was recorded using pure-tones in an odd-ball paradigm, from electrode sites Cz and Pz. The latency and amplitude of peaks P1, N1, P2, N2 P300, and N4 were measured. Results:  The results showed no significant difference in the latency and amplitude of peaks P1, N1, P2, and N2 of the cortical auditory potentials between groups. The P300 was absent in approximately 30% of individuals with vestibular dysfunction meanwhile, it was present in all individuals in group II. The mean latency and amplitude of the P300 and latency of N4 were not significantly different between the groups. However, a significant difference was observed in N4 amplitude between groups at both electrode sites. And, no correlation was observed between the DHI score and the P300 parameters in group I. Conclusions: the P300 was absent in a greater number of individuals with vestibular dysfunction, suggesting cognitive impairment. However, when the P300 was present the peak latency and amplitude showed no significant difference in both groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the synergistic effect of a poly-herbals combination on the antioxidant activity through a statistical approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Poly-herbals combination was applied to enhance biological activity, particularly antioxidant activity. This present study was purposed to assess the synergistic interaction of a combination of five traditional Indonesian herbal plants through a simultaneous and integrated statistical technique. The plants were extracted using maceration, and purification was conducted before extraction to eliminate the ballast compounds. A simplex lattice design comprising 35 design points was utilized to understand herbal combinations' main effect and interaction through multiple linear regression analysis on the antioxidant activity using DPPH and ABTS assays. The results showed that C. longa, P. niruri, and C. xanthorrhiza had the most potent antioxidant activity than M. oleifera and C. asiatica. The presence of C. longa modulated the synergistic interaction between combinations. Meanwhile, the non-curcuminoid content in C. xanthorrhiza played a fundamental role in reducing the antioxidant activity. The synergistic interaction could enhance the antioxidant activity through poly-herbals combination. In addition, particular consideration should be withdrawn by antagonism interaction in the poly-herbals combination for reducing the biological activity.

                Human prostate cancer can result from chromosomal rearrangements that lead to aberrant ETS gene expression. The mechanisms that lead to fusion-independent ETS factor upregulation and prostate oncogenesis remain relatively unknown. Here, we show that two neighboring transcription factors, Capicua (<i>CIC</i>) and ETS2 repressor factor (<i>ERF</i>), which are co-deleted in human prostate tumors can drive prostate oncogenesis. Concurrent <i>CIC</i> and <i>ERF</i> loss commonly occur through focal genomic deletions at chromosome 19q13.2. Mechanistically, <i>CIC</i> and <i>ERF</i> co-bind the proximal regulatory element and mutually repress the ETS transcription factor, <i>ETV1</i>. Targeting ETV1 in <i>CIC</i> and <i>ERF</i>-deficient prostate cancer limits tumor growth. Thus, we have uncovered a fusion-independent mode of ETS transcriptional activation defined by concurrent loss of <i>CIC</i> and <i>ERF</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Defocus corrected large area cryo-EM (DeCo-LACE) for label-free detection of molecules across entire cell sections</a></h4>

              
                A major goal of biological imaging is localization of biomolecules inside a cell. Fluorescence microscopy can localize biomolecules inside whole cells and tissues, but its ability to count biomolecules and accuracy of the spatial coordinates is limited by the wavelength of visible light. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides highly accurate position and orientation information of biomolecules but is often confined to small fields of view inside a cell, limiting biological context. In this study we use a new data-acquisition scheme called 'Defocus-Corrected Large-Area cryo-EM' (DeCo-LACE) to collect high-resolution images of entire sections (100 - 250 nm thick lamellae) of neutrophil-like mouse cells, representing 1-2% of the total cellular volume. We use 2D template matching (2DTM) to determine localization and orientation of the large ribosomal subunit in these sections. These data provide 'maps' of ribosomes across entire sections of mammalian cells. This high-throughput cryo-EM data collection approach together with 2DTM will advance visual proteomics and provide biological insight that cannot be obtained by other methods.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reevaluation of Piezo1 as a gut RNA sensor</a></h4>

              
                Piezo1 is a stretch-gated ion channel required for mechanosensation in many organ systems. Recent findings point to a new role for Piezo1 in the gut, suggesting that it is a sensor of microbial single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) rather than mechanical force. If true, this would redefine the scope of Piezo biology. Here, we sought to replicate the central finding that fecal ssRNA is a natural agonist of Piezo1. While we observe that fecal extracts and ssRNA can stimulate calcium influx in certain cell lines, this response is independent of Piezo1. Additionally, sterilized dietary extracts devoid of gut biome RNA show similar cell line-specific stimulatory activity to fecal extracts. Together, our data highlight potential confounds inherent to gut-derived extracts, exclude Piezo1 as a receptor for ssRNA in the gut, and support a dedicated role for Piezo channels in mechanosensing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic architecture of natural variation of cardiac performance from flies to humans</a></h4>

              
                Deciphering the genetic architecture of human cardiac disorders is of fundamental importance but their underlying complexity is a major hurdle. We investigated the natural variation of cardiac performance in the sequenced inbred lines of the <i>Drosophila</i> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) identified genetic networks associated with natural variation of cardiac traits which were used to gain insights as to the molecular and cellular processes affected. Non-coding variants that we identified were used to map potential regulatory non-coding regions, which in turn were employed to predict transcription factors (TFs) binding sites. Cognate TFs, many of which themselves bear polymorphisms associated with variations of cardiac performance, were also validated by heart-specific knockdown. Additionally, we showed that the natural variations associated with variability in cardiac performance affect a set of genes overlapping those associated with average traits but through different variants in the same genes. Furthermore, we showed that phenotypic variability was also associated with natural variation of gene regulatory networks. More importantly, we documented correlations between genes associated with cardiac phenotypes in both flies and humans, which supports a conserved genetic architecture regulating adult cardiac function from arthropods to mammals. Specifically, roles for PAX9 and EGR2 in the regulation of the cardiac rhythm were established in both models, illustrating that the characteristics of natural variations in cardiac function identified in <i>Drosophila</i> can accelerate discovery in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Binary and analog variation of synapses between cortical pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Learning from experience depends at least in part on changes in neuronal connections. We present the largest map of connectivity to date between cortical neurons of a defined type (L2/3 pyramidal cells in mouse primary visual cortex), which was enabled by automated analysis of serial section electron microscopy images with improved handling of image defects (250×140×90 μm<sup>3</sup> volume). We used the map to identify constraints on the learning algorithms employed by the cortex. Previous cortical studies modeled a continuum of synapse sizes by a log-normal distribution. A continuum is consistent with most neural network models of learning, in which synaptic strength is a continuously graded analog variable. Here we show that synapse size, when restricted to synapses between L2/3 pyramidal cells, is well-modeled by the sum of a binary variable and an analog variable drawn from a log-normal distribution. Two synapses sharing the same presynaptic and postsynaptic cells are known to be correlated in size . We show that the binary variables of the two synapses are highly correlated, while the analog variables are not. Binary variation could be the outcome of a Hebbian or other synaptic plasticity rule depending on activity signals that are relatively uniform across neuronal arbors, while analog variation may be dominated by other influences such as spontaneous dynamical fluctuations. We discuss the implications for the longstanding hypothesis that activity-dependent plasticity switches synapses between bistable states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The perceptual nature of illusory object recognition</a></h4>

              
                We occasionally misinterpret ambiguous sensory input or report a stimulus when none is presented. It is unknown whether such errors have a sensory origin and reflect true perceptual illusions, or whether they have a more cognitive origin (e.g., are due to guessing), or both. When participants performed an error-prone and challenging face/house discrimination task, multivariate EEG analyses revealed that during decision errors (mistaking a face for a house), sensory stages of visual information processing initially represent the presented stimulus category. Crucially however, when participants were confident in their erroneous decision, so when the illusion was strongest, this neural representation flipped later in time and reflected the incorrectly reported percept. This flip in neural pattern was absent for decisions that were made with low confidence. This work demonstrates that decision confidence arbitrates between perceptual decision errors, which reflect true illusions of perception, and cognitive decision errors, which do not.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating Quantitative and Functional MRI As Potential Techniques to Identify the Subdivisions in the Human Lateral Geniculate Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Segmenting the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) divisions of the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has been challenging yet remains an important goal because the LGN is the only place in the brain where these two information streams are spatially disjoint and can be studied independently. Previous research used the amplitude of responses to different types of stimuli to separate M and P regions (Denison et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, this method is confounded because the hilum region of the LGN exhibits greater response amplitudes to all stimuli and can be mistaken for the M subdivision (DeSimone & Schneider, 2019). Therefore, we have employed two independent methodologies that do not rely upon the functional response properties of the M and P neurons to segment the M and P regions: 1. structural quantitative MRI (qMRI) at 3T to measure the T1 relaxation time, and 2. monocular and dichoptic functional MRI (fMRI) procedures to measure eye-specific responses. Our qMRI results agreed with the anatomical expectations, identifying M regions on the ventromedial surface of the LGN. The monocular fMRI procedure was better than the dichoptic condition to identify the eye-dominance signals. Both procedures revealed significant right eye bias, and neither could reliably identify the first M layer of the LGN. These findings indicated that the qMRI methods are promising whereas the functional identification of contralateral layers requires further refinement.
