              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15289">The Computational Mechanisms of Detached Mindfulness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the computational mechanisms underlying a type of metacognitive monitoring known as detached mindfulness, a particularly effective therapeutic technique within cognitive psychology. While research strongly supports the capacity of detached mindfulness to reduce depression and anxiety, its cognitive and computational underpinnings remain largely unexplained. We employ a computational model of metacognitive skill to articulate the mechanisms through which a detached perception of affect reduces emotional reactivity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15833">Sex Differences in Hierarchical and Modular Organization of Functional Brain Networks: Insights from Hierarchical Entropy and Modularity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies have demonstrated significant sex differences in the neural mechanisms of daily life and neuropsychiatric disorders. The hierarchical organization of the functional brain network is a critical feature for assessing these neural mechanisms. But sex differences on the hierarchical organization is not fully investigated. Here, we explore whether hierarchical structure of brain network differs between females and males. At the group level, we measure the hierarchical entropy and the maximum modularity of each individual, and identify a significant negative correlation between the complexity of hierarchy and modularity in brain networks. On average, female brain networks have stronger connectivity within the module, whereas male brain networks demonstrate more complex hierarchy. At the consensus level, we use co-classification matrix to investigate the detailed differences in the hierarchical organization between sexes and observe that females and males exhibit different interaction patterns of brain regions in the dorsal attention network (DAN) and visual network (VIN). Our finding suggests that females and males employ different network topology to achieve brain functions. In addition, the negative correlation between hierarchy and modularity implies a need to balance the complexity in hierarchical organization of the brain network, which shed light on future studies of brain functions.

Abstract: Computational modeling is a critical tool for understanding consciousness, but is it enough on its own? This paper discusses the necessity for an ontological basis of consciousness, and introduces a formal framework for grounding computational descriptions into an ontological substrate. Utilizing this technique, a method is demonstrated for estimating the difference in qualitative experience between two systems. This framework has wide applicability to computational theories of consciousness.

                arXiv:2409.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in manufacturing of flexible and conformable microelectronics have opened opportunities for health monitoring and disease treatment. Other material engineering advances, such as the development of conductive, skin-like hydrogels, liquid metals, electric textiles, and piezoelectric films provide safe and comfortable means of interfacing with the human body. Together, these advances have enabled the design and engineering of bioelectronic devices with integrated multimodal sensing and stimulation capabilities to be worn nearly anywhere on the body. Of particular interest here, the external ear (auricle) offers a unique opportunity to design scalable bioelectronic devices with a high degree of usability and familiarity given the broad use of headphones. This perspective article discusses recent design and engineering advances in the development of auricular bioelectronic devices capable of physiological and biochemical sensing, cognitive monitoring, targeted neuromodulation, and control for human-computer interactions. Stemming from this scalable foundation, there will be increased growth and competition in research and engineering to advance auricular bioelectronics. This activity will lead to increased adoption of these smart headphone-style devices by patients and consumers for tracking health, treating medical conditions, and enhancing human-computer interactions.

Abstract: Human intelligence, the most evident and accessible form of source of reasoning, hosted by biological hardware, has evolved and been refined over thousands of years, positioning itself today to create new artificial forms and preparing to self--design their evolutionary path forward. Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has surpassed any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led to both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. In the sequel, we shall explore the interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We slightly delve into interesting aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. Additionally, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation AI development. We finalize this evolving document with a few thoughts and open questions yet to be addressed by the broader community.

Abstract: This study explores prosodic production in latent aphasia, a mild form of aphasia associated with left-hemisphere brain damage (e.g. stroke). Unlike prior research on moderate to severe aphasia, we investigated latent aphasia, which can seem to have very similar speech production with neurotypical speech. We analysed the f0, intensity and duration of utterance-initial and utterance-final words of ten speakers with latent aphasia and ten matching controls. Regression models were fitted to improve our understanding of this understudied type of very mild aphasia. The results highlighted varying degrees of differences in all three prosodic measures between groups. We also investigated the diagnostic classification of latent aphasia versus neurotypical control using random forest, aiming to build a fast and reliable tool to assist with the identification of latent aphasia. The random forest analysis also reinforced the significance of prosodic features in distinguishing latent aphasia.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03376">Interpretable statistical representations of neural population dynamics and geometry</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2304.03376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of neuron populations commonly evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. Thus, we need methods that learn the dynamical processes over neural manifolds to infer interpretable and consistent latent representations. We introduce a representation learning method, MARBLE, that decomposes on-manifold dynamics into local flow fields and maps them into a common latent space using unsupervised geometric deep learning. In simulated non-linear dynamical systems, recurrent neural networks, and experimental single-neuron recordings from primates and rodents, we discover emergent low-dimensional latent representations that parametrise high-dimensional neural dynamics during gain modulation, decision-making, and changes in the internal state. These representations are consistent across neural networks and animals, enabling the robust comparison of cognitive computations. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art within- and across-animal decoding accuracy of MARBLE compared with current representation learning approaches, with minimal user input. Our results suggest that manifold structure provides a powerful inductive bias to develop powerful decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15298">Sorbet: A Neuromorphic Hardware-Compatible Transformer-Based Spiking Language Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For reasons such as privacy, there are use cases for language models at the edge. This has given rise to small language models (SLMs) targeted for deployment in resource-constrained devices where energy efficiency is a significant concern. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution due to their energy efficiency, and there are already works on realizing transformer-based models on SNNs. However, key operations like softmax and layer normalization (LN) are difficult to implement on neuromorphic hardware, and many of these early works sidestepped them. To address these challenges, we introduce Sorbet, a transformer-based spiking language model that is more neuromorphic hardware-compatible. Sorbet incorporates a novel shifting-based softmax called PTsoftmax and a power normalization method using bit-shifting (BSPN), both designed to replace the respective energy-intensive operations. By leveraging knowledge distillation and model quantization, Sorbet achieved a highly compressed binary weight model that maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing energy consumption. We validate Sorbet's effectiveness through extensive testing on the GLUE benchmark and a series of ablation studies, demonstrating its potential as an energy-efficient solution for language model inference.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15300">Learning Task-Based Trainable Neuromorphic ADCs via Power-Aware Distillation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to process signals in digital form depends on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Traditionally, ADCs are designed to ensure that the digital representation closely matches the analog signal. However, recent studies have shown that significant power and memory savings can be achieved through task-based acquisition, where the acquisition process is tailored to the downstream processing task. An emerging technology for task-based acquisition involves the use of memristors, which are considered key enablers for neuromorphic computing. Memristors can implement ADCs with tunable mappings, allowing adaptation to specific system tasks or power constraints. In this work, we study task-based acquisition for a generic classification task using memristive ADCs. We consider the unique characteristics of this such neuromorphic ADCs, including their power consumption and noisy read-write behavior, and propose a physically compliant model based on resistive successive approximation register ADCs integrated with memristor components, enabling the adjustment of quantization regions. To optimize performance, we introduce a data-driven algorithm that jointly tunes task-based memristive ADCs alongside both digital and analog processing. Our design addresses the inherent stochasticity of memristors through power-aware distillation, complemented by a specialized learning algorithm that adapts to their unique analog-to-digital mapping. The proposed approach is shown to enhance accuracy by up to 27% and reduce power consumption by up to 66% compared to uniform ADCs. Even under noisy conditions, our method achieves substantial gains, with accuracy improvements of up to 19% and power reductions of up to 57%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our power-aware neuromorphic ADCs in improving system performance across diverse tasks.

                arXiv:2409.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are universal solvers inspired by principles of natural evolution. In many applications, EAs produce astonishingly good solutions. As they are able to deal with complex optimisation problems, they show great promise for hard problems encountered in the field of graph drawing.To complement recent theoretical advances in the analysis of EAs on graph drawing, we contribute a fundamental empirical study. We consider the so-called \textsc{One-Sided Bipartite Crossing Minimisation (OBCM)}: given two layers of a bipartite graph and a fixed horizontal order of vertices on the first layer, the task is to order the vertices on the second layer to minimise the number of edge crossings. We empirically analyse the performance of simple EAs for OBCM and compare different mutation operators on the underlying permutation ordering problem: exchanging two elements (\textit{exchange}), swapping adjacent elements (\textit{swap}) and jumping an element to a new position (\textit{jump}). EAs using jumps easily outperform all deterministic algorithms in terms of solution quality after a reasonable number of generations. We also design variations of the best-performing EAs to reduce the execution time for each generation. The improved EAs can obtain the same solution quality as before and run up to 100 times faster.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15375">DS2TA: Denoising Spiking Transformer with Attenuated Spatiotemporal Attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) are current high-performance models of choice for various vision applications. Recent developments have given rise to biologically inspired spiking transformers that thrive in ultra-low power operations on neuromorphic hardware, however, without fully unlocking the potential of spiking neural networks. We introduce DS2TA, a Denoising Spiking transformer with attenuated SpatioTemporal Attention, designed specifically for vision applications. DS2TA introduces a new spiking attenuated spatiotemporal attention mechanism that considers input firing correlations occurring in both time and space, thereby fully harnessing the computational power of spiking neurons at the core of the transformer architecture. Importantly, DS2TA facilitates parameter-efficient spatiotemporal attention computation without introducing extra weights. DS2TA employs efficient hashmap-based nonlinear spiking attention denoisers to enhance the robustness and expressive power of spiking attention maps. DS2TA demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on several widely adopted static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets. Operated over 4 time steps, DS2TA achieves 94.92% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 and 77.47% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR100, as well as 79.1% and 94.44% on CIFAR10-DVS and DVS-Gesture using 10 time steps.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15729">Sequential Learning in the Dense Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential learning involves learning tasks in a sequence, and proves challenging for most neural networks. Biological neural networks regularly conquer the sequential learning challenge and are even capable of transferring knowledge both forward and backwards between tasks. Artificial neural networks often totally fail to transfer performance between tasks, and regularly suffer from degraded performance or catastrophic forgetting on previous tasks. Models of associative memory have been used to investigate the discrepancy between biological and artificial neural networks due to their biological ties and inspirations, of which the Hopfield network is perhaps the most studied model. The Dense Associative Memory, or modern Hopfield network, generalizes the Hopfield network, allowing for greater capacities and prototype learning behaviors, while still retaining the associative memory structure. We investigate the performance of the Dense Associative Memory in sequential learning problems, and benchmark various sequential learning techniques in the network. We give a substantial review of the sequential learning space with particular respect to the Hopfield network and associative memories, as well as describe the techniques we implement in detail. We also draw parallels between the classical and Dense Associative Memory in the context of sequential learning, and discuss the departures from biological inspiration that may influence the utility of the Dense Associative Memory as a tool for studying biological neural networks. We present our findings, and show that existing sequential learning methods can be applied to the Dense Associative Memory to improve sequential learning performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15849">Twin Network Augmentation: A Novel Training Strategy for Improved Spiking Neural Networks and Efficient Weight Quantization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has led to increased energy consumption, raising concerns about their sustainability. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are inspired by biological neural systems and operate using sparse, event-driven spikes to communicate information between neurons, offer a potential solution due to their lower energy requirements. An alternative technique for reducing a neural network's footprint is quantization, which compresses weight representations to decrease memory usage and energy consumption. In this study, we present Twin Network Augmentation (TNA), a novel training framework aimed at improving the performance of SNNs while also facilitating an enhanced compression through low-precision quantization of weights. TNA involves co-training an SNN with a twin network, optimizing both networks to minimize their cross-entropy losses and the mean squared error between their output logits. We demonstrate that TNA significantly enhances classification performance across various vision datasets and in addition is particularly effective when applied when reducing SNNs to ternary weight precision. Notably, during inference , only the ternary SNN is retained, significantly reducing the network in number of neurons, connectivity and weight size representation. Our results show that TNA outperforms traditional knowledge distillation methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance for the evaluated network architecture on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10-DVS. This paper underscores the effectiveness of TNA in bridging the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs and suggests further exploration into the application of TNA in different network architectures and datasets.

                arXiv:2409.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most successful examples of a derandomized evolution strategy. However, it still relies on randomly sampling offspring, which can be done via a uniform distribution and subsequently transforming into the required Gaussian. Previous work has shown that replacing this uniform sampling with a low-discrepancy sampler, such as Halton or Sobol sequences, can improve performance over a wide set of problems. We show that iterating through small, fixed sets of low-discrepancy points can still perform better than the default uniform distribution. Moreover, using only 128 points throughout the search is sufficient to closely approximate the empirical performance of using the complete pseudorandom sequence up to dimensionality 40 on the BBOB benchmark. For lower dimensionalities (below 10), we find that using as little as 32 unique low discrepancy points performs similar or better than uniform sampling. In 2D, for which we have highly optimized low discrepancy samples available, we demonstrate that using these points yields the highest empirical performance and requires only 16 samples to improve over uniform sampling. Overall, we establish a clear relation between the $L_2$ discrepancy of the used point set and the empirical performance of the CMA-ES.

                arXiv:2409.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multi-operator and multi-method algorithms have succeeded, encouraging their combination within single frameworks. Despite promising results, there remains room for improvement as only some evolutionary algorithms (EAs) consistently excel across all optimization problems. This paper proposes mLSHADE-RL, an enhanced version of LSHADE-cnEpSin, which is one of the winners of the CEC 2017 competition in real-parameter single-objective optimization. mLSHADE-RL integrates multiple EAs and search operators to improve performance further. Three mutation strategies such as DE/current-to-pbest-weight/1 with archive, DE/current-to-pbest/1 without archive, and DE/current-to-ordpbest-weight/1 are integrated in the original LSHADE-cnEpSin. A restart mechanism is also proposed to overcome the local optima tendency. Additionally, a local search method is applied in the later phase of the evolutionary procedure to enhance the exploitation capability of mLSHADE-RL. mLSHADE-RL is tested on 30 dimensions in the CEC 2024 competition on single objective bound constrained optimization, demonstrating superior performance over other state-of-the-art algorithms in producing high-quality solutions across various optimization scenarios.

                arXiv:2409.15670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the third generation neural networks, are known for their low energy consumption and high robustness. SNNs are developing rapidly and can compete with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in many fields. To ensure that the widespread use of SNNs does not cause serious security incidents, much research has been conducted to explore the robustness of SNNs under adversarial sample attacks. However, many other unassessed security threats exist, such as highly stealthy backdoor attacks. Therefore, to fill the research gap in this and further explore the security vulnerabilities of SNNs, this paper explores the robustness performance of SNNs trained by supervised learning rules under backdoor attacks. Specifically, the work herein includes: i) We propose a generic backdoor attack framework that can be launched against the training process of existing supervised learning rules and covers all learnable dataset types of SNNs. ii) We analyze the robustness differences between different learning rules and between SNN and ANN, which suggests that SNN no longer has inherent robustness under backdoor attacks. iii) We reveal the vulnerability of conversion-dependent learning rules caused by backdoor migration and further analyze the migration ability during the conversion process, finding that the backdoor migration rate can even exceed 99%. iv) Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures against this kind of backdoor attack and its technical challenges and point out several promising research directions.

                arXiv:2409.16231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes a novel approach of survival transformers and extreme gradient boosting models in predicting cognitive deterioration in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using metabolomics data in the ADNI cohort. By leveraging advanced machine learning and transformer-based techniques applied in survival analysis, the proposed approach highlights the potential of these techniques for more accurate early detection and intervention in Alzheimer's dementia disease. This research also underscores the importance of non-invasive biomarkers and innovative modelling tools in enhancing the accuracy of dementia risk assessments, offering new avenues for clinical practice and patient care. A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation procedure consisting of 100 repetitions of a nested cross-validation in which models were trained and evaluated, indicates that the survival machine learning models based on Transformer and XGBoost achieved the highest mean C-index performances, namely 0.85 and 0.8, respectively, and that they are superior to the conventional survival analysis Cox Proportional Hazards model which achieved a mean C-Index of 0.77. Moreover, based on the standard deviations of the C-Index performances obtained in the Monte Carlo simulation, we established that both survival machine learning models above are more stable than the conventional statistical model.

Abstract: The paper explores the capability of continuous-time recurrent neural networks to store and recall precisely timed spike patterns. We show (by numerical experiments) that this is indeed possible: within some range of parameters, any random score of spike trains (for all neurons in the network) can be robustly memorized and autonomously reproduced with stable accurate relative timing of all spikes, with probability close to one. We also demonstrate associative recall under noisy conditions.
  In these experiments, the required synaptic weights are computed offline, to satisfy a template that encourages temporal stability.

                arXiv:2405.06419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the gated perceptron, an enhancement of the conventional perceptron, which incorporates an additional input computed as the product of the existing inputs. This allows the perceptron to capture non-linear interactions between features, significantly improving its ability to classify and regress on complex datasets. We explore its application in both linear and non-linear regression tasks using the Iris dataset, as well as binary and multi-class classification problems, including the PIMA Indian dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Our results demonstrate that the gated perceptron can generate more distinct decision regions compared to traditional perceptrons, enhancing its classification capabilities, particularly in handling non-linear data. Performance comparisons show that the gated perceptron competes with state-of-the-art classifiers while maintaining a simple architecture.

	<p>Objective: Awake craniotomy (AWC) allows intraoperative evaluation of functions involving the cortical surface and subcortical fibers. In epilepsy surgery, indications for and the role of AWC have not been established because evaluation with intracranial electrodes is considered the gold standard. We report herein our case series of patients who underwent AWC in epilepsy surgery and propose the scenarios for and roles of AWC. Methods: Patients who underwent AWC in epilepsy surgery at our institutions between 2014 and 2023 were included. Information about age, sex, etiology, location of epileptogenicity, seizure type, use of intracranial electrode placement, surgical complications, neurological deficits, additional surgery, and seizure outcomes was reviewed. Following a diagnostic and treatment flow for epilepsy surgery, we clarified three different scenarios and roles for AWC. Results: Ten patients underwent AWC. Three patients underwent AWC after non-invasive evaluations. Two patients underwent AWC after intracranial evaluation with stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG). Five patients underwent AWC after intracranial evaluation with subdural grid electrodes (SDG). Among these, two patients were initially evaluated with SEEG and with SDG thereafter. One patient reported slight numbness in the hand, and one patient showed slight cognitive decline. Seizure outcomes according to the Engel outcome scale were class 1A in three patients, IIA in two patients, IIIA in four patients, and IVA in one patient. Conclusions: AWC can be used for purposes of epilepsy surgery in different situations, either immediately after non-invasive studies or as an additional invasive step after invasive monitoring with either SEEG or SDG. The application of AWC should be individualized according to each patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s specific characteristics.</p>

	<p>Extremely preterm birth entails an increased risk for multimorbidity and the prevalence of developmental deficits because this risk is negatively correlated to the number of gestation weeks. This work evaluated subcortical volume changes in children born extremely preterm who received Katona neurohabilitation, as well as the effects of subcortical volume and treatment adherence on their three-year-old neurodevelopment outcomes. Fifteen extremely preterm-born participants were treated from two months to two years old and followed up until past three years of age. The participants received Katona neurohabilitation, which provides vestibular and proprioceptive stimulation and promotes movement integration through the early, intensive practice of human-specific elementary movements. Subcortical brain volumes from magnetic resonance images were obtained at the beginning and after treatment. Also, treatment adherence to Katona neurohabilitation and neurodevelopment outcomes were measured. The results showed that absolute subcortical volumes increased after treatment; however, when adjusted by intracranial volume, these volumes decreased. Subcortical function inhibition allows cortical control and increased connectivity, which may explain decreased adjusted volume. Regression analyses showed that after-treatment hippocampal volumes had a discrete predictive value. However, treatment adherence showed a clear effect on mental and psychomotor neurodevelopment. Thus, the effectiveness of Katona neurohabilitation is constrained by treatment adherence.</p>

                <p>Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MeCP2 gene, is characterized by cognitive and social deficits. Previous studies have noted hypoactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pyramidal neurons of MeCP2-deficient mice (RTT mice) in response to both social and nonsocial stimuli. To further understand the neural mechanisms behind the social deficits of RTT mice, we monitored excitatory pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the mPFC during social interactions in mice. These neurons&rsquo; activity was closely linked to social preference, especially in wild-type mice. However, RTT mice showed reduced social interest and corresponding hypoactivity in these neurons, indicating that impaired mPFC activity contributes to their social deficits. We identified six mPFC neural ensembles selectively tuned to various stimuli, with RTT mice recruiting fewer neurons to ensembles responsive to social interactions and consistently showing lower stimulus-ON ensemble transient rates. Despite these lower rates, RTT mice exhibited an increase in the percentage of social-ON neurons in later sessions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for the decreased firing rate. This highlights the limited plasticity in the mPFC caused by MeCP2 deficiency and offers insights into the neural dynamics of social encoding. The presence of multifunctional neurons and those specifically responsive to social or object stimuli in the mPFC emphasizes its crucial role in complex behaviors and cognitive functions, with selective neuron engagement suggesting efficiency in neural activation that optimizes responses to environmental stimuli.</p>

                <p>Studies employing EEG to measure somatosensory responses have been typically optimized to compute event-related potentials in response to discrete events. However, tactile interactions involve continuous processing of nonstationary inputs that change in location, duration, and intensity. To fill this gap, this study aims to demonstrate the possibility of measuring the neural tracking of continuous and unpredictable tactile information. Twenty-seven young adults (females, 15) were continuously and passively stimulated with a random series of gentle brushes on single fingers of each hand, which were covered from view. Thus, tactile stimulations were unique for each participant and stimulated fingers. An encoding model measured the degree of synchronization between brain activity and continuous tactile input, generating a temporal response function (TRF). Brain topographies associated with the encoding of each finger stimulation showed a contralateral response at central sensors starting at 50&nbsp;ms and peaking at ~140&nbsp;ms of lag, followed by a bilateral response at ~240&nbsp;ms. A series of analyses highlighted that reliable tactile TRF emerged after just 3&nbsp;min of stimulation. Strikingly, topographical patterns of the TRF allowed discriminating digit lateralization across hands and digit representation within each hand. Our results demonstrated for the first time the possibility of using EEG to measure the neural tracking of a naturalistic, continuous, and unpredictable stimulation in the somatosensory domain. Crucially, this approach allows the study of brain activity following individualized, idiosyncratic tactile events to the fingers.</p>

                Abstract* Background Goal-directed perfusion (GDP) aims to balance oxygen delivery (DO2) and consumption (VO2) in cardiac surgery. Elevated lactate during CPB is common and linked to higher morbidity and mortality. Evaluating lactate with base excess (BE) is vital due to their relationship. Reducing severe BE and lactate predicts cardiac surgery outcomes better. Methods Fifty adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were randomly assigned to either the GDP group or the conventional group. In the GDP group, the priming solution was adjusted to target a hematocrit (HCT) level of 24 to 27% with a pump flow of 1.8 to 2.2 L/min/m2 to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 60 and 65 mmHg. The primary outcomes was oxygen delivery index (DO2i). Results There were increasing trends in lactate levels and decreasing trends in BE levels at all timeframes. The GDP mean difference of lactate [1.504 (1.52); p < 0.001] and BE [-0.87 (2.93); p = 0.22] levels showed better value in the GDP group, with statistically significant increased values in the control group for BE [-1.667 (2.93); p = 0.017] and lactate levels [2.215 (2.919); p < 0.001]. The postoperative outcome showed a significant difference in AKI and ventilator time. Conclusions The GDP low flow CPB compared with conventional flow CPB maintained DO2 matched with VO2 with a better clinical values in the lactate and BE levels and significantly lowered AKI and ventilator duration in cardiac surgery.

                Introduction Climacteric period signifies a transitional phase characterized by ovarian failure and a decline in estrogen levels, leading to various urogynecological alterations, including potential sexual dysfunctions. Among these, pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function plays a pivotal role in female sexual function. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on the sexual function of climacteric women. Methods Experimental or quasi-experimental studies published in peer-reviewed journals, assessing the sexual function of perimenopausal women with PFMT as an intervention, will be included. Studies conducted in institutionalized populations or with neurological and cognitive diseases will be excluded. This systematic review protocol follows the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The searches will be carried out in the Pubmed, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences), Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro, using the Search equation: climacteric women/menopause and PFMT and (sexual function or sexual dysfunction). The assessment of methodological quality will be carried out using the Pedro and GRADE scale, which will involve two independent researchers to evaluate the criteria. A third researcher will resolve discrepancies. Ethics and disclosure Ethical approval is not required as this is a secondary data study. This systematic review began in April 2024 and all steps are expected to be completed by November 2024. PROSPERO registration number CRD42024534297

                Background This socio-economic analysis studies the influence of jasmine production on the economic well-being of farmers in Huvina Hadagali, a region known for its high-quality jasmine flowers. The Vijaya Nagara district’s Havina Hadagali area is well known throughout the country for its jasmine flower farming. In addition to being referred to as Mallige Nadu, this location is also known as Malligeya Tavaru. The cultivation of the jasmine flower is protected by the Geographical Indication (GI) Tag, and this flower has been popular in this region for a substantial amount of time. Methods Data was collected from a sample of 364 jasmine growers using a structured questionnaire in Huvina Hadagali, Vijayanagar district. The data focused on different socio-economic factors such as income levels, employment, market access, and agricultural techniques. The study is analysed using IBM SPSS through frequency analysis and 2-step clustering. Result The results demonstrate that the cultivation of jasmine makes a substantial contribution to the local economy, serving as a main or additional source of income for numerous households. Jasmine farming often contributes 40% of the whole household income, and during peak seasons, it provides significant economic advantages. Nevertheless, the highlighted obstacles were volatile market pricing, pest infestations, and limited access to contemporary farming practices. The study emphasises the crucial significance of cooperative societies and local marketplaces in stabilising income and offering essential resources and training to farmers. Conclusion The research highlights the necessity of governmental interventions focused on developing market infrastructure, offering financial assistance, and improving access to agricultural innovations to maintain and augment the economic advantages of jasmine cultivation in Huvina Hadagali.

                Abstract* Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods This scoping review aims to assess the current evidence on the effects and safety of PCL in pediatric surgery. A multi-database search strategy would be used, with eligibility criteria including recent original English articles on pediatric PCL. Data extraction would focus on PCL type, sample sizes, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 10 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies showed that PCL improved metabolic outcome and reduced postoperative recovery time. However, outcomes like hospital stay length and postoperative complications, such as nausea and vomiting, varied. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery may stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and enhance recovery, including anxiety reduction.

                Background Trichoderma spp. hold significant potential as biocontrol agents in agriculture due to their antagonistic properties against plant pathogens. The study aimed to characterize and identify Trichoderma isolates from rhizospheric regions of vegetable crops. Methods In this study, Trichoderma isolates were collected from rhizospheric soil samples of vegetable crops from different ecological zones and were selected for comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization. The isolates were visually assessed for colony color, growth pattern, aerial mycelium presence, phialide and conidial morphology, and chlamydospore presence. Molecular analysis was employed based on ITS and tef-1α sequences. Diversity indices were also computed for different ecological zones. Results The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic trees for both regions provided a clear species resolution, with four main clades: Harzianum, Viride, Brevicompactum and Longibrachiatum with 12 species T. harzinaum, T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. inhamatum, T. camerunense, T. azevedoi, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. asperelloides, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. brevicompactum and nine species as a new country record. Diversity indices indicated that high mountain regions displayed the highest species diversity and evenness (H = 1.724 [0.28], J = 0.84, D = 0.28), followed by hilly regions (H = 1.563 [0.28], J = 0.72, D = 0.28). Plains, on the other hand, exhibited lower species diversity (H = 1.515, J = 0.66, D = 0.33). The calculated species abundance values showed that plains (E = 2.11), mid-hills (E = 1.95), and high mountains (E = 1.99) each had their unique diversity profiles. Notably, T. afroharzianum and T. asperellum were predominant. Conclusions Overall, the study unveiled a rich diversity of Trichoderma species in different agricultural zones of Nepal. These findings shed light on the ecological distribution and diversity of Trichoderma spp., which could have significant implications for sustainable agriculture and biological control strategies.

                RNA-binding protein Fused-in Sarcoma (FUS) plays an essential role in various cellular processes. Mutations in the C-terminal domain region, where the nuclear localization signal (NLS) is located, causes the redistribution of FUS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In neurons, neurotoxic aggregates are formed as a result, contributing to neurogenerative diseases. Well-characterized anti-FUS antibodies would enable the reproducibility of FUS research, thereby benefiting the scientific community. In this study, we characterized ten FUS commercial antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

                Background Cancer and its management can incur high costs, high risks and high demand. In Indonesia, there remains gap in the availability of national cancer data despite the establishment of a National Committee for Cancer Control. Multiple pilot projects have been developed by the Ministry of Health to improve the delivery of care, including interventions utilising digital health approaches and integrated referral information systems. However, it is not yet clear to what extent these approaches influence patient management or the experience of cancer patients themselves. This research aims to explore the current role of health information technology (HIT) in the provision of services and treatments for patients with cancer from primary to tertiary healthcare centres in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Methods The study will adopt an observational mixed-methods single case study design of health facilities involved in the delivery of cancer services in a sub-national health system. We will collect data through face-to-face interviews with a range of health professionals involved in the delivery of cancer care. Patients will be interviewed to share their views and experiences of the existing cancer referral system and communication with health facilities. Alongside interviews, we will undertake an analysis of routine data from participating health facilities to assess gaps in existing information systems. Data analysis will include framework analysis for qualitative data alongside descriptive analyses of quantitative data. Findings will be used to inform conceptual maps to be presented as part of Theory of Change workshops focused on understanding how the existing cancer referral system works, why and for whom, with a focus on future refinement and intervention development. Conclusion Our findings will inform critical thinking around the design, implementation, adaptation, and evaluation of existing systems. Through early engagement and participation of key stakeholders and project partners, we intend that findings will have immediate utility.

Triploidy is very useful in both aquaculture and some cultivated plants as the induced sterility helps to enhance growth and product quality, as well as acting as a barrier against the contamination of wild populations by escapees. To use genetic information from triploids for academic or breeding purposes, an efficient and robust method to genotype triploids is needed. We developed such a method for genotype calling from SNP arrays, and we implemented it in the R package named GenoTriplo. Our method requires no prior information on cluster positions and remains unaffected by shifted luminescence signals. The method relies on starting the clustering algorithm with an initial higher number of groups than expected from the ploidy level of the samples, followed by merging groups that are too close to each other to be considered as distinct genotypes. Accurate classification of SNPs is achieved through multiple thresholds of quality controls. We compared the performance of GenoTriplo with that of fitPoly, the only published method for triploid SNP genotyping with a free software access. This was assessed by comparing the genotypes generated by both methods for a dataset of 1232 triploid rainbow trout genotyped for 38,033 SNPs. The two methods were consistent for 89% of the genotypes, but for 26% of the SNPs, they exhibited a discrepancy in the number of different genotypes identified. For these SNPs, GenoTriplo had >95% concordance with fitPoly when fitPoly genotyped better. On the contrary, when GenoTriplo genotyped better, fitPoly had less than 50% concordance with GenoTriplo. GenoTriplo was more robust with less genotyping errors. It is also efficient at identifying low-frequency genotypes in the sample set. Finally, we assessed parentage assignment based on GenoTriplo genotyping and observed significant differences in mismatch rates between the best and second-best couples, indicating high confidence in the results. GenoTriplo could also be used to genotype diploids as well as individuals with higher ploidy level by adjusting a few input parameters.

Advances in bioinformatics are primarily due to new algorithms for processing diverse biological data sources. While sophisticated alignment algorithms have been pivotal in analyzing biological sequences, deep learning has substantially transformed bioinformatics, addressing sequence, structure, and functional analyses. However, these methods are incredibly data-hungry, compute-intensive, and hard to interpret. Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has recently emerged as an exciting alternative. The key idea is that random vectors of high dimensionality can represent concepts such as sequence identity or phylogeny. These vectors can then be combined using simple operators for learning, reasoning, or querying by exploiting the peculiar properties of high-dimensional spaces. Our work reviews and explores HDC’s potential for bioinformatics, emphasizing its efficiency, interpretability, and adeptness in handling multimodal and structured data. HDC holds great potential for various omics data searching, biosignal analysis, and health applications.

                <p>by Yidi Sun, Albert Yeam, Jonathan Kuo, Yuichiro Iwamoto, Gean Hu, David G. Drubin</p>

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a critical trafficking process that begins when an elaborate endocytic protein network is established at the plasma membrane. Interaction of early endocytic proteins with anionic phospholipids and/or cargo has been suggested to trigger CME initiation. However, the exact mechanism by which CME sites are initiated has not been fully elucidated. In the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, higher levels of anionic phospholipids and cargo molecules exist in the newly formed daughter cell compared to the levels in the mother cell during polarized growth. Taking advantage of this asymmetry, we quantitatively compared CME proteins in <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> mother versus daughter cells, observing differences in the dynamics and composition of key endocytic proteins. Our results show that CME site initiation occurs preferentially on regions of the plasma membrane with a relatively higher density of endocytic cargo and/or acidic phospholipids. Furthermore, our combined live cell-imaging and yeast genetics analysis provided evidence for a molecular mechanism in which CME sites are initiated when Yap1801 and Yap1802 (yeast CALM/AP180) and Syp1 (yeast FCHo1/2) coordinate with anionic phospholipids and cargo molecules to trigger Ede1 (yeast Eps15)-centric CME initiation complex assembly at the plasma membrane.

Neural activity and behavior vary within an individual (states) and between individuals (traits). However, the mapping of state-trait neural variation to behavior is not well understood. To address this gap, we quantify moment-to-moment changes in brain-wide co-activation patterns derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. In healthy young adults, we identify reproducible spatiotemporal features of co-activation patterns at the single-subject level. We demonstrate that a joint analysis of state-trait neural variations and feature reduction reveal general motifs of individual differences, encompassing state-specific and general neural features that exhibit day-to-day variability. The principal neural variations co-vary with the principal variations of behavioral phenotypes, highlighting cognitive function, emotion regulation, alcohol and substance use. Person-specific probability of occupying a particular co-activation pattern is reproducible and associated with neural and behavioral features. This combined analysis of state-trait variations holds promise for developing reproducible neuroimaging markers of individual life functional outcome.

Bats are reservoirs of many zoonotic viruses that are fatal in humans but do not cause disease in bats. Moreover, bats generate low neutralizing antibody titers in response to experimental viral infection, although more robust antibody responses have been observed in wild-caught bats during times of food stress. Here, we compared the antibody titers and B cell receptor (BCR) diversity of Jamaican fruit bats (<i>Artibeus jamaicensis</i>; JFBs) and BALB/c mice generated in response to T-dependent and T-independent antigens. We then manipulated the diet of JFBs and challenged them with H18N11 influenza A-like virus or a replication incompetent Nipah virus VSV (Nipah-riVSV). Under standard housing conditions, JFBs generated a lower avidity antibody response and possessed more BCR mRNA diversity compared to BALB/c mice. However, withholding protein from JFBs improved serum neutralization in response to Nipah-riVSV and improved serum antibody titers specific to H18 but reduced BCR mRNA diversity.

Dopamine-based reward and learning mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to placebo effects. However, the exact role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in their generation and maintenance is still unclear. This study aimed to shed light on the causal role of dopamine in establishing positive treatment expectations, as well as on the magnitude and duration of their effect on pain. To this end, we used an established placebo analgesia paradigm in combination with 2 opposing pharmacological modulations of dopaminergic tone, i.e., the dopamine antagonist sulpiride and the dopamine precursor L-dopa which were both applied in an experimental, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a between-subject design in <i>N</i> = 168 healthy volunteers. The study medication successfully altered dopaminergic tone during the conditioning procedure. Contrary to our hypotheses, the medication did not modulate the formation of positive treatment expectation and placebo analgesia tested 1 day later. Placebo analgesia was no longer detectable on day 8 after conditioning. Using a combined frequentist and Bayesian approach, our data provide strong evidence against a direct dopaminergic influence on the generation and maintenance of placebo effects. Further exploration of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia remains paramount in the quest to exploit these effects for optimal treatment outcomes.

Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in the regulation and evolution of host–virus interactions. Here, we conducted a genome-wide arrayed CRISPR knockout screen in the presence and absence of IFN to identify human genes that influence Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We then performed an integrated analysis of genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2, drawing from a selection of 67 large-scale studies, including our own. We identified 28 genes of high relevance in both human genetic studies of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and functional genetic screens in cell culture, with many related to the IFN pathway. Among these was the IFN-stimulated gene <i>PLSCR1</i>. PLSCR1 did not require IFN induction to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and did not contribute to IFN signaling. Instead, PLSCR1 specifically restricted spike-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry. The PLSCR1-mediated restriction was alleviated by TMPRSS2 overexpression, suggesting that PLSCR1 primarily restricts the endocytic entry route. In addition, recent SARS-CoV-2 variants have adapted to circumvent the PLSCR1 barrier via currently undetermined mechanisms. Finally, we investigate the functional effects of PLSCR1 variants present in humans and discuss an association between PLSCR1 and severe COVID-19 reported recently.

                <p>by Richard A. Stewart, Zhihao Ding, Ung Seop Jeon, Lauren B. Goodman, Jeannine J. Tran, John P. Zientko, Malavika Sabu, Ken M. Cadigan</p>

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays numerous essential roles in animal development and tissue/stem cell maintenance. The activation of genes regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling requires the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, a transcriptional co-activator. β-catenin is recruited to many Wnt-regulated enhancers through direct binding to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family transcription factors. β-catenin has previously been reported to form phase-separated biomolecular condensates (BMCs), which was implicated as a component of β-catenin’s mechanism of action. This function required aromatic amino acid residues in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N- and C-termini of the protein. In this report, we further explore a role for β-catenin BMCs in Wnt target gene regulation. We find that β-catenin BMCs are miscible with LEF1 BMCs in vitro and in cultured cells. We characterized a panel of β-catenin mutants with different combinations of aromatic residue mutations in human cell culture and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Our data support a model in which aromatic residues across both IDRs contribute to BMC formation and signaling activity. Although different Wnt targets have different sensitivities to loss of β-catenin’s aromatic residues, the activation of every target examined was compromised by aromatic substitution. These mutants are not defective in nuclear import or co-immunoprecipitation with several β-catenin binding partners. In addition, residues in the N-terminal IDR with no previously known role in signaling are clearly required for the activation of various Wnt readouts. Consistent with this, deletion of the N-terminal IDR results in a loss of signaling activity, which can be rescued by the addition of heterologous IDRs enriched in aromatic residues. Overall, our work supports a model in which the ability of β-catenin to form biomolecular condensates in the nucleus is tightly linked to its function as a transcriptional co-regulator.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The brain changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include Abeta (Aβ) amyloid plaques (“A”), abnormally phosphorylated tau tangles (“T”), and neurodegeneration (“N”). These have been used to construct in vivo and postmortem diagnostic and staging classifications for evaluating the spectrum of AD in the “ATN” and “ABC” (“B” for Braak tau stage, “C” for Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease [CERAD] neuritic plaque density) systems. Another common AD feature involves cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We report the first experiment to examine relationships among cognition, brain distribution of amyloid plaques, CAA, tau/tangles, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-determined volume changes (as a measure of “N”) in the same group of behaviorally characterized nonhuman primates. Both ATN and ABC systems were applied to a group of 32 rhesus macaques aged between 7 and 33 years. When an immunohistochemical method for “T” and “B” was used, some monkeys were “triple positive” on ATN, with a maximum ABC status of A1B2C3. With silver or thioflavin S methods, however, all monkeys were classified as T-negative and B0, indicating the absence of mature neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and hence neuropathologically defined AD. Although monkeys at extremes of the ATN and ABC classifications, or with frequent CAA, had significantly lower scores on some cognitive tests, the lack of fully mature NFTs or dementia-consistent cognitive impairment indicates that fully developed AD may not occur in rhesus macaques. There were sex differences noted in the types of histopathology present, and only CAA was significantly related to gray matter volume.</p>

<p>High motor impulsivity is associated with low cortico-striatal function. Chemogenetic restoration of cortico-striatal activity in high-impulsive rats reduces their exacerbated motor impulsivity, without affecting risky decision-making.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders (SUD) are characterized by exacerbated motor and risk-related impulsivities, which are associated with decreased cortical activity. In rodents, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been separately implicated in impulsive behaviors, but studies on the specific role of the mPFC-NAc pathway in these behaviors are limited. Here, we investigated whether heightened impulsive behaviors are associated with reduced mPFC activity in rodents and determined the involvement of the mPFC-NAc pathway in motor and risk-related impulsivities. We used the Roman High- (RHA) and Low-Avoidance (RLA) rat lines, which display divergent phenotypes in impulsivity. To investigate alterations in cortical activity in relation to impulsivity, regional brain glucose metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography and [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG). Using chemogenetics, the activity of the mPFC-NAc pathway was either selectively activated in high-impulsive RHA rats or inhibited in low-impulsive RLA rats, and the effects of these manipulations on motor and risk-related impulsivity were concurrently assessed using the rat gambling task. We showed that basal [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake was lower in the mPFC and NAc of RHA compared to RLA rats. Activation of the mPFC-NAc pathway in RHA rats reduced motor impulsivity, without affecting risk-related decision-making. Conversely, inhibition of the mPFC-NAc pathway had no effect in RLA rats. Our results suggest that the mPFC-NAc pathway controls motor impulsivity, but has limited involvement in risk-related decision-making in our current model. Our findings suggest that reducing fronto-striatal activity may help attenuate motor impulsivity in patients with impulse control dysregulation.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Fatally injured neurons may necrose and rupture immediately, or they may initiate a programmed cell death pathway and then wait for microglial phagocytosis. Biochemical and histopathologic assays of neuronal death assess the numbers of neurons awaiting phagocytosis at a particular time point after injury. This number varies with the fraction of neurons that have necrosed vs initiated programmed cell death, the time elapsed since injury, the rate of phagocytosis, and the assay’s ability to detect neurons at different stages of programmed cell death. Many of these variables can be altered by putatively neurotoxic and neuroprotective interventions independent of the effects on neuronal death. This complicates analyses of neurotoxicity and neuroprotection and has likely contributed to difficulties with clinical translation of neuroprotective strategies after brain injury. Time-resolved assays of neuronal health, such as ongoing expression of transgenic fluorescent proteins, are a useful means of avoiding these problems.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Deficits in learning and memory are some of the most commonly reported symptoms following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). We will examine whether the neural basis of these deficits stems from alterations to bidirectional synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. Although the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus has been a focus of TBI research, the dentate gyrus should also be given attention as it exhibits a unique ability for adult neurogenesis, a process highly susceptible to TBI-induced damage. This review examines our current understanding of how TBI results in deficits in synaptic plasticity, as well as how TBI-induced changes in endocannabinoid (eCB) systems may drive these changes. Through the synthesis and amalgamation of existing data, we propose a possible mechanism for eCB-mediated recovery in synaptic plasticity deficits. This hypothesis is based on the plausible roles of CB1 receptors in regulating inhibitory tone, influencing astrocytes and microglia, and modulating glutamate release. Dysregulation of the eCBs may be responsible for deficits in synaptic plasticity and learning following TBI. Taken together, the existing evidence indicates eCBs may contribute to TBI manifestation, pathogenesis, and recovery, but it also suggests there may be a therapeutic role for the eCB system in TBI.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Down syndrome (DS), a prevalent cognitive disorder resulting from trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), poses a significant global health concern. Affecting approximately 1 in 800 live births worldwide, DS is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and a major predisposing factor for early-onset Alzheimer’s dementia. The estimated global population of individuals with DS is 6 million, with increasing prevalence due to advances in DS health care. Global efforts are dedicated to unraveling the mechanisms behind the varied clinical outcomes in DS. Recent studies on DS mouse models reveal disrupted neuronal circuits, providing insights into DS pathologies. Yet, translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limited systematic electrophysiological analyses directly comparing human and mouse. Additionally, disparities in experimental procedures between the two species pose hurdles to successful translation. This review provides a concise overview of neuronal oscillations in human and rodent cognition. Focusing on recent DS mouse model studies, we highlight disruptions in associated brain function. We discuss various electrophysiological paradigms and suggest avenues for exploring molecular dysfunctions contributing to DS-related cognitive impairments. Deciphering neuronal oscillation intricacies holds promise for targeted therapies to alleviate cognitive disabilities in DS individuals.

                Chirality is a fundamental trait of living organisms, encompassing the homochirality of biological molecules and the left–right (LR) asymmetry of visceral organs and the brain. The nervous system in bilaterian organisms displays a lateralized organization characterized by the presence of asymmetrical neuronal circuits and brain functions that are predominantly localized within one hemisphere. Although body asymmetry is relatively well understood, and exhibits robust phenotypic expression and regulation via conserved molecular mechanisms across phyla, current findings indicate that the asymmetry of the nervous system displays greater phenotypic, genetic, and evolutionary variability. In this review we explore the use of nematode, zebrafish, and Drosophila genetic models to investigate neuronal circuit asymmetry. We discuss recent discoveries in the context of body–brain concordance and highlight the distinct characteristics of nervous system asymmetry and its cognitive correlates.

                The offline reactivation of hippocampal neuronal activity during sleep is thought to be crucial for memory. We investigated the contribution of dentate spikes to offline reactivation of hippocampal activity patterns and flexible recognition memory by combining triple-ensemble (DG-CA3-CA1) recordings and closed-loop optogenetic feedback in mice undergoing sleep/rest following active exploratory behavior. This work establishes dentate spikes as a second network event that, together with sharp-wave ripples, supports offline hippocampal dynamics for memory-guided behavior.

                Caveolae are small membrane pits with fundamental roles in mechanotransduction. Several studies have shown that caveolae flatten out in response to an increase in membrane tension, thereby acting as a mechanosensitive membrane reservoir that buffers acute mechanical stress. The dynamic assembly and disassembly of caveolae has also been implicated in the control of RhoA/ROCK-mediated actomyosin contractility at the rear of migrating cells. However, how membrane tension controls the organisation of caveolae and caveolae-mediated mechanotransduction is poorly understood. To address this, we systematically quantified protein-protein interactions of caveolin-1 in migrating RPE1 cells at steady state and in response to an acute increase in membrane tension using biotin-based proximity labelling and quantitative mass spectrometry. Our data show that caveolae are highly enriched at the rear of migrating RPE1 cells and that membrane tension rapidly and reversibly disassembles the caveolar protein coat. Membrane tension also dislodges caveolin-1 from focal adhesion proteins and several mechanosensitive cortical actin regulators including filamins and cortactin. In addition, we present evidence that ROCK and the RhoGAP ARHGAP29 are associated with caveolin-1 in a membrane tension-dependent manner, and that ARHGAP29 regulates caveolin-1 Y14 phosphorylation, caveolae rear localisation, and RPE1 cell migration. Taken together, our work uncovers a membrane tension-sensitive coupling between caveolae and the rear-localised F-actin cytoskeleton. This provides a framework for dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying caveolae-regulated mechanotransduction pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93796">Identification of pharmacological inducers of a reversible hypometabolic state for whole organ preservation</a></h4>

              
                Drugs that induce reversible slowing of metabolic and physiological processes would have great value for organ preservation, especially for organs with high susceptibility to hypoxia-reperfusion injury, such as the heart. Using whole-organism screening of metabolism, mobility, and development in <i>Xenopus</i>, we identified an existing drug, SNC80, that rapidly and reversibly slows biochemical and metabolic activities while preserving cell and tissue viability. Although SNC80 was developed as a delta opioid receptor activator, we discovered that its ability to slow metabolism is independent of its opioid modulating activity as a novel SNC80 analog (WB3) with almost 1000 times less delta opioid receptor binding activity is equally active. Metabolic suppression was also achieved using SNC80 in microfluidic human organs-on-chips, as well as in explanted whole porcine hearts and limbs, demonstrating the cross-species relevance of this approach and potential clinical relevance for surgical transplantation. Pharmacological induction of physiological slowing in combination with organ perfusion transport systems may offer a new therapeutic approach for tissue and organ preservation for transplantation, trauma management, and enhancing patient survival in remote and low-resource locations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91102">Distractor effects in decision making are related to the individual’s style of integrating choice attributes</a></h4>

              
                Humans make irrational decisions in the presence of irrelevant distractor options. There is little consensus on whether decision making is facilitated or impaired by the presence of a highly rewarding distractor, or whether the distractor effect operates at the level of options’ component attributes rather than at the level of their overall value. To reconcile different claims, we argue that it is important to consider the diversity of people’s styles of decision making and whether choice attributes are combined in an additive or multiplicative way. Employing a multi-laboratory dataset investigating the same experimental paradigm, we demonstrated that people used a mix of both approaches and the extent to which approach was used varied across individuals. Critically, we identified that this variability was correlated with the distractor effect during decision making. Individuals who tended to use a multiplicative approach to compute value, showed a positive distractor effect. In contrast, a negative distractor effect (divisive normalisation) was prominent in individuals tending towards an additive approach. Findings suggest that the distractor effect is related to how value is constructed, which in turn may be influenced by task and subject specificities. This concurs with recent behavioural and neuroscience findings that multiple distractor effects co-exist.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89131">When and why does motor preparation arise in recurrent neural network models of motor control?</a></h4>

              
                During delayed ballistic reaches, motor areas consistently display movement-specific activity patterns prior to movement onset. It is unclear why these patterns arise: while they have been proposed to seed an initial neural state from which the movement unfolds, recent experiments have uncovered the presence and necessity of ongoing inputs during movement, which may lessen the need for careful initialization. Here, we modeled the motor cortex as an input-driven dynamical system, and we asked what the optimal way to control this system to perform fast delayed reaches is. We find that delay-period inputs consistently arise in an optimally controlled model of M1. By studying a variety of network architectures, we could dissect and predict the situations in which it is beneficial for a network to prepare. Finally, we show that optimal input-driven control of neural dynamics gives rise to multiple phases of preparation during reach sequences, providing a novel explanation for experimentally observed features of monkey M1 activity in double reaching.

">BrainScale: Enabling Scalable Online Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain simulation stands as one of the most ambitious endeavors of our time, yet it remains constrained by significant technical challenges. A critical obstacle in this pursuit is the absence of a scalable online learning framework capable of supporting the efficient training of complex, diverse, and large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs). To address this limitation, we introduce BrainScale, a framework specifically designed to enable scalable online learning in SNNs. BrainScale achieves three key advancements for scalability. (1) Model diversity: BrainScale accommodates the complex dynamics of brain function by supporting a wide spectrum of SNNs through a streamlined abstraction of synaptic interactions. (2) Efficient scaling: Leveraging SNN intrinsic characteristics, BrainScale achieves an online learning algorithm with linear memory complexity. (3) User-friendly programming: BrainScale provides a programming environment that automates the derivation and execution of online learning computations for any user-defined models. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate BrainScale's efficiency and robustness, showing a hundred-fold improvement in memory utilization and several-fold acceleration in training speed while maintaining performance on long-term dependency tasks and neuromorphic datasets. These results suggest that BrainScale represents a crucial step towards brain-scale SNN training and whole-brain simulation.

">Hyperexcitability precedes CA3 hippocampal neurodegeneration in a dox-regulatable TDP-43 mouse model of ALS-FTD.</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal hyperexcitability is a hallmark of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but its relationship with the TDP-43 aggregates that comprise the predominant pathology in over 90% of ALS cases remains unclear. Emerging evidence in tissue and slice culture models indicate that TDP-43 pathology induces neuronal hyperexcitability suggesting it may be responsible for the excitotoxicity long believed to be a major driver of ALS neuron death. Here, we characterized hyperexcitability and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of doxycycline-regulatable rNLS8 mice (NEFH-tTA x tetO-hTDP-43deltaNLS), followed by treatment with AAV encoded DREADDs and anti-seizure medications to measure the effect on behavioral function and neurodegeneration. We found that approximately half of the CA3 neurons in the dorsal hippocampus are lost between 4 and 6 weeks after TDP-43deltaNLS induction. Neurodegeneration was preceded by selective hyperexcitability in the mossy fiber-CA3 circuit, leading us to hypothesize that glutamate excitotoxicity may be a significant contributor to neurodegeneration in this model. Interestingly, hippocampal injection of AAV encoded inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) and daily activation with CNO ligand rescued anxiety deficits on elevated zero maze (EZM) but did not reduce neurodegeneration. Therapeutic doses of the anti-seizure medications, valproic acid and levetiracetam, did not improve behavior or prevent neurodegeneration. These results highlight the complexity of TDP-43 -induced alterations to neuronal excitability and suggest that whereas targeting hyperexcitability can meliorate some behavioral deficits, it may not be sufficient to halt or slow neurodegeneration in TDP-43-related proteinopathies.

">Adipocyte metabolic state regulates glial phagocytic function</a></h4>

              
                Obesity and type 2 diabetes are well-established risk factors for neurodegenerative disorders, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The adipocyte-brain axis is crucial for brain function, as adipocytes secrete signaling molecules, including lipids and adipokines, that impinge on neural circuits to regulate feeding and energy expenditure. Disruptions in the adipocyte-brain axis are associated with neurodegenerative conditions, but the causal links are not fully understood. Neural debris accumulates with age and injury, and glial phagocytic function is crucial for clearing this debris and maintaining a healthy brain microenvironment. Using adult Drosophila, we investigate how adipocyte metabolism influences glial phagocytic activity in the brain. We demonstrate that a prolonged obesogenic diet increases adipocyte fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Genetic manipulations that mimic obesogenic diet-induced changes in adipocyte lipid and mitochondrial metabolism unexpectedly reduce the expression of the phagocytic receptor Draper in Drosophila microglia-like cells in the brain. We identify Apolpp, the Drosophila equivalent of human apolipoprotein B (ApoB), as a critical adipocyte-derived signal that regulates glial phagocytosis. Additionally, we show that Lipoprotein Receptor 1 (LpR1), the LDL receptor on phagocytic glia, is required for glial capacity to clear injury-induced neuronal debris. Our findings establish that adipocyte-brain lipoprotein signaling regulates glial phagocytic function, revealing a novel pathway that links adipocyte metabolic disorders with neurodegeneration.

">Phonological decoding ability is associated with fiber density of the left arcuate fasciculus longitudinally across reading development</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have linked reading ability to white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging, but recent large studies have failed to show consistency. Fiber-specific diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) models offer enhanced precision to measure specific features of white matter structure and may be more sensitive to individual differences in reading skills. However, fiber-specific models have not yet been applied to examine associations between reading ability and white matter microstructure over the course of reading acquisition. In this accelerated longitudinal study, we applied constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and fiber-specific modelling to characterize developmental changes in fiber density of key white matter tracts of the reading network bilaterally, and investigated associations between tract-wise fiber density and children's phonological decoding abilities. Fiber density was measured from ages 2-13 years, and decoding ability (pseudoword reading) was assessed at ages 6 years and older. Higher decoding ability was associated with greater fiber density in the left arcuate fasciculus, and effects remained consistent over time. Follow-up analysis revealed that asymmetry changes in the arcuate fasciculus were moderated by decoding ability: good decoders showed leftward asymmetry from early childhood onward, while poorer decoders shifted toward leftward asymmetry over time. These results suggest that densely organized fibers in the left arcuate fasciculus serve as a foundation for the development of reading skills from the pre-reading stage through fluent reading. Ongoing developmental changes in fiber density and microstructural asymmetry throughout childhood may reflect a reciprocal relationship in which reading experience continues to refine and strengthen these pathways.

">An integrative analysis of cell-specific transcriptomics and nuclear proteomics of sleep-deprived mouse cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sleep regulation follows a homeostatic pattern. The mammalian cerebral cortex is the repository of homeostatic sleep drive and neurons and astrocytes of the cortex are principal responders of sleep need. The molecular mechanisms by which these two cell types respond to sleep loss are not yet clearly understood. By combining cell-type specific transcriptomics and nuclear proteomics we investigated how sleep loss affects the cellular composition and molecular profiles of these two cell types in a focused approach. The results indicate that sleep deprivation regulates gene expression and nuclear protein abundance in a cell-type-specific manner. Our integrated multi-omics analysis suggests that this distinction arises because neurons and astrocytes employ different gene regulatory strategies under accumulated sleep pressure. These findings provide a comprehensive view of the effects of sleep deprivation on gene regulation in neurons and astrocytes.

">Transcriptomic and histological characterization of telocytes in the human dorsal root ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Telocytes are interstitial cells with long processes that cover distances in tissues and likely coordinate interacts with other cell types. Though present in central and peripheral neuronal tissues, their role remains unclear. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) house pseudounipolar afferent neurons responsible for signals such as temperature, proprioception and nociception. This study aimed to investigate the presence and function of telocytes in human DRG by investigating their transcriptional profile, location and ultrastructure. Sequencing data revealed CD34 and PDGFRA expressing cells comprise roughly 1.5-3% of DRG cells. Combined expression of CD34 and PDGFRA is a putative marker gene set for telocytes. Further analysis identified nine subclusters with enriched cluster-specific genes. KEGG and GO pathway analysis suggested vascular, immune and connective tissue associated putative telocyte subtypes. Over 3000 potential receptor-ligand interactions between sensory neurons and these CD34 and PDGFRA expressing putative telocytes were identified using a ligand-receptors interactome platform. Immunohisto-chemistry showed CD34+ telocytes in the endoneural space of DRGs, next to neuron-satellite complexes, in perivascular spaces and in the endoneural space between nerve fibre bundles, consistent with pathway analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed their location identifying characteristic elongated nucleus, long and thin telopods containing vesicles, surrounded by a basal lamina. This is the first study that provides gene expression analysis of telocytes in complex human tissue such as the DRG, highlighting functional differences based on tissue location with no significant ultrastructural variation.

">Elevated synaptic PKA activity and abnormal striatal dopamine signaling in Akap11 mutant mice, a genetic model of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in AKAP11 (a protein kinase A (PKA)-binding protein) greatly increase the risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. We conducted multi-omic analyses of Akap11 mutant mouse brains and report the neurobiological functions of AKAP11 and the consequences of its absence. AKAP11 interacts with multiple proteins involved in signaling and proteostasis. In Akap11+/- and Akap11-/- synapses, PKA protein levels were markedly elevated, and many synaptic proteins were hyperphosphorylated at PKA substrate sites. Akap11 mutant brains showed extensive transcriptomic changes, prominently in synapse-related gene-sets and most profoundly in neurons of the striatum, a brain region implicated in motivation, cognition and psychiatric disorders. In vivo, real-time measurements of PKA activity in Akap11-/- revealed constitutively elevated kinase activity, which distorts the dynamic range of dopamine to PKA signaling in the striatum. Our work reveals the molecular basis of circuit dysfunction in a genetically valid model of psychotic disorder.

                Calcium fluorescence imaging enables us to investigate how individual neurons of live animals encode sensory input or drive specific behaviors. Extracting and interpreting large-scale neuronal activity from imaging data are crucial steps in harnessing this information. A significant challenge arises from uncorrectable tissue deformation, which disrupts the effectiveness of existing neuron segmentation methods. Here, we propose an open-source software, DynamicNeuronTracker (DyNT), which generates dynamic neuron masks for deforming and/or incompletely registered 3D calcium imaging data using patch-matching iterations. We demonstrate that DyNT accurately tracks densely populated neurons, whereas a widely used static segmentation method often produces erroneous masks. DyNT also includes automated statistical analyses for interpreting neuronal responses to multiple sequential stimuli. We applied DyNT to analyze the responses of pheromone-sensing neurons in mice to controlled stimulation. We found that four bile acids and four sulfated steroids activated 15 subpopulations of sensory neurons with distinct combinatorial response profiles, revealing a strong bias toward detecting sulfated estrogen and pregnanolone.

">Which perceptual categories do observers experience during multistable perception?</a></h4>

              
                Multistable perceptual phenomena provide insights into the mind's dynamic states within a stable external environment and the neural underpinnings of these consciousness changes are often studied with binocular rivalry. Conventional methods to study binocular rivalry suffer from biases and assumptions that limit their ability to describe the continuous nature of this perceptual transitions and to discover what kind of percept was perceived across time. In this study, we propose a novel way to avoid those shortcomings by combining a continuous psychophysical method that estimates introspection during binocular rivalry with machine learning clustering and transition probability analysis. This combination of techniques reveals individual variability and complexity of perceptual experience in 28 normally sighted participants. Also, the analysis of transition probabilities between perceptual categories, i.e., exclusive and different kinds of mixed percepts, suggest that interocular perceptual competition, triggered by low-level stimuli, involves conflict between monocular and binocular neural processing sites rather than mutual inhibition of monocular sites.

">Transcriptome profiling of dopaminergic neurons derived from an ADHD induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model</a></h4>

              
                The most recent ADHD GWAS meta analysis highlighted the potential role of 76 genes enriched among genes expressed in early brain development and associated with midbrain dopaminergic neurons. However, the precise functional importance of the GWAS-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remain unknown. In contrast to GWAS, transcriptome analysis directly investigates gene products by assessing the transcribed RNA. This allows one to gain functional insights into gene expression paving the way for a better understanding of the molecular risk mechanisms of conditions, such as ADHD. In this study, we performed transcriptome profiling of highly homogeneous dopamine neurons developed from induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) that were derived from an individual with ADHD and a neurotypical comparison individual. Comparative gene expression analysis between the examined lines revealed that the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly associated with nervous system functions related to neuronal development and dopaminergic regulation. Notably, 29 of the DEGs overlapped with those identified by ADHD GWAS meta analysis. These genes are overrepresented in biological processes including developmental growth regulation, axonogenesis, and nervous system development. In addition, gene set analysis revealed significant enrichment for meta categories such as ion channel activity, synaptic function and assembly, neuronal development and cell differentiation. Further, we observed significantly reduced projections in the ADHD dopamine neurons at the mid differentiation stage (day 14 in vitro), providing preliminary support for the delayed neuronal maturation hypotheses of ADHD. This study underscores the potential of using iPSC derived cell type specific models that integrate genome and transcriptome analyses for biological discovery in ADHD.

">Navigating Memorability Landscapes: Hyperbolic Geometry Reveals Hierarchical Structures in Object Concept Memory</a></h4>

              
                Why are some object concepts (e.g., birds, cars, vegetables, etc.) more memorable than others? Prior studies have suggested that features (e.g., color, animacy, etc.) and typicality (e.g., robin vs. penguin) of object images influences the likelihood of being remembered. However, a complete understanding of object memorability remains elusive. In this study, we examine whether the geometric relationship between object concepts explains differences in their memorability. Specifically, we hypothesize that image concepts will be geometrically arranged in hierarchical structures and that memorability will be explained by a concept's depth in these hierarchical trees. To test this hypothesis, we construct a Hyperbolic representation space of object concepts (N=1,854) from the THINGS database (Hebart et al., 2019), which consists of naturalistic images of concrete objects, and a space of 49 feature dimensions derived from data-driven models. Using ALBATROSS (Stier et al., In prep), a stochastic topological data analysis technique that detects underlying structures of data, we demonstrate that Hyperbolic geometry efficiently captures the hierarchical organization of object concepts above and beyond a traditional Euclidean geometry and that hierarchical organization is related to memorability. We find that concepts closer to the center of the representational space are more prototypical and also more memorable. Importantly, Hyperbolic distances are more predictive of memorability and prototypicality than Euclidean distances, suggesting that concept memorability and typicality are organized hierarchically. Taken together, our work presents a novel hierarchical representational structure of object concepts that explains memorability and typicality.

                MicroRNAs are small, highly conserved non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate mRNA translation and stability. In the brain, microRNAs contribute to neuronal development, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. The microRNA 138-5p (miR-138-5p) controls inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and is highly expressed in cerebellar excitatory neurons. However, its role in cerebellar synaptic transmission remains unkwown. Here, we investigated excitatory transmission within the cerebellum in mice expressing a sponge construct that sequesters endogenous miR-138-5p. Mossy fiber stimulation-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in granule cells were significantly larger compared with controls. Furthermore, we observed larger miniature EPSC amplitudes, suggesting increased postsynaptic AMPA receptor numbers. High-frequency train stimulations revealed enhanced short-term depression following miR-138-5p downregulation. Together with computational modelling, this suggests a negative regulation of presynaptic release probability. Overall, our results demonstrate that miR-138-5p suppresses synaptic strength through pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, providing a powerful mechanism for tuning excitatory synaptic input into the cerebellum.

">Cardiac responses to auditory irregularities reveal hierarchical information processing during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to process environmental stimuli varies during sleep. Although much research focused on neural processing, emerging evidence shows that bodily signals may play a key role in understanding high-level sensory processing during sleep. Here, we tested how cardiac responses to the local-global paradigm, a typical oddball task probing the processing of simple (local) and complex (global) sensory irregularities. To do so, we analyzed electrocardiography (ECG) signals in a total of 56 participants from two existing datasets which contained cerebral responses to local auditory irregularities, but which did not analyze the ECG data before. We found that cardiac activity slowed down after global, but not local, auditory irregularities, revealing the presence of global deviance effect in Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, cardiac activity was faster after local, but not global, deviants in Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. Overall, our results demonstrate that cardiac responses to auditory irregularities inform about hierarchical information processing and its variations during sleep beyond cerebral activity. They highlight the embodiment of cognitive function and the value of cardiac signals to understand the variations of sensory processing during sleep.

">The electrogenicity of the Na+/K+-ATPase poses challenges for computation in highly active spiking cells</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of the Na+/K+-ATPase laid the foundation for ion homeostasis and electrical signalling. While not required for restoration of ionic gradients, the electrogenicity of the pump (resulting from its 3:2 stoichiometry) is useful to prevent runaway activity. As we show here, electrogenicity also comes with disadvantageous side effects: (1) an activity-dependent shift in a cell's baseline firing and (2) interference with computation, disturbing network entrainment when inputs change strongly. We exemplify these generic effects in a mathematical model of the weakly electric fish electrocyte, which spikes at hundreds of Hz and is exposed to abrupt rate changes when producing behaviourally relevant communication signals. We discuss biophysical strategies allowing cells to mitigate the consequences of electrogenicity at additional metabolic cost and postulate an interesting role for a voltage dependence of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Our work shows that the pump's electrogenicity opens an additional axis of vulnerability that is likely to play a role in brain disease.

">Temporal integration in human auditory cortex is predominantly yoked to absolute time, not structure duration</a></h4>

              
                Sound structures such as phonemes and words have highly variable durations. Thus, there is a fundamental difference between integrating across absolute time (e.g., 100 ms) vs. sound structure (e.g., phonemes). Auditory and cognitive models have traditionally cast neural integration in terms of time and structure, respectively, but the extent to which cortical computations reflect time or structure remains unknown. To answer this question, we rescaled the duration of all speech structures using time stretching/compression and measured integration windows in the human auditory cortex using a new experimental/computational method applied to spatiotemporally precise intracranial recordings. We observed significantly longer integration windows for stretched speech, but this lengthening was very small (~5%) relative to the change in structure durations, even in non-primary regions strongly implicated in speech-specific processing. These findings demonstrate that time-yoked computations dominate throughout the human auditory cortex, placing important constraints on neurocomputational models of structure processing.

">Leg compliance is required to explain the ground reaction force patterns and speed ranges in different gaits</a></h4>

              
                Two simple models, vaulting over stiff legs and rebounding over compliant legs, are employed to describe the mechanics of legged locomotion. It is agreed that compliant legs are necessary for describing running and that legs are compliant while walking. Despite this agreement, stiff legs continue to be employed to model walking. Here, we show that leg compliance is necessary to model walking and, in the process, identify the principles that underpin two important features of legged locomotion: First, at the same speed, step length, and stance duration, multiple gaits that differ in the number of leg contraction cycles are possible. Among them, humans and other animals choose a gait with M-shaped vertical ground reaction forces because it is energetically favored. Second, the transition from walking to running occurs because of the inability to redirect the vertical component of the velocity during the double stance phase. Additionally, we also examine the limits of double spring-loaded pendulum (DSLIP) as a quantitative model for locomotion, and conclude that DSLIP is limited as a model for walking. However, insights gleaned from the analytical treatment of DSLIP are general and will inform the construction of more accurate models of walking.

">Whisker deprivation triggers a distinct form of cortical homeostatic plasticity that is impaired in the Fmr1 KO</a></h4>

              
                Mouse models of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) have demonstrated impairments in excitatory and inhibitory sensory-evoked neuronal firing. Homeostatic plasticity, which encompasses a set of mechanisms to stabilize baseline activity levels, does not compensate for these changes in activity. Previous work has shown that impairments in homeostatic plasticity are observed in FXS, including deficits in synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability. Here, we aimed to examine how homeostatic plasticity is altered in vivo in an Fmr1 KO mouse model following unilateral whisker deprivation (WD). We show that WD in the wild type leads to an increase in the proportion of L5/6 somatosensory neurons that are recruited, but this does not occur in the KO. In addition, we observed a change in the threshold of excitatory neurons at a later developmental stage in the KO. Compromised homeostatic plasticity in development could influence sensory processing and long-term cortical organization.

">Embodied processing in whisker somatosensory cortex during exploratory behaviour in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems have evolved to solve computational challenges that animals face during behaviour in their natural environments. To illuminate how sensory cortex operates under such conditions, we investigated the function of neurons in whisker-related Somatosensory Cortex (wS1) of freely moving mice, engaged in tactile exploratory behaviour. By recording neural activity from wS1 whilst tracking the mouse body in 3D, we found that wS1 neurons are substantially modulated by body state (configuration of individual body-parts and their derivatives), even in the absence of whisker afferent input. Most neurons were modulated by multiple dimensions of body state, with the most prominently encoded being the angle of the head to the body and locomotion speed. Overall, our data suggest that sensory cortex functions as an embodied representation, which integrates signals from its associated sense organ within a body schema.

">Distinct Disruptions in CA1 and CA3 Place Cell Function in Alzheimer's Disease Mice</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus, a critical brain structure for spatial learning and memory, is susceptible to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model is widely used to study the pathology of AD. Although previous research has established AD-associated impairments in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these cognitive dysfunctions remain less understood. To address this gap, we investigated the activities of place cells in both CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subregions, which have distinct yet complementary computational roles. Behaviorally, APP/PS1 mice demonstrated impaired spatial recognition memory compared to wild-type (WT) mice in the object location test. Physiologically, place cells in APP/PS1 mice showed deterioration in spatial representation compared to WT. Specifically, CA1 place cells exhibited significant reductions in coherence and spatial information, while CA3 place cells displayed a significant reduction in place field size. Both CA1 and CA3 place cells in APP/PS1 mice also showed significant disruptions in their ability to stably encode the same environment. Furthermore, the burst firing properties of these cells were altered to forms correlated with reduced cognition. Additionally, the theta rhythm was significantly attenuated in CA1 place cells of APP/PS1 mice compared to WT. Our results suggest that distinct alteration in the physiological properties of CA1 and CA3 place cells, coupled with disrupted hippocampal theta rhythm in CA1, may collectively contribute to impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in AD.

">The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol is released and transported on demand via extracellular microvesicles</a></h4>

              
                While it is known that endocannabinoids (eCB) modulate multiple neuronal functions, the molecular mechanism governing their release and transport remains elusive. Here, we propose an 'on-demand release' model, wherein the formation of microvesicles, a specific group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is the rate-limiting step. A co-culture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, GRABeCB2.0, and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by PKC, DAGL, Arf6, and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors. This 'on demand release' model, supported by mathematical analysis, offers a cohesive framework for understanding eCB signaling at the molecular level and suggests that microvesicles carrying signaling lipids regulate neuronal functions in parallel to canonical synaptic vesicles.

">CX3CR1 modulates migration of resident microglia towards brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). They extend their processes towards and migrate towards injuries in vivo. However, whether the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) influences microglial migration remains unknown. Label-free proteomic profiling predicted changes in RHO-signaling activity that hint at dysregulated cytoskeleton signaling in Cx3cr1-deficient murine cortex tissue. To further investigate microglial migration, we carried out 4-hour interval two-photon in vivo imaging for 72 hours after a laser lesion in the cortex. Cx3cr1-deficient microglia showed enhanced migration towards the lesion. Additionally, length and velocity of microglial fine processes extending towards the lesion were increased in Cx3cr1-deficient microglia. Migration remained unchanged in Ccr2-deficient mice, indicating that monocyte-derived macrophages/microglia did not contribute to microglia accumulation around the lesion. These results demonstrate microglia migration towards CNS injury and suggest CX3CR1 as a modulator of this. Manipulating microglia migration via CX3CR1 therefore is a potential target for treatment of CNS-injury.

">Why do we have so many excitatory neurons?</a></h4>

              
                Approximately four in five neurons are excitatory. This is true across functional regions and species. Why do we have so many excitatory neurons? Little is known. Here we provide a normative answer to this question. We designed a task-agnostic, learning-independent and experiment-testable measurement of functional complexity, which quantifies the network's ability to solve complex problems. Using the first neuron level full connectome of a species - the larva Drosophila - we discovered the optimal Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) ratio that maximizes the functional complexity: 75-81% percentage of neurons are excitatory. This number is consistent with the true distribution observed via scRNA-seq. We found that the abundance of excitatory neurons confers an advantage in functional complexity, but only when inhibitory neurons are highly connected. In contrast, when the E-I identities are sampled uniformly (not dependent on connectivity), the optimal E-I ratio falls around equal population size, and its overall achieved functional complexity is sub-optimal. Our functional complexity measurement offers a normative explanation for the over-abundance of excitatory neurons in the brain. We anticipate that this approach will further uncover the functional significance of various neural network structures.

">Amyloid-β-induced Alteration of Fast and Localized Calcium Elevations in Cultured Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive decline. Uncovering the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in the early stages is essential to establish a treatment for AD. Recent research has proposed the hypothesis that amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) oligomers elicit an excessive glutamate release from astrocytes toward synapses through intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) elevations in astrocytes, finally resulting in neuronal dendritic spine loss. Under physiological conditions, astrocytic [Ca2+]i elevations range spatially from microdomains to network-wide propagation and temporally from milliseconds to tens of seconds. Astrocytic localized and fast [Ca2+]i elevations might correlate with glutamate release; however, the A{beta}-induced alteration of localized, fast astrocytic [Ca2+]i elevations remains unexplored. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the A{beta} dimers-induced changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of [Ca2+]i in a primary culture of astrocytes by two-photon excitation spinning-disk confocal microscopy. The frequency of fast [Ca2+]i elevations occurring locally in astrocytes ([&le;]0.5 s, [&le;]35 m2) and [Ca2+]i event occupancy relative to cell area significantly increased after exposure to A{beta} dimers. The effect of A{beta} dimers appeared dose-dependently above 500 nM, and these A{beta} dimers-induced [Ca2+]i elevations were primarily mediated by a metabotropic purinergic receptor (P2Y1 receptor) and Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Our findings suggest that the A{beta} dimers-induced alterations and hyperactivation of astrocytic [Ca2+]i is a candidate cellular mechanism in the early stages of AD.

">Motor preparation tracks decision boundary crossing in temporal decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Interval timing, the ability of animals to estimate the passage of time, is thought to involve diverse neural processes rather than a single central "clock" (Paton & Buonomano, 2018). Each of the different processes engaged in interval timing follows a different dynamic path, according to its specific function. For example, attention tracks anticipated events, such as offsets of intervals (Rohenkohl & Nobre, 2011), while motor processes control the timing of the behavioral output (De Lafuente et al., 2024). Hence, different processes provide complimentary perspectives on mechanisms of time perception. The temporal bisection task, where participants categorize intervals as "long" or "short", is thought to rely on the same mechanisms as other perceptual decisions (Balci & Simen, 2014). In line with this hypothesis, we previously described an EEG potential that tracks the formation of decision following the end of the timed interval (Ofir & Landau, 2022). Here, we track the dynamics of motor preparation to investigate the formation of decision within the timed interval. In contrast to typical perceptual decisions, where motor plans for all response alternatives are prepared simultaneously (Shadlen & Kiani, 2013), we find that different temporal decisions develop sequentially. While preparation for "long" responses was already underway before interval offset, no preparation was found for "short" responses. Furthermore, within intervals categorized as "long", motor preparation was stronger at interval offset for faster responses. Our findings shed light on the unique dynamics of temporal decisions and demonstrate the importance of considering neural activity in timing tasks from multiple perspectives.

">Effects of age on resting-state cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography recordings of functional brain activity reveal large-scale cortical networks that are associated with cognition. The correlation of individualised networks with age and cognitive performance (age effects and cognitive performance effects respectively) was studied using a large cross-sectional healthy cohort (N=612, 18-88 years old) and accounting for a comprehensive set of confounds. Age effects were found in time-averaged functional networks in five canonical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) that are consistent with the posterior-anterior shift with age observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. Evidence from cognitive performance effects in time-averaged networks suggested the importance of maintaining alpha-band activity for cognitive health. A more detailed description of the functional activity was obtained by adopting an established machine learning approach (the Hidden Markov Model). Ten transient large-scale cortical networks with fast dynamics (~100 ms) were identified, which provided insight into age and cognitive performance effects that were not observed in the time-averaged analyses. The time spent in most networks increased with age, whereas the time spent in frontal networks decreased. The cognitive performance effects for the transient networks suggested that age effects in the frontal networks are compensatory. Thus, our study suggests both the maintenance of functional activity (lesser age effects) and the recruitment of compensatory functional activity can co-occur to produce good cognitive performance in older individuals. The time-averaged and transient functional networks have been made publicly available as a resource.

We demonstrate live imaging of 25 plane 3D volumes of up to 180x180x50um at >100 volumes per second. 3D data is recorded simultaneously by an array of 25 small, sensitive, synchronized machine vision cameras. M25 employs aberration corrected Multifocus microscopy, an optical method where diffractive Fourier optics are used for multiplexing and refocusing light, with a simplified design for chromatic dispersion correction where a corrective diffractive grating is placed on each camera in the array. This elegant architecture for chromatic correction will be applicable in a broad range of diffractive imaging applications. M25 is a powerful optical tool for high speed 3D microscopy in that it allows both non invasive, label free bright field and highly sensitive fluorescence microscopy. We showcase M25 capabilities in 3D particle tracking, bright field and fluorescence imaging in D. melanogaster, and locomotion and neural activity studies in C. elegans.

">Organellular imaging in vivo reveals a depletion of endoplasmic reticular calcium during post-ictal cortical spreading depolarization</a></h4>

              
                During cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), neurons exhibit a dramatic increase in cytosolic calcium, which may be integral to CSD-mediated seizure termination. This calcium increase greatly exceeds that during seizures, suggesting the calcium source may not be solely extracellular. Thus, we sought to determine if the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the largest intracellular calcium store, is involved. We developed a two-photon calcium imaging paradigm to simultaneously record the cytosol and ER during seizures in awake mice. Paired with direct current recording, we reveal that CSD can manifest as a slow post-ictal cytosolic calcium wave with a concomitant depletion of ER calcium that is spatiotemporally consistent with a calcium-induced calcium release. Importantly, we observed both naturally occurring and electrically induced CSD suppressed post-ictal epileptiform activity. Collectively, this work links ER dynamics to CSD, which serves as an innate process for seizure suppression and a potential mechanism underlying therapeutic electrical stimulation for epilepsy.

">A toolbox for ablating excitatory and inhibitory synapses</a></h4>

              
                Recombinant optogenetic and chemogenetic proteins that manipulate neuronal activity are potent tools for activating and inhibiting neuronal circuit function. However, there are few analogous tools for manipulating the structure of neural circuits. Here, we introduce three rationally designed genetically encoded tools that use E3 ligase-dependent mechanisms to trigger the degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins, leading to functional ablation of synapses. First, we developed a constitutive excitatory synapse ablator, PFE3, analogous to the inhibitory synapse ablator GFE3. PFE3 targets the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 and the proteasome-interacting region of Protocadherin 10 to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, leading to efficient ablation of excitatory synapses. In addition, we developed a light-inducible version of GFE3, paGFE3, using a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c. paGFE3 degrades Gephyrin and ablates inhibitory synapses in response to 400 nm light. Finally, we developed a chemically inducible version of GFE3, chGFE3, which degrades inhibitory synapses when combined with the bio-orthogonal dimerizer, HaloTag ligand-trimethoprim. Each tool is specific, reversible, and capable of breaking neural circuits at precise locations.

">Absent, but not glucocorticoid-modulated, corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) regulates anxiety-like behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a well characterized endocrine response system. Hypothalamic Crh in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) initiates HPA axis signaling to cause the release of cortisol (or corticosterone in rodents) from the adrenal gland. PVH-specific deletion of Crh reduces anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Here we report that manipulation of PVH Crh expression in primary adrenal insufficiency or by dexamethasone (DEX) treatment do not alter mouse anxiety behaviors. In Experiment 1, we compared wildtype (WT) mice to those with primary adrenal insufficiency (MrapKO) or global deletion of Crh (CrhKO). We analyzed behaviors using open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM), PVH Crh mRNA expression by spatial transcriptomics, and plasma ACTH and corticosterone after a 15-minute restraint test with ELISAs. EPM analysis showed CrhKO mice were less anxious than WT and MrapKO mice, and MrapKO mice had no distinguishing behavioral phenotype. In Experiment 2, we evaluated HPA axis habituation to chronically elevated Crh expression by comparing mice treated with 5-8 weeks of DEX with those similarly treated followed by DEX withdrawal for 1 week. All mice regardless of genotype and treatment showed no significant behavioral differences. Our findings suggest that reduced anxiety associated with low Crh expression requires extreme deficiency, perhaps outside of those PVH Crh neurons negatively regulated by glucocorticoids. If these findings extend to humans, they suggest that increases in Crh expression with primary adrenal insufficiency, or decreases with exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, may not alter anxiety behaviors via modulation of Crh expression.

">A stolen future: aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis produces glial cells in epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is disturbed in epilepsy. The increased neuronal activity in the epileptic brain leads to an increased production of newborn cells, increased mossy fibre sprouting and altered integration of new neurons within the hippocampus. Here, we set out to investigate increased astrocyte numbers following status epilepticus. We used immunolabelling of brain sections from the mouse intra-amygdala kainic acid model of epilepsy and publicly available single cell RNA sequencing datasets to assess newborn cells in the dentate gyrus. Similar to published series we found on increased number of reactive astrocytes present in the epileptic hippocampus. Additionally, we identified a cell population that expressed neurogenesis (doublecortin) and astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein) markers in the epileptic brain, both in mouse and in human tissue. We further evaluated the expression profile of these cells. Immunolabelling showed expression of mature astrocyte markers aquaporin 4 and glutamate transporter-1. The single cell RNA sequencing data highlighted expression of neurogenesis and astrocyte markers in the doublecortin/glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing cells. In conclusion, epilepsy pushes early neuroblasts to fate-switch to an astrocyte lineage as seen in the kainic acid-induced mouse model and in human resected brain tissue. Further understanding how neurogenesis is altered in epilepsy and whether the neuroblast fate-switch can be reverted will help in finding novel therapy strategies for epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with aberrant adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Crowding is a common visual phenomenon that can significantly impair the recognition of objects in peripheral vision. Two recent behavioral studies have revealed that both exogenous and endogenous attention can alleviate crowding, but exogenous attention seems to be more effective. Methods: The present study employed the event-related potential (ERP) technique to explore the electrophysiological characteristics of the influence of these two types of attention on crowding. In the experiment, participants were required to judge whether the letter &amp;amp;ldquo;T&amp;amp;rdquo; was upright or inverted, which may be preceded by an exogenous cue or an endogenous cue indicating the location of the target letter. Results: The behavioral results showed that while exogenous cues reduced crowding in all stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), endogenous attention took effects only in long SOA. The ERP results indicated that both endogenous and exogenous cues significantly alleviated the inhibition of visual crowding on the N1 component. However, the endogenous cue was effective only under long SOA, while the exogenous cue was effective only under short SOA conditions. In addition, invalid exogenous cues induced a larger P3 wave amplitude than valid ones in the short SOA condition, but endogenous attention did not show such a difference. Conclusions: These results indicate that both endogenous and exogenous attention can alleviate the effects of visual crowding, but they differ in effect size and temporal dynamics.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive impairment is an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia, and its detection in the early stages is essential to prevent dementia, an incurable pathology. The aim of this study is to screen and estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment, including dementia, and its correlated factors in a community-based sample of the Albanian population over 50 years old. Methods: We carried out a door-to-door neuropsychological screening of Albanian residents older than 50 years from November 2023 to June 2024 in 12 Albanian districts. Participants completed the Early Dementia Questionnaire (EDQ) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: The overall estimating prevalence of cognitive impairment and early dementia among the Albanian population over 50 years old was 14.04% using the MMSE, with 2.31% for MMSE &amp;amp;le;18 (serious cognitive impairment), 5.51% for MMSE 19&amp;amp;ndash;22 (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), and 6.22 for MMSE 23&amp;amp;ndash;24 (suspected cognitive impairment or dementia),respectively. The prevalence of early dementia using the EDQ was significantly higher (53.99%).The number of male participants with MMSE scores of 23&amp;amp;ndash;24 (suspected cognitive impairment or early dementia) was 2.5 times higher with respect to female participants. Smoking and alcohol consumption decreased the MMSE scores. The number of participants with normal cognitive function (MMSE scores 25&amp;amp;ndash;30) was lower among participants with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cerebral ischemia. Conclusions: A diagnostic evaluation, including a clinical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory studies, is further required for a diagnosis. Despite limitations, the data provided in this study are the only ones reported for a large community-based sample of the older adult Albanian population, which can help health care providers to diagnose cognitive impairment.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used to assess language lateralization, but its application in patients with brain tumors can be hindered by cognitive impairments, compensatory neuroplasticity, and artifacts due to patient movement or severe aphasia. Gray matter volume (GMV) analysis via voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in language-related brain regions may offer a stable complementary approach. This study investigates the relationship between GMV and fMRI-derived language lateralization in healthy individuals and patients with left-hemisphere brain tumors, aiming to enhance accuracy in complex cases. Methods: The MRI data from 22 healthy participants and 28 individuals with left-hemisphere brain tumors were analyzed. Structural T1-weighted and functional images were obtained during three language tasks. Language lateralization was assessed based on activation in predefined regions of interest (ROIs), categorized as typical (left) or atypical (right or bilateral). The GMV in these ROIs was measured using VBM. Linear regressions explored GMV-lateralization associations, and logistic regressions predicted the lateralization based on the GMV. Results: In the healthy participants, typical left-hemispheric language dominance correlated with higher GMV in the left pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus. The brain tumor participants with atypical lateralization showed increased GMV in six right-hemisphere ROIs. The GMV in the language ROIs predicted the fMRI language lateralization, with AUCs from 80.1% to 94.2% in the healthy participants and 78.3% to 92.6% in the tumor patients. Conclusions: GMV analysis in language-related ROIs effectively complements fMRI for assessing language dominance, particularly when fMRI is challenging. It correlates with language lateralization in both healthy individuals and brain tumor patients, highlighting its potential in preoperative language mapping. Further research with larger samples is needed to refine its clinical utility.</p>

	<p>Violence against women impacts a minimum of 35% of the global female population, encompassing sexual, physical, and psychological forms. Perpetrators of this violence include partners, family members, or strangers. Its ramifications are substantial, evident in the prevalence of chronic pain reported by between 48% and 84% of women who have experienced abuse, with an odds ratio of 2.08. Notably associated diagnoses include pelvic/vaginal pain, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome/bowel symptoms, abdominal pain, migraine/headache, and back and neck pain. These diagnoses significantly limit a woman&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to participate in daily activities, such as exercising or working, leading to genuine disability. Despite substantial evidence, the precise cause and etiology of these conditions remain unclear. Adhering to the bio-psycho-social model, it is conceivable that chronic pain in victims of violence cannot be attributed to a single factor alone, but rather to a combination of all three: biological, psychological, and social factors. Uncovering these factors could have significant clinical and legal implications. On one hand, it would be possible to conduct screenings to avoid developing chronic pain. and guide individuals toward the correct treatment. On the other hand, victims could seek compensation for chronic pain resulting from violence. Considering the limited knowledge about the causes of chronic pain and the absence of tools to identify risk factors or a set of tests for evaluating victims of violence, the goal of the research described in this project protocol is to pinpoint the specific contributing factors for chronic pain due to violence victimization. Additionally, it aims to devise a comprehensive protocol for assessing these factors in forensic science.</p>

	<p>In this review, we aim to draw a connection between drug addiction and overconsumption of highly palatable food (OHPF) by discussing common behaviors and neurochemical pathways shared by these two states. OHPF can stimulate reward pathways in the brain that parallel those triggered by drug use, increasing the risk of dependency. Behavioral similarities between food and drug addiction can be addressed by tracking their stages: loss of control when eating (bingeing), withdrawal, craving, sensitization, and cross-sensitization. The brain adapts to addiction by way of the mesolimbic dopamine system, endogenous opioids and receptors, acetylcholine and dopamine balance, and adaptations of serotonin in neuroanatomy. Studies from the current literature are reviewed to determine how various neurological chemicals contribute to the reinforcement of drug addiction and OHPF. Finally, protocols for treating food addiction are discussed, including both clinical and pharmacological modalities. There is consistent evidence that OHPF changes brain chemistry and leads to addiction in similar ways to drugs. However, more long-term research is needed on food addiction, binge eating, and their neurobiological effects.</p>

	<p>Background: Headache is a common complaint during childhood and adolescence. It is important to be aware of the characteristics of pediatric headaches in order to make a precise and timely diagnosis. This study investigated the clinical characteristics of pediatric headaches according to the underlying etiology and age group. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 3374 pediatric patients (2667 with primary headache [PH] and 707 with secondary headache [SH]) who presented with headaches at two centers between January 2012 and November 2023. Results: The incidence of PH was significantly higher in adolescents (40.1% vs. 22.9%), whereas that of SH was considerably higher in preschoolers (37.5% vs. 16.3%) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The prevalence of headaches attributed to infection was significantly higher in preschool and school-aged children (90.8% vs. 80.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); adolescents exhibited significantly higher frequencies of cranial and cervical vascular disorders (3.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.044) and psychiatric disorders (5.6% vs. 0.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Statistically significant differences were observed between preschool/school-aged children and adolescents in terms of headache characteristics and the prevalence of headache-associated symptoms (60.4% vs. 74.1%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in PH), neurologic abnormalities (10.2% vs. 23.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in PH; 2.4% vs. 11.7%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in SH), and headache triggers (19.9% vs. 24.2%, p = 0.008 in PH; 2.0% vs. 8.0%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in SH). Conclusions: Recognizing the etiology and age-specific differences in the clinical characteristics of headaches is crucial for an accurate and timely diagnosis. Tailoring the diagnostic approach accordingly helps to achieve optimal outcomes in pediatric patients with headaches.</p>

                <p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (CaBPs; CaBP1&ndash;5) are a subfamily of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors with high homology to calmodulin. Notably, CaBP4, which is exclusively expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors, is crucial for maintaining normal retinal functions. However, the functional roles of CaBP1, CaBP2, and CaBP5 in the retina remain elusive, primarily due to limited understanding of their expression patterns within inner retinal neurons. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive transcript analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to investigate the gene expression profiles of CaBPs in mouse and human retinal neurons. Our findings revealed notable similarities in the overall expression patterns of CaBPs across both species. Specifically, nearly all amacrine cell, ganglion cell, and horizontal cell types exclusively expressed CaBP1. In contrast, the majority of bipolar cell types, including rod bipolar (RB) cells, expressed distinct combinations of CaBP1, CaBP2, and CaBP5, rather than a single CaBP as previously hypothesized. Remarkably, mouse rods and human cones exclusively expressed CaBP4, whereas mouse cones and human rods coexpressed both CaBP4 and CaBP5. Our single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the coexpression CaBP1 and CaBP5 in individual RBs from mice of either sex. Additionally, all three splice variants of CaBP1, primarily L-CaBP1, were detected in mouse RBs. Taken together, our study offers a comprehensive overview of the distribution of CaBPs in mouse and human retinal neurons, providing valuable insights into their roles in visual functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0288-24.2024?rss=1">Prior Negative Experience Biases Activity of Medial Amygdala during Interstrain Social Engagement in Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social recognition is an essential part of social function and often promotes specific social behaviors based on prior experience. Social and defensive behaviors in particular often emerge with prior experiences of familiarity or novelty/stress, respectively. This is also commonly seen in rodents toward same-strain and interstrain conspecifics. Medial amygdala (MeA) activity guides social choice based on age and sex recognition and is sensitive to social experiences. However, little is known about whether the MeA exhibits differential responses based on strain or how this is impacted by experience. Social stress impacts posterior MeA (MeAp) function and can shift measures of social engagement. However, it is unclear how stress impacts MeAp activity and contributes to altered social behavior. The primary goal of this study in adult male Sprague Dawley rats was to determine whether prior stress experience with a different-strain (Long&ndash;Evans) rat impacts MeAp responses to same-strain and different-strain conspecifics in parallel with a change in behavior using in vivo fiber photometry. We found that MeAp activity was uniformly activated during social contact with a novel same-strain rat during a three-chamber social preference test following control handling but became biased toward a novel different-strain rat following social stress. Socially stressed rats also showed initially heightened social interaction with novel same-strain rats but showed social avoidance and fragmented social behavior with novel different-strain rats relative to controls. These results indicate that heightened MeAp activity may guide social responses to novel, threatening, rather than non-threatening, social stimuli after stress.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0306-24.2024?rss=1">Whole Nervous System Expression of Glutamate Receptors Reveals Distinct Receptor Roles in Sensorimotor Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>The goal of connectomics is to reveal the links between neural circuits and behavior. Larvae of the primitive chordate <I>Ciona</I> are well-suited to make contributions in this area. In addition to having a described connectome, <I>Ciona</I> larvae have a range of readily quantified behaviors. Moreover, the small number of neurons in the larval CNS (~180) holds the promise of a comprehensive characterization of individual neurons. We present single-neuron predictions for glutamate receptor (GlutR) expression based on in situ hybridization. Included are both ionotropic receptors (AMPA, NMDA, and kainate) and metabotropic receptors. The predicted glutamate receptor expression dataset is discussed in the context of known circuits driving behaviors such as phototaxis, mechanosensation, and looming shadow response. The predicted expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors may help resolve issues regarding the co-production of GABA and glutamate by a subset of photoreceptors. The targets of these photoreceptors in the midbrain appear to express NMDA receptors, but not AMPA receptors. This is in agreement with previous results indicating that GABA is the primary neurotransmitter from the photoreceptors evoking a swimming response through a disinhibition mechanism and that glutamate may, therefore, have only a modulatory action in this circuit. Other findings reported here are more unexpected. For example, many of the targets of glutamatergic epidermal sensory neurons (ESNs) do not express any of the ionotropic receptors, yet the ESNs themselves express metabotropic receptors. Thus, we speculate that their production of glutamate may be for communication with neighboring ESNs, rather than to their interneuron targets.</p>

                Abstract* Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of fine-tuning their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

                Background Building Metagenome–Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from highly complex metagenomics datasets encompasses a series of steps covering from cleaning the sequences, assembling them to finally group them into bins. Along the process, multiple tools aimed to assess the quality and integrity of each MAG are implemented. Nonetheless, even when incorporated within end–to–end pipelines, the outputs of these pieces of software must be visualized and analyzed manually lacking integration in a complete framework. Methods We developed a Nextflow pipeline (MAGFlow) for estimating the quality of MAGs through a wide variety of approaches (BUSCO, CheckM2, GUNC and QUAST), as well as for annotating taxonomically the metagenomes using GTDB-Tk2. MAGFlow is coupled to a Python–Dash application (BIgMAG) that displays the concatenated outcomes from the tools included by MAGFlow, highlighting the most important metrics in a single interactive environment along with a comparison/clustering of the input data. Results By using MAGFlow/BIgMAG, the user will be able to benchmark the MAGs obtained through different workflows or establish the quality of the MAGs belonging to different samples following the divide and rule methodology. Conclusions MAGFlow/BIgMAG represents a unique tool that integrates state-of-the-art tools to study different quality metrics and extract visually as much information as possible from a wide range of genome features.

                Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a change in brain function or evidence of brain pathology caused by external mechanical forces. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a neurotropin that functions as a neuron protective. Nigella sativa L is reported to have an antioxidant effect, administration of Nigella Sativa L to rats treated with ischemia-reperfusion brain injury. Propofol is an anesthetic agent frequently used intravenously in the management of TBI. The effect of propofol on brain tissue after TBI may be neuroprotective. We aimed to compare the potential of Nigella sativa L and propofol as neuroplasticity and neuroprotection in rats with TBI. Methods This was a laboratory experimental animal model with the post-test only control group design, namely measuring the effect of treatment by comparing the five groups of rats consisting of 30 rats. BDNF levels in rat brain tissue were collected at day 7 of treatment and measured by ELISA. Results The average BDNF protein levels per group, namely G1 (221,243 pg/mL), G2 (172,139 pg/mL), G3 (255,483 pg/mL), G4 (227,089 pg/mL), and G5 (272,603 pg/mL) respectively. Based on the ANOVA statistic, p-value = 0.032 (there was a significant difference between groups), with the Levene Test (0.077) or having variance between the same groups, sequentially the difference in average BDNF protein levels of the five groups is G5>G3>G4>G1>G2, meaning that the combination of Nigella sativa and propofol has more potential to increase BDNF protein levels than Nigella sativa, and Nigella sativa has more potential than propofol. Conclusion We concluded that both nigella sativa and propofol have the potential to increase BDNF protein levels. Nigella Sativa L had a better effect than propofol in repairing damaged neuron cells (neuroplasticity) and increasing BDNF protein levels (neuroprotection) for 7 days of administration in rat traumatic brain injury.

                Background Gambling disorder (GD) has become a wide concern in Indonesia, as many negative consequences arise from this psychiatric condition. Prompt treatment with an appropriate method of delivery is required to achieve optimal outcomes in GD patients. This protocol paper outlines a study to determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) in treating GD in Indonesia. Methods This non-randomized pilot and feasibility study will recruit 20 people with GD. All participants will receive the iCBT intervention through self-learning videos and guided weekly group sessions. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed at baseline (week 0), post- treatment completion (week 10), and 6 weeks post-treatment (week 16). The outcomes measured will be the change in gambling symptoms, gambling urges, cognitive distortions, readiness to change, emotional problems, and quality of life of the participants. Discussion The feasibility of iCBT for GD patients in Indonesia will be assessed by this study. The study’s results will give an indication of the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of a subsequent conclusive trial. The delivery of iCBT may help to address the issue of treatment access in an extensive geographical region and provide immediate implications as a treatment resource for GD in practice.

                Wireless capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive medical imaging modality used for diagnosing and monitoring digestive tract diseases. However, the analysis of images obtained from wireless capsule endoscopy is a challenging task, as the images are of low resolution and often contain a large number of artifacts. In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the analysis of medical images, including wireless capsule endoscopy images. This paper provides a review of the current trends and future directions in deep learning for wireless capsule endoscopy. We focus on the recent advances in transfer learning, attention mechanisms, multi-modal learning, automated lesion detection, interpretability and explainability, data augmentation, and edge computing. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of current deep learning methods and discuss the potential future directions for the field. Our review provides insights into the ongoing research and development efforts in the field of deep learning for wireless capsule endoscopy, and can serve as a reference for researchers, clinicians, and engineers working in this area inspection process.

Background <p>Mood disorders involve a complex interplay between multifaceted internal emotional states, and complex external inputs. Dynamical systems theory suggests that this interplay between aspects of moods and environmental stimuli may hence determine key psychopathological features of mood disorders, including the stability of mood states, the response to external inputs, how controllable mood states are, and what interventions are most likely to be effective. However, a comprehensive computational approach to all these aspects has not yet been undertaken.</p> Methods <p>Here, we argue that the combination of ecological momentary assessments (EMA) with a well-established dynamical systems framework—the humble Kalman filter—enables a comprehensive account of all these aspects. We first introduce the key features of the Kalman filter and optimal control theory and their relationship to aspects of psychopathology. We then examine the psychometric and inferential properties of combining EMA data with Kalman filtering across realistic scenarios. Finally, we apply the Kalman filter to a series of EMA datasets comprising over 700 participants with and without symptoms of depression.</p> Results <p>The results show a naive Kalman filter approach performs favourably compared to the standard vector autoregressive approach frequently employed, capturing key aspects of the data better. Furthermore, it suggests that the depressed state involves alterations to interactions between moods; alterations to how moods responds to external inputs; and as a result an alteration in how controllable mood states are. We replicate these findings qualitatively across datasets and explore an extension to optimal control theory to guide therapeutic interventions.</p> Conclusions <p>Mood dynamics are richly and profoundly altered in depressed states. The humble Kalman filter is a well-established, rich framework to characterise mood dynamics. Its application to EMA data is valid; straightforward; and likely to result in substantial novel insights both into mechanisms and treatments.</p>

                <p>by Matt J. Keeling, Louise Dyson</p>

We discuss the invasion of the Omicron BA.1 variant into England as a paradigm for real-time model fitting and projection. Here we use a mixture of simple SIR-type models, analysis of the early data and a more complex age-structure model fit to the outbreak to understand the dynamics. In particular, we highlight that early data shows that the invading Omicron variant had a substantial growth advantage over the resident Delta variant. However, early data does not allow us to reliably infer other key epidemiological parameters—such as generation time and severity—which influence the expected peak hospital numbers. With more complete epidemic data from January 2022 are we able to capture the true scale of the epidemic in terms of both infections and hospital admissions, driven by different infection characteristics of Omicron compared to Delta and a substantial shift in estimated precautionary behaviour during December. This work highlights the challenges of real time forecasting, in a rapidly changing environment with limited information on the variant’s epidemiological characteristics.

                <p>by Juan Pablo Franco, Peter Bossaerts, Carsten Murawski</p>

Many everyday tasks require people to solve computationally complex problems. However, little is known about the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving such problems. Here, we draw on computational complexity theory to address this issue. We performed an experiment in which participants solved several instances of the 0-1 knapsack problem, a combinatorial optimization problem, while undergoing ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Instances varied in computational hardness. We characterize a network of brain regions whose activation was correlated with computational complexity, including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the intra-parietal sulcus/angular gyrus. Activation and connectivity changed dynamically as a function of complexity, in line with theoretical computational requirements. Overall, our results suggest that computational complexity theory provides a suitable framework to study the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving complex cognitive tasks.

                <p>by Nafiseh Atapour, Marcello G. P. Rosa, Shi Bai, Sylwia Bednarek, Agata Kulesza, Gabriela Saworska, Sadaf Teymornejad, Katrina H. Worthy, Piotr Majka</p>

The diversity of the mammalian cerebral cortex demands technical approaches to map the spatial distribution of neurons with different biochemical identities. This issue is magnified in the case of the primate cortex, characterized by a large number of areas with distinctive cytoarchitectures. To date, no full map of the distribution of cells expressing a specific protein has been reported for the cortex of any primate. Here we have charted the 3-dimensional distribution of neurons expressing the calcium-binding protein calbindin (CB<sup>+</sup> neurons) across the entire marmoset cortex, using a combination of immunohistochemistry, automated cell identification, computerized reconstruction, and cytoarchitecture-aware registration. CB<sup>+</sup> neurons formed a heterogeneous population, which together corresponded to 10–20% of the cortical neurons. They occurred in higher proportions in areas corresponding to low hierarchical levels of processing, such as sensory cortices. Although CB<sup>+</sup> neurons were concentrated in the supragranular and granular layers, there were clear global trends in their laminar distribution. For example, their relative density in infragranular layers increased with hierarchical level along sensorimotor processing streams, and their density in layer 4 was lower in areas involved in sensorimotor integration, action planning and motor control. These results reveal new quantitative aspects of the cytoarchitectural organization of the primate cortex, and demonstrate an approach to mapping the full distribution of neurochemically distinct cells throughout the brain which is readily applicable to most other mammalian species.

                <p>by Nicola Dietler, Alia Abbara, Subham Choudhury, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that nonlinear selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.

Many distantly related organisms have convergently evolved traits and lifestyles that enable them to live in similar ecological environments. However, the extent of phenotypic convergence evolving through the same or distinct genetic trajectories remains an open question. Here, we leverage a comprehensive dataset of genomic and phenotypic data from 1,049 yeast species in the subphylum Saccharomycotina (Kingdom Fungi, Phylum Ascomycota) to explore signatures of convergent evolution in cactophilic yeasts, ecological specialists associated with cacti. We inferred that the ecological association of yeasts with cacti arose independently approximately 17 times. Using a machine learning–based approach, we further found that cactophily can be predicted with 76% accuracy from both functional genomic and phenotypic data. The most informative feature for predicting cactophily was thermotolerance, which we found to be likely associated with altered evolutionary rates of genes impacting the cell envelope in several cactophilic lineages. We also identified horizontal gene transfer and duplication events of plant cell wall–degrading enzymes in distantly related cactophilic clades, suggesting that putatively adaptive traits evolved independently through disparate molecular mechanisms. Notably, we found that multiple cactophilic species and their close relatives have been reported as emerging human opportunistic pathogens, suggesting that the cactophilic lifestyle—and perhaps more generally lifestyles favoring thermotolerance—might preadapt yeasts to cause human disease. This work underscores the potential of a multifaceted approach involving high-throughput genomic and phenotypic data to shed light onto ecological adaptation and highlights how convergent evolution to wild environments could facilitate the transition to human pathogenicity.

                Background In a rehabilitation centre designed for drug and alcohol recovery, the therapeutic environment may enhance the psychosocial well-being of sufferers and facilitate a speedy recovery. This study aims to investigate the psychosocial well-being needs (PWNs) of users in an alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre (ADRC) and how therapeutic architectural solutions (TASs) can promote a healing environment through design. Methods The study employed a mixed research method (qualitative and quantitative). The research strategy was a case study of four rehabilitation centres in Nigeria’s busiest cities; Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Enugu. Data were collected via survey questionnaires, an in-depth interview guide, an observation guide, and a checklist of TACs in a healthcare facility. We first investigated what the PWNs of alcohol and drug sufferers (ADSs) are, then identified the therapeutic architectural components (TACs) of an ADRC, before determining what effect TACs have on the recovery process of substance abuse patients. Results The findings identify eight PWNs and nine TACs essential in an ADRC. The result indicates that TACs have a significant effect on the recovery process of ADSs. However, based on the study results, a framework (framework here refers to using an intelligent and sensitive conceptual design structure as a standard guide for the building archetype rehabilitation facility, which supports mental health service delivery) may be recommended for rehabilitation facilities with TASs for Substance Abuse Disorder (SUD). Conclusion The study result presents a correlation between ADSs’ recovery rates and a well-designed therapeutic environment. So, there is a need for evidence-based design (EBD) of rehabilitation centres with full compliments of a therapeutic architectural environment and integration of mental health services into routine care in sub-Saharan Africa. Limitations include that analyses were cross-sectional and thus may not deduce causal directions, and the authors based the result on self-report.

                Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, an increase in the incidence of fungal infections was observed. However, the real magnitude of these fungal infections and their risk factors among COVID-19 patients in the Indian population is unknown. Aim: To study the frequency, and spectrum of invasive fungal infections (IFI) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and the risk factors associated with invasive fungal infections. Methods: We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study; including all adult patients, admitted to Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), a tertiary care hospital in Southern India between April 2020 and August 2021, with COVID-19. Based on clinical-radiological features, patients with fungal infections were grouped into three diagnostic categories. Demographics, clinical, and laboratory features of patients with fungal infections were analyzed to identify the risk factors. Results: About 10% (449 out of 4650) of the admitted patients with recent COVID-19, had some form of IFI. Among the patients with IFI, 80% (366 out of 449) were hospitalized for active COVID-19, whereas almost all the patients admitted with post-COVID complications had IFI. Of the 449 patients with IFI, 377 had mold infections and 88 had invasive candidiasis. Mucormycosis was the most common mold infection. Diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis were strong independent predictors of IFI. We also found an association between end-stage renal disease, central venous catheterization, antibiotic usage, prior stroke, and corticosteroid therapy with IFI. Conclusions: The frequency of fungal infections among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. Special precautions in COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy, and prior antibiotic usage may help to reduce invasive fungal infections.

                Molecular mechanisms of horizontal cell-to-cone feedback in the retina have been under debate. Morikawa et al. show that Slc4a5, an electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter specific to horizontal cells, is crucial for feedback. They suggest that Slc4a5, through its voltage-dependent transport of bicarbonate, regulates pH in the synaptic cleft that mediates feedback.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91705">Patient-derived xenografts and single-cell sequencing identifies three subtypes of tumor-reactive lymphocytes in uveal melanoma metastases</a></h4>

              
                Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare melanoma originating in the eye’s uvea, with 50% of patients experiencing metastasis predominantly in the liver. In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, there is only a limited effectiveness of combined immune checkpoint therapies, and half of patients with uveal melanoma metastases succumb to disease within 2 years. This study aimed to provide a path toward enhancing immunotherapy efficacy by identifying and functionally validating tumor-reactive T cells in liver metastases of patients with UM. We employed single-cell RNA-seq of biopsies and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to identify potential tumor-reactive T cells. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of UM metastases were created from patients, and tumor sphere cultures were generated from these models for co-culture with autologous or MART1-specific HLA-matched allogenic TILs. Activated T cells were subjected to TCR-seq, and the TCRs were matched to those found in single-cell sequencing data from biopsies, expanded TILs, and in livers or spleens of PDX models injected with TILs. Our findings revealed that tumor-reactive T cells resided not only among activated and exhausted subsets of T cells, but also in a subset of cytotoxic effector cells. In conclusion, combining single-cell sequencing and functional analysis provides valuable insights into which T cells in UM may be useful for cell therapy amplification and marker selection.

                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) plays critical roles in the motor and cognitive function of the basal ganglia (BG), but the exact nature of these roles is not fully understood, especially in the context of decision-making based on uncertain evidence. Guided by theoretical predictions of specific STN contributions, we used single-unit recording and electrical microstimulation in the STN of healthy monkeys to assess its causal, computational roles in visual-saccadic decisions based on noisy evidence. The recordings identified subpopulations of STN neurons with distinct task-related activity patterns that related to different theoretically predicted functions. Microstimulation caused changes in behavioral choices and response times that reflected multiple contributions to an ‘accumulate-to-bound’-like decision process, including modulation of decision bounds and evidence accumulation, and to non-perceptual processes. These results provide new insights into the multiple ways that the STN can support higher brain function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87949">Deep learning for rapid analysis of cell divisions in vivo during epithelial morphogenesis and repair</a></h4>

              
                Cell division is fundamental to all healthy tissue growth, as well as being rate-limiting in the tissue repair response to wounding and during cancer progression. However, the role that cell divisions play in tissue growth is a collective one, requiring the integration of many individual cell division events. It is particularly difficult to accurately detect and quantify multiple features of large numbers of cell divisions (including their spatio-temporal synchronicity and orientation) over extended periods of time. It would thus be advantageous to perform such analyses in an automated fashion, which can naturally be enabled using deep learning. Hence, we develop a pipeline of deep learning models that accurately identify dividing cells in time-lapse movies of epithelial tissues in vivo. Our pipeline also determines their axis of division orientation, as well as their shape changes before and after division. This strategy enables us to analyse the dynamic profile of cell divisions within the <i>Drosophila</i> pupal wing epithelium, both as it undergoes developmental morphogenesis and as it repairs following laser wounding. We show that the division axis is biased according to lines of tissue tension and that wounding triggers a synchronised (but not oriented) burst of cell divisions back from the leading edge.

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, mainly affecting elderly individuals. AD is characterized by &amp;amp;beta;-amyloid plaques, abnormal tau tangles, neuronal loss, and metabolic disruptions. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of the kynurenine (KP) pathway and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in AD development. The KP pathway metabolizes tryptophan to produce neuroactive substances like kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and quinolinic acid. In AD, high levels of kynurenine and the neurotoxic quinolinic acid are associated with increased neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity; conversely, reduced levels of kynurenic acid, which acts as a glutamate receptor antagonist, compromise neuroprotection. Research has indicated elevated KP metabolites and enzymes in the hippocampus of AD patients and other tissues such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine. However, the finding that KP metabolites are AD biomarkers in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine has been controversial. This controversy, stemming from the lack of consideration of the specific stage of AD, details of the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s treatment, cognitive deficits, and psychiatric comorbidities, underscores the need for more comprehensive research. AhR, a ligand-activated transcription factor, regulates immune response, oxidative stress, and xenobiotic metabolism. Various ligands, including tryptophan metabolites, can activate it. Some studies suggest that AhR activation contributes to AD, while others propose that it provides neuroprotection. This discrepancy may be explained by the specific ligands that activate AhR, highlighting the complex relationship between the KP pathway, AhR activation, and AD, where the same pathway can produce both neuroprotective and harmful effects.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In the past two decades, significant advancements in neuromodulation techniques have occurred, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). According to the assumption that repeated stimulation within a condensed timeframe can yield sustained efficacy, an accelerated protocol may be more effective in reducing time to response. With those premises, this study aimed to evaluate a sample of TRD patients treated with standard repetitive TMS (rTMS) and accelerated rTMS (arTMS). Methods: Nine subjects were treated with standard rTMS and 19 with arTMS. Psychometric assessment was made at the baseline and one week, one month, and three months after the treatment. A linear mixed-effect regression was performed along with other appropriate statistical analyses. Results: A significant improvement over time was observed for both depressive and cognitive symptoms. Moreover, considering the reduction in the Montgomery&amp;amp;ndash;Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores, a better treatment response was observed in subjects treated with arTMS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings showed a significant difference between the two protocols in terms of clinical response. Although further studies are needed to confirm the superiority of arTMS, the better cost-effectiveness of this technique should be considered.</p>

	<p>Background: The advent of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway has transformed the management of migraine, offering newfound optimism for clinicians and individuals with episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided crucial insights into the effectiveness and safety profiles of these treatments, their translation into real-world clinical practice remains a challenge. Objective: This review aims to conduct a comprehensive assessment of real-world studies, offering valuable insights tailored for practical application in clinical settings. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE for real-life studies on erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. Abstracts underwent rigorous screening by two reviewers for relevance. Data extraction from selected articles was performed using a standardized form, with verification by a second reviewer. Data synthesis was narrative, following PRISMA guidelines. Results: Our search included 61 pertinent studies conducted between 2019 and 1 March 2024. Real-world study designs demonstrated notable variability in the selection and inclusion of migraine patients, influenced by factors such as attack frequency, data collection criteria, and primary/secondary objectives. Key findings commonly reported considerable improvements in efficacy outcomes (migraine frequency, analgesic use, pain severity, and disability), high responder rates, and optimal safety and tolerability profiles. Conclusions: Real-world evidence underscores the role of anti-CGRP mAbs as targeted therapies for both CM and EM patients. The overall results indicate that the effectiveness and tolerability of anti-CGRP mAbs in real-world applications may exceed those observed in RCTs, an extraordinary finding in clinical neurology.</p>

	<p>Background: Musculoskeletal pain is a leading cause of medical visits, posing significant challenges both socially and economically, encouraging the scientific community to continue researching and exploring the most effective methods to address the problem. An alternative way to deal with chronic pain is pain neuroscience education (PNE), a lesson plan that addresses the neurobiology, neurophysiology, and nervous system processing of pain. This method takes the place of the conventional one, which connected pain to tissue damage or nociception. Results: As a result, patients are taught that pain is often not a reliable measure of the health of the tissues but rather the outcome of the nervous system interpreting the injury in conjunction with additional psychosocial variables. In addition to finding research that examine, using neuroimaging, whether the administration of PNE has detectable effects at the level of the central nervous system, this narrative review seeks to clarify what PNE is, how it is administered, and if it is an effective treatment for musculoskeletal pain. Conclusions: Based on the findings, it appears that PNE is more therapeutically beneficial when combined with therapeutic exercise, when done one-on-one, and during lengthy, frequent sessions. Lastly, even though PNE has no effect on the morphological properties of the gray matter, it appears to cause decreased activation of the regions linked to pain.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the entorhinal cortex (EC), attempts have been made to identify the human homologue regions of the medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subregions using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a confined border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct whole-brain connectivity profiles. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.</p>

<p>

PTZ-induced seizures caused short-term changes in glial gene expression, with more significant alterations observed in astroglial genes compared to microglial genes.

The changes were directed toward the neuroprotective profile of A2 cell activation.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Astrocytes and microglia can adopt two distinct phenotypes in various pathological processes: neurotoxic A1/M1 and neuroprotective A2/M2. Recent evidence suggests that these cells play a significant role in epileptogenesis. The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotype of astrocytes and microglial cells in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of young male Wistar rats at 3 h, 1, 3, and 7 days after pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. RT-qPCR was employed to examine the expression of glial genes (<i>Gfap</i>, <i>Aif1</i>, <i>Slc1a1</i>, <i>Slc1a2</i>, <i>Slc1a3</i>, <i>Itpr2</i>, <i>Gdnf</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Fgf2</i>, <i>Tgfb</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Tnf</i>, <i>Il1rn</i>, <i>Lcn2</i>, <i>S100a10</i>, <i>Nlrp3</i>, <i>Arg1</i>). The most notable alterations in the expression of glial genes were observed on the first day following seizures in the temporal cortex. An increase in the expression of the <i>Gfap</i>, <i>Slc1a2</i>, <i>Slc1a1</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Tnfa</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, and <i>Fgf2</i> genes, and the A2 astrocyte condition marker <i>S100a10</i>, was observed. An increase in the expression of the <i>Gfap</i> and <i>Slc1a2</i> genes was observed in the hippocampus on the first day after seizures. However, in contrast to the changes observed in the cortex, the changes in the hippocampus were opposite for the <i>Il1rn</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Tgfb</i>, and <i>Arg1</i> genes. Nevertheless, the alterations in GFAP and EAAT2 protein levels were not corroborated by Western blot analysis. Conversely, a more comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis confirmed an augmentation in the number of GFAP-positive cells in the hippocampus 1 day after seizures. Based on the presented evidence, we can conclude that a single convulsive seizure episode in 3-week-old rats results in transient astroglial activation and polarization to a neuroprotective phenotype (A2).</p>

                Chronic stress and the accompanying long-term elevation of glucocorticoids (GCs), the stress hormones of the body, increase the risk and accelerate the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Signatures of AD include intracellular tau (MAPT) tangles, extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, and neuroinflammation. A growing body of work indicates that stress and GCs initiate cellular processes underlying these pathologies through dysregulation of protein homeostasis and trafficking, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and response to damage-associated stimuli. In this review, we integrate findings from mechanistic studies in rodent and cellular models, wherein defined chronic stress protocols or GC administration have been shown to elicit AD-related pathology. We specifically discuss the effects of chronic stress and GCs on tau pathogenesis, including hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, and spreading, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and trafficking culminating in Aβ production, immune priming by proinflammatory cytokines and disease-associated molecular patterns, and alterations to glial cell and blood–brain barrier (BBB) function.

                Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) neuroscience research is rapidly expanding, the fundamental question of how these fish should be maintained in research laboratories remains largely unstudied. This may explain the diverse practices and broad range of environmental parameters used in zebrafish facilities. Here, we provide examples of these parameters and practices, including housing density, tank size, and water chemistry. We discuss the principles of stochastic resonance versus homeostasis and provide hypothetical examples to explain why keeping zebrafish outside of their tolerated range of environmental parameters may increase phenotypical variance and reduce replicability. We call for systematic studies to establish the optimal maintenance conditions for zebrafish. Furthermore, we discuss why knowing more about the natural behavior and ecology of this species could be a guiding principle for these studies.

                Bhat et al. show that the E3-ligase SCFFBXO10 is prenylated at C953 in its C-terminal CaaX motif. Prenylated FBXO10 is specifically delivered to the outer mitochondrial membrane via combined actions of cytosolic PDE6δ and HSP90. The expression of prenylation-deficient FBXO10(C953S) impairs mitochondrial proteostasis and functions. FBXO10 loss impairs myogenic differentiation of human iPSCs and murine myoblasts.

	<p>Objective: This study investigated the degrees of lenition, or consonantal weakening, in the production of Spanish stop consonants by native English speakers during a study abroad (SA) program. Lenition is a key phonological process in Spanish, where voiced stops (/b/, /d/, /&amp;amp;#609;/) typically weaken to fricatives or approximants in specific phonetic environments. For L2 learners, mastering this subtle process is essential for achieving native-like pronunciation. Methods: To assess the learners&amp;amp;rsquo; progress in acquiring lenition, we employed Phonet, a deep learning model. Unlike traditional quantitative acoustic methods that focus on measuring the physical properties of speech sounds, Phonet utilizes recurrent neural networks to predict the posterior probabilities of phonological features, particularly sonorant and continuant characteristics, which are central to the lenition process. Results: The results indicated that while learners showed progress in producing the fricative-like variants of lenition during the SA program and understood how to produce lenition in appropriate contexts, the retention of these phonological gains was not sustained after their return. Additionally, unlike native speakers, the learners never fully achieved the approximant-like realization of lenition. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for sustained exposure and practice beyond the SA experience to ensure the long-term retention of L2 phonological patterns. While SA programs offer valuable opportunities for enhancing L2 pronunciation, they should be supplemented with ongoing support to consolidate and extend the gains achieved during the immersive experience.</p>

	<p>Background: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is effective in regulating mood and high-level cognition in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of taVNS treatment in patients with MDD and an altered brain topological organization of functional networks. Methods: Nineteen patients with MDD were enrolled in this study. Patients with MDD underwent 4 weeks of taVNS treatments; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of the patients were collected before and after taVNS treatment. The graph theory method and network-based statistics (NBS) analysis were used to detect abnormal topological organizations of functional networks in patients with MDD before and after taVNS treatment. A correlation analysis was performed to characterize the relationship between altered network properties and neuropsychological scores. Results: After 4 weeks of taVNS treatment, patients with MDD had increased global efficiency and decreased characteristic path length (Lp). Additionally, patients with MDD exhibited increased nodal efficiency (NE) and degree centrality (DC) in the left angular gyrus. NBS results showed that patients with MDD exhibited reduced connectivity between default mode network (DMN)&amp;amp;ndash;frontoparietal network (FPN), DMN&amp;amp;ndash;cingulo-opercular network (CON), and FPN&amp;amp;ndash;CON. Furthermore, changes in Lp and DC were correlated with changes in Hamilton depression scores. Conclusions: These findings demonstrated that taVNS may be an effective method for reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with MDD, mainly through modulating the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s topological organization. Our study may offer insights into the underlying neural mechanism of taVNS treatment in patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study was to verify whether the level of mental resilience would differentiate reading comprehension performance when using different information carriers. More than 150 people filled out a test regarding the level of resilience. They then participated in a survey using fNIRS. Their task was to read a one-page informational text and answer several questions. The results showed no differences in correct answers between groups of people with different levels of resilience. In the groups of people with high and low levels of resilience, the number of correct answers was not differentiated by the type of carrier. Among those with moderate levels of resilience, better results were obtained by those who read text printed on paper. Analyses of neuronal mechanisms showed that the type of carrier differentiated brain activity in each group. Obtaining the same number of correct answers in the test was the result of different neuronal mechanisms activated in those who used a computer and those who read a printed text.</p>

Theory of mind task battery (ToMTB), Metacognitive Knowledge Interview (McKI), Schultz Test of Emotion Processing&amp;amp;mdash;Preliminary Version (STEP-P), and self-regulation scale were administered to 310 children aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years. Results: The results show that social information processing (except STEP-P.P.B, one of the sub-dimensions of the STEP-P scale) has a significant effect on ToM through metacognition and self-regulation. Conclusions: In this context, it can be said that social information processing, metacognition, and self-regulation are effective in the development of ToM.</p>

	<p>Human biostasis, the preservation of a human when all other contemporary options for extension of quality life are exhausted, offers the speculative potential for survival via continuation of life in the future. While provably reversible preservation, also known as suspended animation, is not yet possible for humans, the primary justification for contemporary biostasis is the preservation of the brain, which is broadly considered the seat of memories, personality, and identity. By preserving the information contained within the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s structures, it may be possible to resuscitate a healthy whole individual using advanced future technologies. There are numerous challenges in biostasis, including inadequacies in current preservation techniques, methods to evaluate the quality of preservation, and potential future revival technologies. In this report, we describe a roadmap that attempts to delineate research directions that could improve the field of biostasis, focusing on optimizing preservation protocols and establishing metrics for querying preservation quality, as well as pre- and post-cardiac arrest factors, stabilization strategies, and methods for long-term preservation. We acknowledge the highly theoretical nature of future revival technologies and the importance of achieving high-fidelity brain preservation to maximize the potential of future repair technologies. We plan to update the research roadmap biennially. Our goal is to encourage multidisciplinary communication and collaboration in this field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Finding innovative digital solutions is fundamental to ensure prompt and continuous care for patients with chronic neurological disorders, whose demand for rehabilitation also in home-based settings is steadily increasing. The aim is to verify the safety and the effectiveness of two telerehabilitation (TR) models in improving recovery from subacute upper limb (UL) disability after stroke, with and without a robotic device. Methods: One hundred nineteen subjects with subacute post-stroke UL disability were assessed for eligibility. Of them, 30 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either the Robotic Group (RG), undergoing a 20-session TR program, using a robotic device, or the Non-Robotic Group (NRG), undergoing a 20-session TR program without robotics. Clinical evaluations were measured at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1, 5 weeks after baseline), and included assessments of quality of life, motor skills, and clinical/functional status. The primary outcome measure was the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, evaluating the change in perceived disability. Results: Statistical analysis shows that patients of both groups improved significantly over time in all domains analyzed (mean decrease from baseline in the WHODAS 2.0 of 6.09 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.62% for the NRG, and of 0.76 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.21% for the RG), with a greater improvement of patients in the NRG in motor (Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity&amp;amp;mdash;motor function, Box and Block Test) and cognitive skills (Trail Making Test-A). Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of TR programs to transform stroke rehabilitation by enhancing accessibility and patient-centered care, promoting autonomy, improving adherence, and leading to better outcomes and quality of life for stroke survivors.</p>

                <p>Some visual neurons in the dragonfly (<I>Hemicordulia tau</I>) optic lobe respond to small, moving targets, likely underlying their fast pursuit of prey and conspecifics. In response to repetitive targets presented at short intervals, the spiking activity of these "small target motion detector" (STMD) neurons diminishes over time. Previous experiments limited this adaptation by including intertrial rest periods of varying durations. However, the characteristics of this effect have never been quantified. Here, using extracellular recording techniques lasting for several hours, we quantified both the spatial and temporal properties of STMD adaptation. We found that the time course of adaptation was variable across STMD units. In any one STMD, a repeated series led to more rapid adaptation, a minor accumulative effect more akin to habituation. Following an adapting stimulus, responses recovered quickly, though the rate of recovery decreased nonlinearly over time. We found that the region of adaptation is highly localized, with targets displaced by ~2.5&deg; eliciting a naive response. Higher frequencies of target stimulation converged to lower levels of sustained response activity. We determined that adaptation itself is a target-tuned property, not elicited by moving bars or luminance flicker. As STMD adaptation is a localized phenomenon, dependent on recent history, it is likely to play an important role in closed-loop behavior where a target is foveated in a localized region for extended periods of the pursuit duration<b>.</b></p>

                <p>Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairments (CRCIs) encompass cognitive deficits in memory, attention, and executive function that arise during and following chemotherapy. CRCI symptoms are predominantly reported by female cancer patients but also occur in males. These impairments may involve reduced estradiol levels, which then increases vulnerability to the impact of tumors and chemotherapy on cognition. This study utilized the MMTV-PyVT mouse model of breast cancer to test the hypothesis that impaired ovarian function and associated estradiol levels play a critical role in CRCI susceptibility. Mice were either ovariectomized (OVX) or underwent sham surgery. The OVX group then received supplemental estradiol (E<sup>2</sup>) <I>ad libitum</I> in the drinking water to maintain physiological hormone levels. After tumor development, mice were trained in the Morris water maze to assess spatial memory, and subsequently, they received weekly injections of either saline or a combination of cyclophosphamide (CYP; 66.7&nbsp;mg/kg, i.v.) and doxorubicin (DOX; 6.7&nbsp;mg/kg, i.v.) for 4&nbsp;weeks. Spatial memory was reassessed 10&nbsp;d and then 35&nbsp;d, after the final injections. Results demonstrated a significant disruption of normal ovarian cycling in sham-operated mice treated with CYP + DOX, as well as significant spatial memory impairments when compared with OVX mice supplemented with E<sup>2</sup>. This study suggests that chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage and the consequent drop in circulating estrogens significantly contribute to vulnerability to CRCIs, underscoring the importance of estradiol in mitigating CRCI risks.</p>

                <p>Learning to solve a new problem involves identifying the operating rules, which can be accelerated if known rules generalize in the new context. We ask how prior experience affects learning a new rule that is distinct from known rules. We examined how rats learned a new spatial navigation task after having previously learned tasks with different navigation rules. The new task differed from the previous tasks in spatial layout and navigation rule. We found that experience history did not impact overall performance. However, by examining navigation choice sequences in the new task, we found experience-dependent differences in exploration patterns during early stages of learning, as well as differences in the types of errors made during stable performance. The differences were consistent with the animals adopting experience-dependent memory strategies to discover and implement the new rule. Our results indicate prior experience shapes the strategies for solving novel problems, and the impact of prior experience remains persistent.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0365-24.2024?rss=1">A Subcortical Model for Auditory Forward Masking with Efferent Control of Cochlear Gain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous physiological and psychophysical studies have explored whether feedback to the cochlea from the efferent system influences forward masking. The present work proposes that the limited growth-of-masking (GOM) observed in auditory nerve (AN) fibers may have been misunderstood; namely, that this limitation may be due to the influence of anesthesia on the efferent system. Building on the premise that the unanesthetized AN may exhibit GOM similar to more central nuclei, the present computational modeling study demonstrates that feedback from the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents may contribute to GOM observed physiologically in onset-type neurons in both the cochlear nucleus and inferior colliculus (IC). Additionally, the computational model of MOC efferents used here generates a decrease in masking with longer masker-signal delays similar to that observed in IC physiology and in psychophysical studies. An advantage of this explanation over alternative physiological explanations (e.g., that forward masking requires inhibition from the superior paraolivary nucleus) is that this theory can explain forward masking observed in the brainstem, early in the ascending pathway. For explaining psychoacoustic results, one strength of this model is that it can account for the lack of elevation in thresholds observed when masker level is randomly varied from interval-to-interval, a result that is difficult to explain using the conventional temporal window model of psychophysical forward masking. Future directions for evaluating the efferent mechanism as a contributing mechanism for psychoacoustic results are discussed.</p>

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscripts’ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

                <p>by Rekha Gopalan-Nair, Aurore Coissac, Ludovic Legrand, Céline Lopez-Roques, Yann Pécrix, Céline Vandecasteele, Olivier Bouchez, Xavier Barlet, Anne Lanois, Alain Givaudan, Julien Brillard, Stéphane Genin, Alice Guidot</p>

Adaptation is usually explained by beneficial genetic mutations that are transmitted from parents to offspring and become fixed in the adapted population. However, genetic mutation analysis alone is not sufficient to fully explain the adaptive processes, and several studies report the existence of nongenetic (or epigenetic) inheritance that can enable adaptation to new environments. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis of the role of DNA methylation, a form of epigenetic modification, in adaptation of the plant pathogen <i>Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum</i> to the host during experimental evolution. Using SMRT-seq technology, we analyzed the methylomes of 31 experimentally evolved clones obtained after serial passages on 5 different plant species during 300 generations. Comparison with the methylome of the ancestral clone revealed a list of 50 differential methylated sites (DMSs) at the GTWWAC motif. Gene expression analysis of the 39 genes targeted by these DMSs revealed limited correlation between differential methylation and differential expression of the corresponding genes. Only 1 gene showed a correlation, the RSp0338 gene encoding the EpsR regulator protein. The MSRE-qPCR technology, used as an alternative approach for DNA methylation analysis, also found the 2 DMSs upstream RSp0338. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated the contribution of these 2 DMSs in host adaptation. As these DMSs appeared very early in the experimental evolution, we hypothesize that such fast epigenetic changes can allow rapid adaptation to the plant stem environment. In addition, we found that the change in DNA methylation upstream RSp0338 remains stable at least for 100 generations outside the host and thus can contribute to long-term adaptation to the host plant. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a direct link between bacterial epigenetic variation and adaptation to a new environment.

                Background The interaction between Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Veillonella species (Veillonella spp.) is unclear. This study aims to investigate the interaction between S. mutans and Veillonella spp. on caries development using systematic review. Methods This systematic review was accorded to the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Three electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library, were used to conduct a systematic search for eligible studies from their inception until July 18, 2023. PROSPERO registration number was No. CRD42023445968. Results We initially identified 4,774 articles. After eliminating duplicates and irrelevant articles, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies revealed important aspects of the relationship between S. mutans and Veillonellae spp. in dental caries. One significant finding is that Veillonellae spp. can affect the acid production capacity of S. mutans. Some studies indicate that Veillonellae spp. can inhibit the acid production by S. mutans, potentially reducing the cariogenic process. Another aspect is the competition for substrates. Veillonellae spp. utilize lactic acid, which is a by product of S. mutans metabolism, as a source of carbon. This metabolic interaction may decrease the availability of lactic acid for S. mutans, potentially influencing its cariogenic potential. Conclusions This systematic review highlights the emerging evidence on the interaction between S. mutans and Veillonellae spp. in dental caries. The findings suggest that Veillonellae spp. can modulate the acid production, and substrate competition of S. mutans, potentially influencing the cariogenic process.

                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                Background Active venous leg ulcer (VLU) is the most severe manifestation of chronic venous disease which not only affects patients’ health, but also decreases the quality of life, and delivers economic burdens. Treatment of superficial venous reflux with early endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) has been associated with reducing ulcer recurrence levels and promoting faster VLU healing. We reported three cases of patients with active VLU undergoing EVLA with different approaches. Case illustration Three patients came with complaint of leg ulcer, diagnosed with C6sEpAsdPr, with venous clinical severity scores (VCSS) of 15, 23, and 22 respectively. Severe great saphenous veins (GSV) reflux was found in all patients by duplex ultrasound examination. The second patient had undergone above-the-knee EVLA. All patients underwent EVLA using 1470-nano meter wavelength laser device and ELVeS radial fiber (Biolitec, Bonn, Germany). The laser energy protocol used was 6 W linear endovenous energy density (LEED) 50 J/cm for proximal until media ATK GSV ablation, 5 W LEED 40 J/cm for media ATK until proximal below-the-knee (BTK) GSV, and 2 W LEED 20 J/cm for proximal until distal BTK GSV. The third patient was also treated with EVLA for small saphenous vein severe reflux. Follow-up until 6 months post-EVLA showed significant healing of the ulcer with 14, 16, and 17 VCSS reduction consecutively without any complication. Conclusion We’ve reported three cases of patients with active VLU undergoing EVLA until BTK with significant results. The EVLA of GSV until BTK where there is still significant reflux is safe and provides satisfactory results in patients with VLU.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-736/v2?src=rss">Life should be redefined: Any molecule with the ability to self-replicate should be considered life [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the nature of life and its propensity for reproduction has long been a question that humans aspire to answer. Reproduction, a defining characteristic of life, fundamentally involves the replication of genetic material, be it DNA or RNA. The driving force behind this replication process has always intrigued scientists. In recent years, theories involving selfish genes, the RNA world, and entropic forces have been proposed by some scholars. These theories seem to suggest that life, as we know it, exists solely in Earth’s environment and is based on a single type of genetic material, either DNA or RNA. However, if we broaden our definition of life to include any replicable molecules, we might be able to transcend traditional thought. This could potentially enhance our understanding of the impetus behind DNA replication and provide deeper insights into the essence of life.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>De novo variants in <i>cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase</i> (<i>CUL3</i>) have been strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but no large case series have been reported so far. Here, we aimed to collect sporadic cases carrying rare variants in <i>CUL3</i>, describe the genotype–phenotype correlation, and investigate the underlying pathogenic mechanism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Genetic data and detailed clinical records were collected via multicenter collaboration. Dysmorphic facial features were analyzed using GestaltMatcher. Variant effects on CUL3 protein stability were assessed using patient-derived T-cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We assembled a cohort of 37 individuals with heterozygous <i>CUL3</i> variants presenting a syndromic NDD characterized by intellectual disability with or without autistic features. Of these, 35 have loss-of-function (LoF) and 2 have missense variants. <i>CUL3</i> LoF variants in patients may affect protein stability leading to perturbations in protein homeostasis, as evidenced by decreased ubiquitin-protein conjugates in vitro. Notably, we show that 4E-BP1 (EIF4EBP1), a prominent substrate of CUL3, fails to be targeted for proteasomal degradation in patient-derived cells.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further refines the clinical and mutational spectrum of <i>CUL3</i>-associated NDDs, expands the spectrum of cullin RING E3 ligase-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, and suggests haploinsufficiency via LoF variants is the predominant pathogenic mechanism.

                Background Better affordability of data plans and an increase in “budget” smartphones have resulted in an exponential rise in internet and smartphone users. The ease of access to sexually explicit material (SEM) coupled with adolescents’ impulsivity makes them prone to excessive SEM exposure and may affect the development of sexuality via the perceived realism of such content. This study was done to study the influence between problematic smartphone usage (PSU) and sexuality development among late adolescent boys. Methods One hundred and thirty-four adolescents aged 18-19 years, studying in a medical university, participated in this cross-sectional study. Smartphone Addiction Scale – short version (SAS-SV) to evaluate PSU and a content validated semi-structured proforma to evaluate gender identity, sexual orientation, sources of information on pubertal changes, and exposure to pornographic content was used. We expressed results as proportion and summary measures (Mean±SD), Chi-square test to find influence between PSU and adolescent sexuality development. Results We found a 45.5% prevalence of PSU. Among study participants, 88% were attracted to the opposite sex, 6% were attracted to the same-sex, and 6% were attracted to both sexes. Three per cent of participants liked wearing clothes of the opposite sex, 7.5% wanted to be members of the opposite sex, whereas 10.4% were not comfortable with their genitalia. They obtained information regarding pubertal changes from friends (85) and media (78). Many had exposure to pornographic content (90%), with the youngest being nine years old. Conclusion Nearly half of the late adolescents have PSU. Pornographic contents are accessed through Smartphones.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97916">Tumor-infiltrating nerves functionally alter brain circuits and modulate behavior in a mouse model of head-and-neck cancer</a></h4>

              
                Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors (decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88256">PITAR, a DNA damage-inducible cancer/testis long noncoding RNA, inactivates p53 by binding and stabilizing TRIM28 mRNA</a></h4>

              
                In tumors with WT p53, alternate mechanisms of p53 inactivation are reported. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA, <i>PITAR</i> (<i>p</i>53 <i>I</i>nactivating <i>T</i>RIM28 <i>A</i>ssociated <i>R</i>NA), as an inhibitor of p53. <i>PITAR</i> is an oncogenic Cancer/testis lncRNA and is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSC). We establish that <i>TRIM28</i> mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a direct target of <i>PITAR. PITAR</i> interaction with <i>TRIM28</i> RNA stabilized <i>TRIM28</i> mRNA, which resulted in increased TRIM28 protein levels and reduced p53 steady-state levels due to enhanced p53 ubiquitination. DNA damage activated <i>PITAR</i>, in addition to p53, in a p53-independent manner, thus creating an incoherent feedforward loop to inhibit the DNA damage response by p53. While <i>PITAR</i> silencing inhibited the growth of WT p53 containing GSCs in vitro and reduced glioma tumor growth in vivo, its overexpression enhanced the tumor growth in a <i>TRIM28</i>-dependent manner and promoted resistance to Temozolomide. Thus, we establish an alternate way of p53 inactivation by <i>PITAR</i>, which maintains low p53 levels in normal cells and attenuates the DNA damage response by p53. Finally, we propose <i>PITAR</i> as a potential GBM therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96852">Dynamic chromatin architecture identifies new autoimmune-associated enhancers for IL2 and novel genes regulating CD4+ T cell activation</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic signals associated with autoimmune disease. The majority of these signals are located in non-coding regions and likely impact <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (cRE). Because cRE function is dynamic across cell types and states, profiling the epigenetic status of cRE across physiological processes is necessary to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which autoimmune variants contribute to disease risk. We localized risk variants from 15 autoimmune GWAS to cRE active during TCR-CD28 co-stimulation of naïve human CD4+ T cells. To characterize how dynamic changes in gene expression correlate with cRE activity, we measured transcript levels, chromatin accessibility, and promoter–cRE contacts across three phases of naive CD4+ T cell activation using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiC. We identified ~1200 protein-coding genes physically connected to accessible disease-associated variants at 423 GWAS signals, at least one-third of which are dynamically regulated by activation. From these maps, we functionally validated a novel stretch of evolutionarily conserved intergenic enhancers whose activity is required for activation-induced <i>IL2</i> gene expression in human and mouse, and is influenced by autoimmune-associated genetic variation. The set of genes implicated by this approach are enriched for genes controlling CD4+ T cell function and genes involved in human inborn errors of immunity, and we pharmacologically validated eight implicated genes as novel regulators of T cell activation. These studies directly show how autoimmune variants and the genes they regulate influence processes involved in CD4+ T cell proliferation and activation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95393">Sensitivity to vocal emotions emerges in newborns at 37 weeks gestational age</a></h4>

              
                Emotional responsiveness in neonates, particularly their ability to discern vocal emotions, plays an evolutionarily adaptive role in human communication and adaptive behaviors. The developmental trajectory of emotional sensitivity in neonates is crucial for understanding the foundations of early social-emotional functioning. However, the precise onset of this sensitivity and its relationship with gestational age (GA) remain subjects of investigation. In a study involving 120 healthy neonates categorized into six groups based on their GA (ranging from 35 and 40 weeks), we explored their emotional responses to vocal stimuli. These stimuli encompassed disyllables with happy and neutral prosodies, alongside acoustically matched nonvocal control sounds. The assessments occurred during natural sleep states using the odd-ball paradigm and event-related potentials. The results reveal a distinct developmental change at 37 weeks GA, marking the point at which neonates exhibit heightened perceptual acuity for emotional vocal expressions. This newfound ability is substantiated by the presence of the mismatch response, akin to an initial form of adult mismatch negativity, elicited in response to positive emotional vocal prosody. Notably, this perceptual shift’s specificity becomes evident when no such discrimination is observed in acoustically matched control sounds. Neonates born before 37 weeks GA do not display this level of discrimination ability. This developmental change has important implications for our understanding of early social-emotional development, highlighting the role of gestational age in shaping early perceptual abilities. Moreover, while these findings introduce the potential for a valuable screening tool for conditions like autism, characterized by atypical social-emotional functions, it is important to note that the current data are not yet robust enough to fully support this application. This study makes a substantial contribution to the broader field of developmental neuroscience and holds promise for future research on early intervention in neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<p>Background/Objectives: With the rapid expansion of the global sports market, the significance of sports sponsorship has attracted growing attention. However, during the golden age of the sports industry&amp;amp;rsquo;s development in China, international sports brand giants such as Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour have rapidly captured a substantial share of the Chinese sports consumer market through their distinctive product designs and varied marketing strategies. This has resulted in a highly competitive environment for China&amp;amp;rsquo;s sports goods industry. Therefore, fostering the improved development of domestic sports brands has become a crucial issue deserving of thorough scholarly investigation. This study examines how consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; differing levels of sports involvement and the degree of fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event affect their cognitive and emotional responses to sports sponsorships. Methods: By employing Predictive Coding Theory and ERP (event-related potential) brainwave technology, this study delves into the psychological and neurobiological levels to analyze the impact of consumer sports involvement on the processing of sponsorship information. Results: The results indicate significant differences in cognitive and emotional responses between high-involvement and low-involvement consumers. Additionally, the fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event also significantly affects consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; cognitive and emotional responses. These differences stem from consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; complex and sophisticated predictive coding models. Conclusions: This study not only provides scientific evidence for sports brands in selecting and executing sponsorship activities, but also offers new perspectives for evaluating and optimizing sponsorship effectiveness.</p>

	<p>The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cornerstone tool for the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of selected patient populations. EEGs offer significant advantages such as high temporal resolution, real-time cortical function assessment, and bedside usability. The quantitative EEG (qEEG) added the possibility of long recordings being processed in a compressive manner, making EEG revision more efficient for experienced users, and more friendly for new ones. Recent advancements in commercially available software, such as Persyst, have significantly expanded and facilitated the use of qEEGs, marking the beginning of a new era in its application. As a result, there has been a notable increase in the practical, real-world utilization of qEEGs in recent years. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current applications of qEEGs in daily neurological emergencies and ICU practice, and some elementary principles of qEEGs using Persyst software in clinical settings. This article illustrates basic qEEG patterns encountered in critical care and adopts the new terminology proposed for spectrogram reporting.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1078/v1?src=rss">Examining the relationship between health literacy and pesticide protective behaviors among farmers in Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The use of chemical pesticides without proper health literacy (HL) and necessary pesticide protective behaviors (PPB) can result in adverse effects on human health. Methods This study aims to determine if there is a correlation between HL and PPB among farmers in the Nakhon Ratchasima province, using a random sample of 464 farmers. Structured interviews consisted of three parts: 1. General information, 2. Health literacy (including knowledge, understanding, and other sub-aspects), and 3. Protective behaviors against chemical exposure. Each part of the questionnaire had a reliability index of 0.60 or higher. The reliability of the 2nd and 3rd parts of the questionnaire were as follows: sub-sections of part 2 had a Kuder-Richardson (KR-20) coefficient of 0.79 and Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficient of 0.85-0.86, while part 3 had an α of 0.88. Risk of chemical exposure was assessed using a Cholinesterase Reactive Paper test administered by a finger-prick blood test. Data was analyzed using the Spearman correlation and binary logistic regression. The study was reviewed by the Human Research Ethics Committee with the approval date: August 9, 2021, and expiry date: August 9, 2022. Results Most participants had moderate levels of overall HL (48.8%) and PPB (44.6%). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between HL and PPB (rs(478) = 0.70, p<.005). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that HL had a statistically significant positive association with PPB (p<.001, OR = 6.57, 95% CI 3.95, 10.94) and was associated with blood cholinesterase levels. Conclusions These findings highlight the need for increased health literacy among farmers in Thailand to ensure correct protective behaviors against chemical exposure and reduce the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on human health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1076/v1?src=rss">Prevalence, satisfaction and preference of tooth shades and their correlation with age, gender and skin shade: A cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Shade selection is one of the most important factors that determines the satisfaction of the patient with the dental prosthesis and thus the overall success of the treatment. Conventional methods of shade selection require the presence of existing teeth or past dental/photographic records. In the absence of these, shade selection becomes challenging and must be done subjectively and arbitrarily based on the patient’s age and sex. This study aims to assess the prevalence, satisfaction, and preference of tooth shades, investigating their correlation with age, sex, and skin shade in a diverse sample of 120 participants. Methods A total of 120 participants, evenly distributed among 60 males and 60 females, were surveyed. Participants were categorized into age groups (n=15) and asked about their satisfaction with existing tooth shades and their preferences. Results The most common existing tooth shade was Value 2 (52.5%). Statistical analysis using Chi-square tests revealed that Value 2 was the most desired shade among males and females alike, particularly in the age group of 41 to 50 years (p < 0.001). Shade 2L1.5 was the most prevalent (n=26), with Value 2 (59.16%) being the most sought-after shade, followed by Shade 2L1.5 (n=21), Shade 2M1 (n=18), Shade 1M1 (n=15), and Shade 2R1.5 (n=14). Existing tooth shades of Value 0 were the least common. The highest satisfaction with existing shades was observed in males aged 41 to 50 (n=15), followed by males aged 51 to 60 (n=14) and females aged 31 to 40 (n=12) and 41 to 50 (n=12). Significant differences in satisfaction were noted among males (p < 0.001). Conclusions This study reveals a consistent and strong preference among both males and females for tooth shades classified as Value 2, following the VITA Tooth-Guide 3D Master shade guide. This universal preference suggests the relevance and acceptance of this shade category across diverse patient groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-98/v5?src=rss">Metabolomic characterization of human glioblastomas and patient plasma: a pilot study [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Primary cam morphology, an acquired bony prominence at the head-neck junction of the femur, is highly prevalent in athlete populations, and causally associated with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and early hip osteoarthritis. Experts agreed on key elements for primary cam morphology and a prioritised research agenda for the field. This research agenda will require higher-quality research to achieve meaningful progress on the aetiology, prognosis and treatment of primary cam morphology in athletes. Aim To explore stakeholders’ perspectives of high-quality research in the research field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. Methods Grounded in interpretive description, we used semi-structured interviews to explore stakeholders’ perspectives of high-quality research in the primary cam morphology research field. The framework for INcreasing QUality In patient-orientated academic clinical REsearch (INQUIRE) informed the interview guide. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. We recruited a heterogenous and purposive maximum variation sample, drawing from a network of research contacts. Results Fifteen individuals, several with multiple perspectives on research quality in the field, participated. Exploring stakeholders’ perspectives on research quality through an established research quality framework (INQUIRE) illuminated areas for immediate action for research communities in the field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. We crafted five action inviting themes: research communities should: partner with athletes/patients; champion equity, diversity and inclusion; collaborate with one another; pursue open science; and nurture young scholars. Conclusion The findings of this study could inform concrete actions by research communities to pursue higher quality research—more research value and less waste—in the field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. Although the five action-inviting themes reflect contemporary trends in research, and could therefore be transferable to other areas of research, their practical application remains context- and field-specific.

                Background Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is commonly fatal, with an overall mortality rate of nearly 90%, and the risk of subsequent rupture remains high, especially in large aneurysm diameters or progressive disease. Unfavorable neck anatomy in EVAR is linked to early graft failure and long-term complications. Recently, a novel multiple stiff wire (MSW) technique has been developed to overcome the challenges of hostile neck anatomy without introducing additional devices and procedural complexity. It has also been feasible in a series of elective cases. In this case, we report the first-ever utilization of the MSW technique in an emergency case of an acute contained rAAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck who underwent Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR). Case presentation A 61-year-old man came with intermittent sharp stomach pain radiating to his back since three weeks ago. Physical examination showed elevated blood pressure and anemic conjunctiva. Laboratory examinations showed anemia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer level, high creatinine level, and low eGFR. CT-Scan Angiography (CTA) revealed severely hostile anatomy, a conical-shaped abdominal aorta aneurysm with a length of 13.2 cm and a maximum diameter of 9.3 cm with angulation of 90.1°. The patient was diagnosed with Ruptured AAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck. Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) management with MSW technique was planned for him. After four days, The patient was discharged in a clinically stable condition with optimal medical treatment and education. Conclusion The endovascular approach could be performed in emergency settings and has been proven to reduce length of stay, mortality, and morbidity rates. In this case, the endovascular approach with the MSW technique showed promising results for the patient.

                Background Traditional optimization methods often struggle to balance global exploration and local refinement, particularly in complex real-world problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel hybrid optimization strategy that integrates the Nelder-Mead (NM) technique and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), named the Genetic and Nelder-Mead Algorithm (GANMA). This hybrid approach aims to enhance performance across various benchmark functions and parameter estimation tasks. Methods GANMA combines the global search capabilities of GA with the local refinement strength of NM. It is first tested on 15 benchmark functions commonly used to evaluate optimization strategies. The effectiveness of GANMA is also demonstrated through its application to parameter estimation problems, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. Results GANMA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of robustness, convergence speed, and solution quality. The hybrid algorithm excels across different function landscapes, including those with high dimensionality and multimodality, which are often encountered in real-world optimization issues. Additionally, GANMA improves model accuracy and interpretability in parameter estimation tasks, enhancing both model fitting and prediction. Conclusions GANMA proves to be a flexible and powerful optimization method suitable for both benchmark optimization and real-world parameter estimation challenges. Its capability to efficiently explore parameter spaces and refine solutions makes it a promising tool for scientific, engineering, and economic applications. GANMA offers a valuable solution for improving model performance and effectively handling complex optimization problems.

Detailed method descriptions are essential for reproducibility, research evaluation, and effective data reuse. We summarize the key recommendations for life sciences researchers and research institutions described in the European Commission PRO-MaP report.

Essential details about study methods are often missing from academic research papers in the life sciences, which can adversely affect reproducibility, undermine trust and impair researchers’ ability to reuse methods and data. This Perspective article describes PRO-MaP (Promoting Reusable and Open Methods And Protocols), which aims to increase and improve the reporting of detailed, structured and open methods and reusable step-by-step protocols in the life sciences.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002785">Identification of a highly efficient chloroplast-targeting peptide for plastid engineering</a></h4>

Plastids are pivotal target organelles for comprehensively enhancing photosynthetic and metabolic traits in plants via plastid engineering. Plastidial proteins predominantly originate in the nucleus and must traverse membrane-bound multiprotein translocons to access these organelles. This import process is meticulously regulated by chloroplast-targeting peptides (cTPs). Whereas many cTPs have been employed to guide recombinantly expressed functional proteins to chloroplasts, there is a critical need for more efficient cTPs. Here, we performed a comprehensive exploration and comparative assessment of an advanced suite of cTPs exhibiting superior targeting capabilities. We employed a multifaceted approach encompassing computational prediction, in planta expression, fluorescence tracking, and in vitro chloroplast import studies to identify and analyze 88 cTPs associated with <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants with phenotypes linked to chloroplast function. These polypeptides exhibited distinct abilities to transport green fluorescent protein (GFP) to various compartments within leaf cells, particularly chloroplasts. A highly efficient cTP derived from <i>Arabidopsis</i> plastid ribosomal protein L35 (At2g24090) displayed remarkable effectiveness in chloroplast localization. This cTP facilitated the activities of chloroplast-targeted RNA-processing proteins and metabolic enzymes within plastids. This cTP could serve as an ideal transit peptide for precisely targeting biomolecules to plastids, leading to advancements in plastid engineering.

<p>High nicotine dose induces anxiety-like behavior in mice in the Open Field Test, alongside oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) reduction in brain regions. Cannabidiol acts as an anxiolytic, exhibiting antioxidant activities, reducing cytokines, and normalizing BDNF levels.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>High doses of nicotine administered to rodents serve as a model for studying anxiety and test compounds' potential anxiolytic effects. At these doses, anxiety in rodents is accompanied by disruption of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The endocannabinoids and nicotine modulate several central nervous system processes via their specific receptors, impacting locomotion, anxiety, memory, nociception, and reward. Cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient of <i>Cannabis sativa</i> L., is devoid of psychoactive actions and has gained attention for its anxiolytic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, among others. This work aims to examine the potential anxiety-reducing properties of CBD in a well-established experimental mouse model of anxiety-like behavior induced by high doses of nicotine on male C57BL/6 mice. In this context, the open-field behavioral test was specially conducted to assess CBD's effects on anxiety-like behavior and locomotion. Brain neuronal plasticity, modulated by BDNF, along with a diverse array of blood's metabolic markers, was examined as a means of evaluating systemic toxicity under various treatments. Finally, oxidative stress was evaluated through the measurement of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA), while pro-inflammatory cytokine assessments were conducted to evaluate redox status and immune system function. Our research suggests that CBD shows potential in reducing anxiety-like behaviors induced by high doses of nicotine, by mitigating changes in BDNF protein levels in cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. At the same time, CBD targets specific liver enzymes, maintains tissue's systemic toxicity (i.e., renal, kidney, and pancreatic), balances redox status (SOD, GSH, and MDA), and regulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27059?af=R">Laser Ablation of Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia for Medically Refractory Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is the most common neuronal heterotopia, frequently resulting in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Here, we characterize variables that predict good epilepsy outcomes following surgical intervention using stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) -informed magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective review of consecutive cases from a single high-volume epilepsy referral center identified patients who underwent SEEG evaluation for PVNH to characterize the intervention and outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty-nine patients underwent SEEG-guided MRgLITT of the seizure onset zone (SoZ) in PVNH and associated epileptic tissue. PVNH and polymicrogyria (PMG) were densely sampled with a mean of 16.5 (SD = 2)/209.4 (SD = 36.9) SEEG probes/recording contacts per patient. Ablation principally targeted just the PVNH and cortex that was abnormal on imaging was ablated (5 patients) only if implicated in the SoZ. Volumetric analyses revealed a high percentage of PVNH SoZ ablation (96.6%, SD = 5.3%) in unilateral and bilateral (92.9%, SD = 7.2%) cases. Mean follow-up duration was 31.4 months (SD = 20.9). Seizure freedom (ILAE 1) was excellent: unilateral PVNH without other imaging abnormalities, 80%; PVNH with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) or PMG, 63%; bilateral PVNH, 50%. SoZ ablation percentage significantly impacted surgical outcomes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PVNH plays a central role in seizure genesis as revealed by dense recordings and selective targeting by LITT. MRgLITT represents a transformative technological advance in PVNH-associated epilepsy with seizure control outcomes consistent with those seen in focal lesional epilepsies. In localized unilateral cases and otherwise normal imaging, PVNH ablation without invasive recordings may be considered, and this approach deserves to be explored further.
