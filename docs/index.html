	<p>Background: The role of non-linguistic factors, such as executive functions, in the reading comprehension process has been analyzed. The present research sought to investigate the relationship between executive functions and reading comprehension. Methods: In an exploratory cross-sectional study, a group of 89 fourth-grade students were evaluated, considering a balanced number of children with and without reading comprehension difficulties. Results: The results indicate that students with reading comprehension difficulties present a lowered profile with respect to both executive functions and reading variables. The path analysis indicates the presence of differences in the variables that explain reading comprehension for both groups. While in the case of students without reading comprehension difficulties, working memory has both a direct and an indirect effect, i.e., through vocabulary, on reading comprehension; in the case of children with reading comprehension difficulties, only cognitive flexibility has a direct impact. In both cases, inhibition has an indirect impact through vocabulary. Conclusions: We reflect on the differentiated role of executive functions according to the level of development of reading skills, highlighting the possibility that some skills may act in a compensatory manner in the presence of general difficulties. The role of vocabulary in the relationship between executive skills and reading is highlighted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-25/v3?src=rss">Household resilience of women migrant worker sellers of Jamu Gendong [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The selling of Jamu Gendong (an Indonesian traditional herbal medicine), is closely associated with the informal work of women who migrate to different regions. In Sukoharjo Regency and Wonogiri Regency, Central Java Province, the pressing need to meet household necessities in their places of origin compels women to assume the role of breadwinners. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the livelihood capital and resilience of migrant women selling jamu gendong. Methods The study was conducted in Ciamis Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia, in November 2022, using quantitative and qualitative methods. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample comprised 51 women selected through snowball sampling and actively involved in selling Jamu Gendong, along with six key individuals from relevant agencies. Results The research findings indicate that the households of migrant women who sell jamu gendong can survive and adapt during their migration to prevent poverty by implementing diverse livelihood strategies. They are the only ones who move without their family members renting a place to live with them. This research has identified various capital sources, including productive age and skills in preparing jamu gendong; physical capital, including road infrastructure, markets, and access to health and education facilities; and natural, social, and financial capital. This research provides an in-depth understanding of women’s roles in family economic resilience, diversification of life strategies, the importance of social capital in migrant networks, economic empowerment through migration, and the influence of cultural values on livelihood strategies. Conclusions The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the resilience demonstrated by migrant women selling jamu gendong. However, further research should be conducted in areas beyond the city center to obtain a holistic view of their resilience.

                Low-stakes assessments (LSAs) are widely used in medical education to promote continuous learning by providing formative feedback and minimizing the high-stress environment associated with high-stakes assessments. While LSAs are recognized for their role in supporting student learning, questions remain about their reliability and validity. This scoping review aims to systematically identify and synthesize existing literature on the reliability and validity of LSAs within medical education contexts. This study aims to map the methodologies used to establish psychometric parameters, identify problems, and offer best practices. The review will use the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, encompassing a comprehensive search across six academic databases and grey literature to identify relevant studies published from 2000 onward. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract data, using the Covidence tool for systematic screening and data extraction. Data will be analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide an overview of reliability and validity evidence for LSAs in medical education. Insights into motivational and psychometric theories, such as Self-Determination Theory, Classical Test Theory, and Generalizability Theory, that inform LSA design and implementation will be used to analyse the findings in this review. Expected outcomes include a detailed map of the literature on LSA reliability and validity, identification of key challenges, theoretical underpinnings and recommended strategies for improving LSA practices in medical education. Findings will inform future research and provide guidelines for optimizing the use of LSAs to enhance student learning outcomes, assessment integrity, and the educational experience in medical training.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/11/ENEURO.0342-24.2024?rss=1">A Multiparadigm Approach to Characterize Dominance Behaviors in CD1 and C57BL6 Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social status and dominance are critical factors influencing well-being and survival across multiple species. However, dominance behaviors vary widely across species, from elaborate feather displays in birds to aggression in chimps. To effectively study dominance, it is essential to clearly define and reliably measure dominance behaviors. In laboratory settings, C57BL/6 mice are commonly used to study dominance due to their stable and linear social hierarchies. However, other mouse strains are also used for laboratory research. Despite substantial evidence for strain effects on behavioral repertoires, the impact of strain on dominance in mice remains largely unstudied. To address this gap, we compared dominance behaviors between CD1 and C57BL/6 male mice across four assays: observation of agonistic behaviors, urine marking, tube test, and a reward competition. We found that CD1 mice demonstrate increased fighting, increased territorial marking through urination, and increased pushing and resisting in the tube test. We used unsupervised machine learning and pose estimation data from the reward competitions to uncover behavioral differences across strains and across rank differences between competing pairs. Of the four assays, urine marking and agonistic behaviors showed the strongest correlation with dominance in both strains. Most notably, we found that CD1 dominance rankings based on the tube test negatively correlated with rankings from all three other assays, suggesting that the tube test may measure a different behavior in CD1 mice. Our results highlight that behaviors can be strain-specific in mice and studies that measure social rank should consider assays carefully to promote reproducibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1412/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Case report: Hepatic and  pulmonary echinococcosis with reactivated tuberculosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The co-infection of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) and hydatid disease is rare. Diagnosis and treatment of this co-infection may be challenging as both diseases present with overlapping clinical manifestations, especially in war zones where the health system is destroyed. We are reporting a 45-year-old female police officer transferred to Sinnar Sudan due to ongoing conflict. She was admitted with chronic cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. The preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary TB was made based on chest X-ray examination and sputum analysis. Further imaging showed cystic lesions in both the liver and the lungs, and thus a diagnosis of Echinococcosis was made. Surgical intervention was done successfully followed by the courses of Albendazole and anti-TB medication. The clinical condition of the patient improved, with the disappearance of all symptoms. This case represents the diagnostic dilemma of dual infections in the areas of their endemicity because of the symptomatology overlap that might occur and result in an erroneous diagnosis. It does demand an appropriate diagnostic approach, thus, with advanced imaging applications, and once more, emphasizes the interdisciplinary attitude in its treatment for the best possible result.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1411/v1?src=rss">Evaluation of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southwards of Nigeria [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Nigeria is located south of the Sahara and is confronted with rapid desertification, with severe impacts in northern Nigeria with signs of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southward of Nigeria. Therefore, this study assessed the rate of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southwards in Nigeria. The climate of Imo State was studied using Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET)data. The climatic variables studied were annual rainfall, maximum and minimum annual temperatures. The mean temperature was computed from the temperature data. Data from the 30-year period from 1987 to 2016 were used. The annual rainfall and temperature data were divided into three decades, from 1987 to 1996, 1997 to 2006, and 2007 to 2016, to study the variation in decades. Mean monthly variations were also studied. Land features were also assessed. Desert encroachment was assessed in the study area using the criteria for the evaluation of desertification status proposed by the FAO/UNEP (1984). The results revealed that annual rainfall in Owerri was highest in the first decade, with a mean of 2,526.2 mm and the lowest in the third decade, with a mean of 2,278.66 mm. This shows a drop in annual rainfall as the years progressed. The results also reveal that the annual rainfall totals in Imo State are reducing by 13.50 mm annually, indicating desert encroachment as evidenced in loss of vegetation and erosion menace. According to the FAO/UNEP (1984) rating of desertification, desert encroachment in the study area is rated as ‘moderate.’ The maximum temperature shows a mean of 32 °C for the first decade, 32.5 °C for the second decade, and 32.5 °C for the third decade. The mean annual temperature of Owerri was found to increase by 0.02 ° °C per annum. This shows the atmospheric warming of Imo State.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1413/v2?src=rss">Mobile applications (apps) for tobacco cessation: Behaviour change potential and heuristic analysis using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Given the high prevalence of tobacco use, India presents a significant challenge in tobacco control. Yet, the support received for tobacco cessation is suboptimal. Hence, the aim of this narrative review was to identify and heuristically evaluate ‘high-quality’ and ‘engaging’ tobacco cessation mobile apps using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Also, to categorize and analyse their features with respect to engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. Methods A systematic search of tobacco cessation apps was done within app stores of prominent smartphone platforms developed by Apple and Android. The following search terms: ‘quit smoking,’ ‘smoking cessation, ‘stop smoking,’ ‘smoking therapy,’ ‘quit tobacco,’ ‘cigarette cessation,’ ‘cold turkey,’ and ‘quit cigarette.’ Pearson’s correlations were used to analyse correlations between app scores (Total score app-quality/mean score) and downloads/ratings and number of downloads with the overall MARS score. A Chi-square test was performed to analyse any association between app focus and app release dates. Results Total MARS scores ranged from 3.1 to 4.9. Quitsure app (4.9), Craving to Quit! app (4.8) and Stop Tobacco Mobile Trainer: Quit Smoking App (4.74) were ranked the highest according to the MARS overall mean score. Older apps focussed more on mere goal setting or substance use, as compared to behaviour change; whereas, recently developed apps are now focussing more on behaviour change. Conclusions The content and functionality of behaviour change-focused apps were of higher quality than those of other app categories. These recently developed mHealth apps can effectively supersede the traditional smoking cessation methods.

                This article explores the determinants of the consumption of geographical indication agricultural products through a ten-year systematic review. In recent years, the demand for healthier and safer products from consumers has been continuously increasing owing to the influence of the geographical indication of agricultural products. Geographical indication products, a type of label that associates food with specific regions, occupy a certain position in the global food market. This article aims to answer research questions about the determinants of the consumption of geographical indication agricultural products and provide a comparative analysis of five literature reviews related to this topic. We collected and processed relevant research data through a systematic literature review and provided transparent, complete, and accurate explanations using the PRISMA criterion. The research results reveal the consumer response to the geographical indication of agricultural products and the determining factors of different responses. The research in this article is of great significance for understanding the consumption trends and important information of geographical indication of agricultural products, helping enterprises better understand consumer behavior, and improving the income of farmers, producers, and enterprises.

However, the safety of the electric field exposure was not fully investigated. Therefore, This study aimed to observe the safety of electric field exposure on kidney and liver structures. Methods Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into one control group and three treatment groups. Animals were treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene for mammary tumour induction and exposed to non-contact electric fields individually for 10 hours a day for three weeks. Fresh samples of the kidney and liver were collected for observation of structural damage in both organs. Both organs were prepared for histopathological cross-sectioning using the paraffin method and Hematoxylin and Eosin staining followed by histological scoring using the post-examination masking method. Results Damages found in the kidney were as follows: thickening of the Bowman capsule, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, cloudy swelling, epithelial sloughing, inflammation, haemorrhage, and congestion. In addition, the number of inflammation and haemorrhage in the kidney structure of healthy rats that were exposed to electric fields was significantly lower than that in the control group. All damages to the kidneys were also found in the liver, but each showed a different degree of damage. Exposure to this electric field can cause haemorrhagic damage to the livers of healthy rats, but not to rats with breast cancer. Conclusions Exposure to non-contact electric fields can cause haemorrhagic damage to the livers of healthy rats, however, in other liver tissues and the kidneys, exposure to this electric field was safe. It can even decrease the number of inflammations and haemorrhages in the kidneys.

                Background There have been significant changes in the lifestyles of individuals in the past few decades, which has led to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Both smoking and chewing forms of tobacco are highly prevalent, especially in India, and are implicated as causes of diseases, including oropharyngeal carcinomas. Effective tobacco cessation techniques and sources can help overcome addiction and reduce the disease burden in society. The aim was to evaluate the quality and readability of contents of various sources on an internet website about tobacco cessation. Objectives i) To evaluate the readability of internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests and the quality of internet content (Google) by using the JAMA benchmark, HONcode and DISCERN questionnaire. Methods A content review was employed to screen the content of the Google search engine for educational tobacco cessation websites, and the top 50 websites were selected according to criteria and reviewed by two reviewers. The readability of the internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation was evaluated using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. The quality of the screened sites was evaluated by using the JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) benchmark, HONcode (The Health on the Net Code of Conduct) and DISCERN (Discerning the Quality of Information for Choosing Treatments) questionnaire, and the readability and quality of the screened websites were correlated using the above instruments. Results FK readability ease was found to be 49% standard and 30% easy. The FK grade test found that 33% of the content could be easily understood by < 5th grade. All 4 JAMA benchmarks were met by 23% of websites, and authorship was the least fulfilled criterion. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between FK ease score and FK grade score. Conclusions The Read-ability Ease and Read-ability Grade Levels of the websites related to tobacco cessation were not standard, and few websites fulfilled the JAMA benchmarks and had HONcode certification.

                <p>by Shuanger Li, Davorka Gulisija, Oana Carja</p>

Coexistence of multiple strains of a pathogen in a host population can present significant challenges to vaccine development or treatment efficacy. Here we discuss a novel mechanism that can increase rates of long-lived strain polymorphism, rooted in the presence of social structure in a host population. We show that social preference of interaction, in conjunction with differences in immunity between host subgroups, can exert varying selection pressure on pathogen strains, creating a balancing mechanism that supports stable viral coexistence, independent of other known mechanisms. We use population genetic models to study rates of pathogen heterozygosity as a function of population size, host population composition, mutant strain fitness differences and host social preferences of interaction. We also show that even small periodic epochs of host population stratification can lead to elevated strain coexistence. These results are robust to varying social preferences of interaction, overall differences in strain fitnesses, and spatial heterogeneity in host population composition. Our results highlight the role of host population social stratification in increasing rates of pathogen strain diversity, with effects that should be considered when designing policies or treatments with a long-term view of curbing pathogen evolution.

                <p>by Anush Devadhasan, Oren Kolodny, Oana Carja</p>

Many evolving ecosystems have spatial structures that can be conceptualized as networks, with nodes representing individuals or homogeneous subpopulations and links the patterns of spread between them. Prior models of evolution on networks do not take ecological niche differences and eco-evolutionary interplay into account. Here, we combine a resource competition model with evolutionary graph theory to study how heterogeneous topological structure shapes evolutionary dynamics under global frequency-dependent ecological interactions. We find that the addition of ecological competition for resources can produce a reversal of roles between amplifier and suppressor networks for deleterious mutants entering the population. We show that this effect is a nonlinear function of ecological niche overlap and discuss intuition for the observed dynamics using simulations and analytical approximations. We use these theoretical results together with spatial representations from imaging data to show that, for ductal carcinoma, where tumor growth is highly spatially constrained, with cells confined to a tree-like network of ducts, the topological structure can lead to higher rates of deleterious mutant hitchhiking with metabolic driver mutations, compared to tumors characterized by different spatial topologies.

CD74 is a cell-surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF binding to CD74 induces a signaling cascade resulting in the release of its cytosolic intracellular domain (CD74-ICD), which regulates transcription in naïve B and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of CD74 in the regulation of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and is characterized by massive infiltration of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment, making this tumor a good candidate for immunotherapy. The tumor and immune cells in TNBC express high levels of CD74; however, the function of this receptor in the tumor environment has not been extensively characterized. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) and tolerogenic dendritic cells) tol-DCs (were previously shown to attenuate the antitumor immune response in TNBC. Here, we demonstrate that CD74 enhances tumor growth by inducing the expansion of tumor-infiltrating tol-DCs and Bregs. Utilizing CD74-KO mice, Cre-flox mice lacking CD74 in CD23<sup>+</sup> mature B cells, mice lacking CD74 in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> population, and a CD74 inhibitor (DRQ), we elucidate the mechanism by which CD74 inhibits antitumor immunity. MIF secreted from the tumor cells activates CD74 expressed on DCs. This activation induces the binding of CD74-ICD to the SP1 promotor, resulting in the up-regulation of SP1 expression. SP1 binds the IL-1β promotor, leading to the down-regulation of its transcription. The reduced levels of IL-1β lead to decreased antitumor activity by allowing expansion of the tol-DC, which induces the expansion of the Breg population, supporting the cross-talk between these 2 populations. Taken together, these results suggest that CD74<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs are the dominant cell type involved in the regulation of TNBC progression. These findings indicate that CD74 might serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC.

                Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished in intensity, the virus continues to circulate globally. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a key enzyme in the life cycle of the virus, making it important for the development of treatments against future variants of the virus. In this work, Peruvian natural compounds were evaluated against different mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Methods In silico techniques such as virtual screening, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and energy estimation analysis were applied. Results Of the tested compounds by virtual screening, rutin was identified as the best binding agent against the different proposed Mpro mutations. In addition, computational simulations and energy estimation analysis demonstrated the high structural and energetic stability between the Mpro-rutin systems. Conclusions Overall, our study identified rutin as the most promising compound with a strong affinity for various Mpro mutations, potentially playing a key role in the development of new treatments for emerging viral variants.

                Background The provision of effective musculoskeletal physiotherapy and treatment outcomes are challenged by the shortage of resources, limitations in adherence to clinical guidelines, and client unacceptability. This study aims to evaluate the process quality of musculoskeletal physiotherapy service in the physiotherapy department of Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Mekelle, Ethiopia, 2020. Method This is a health facility-based single-embedded case study design that involves both quantitative and qualitative methods to describe the service using a three dimensions assessment for quality service evaluation (compliance of the unit, technical compliance, and service acceptability). The quantitative data was collected through document review and observation of the musculoskeletal physiotherapy unit, direct observations of 20 client-physiotherapist interactions, and chart review on systematically selected 172 client charts. For qualitative data; in-depth interviews with five Key informants and 21 clients were conducted. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS v.25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was done and data were presented using frequency and percentage. The calculated outputs were used to judge the overall service against the predetermined criteria (i.e. Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor). Results The compliance of the musculoskeletal physiotherapy unit, service providers’ technical compliance, and service acceptability by the users were judged poor (56.1%), fair (60.1%), and good (73.1%) respectively. The compliance of physiotherapists in recording patient information was concerningly poor (30.2%). The majority of clients were satisfied with the service and adhered to their treatment. Conclusion & recommendation The overall service process quality of physiotherapy service was judged as fair (62.55%). However, the assessed dimensions were not as per the expected standard. Therefore, the relevant stakeholders are recommended to improve the service provision gaps.

                Ni et al. investigate the role of actomyosin and ion exchangers in cell volume regulation. They identify a secondary volume increase (SVI) in normal-like cells via cytoskeleton-mediated NHE1 activation. SVI is absent in cancer cells and on compliant substrates. This leads to nucleus deformation, transcriptomic changes, and ERK-dependent growth inhibition.

They redefine intersectin1’s function as stabilizing growing endocytic sites through its interaction with multiple key endocytic proteins, including dynamin2, AP2, EPS15, FCHO2, and epsin1.

This leads to translational selectivity of mRNAs involved in lipid storage. They find ribosomal function to be a potential therapeutic target in treating metabolic disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96582">The sperm hook as a functional adaptation for migration and self-organized behavior</a></h4>

              
                In most murine species, spermatozoa exhibit a falciform apical hook at the head end. The function of the sperm hook is not yet clearly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of the sperm hook in the migration of spermatozoa through the female reproductive tract in <i>Mus musculus</i> (C57BL/6), using a deep tissue imaging custom-built two-photon microscope. Through live reproductive tract imaging, we found evidence indicating that the sperm hook aids in the attachment of spermatozoa to the epithelium and facilitates interactions between spermatozoa and the epithelium during migration in the uterus and oviduct. We also observed synchronized sperm beating, which resulted from the spontaneous unidirectional rearrangement of spermatozoa in the uterus. Based on live imaging of spermatozoa-epithelium interaction dynamics, we propose that the sperm hook plays a crucial role in successful migration through the female reproductive tract by providing anchor-like mechanical support and facilitating interactions between spermatozoa and the female reproductive tract in the house mouse.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87083">Switching of RNA splicing regulators in immature neuroblasts during adult neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The lateral wall of the mouse subventricular zone harbors neural stem cells (NSC, B cells) which generate proliferating transient-amplifying progenitors (TAP, C cells) that ultimately give rise to neuroblasts (NB, A cells). Molecular profiling at the single-cell level struggles to distinguish these different cell types. Here, we combined transcriptome analyses of FACS-sorted cells and single-cell RNAseq to demonstrate the existence of an abundant, clonogenic and multipotent population of immature neuroblasts (iNB cells) at the transition between TAP and migrating NB (mNB). iNB are reversibly engaged in neuronal differentiation. Indeed, they keep molecular features of both undifferentiated progenitors, plasticity and unexpected regenerative properties. Strikingly, they undergo important progressive molecular switches, including changes in the expression of splicing regulators leading to their differentiation in mNB subdividing them into two subtypes, iNB1 and iNB2. Due to their plastic properties, iNB could represent a new target for regenerative therapy of brain damage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96353">Spatiotemporal recruitment of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP8 directs endosome maturation</a></h4>

              
                The spatiotemporal transition of small GTPase Rab5 to Rab7 is crucial for early-to-late endosome maturation, yet the precise mechanism governing Rab5-to-Rab7 switching remains elusive. USP8, a ubiquitin-specific protease, plays a prominent role in the endosomal sorting of a wide range of transmembrane receptors and is a promising target in cancer therapy. Here, we identified that USP8 is recruited to Rab5-positive carriers by Rabex5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5. The recruitment of USP8 dissociates Rabex5 from early endosomes (EEs) and meanwhile promotes the recruitment of the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1. In USP8-deficient cells, the level of active Rab5 is increased, while the Rab7 signal is decreased. As a result, enlarged EEs with abundant intraluminal vesicles accumulate and digestive lysosomes are rudimentary. Together, our results reveal an important and unexpected role of a deubiquitinating enzyme in endosome maturation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98716">Spatial and temporal coordination of Duox/TrpA1/Dh31 and IMD pathways is required for the efficient elimination of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine of Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Multiple gut antimicrobial mechanisms are coordinated in space and time to efficiently fight foodborne pathogens. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) together with intestinal cell renewal play a key role in eliminating gut microbes. A complementary mechanism would be to isolate and treat pathogenic bacteria while allowing colonization by commensals. Using real-time imaging to follow the fate of ingested bacteria, we demonstrate that while commensal <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> freely circulate within the intestinal lumen, pathogenic strains such as <i>Erwinia carotovora</i> or <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>, are blocked in the anterior midgut where they are rapidly eliminated by antimicrobial peptides. This sequestration of pathogenic bacteria in the anterior midgut requires the Duox enzyme in enterocytes, and both TrpA1 and Dh31 in enteroendocrine cells. Supplementing larval food with hCGRP, the human homolog of Dh31, is sufficient to block the bacteria, suggesting the existence of a conserved mechanism. While the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is essential for eliminating the trapped bacteria, it is dispensable for the blockage. Genetic manipulations impairing bacterial compartmentalization result in abnormal colonization of posterior midgut regions by pathogenic bacteria. Despite a functional IMD pathway, this ectopic colonization leads to bacterial proliferation and larval death, demonstrating the critical role of bacteria anterior sequestration in larval defense. Our study reveals a temporal orchestration during which pathogenic bacteria, but not innocuous, are confined in the anterior part of the midgut in which they are eliminated in an IMD-pathway-dependent manner.

                Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, non-adherent cells remain challenging. In this study, we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI(CA)2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97665">T-follicular helper cells are epigenetically poised to transdifferentiate into T-regulatory type 1 cells</a></h4>

              
                Chronic antigenic stimulation can trigger the formation of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-producing T-regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells in vivo. We have recently shown that murine T-follicular helper (TFH) cells are precursors of TR1 cells and that the TFH-to-TR1 cell transdifferentiation process is characterized by the progressive loss and acquisition of opposing transcription factor gene expression programs that evolve through at least one transitional cell stage. Here, we use a broad range of bulk and single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic tools to investigate the epigenetic underpinnings of this process. At the single-cell level, the TFH-to-TR1 cell transition is accompanied by both, downregulation of TFH cell-specific gene expression due to loss of chromatin accessibility, and upregulation of TR1 cell-specific genes linked to chromatin regions that remain accessible throughout the transdifferentiation process, with minimal generation of new open chromatin regions. By interrogating the epigenetic status of accessible TR1 genes on purified TFH and conventional T-cells, we find that most of these genes, including <i>Il10</i>, are already poised for expression at the TFH cell stage. Whereas these genes are closed and hypermethylated in Tconv cells, they are accessible, hypomethylated, and enriched for H3K27ac-marked and hypomethylated active enhancers in TFH cells. These enhancers are enriched for binding sites for the TFH and TR1-associated transcription factors TOX-2, IRF4, and c-MAF. Together, these data suggest that the TR1 gene expression program is genetically imprinted at the TFH cell stage.

">Ethanol alters mechanosensory habituation in C. elegans by way of the BK potassium channel through a novel mechanism</a></h4>

              
                In this research, we investigated how alcohol modulates the simplest form of learning, habituation, in Caenorhabditis elegans. We used our high throughput Multi-Worm Tracker to conduct a large scale study of more than 21,000 wild-type worms to assess the effects of different doses of alcohol on habituation of the well-characterized tap withdrawal response. We found that the effect of alcohol on habituation of the reversal response to repeated mechanosensory stimuli (taps) differed depending on the component of the reversal response assessed. Furthermore, we discovered that alcohol shifted the dominant response to tap from a backward reversal to a brief forward movement. Because the large conductance potassium (BK) channel has been shown to be important for alcohol's effects on behaviour in a variety of organisms, including C. elegans, we investigated whether the C. elegans BK channel ortholog, SLO-1, mediated the effects of alcohol on habituation. We tested several different strains of worms with mutations in slo-1 along with wild-type controls; null mutations in slo-1 made animals resistant to alcohol induced changes in learning. However, a mutation in the putative ethanol binding site on SLO-1 did not disrupt ethanol's impact on habituation. Finally, by degrading SLO-1 in different parts of the nervous system we found that SLO-1s function in ethanol's impact on habituation is likely distributed throughout the neural circuit that responds to tap. Based on these results, our main conclusions are 1) ethanol is not a general facilitator or inhibitor of habituation but rather a complex modulator, 2) SLO-1 is required for ethanol's effect on habituation, 3) ethanol is interacting (directly or indirectly) with SLO-1 through a novel unidentified mechanism to influence response plasticity.

">Assessing changes in whole-brain structural connectivity in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's Disease using diffusion imaging and tractography</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial, progressive neurodegenerative disease that has a profound impact on those it afflicts. Its hallmark pathophysiology is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain which trigger a host of motor and non-motor symptoms. Many preclinical research efforts utilize unilateral lesion models to assess the neural mechanisms of PD and explore new therapeutic approaches because these models produce similar motor symptoms to those of PD patients. The goal of this work is to examine changes in brain structure resulting from a unilateral lesion both within the nigrostriatal system, where dopaminergic neurons are lost, and throughout the brain. Using multi-shell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and correlational tractography, we assessed microstructural changes throughout the brain resulting from unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the median forebrain bundle (MFB). Following lesioning, the PD phenotype was confirmed using behavioral and histological assessment. Correlational tractography found networks of fiber tracts that were either positively or negatively correlated with lesion status throughout the brain. Analyzing patterns of intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity between the positively and negatively correlated fiber tracts revealed two separate neural networks. The first contained only negatively correlated fibers in the lesioned hemisphere consistent with the local effects of the lesion (i.e. dopaminergic depletion in the nigrostriatal system). The second contained systematically overlapping fiber tracts in the lesioned and non-lesioned hemispheres including the olfactory system and cerebellum, which we suggest are indicative of adaptive mechanisms to compensate for the lesion. Taken together, these results suggest that correlational tractography is a reasonable tool to examine whole brain structural changes in rodent models of neurodegenerative disease, and may have future translational value as a diagnostic tool for patients with PD.

">Neuronal heterogeneity of normalization strength in a circuit model</a></h4>

              
                The size of a neuron's receptive field increases along the visual hierarchy. Neurons in higher-order visual areas integrate information through a canonical computation called normalization, where neurons respond sublinearly to multiple stimuli in the receptive field. Neurons in the visual cortex exhibit highly heterogeneous degrees of normalization. Recent population recordings from visual cortex find that the interactions between neurons, measured by spike count correlations, depend on their normalization strengths. However, the circuit mechanism underlying the heterogeneity of normalization is unclear. In this work, we study normalization in a spiking neuron network model of visual cortex. The model produces a range of neuronal heterogeneity of normalization strength and the heterogeneity is highly correlated with the inhibitory current each neuron receives. Our model reproduces the dependence of spike count correlations on normalization as observed in experimental data, which is explained by the covariance with the inhibitory current. We find that neurons with stronger normalization are more sensitive to contrast differences in images and encode information more efficiently. In addition, networks with more heterogeneity in normalization encode more information about visual stimuli. Together, our model provides a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous normalization strengths in the visual cortex, and sheds new light on the computational benefits of neuronal heterogeneity.

                DDX3X is an X-linked RNA helicases that escapes X chromosome inactivation and is expressed at higher levels in female brains. Mutations in DDX3X are associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are predominantly identified in females. Using cellular and mouse models, we show that Ddx3x mediates sexual dimorphisms in brain development at a molecular, cellular, and behavioral level. During cortical neuronal development, Ddx3x sustains a female-biased signature of enhanced ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA translation. Female neurons display higher levels of ribosomal proteins and larger nucleoli, and these sex dimorphisms are obliterated by Ddx3x loss. Ddx3x regulates dendritic outgrowth in a sex- and dose-dependent manner in both female and male neurons, and dendritic spine development only in female neurons. Further, ablating Ddx3x conditionally in forebrain neurons is sufficient to yield sex-specific changes in developmental outcomes and motor function. Together, these findings pose Ddx3x as a mediator of sexual differentiation during neurodevelopment and open new avenues to understand sex differences in health and disease.

">Electrical synapse molecular diversity revealed by proximity-based proteomic discovery</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal circuits are composed of synapses that are either chemical, where signals are transmitted via neurotransmitter release and reception, or electrical, where signals pass directly through interneuronal gap junction channels. While the molecular complexity that controls chemical synapse structure and function is well appreciated, the proteins of electrical synapses beyond the gap-junction-forming Connexins are not well defined. Yet, electrical synapses are expected to be molecularly complex beyond the gap junctions. Connexins are integral membrane proteins requiring vesicular transport and membrane insertion/retrieval to achieve function, homeostasis, and plasticity. Additionally, electron microscopy of neuronal gap junctions reveals neighboring electron dense regions termed the electrical synapse density (ESD). To reveal the molecular complexity of the electrical synapse proteome, we used proximity-dependent biotinylation (TurboID) linked to neural Connexins in zebrafish. Proteomic analysis of developing and mature nervous systems identifies hundreds of Connexin-associated proteins, with overlapping and distinct representation during development and adulthood. The identified protein classes span cell adhesion molecules, cytoplasmic scaffolds, vesicular trafficking, and proteins usually associated with the post synaptic density (PSD) of chemical synapses. Using circuits with stereotyped electrical and chemical synapses, we define molecular sub-synaptic compartments of ESD localizing proteins, we find molecular heterogeneity amongst electrical synapse populations, and we examine the synaptic intermingling of electrical and chemical synapse proteins. Taken together, these results reveal a new complexity of electrical synapse molecular diversity and highlight a novel overlap between chemical and electrical synapse proteomes. Moreover, human homologs of the electrical synapse proteins are associated with autism, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders, providing a novel framework towards understanding neuro-atypical states.

">Visual and auditory object representations in ventral visual cortex after restoring sight in humans</a></h4>

              
                Visual category-selective representations in human ventral occipital temporal cortex (VOTC) seem to emerge early in infancy. Surprisingly, the VOTC of congenitally blind humans features category-selectivity for auditory and haptic objects. Yet it has been unknown whether VOTC would show category-selective visual responses if sight were restored in congenitally blind humans. Assuming competition for synaptic space during development, cross-modal activation of VOTC as a consequence of congenital blindness might interfere with visual processing in sight-recovery individuals. To test this hypothesis, we investigated adults who had suffered a transient phase of congenital blindness due to bilateral dense cataracts before their sight was restored by cataract-removal surgery. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants watched movies of faces, scenes, body parts and other objects in the visual condition, while in the auditory condition they listened to the corresponding sounds. The most prominent group difference was the reduced face-selectivity in individuals with reversed congenital cataracts compared to age- and sex-matched normally-sighted individuals. In addition, a double dissociation was found: only sight-recovery individuals demonstrated significant decoding accuracy of visual categories based on auditory category representations in VOTC, while only normally-sighted individuals' VOTC decoded auditory categories based on visual category representations. The present results uncovered the neural mechanisms of previously observed face processing impairments in individuals with reversed congenital blindness. We suggest that lower face-selectivity in the sight recovery group might arise from selective deficits in the cortical representation of the central visual field in lower-tier visual areas. Additionally, we speculate that in higher-order visual areas cross-modal activity might facilitate - rather than interfere - with visual functional recovery after congenital blindness.

">Transcallosal generation of phase aligned beta-bursts underlies TMS-induced interhemispheric inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Background The excitability of the sensorimotor (SM1) cortices is reflected in the bilateral ~20 Hz beta oscillations. The extent to which these oscillations subtend the interhemispheric inhibition captured by the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) ipsilateral Silent Period (iSP) protocol is unknown. Objectives We investigated the relationship between movement-induced beta suppression, iSP, and manual dexterity. Methods Forty adults underwent an Electroencephalography assessment of beta oscillations during volitional left hand movement and a TMS assessment of iSP recorded from the right hand. In both cases, left SM1 beta oscillations (contralateral to the activated right SM1), were monitored through a proxy signal - the Electromyography of the contracted right hand. Manual dexterity was assessed with the Purdue Pegboard Test. Results Volitional movement caused significant bilateral SM1 beta suppression in nearly all participants (85 %). ISPs were observed in every participant. In the proxy signal for the left SM1, the iSP coincides with TMS-induced high-amplitude beta bursts. These bursts showed significant phase alignment across participants 10-70 ms after the TMS pulse. There was no significant association between the left-/right-hemisphere beta suppression, iSP, and manual dexterity. Conclusion Our results highlight the distinct nature of beta oscillation changes during voluntary movement compared to TMS-iSP and show that TMS induces IHI via transcallosal induction of phase aligned beta bursts. Furthermore, our data suggests that only the initial phase of a beta burst carries an inhibitory effect. It also highlights the possibility of evoking a beta burst with the iSP protocol, opening perspectives for future modeling studies.

">Decoding Motivational States and Craving through Electrical Markers for Neural 'Mind Reading'</a></h4>

              
                The aim of this electroencephalogram (EEG) study was to identify electrical neuro-markers of 12 different motivational and physiological states such as visceral craves, affective and somatosensory states, and secondary needs. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 30 right-handed participants while recalling a specific state upon the presentation of an auditory verbal command incorporating an evocative sound background consistent with that state (e.g. the chirping of cicadas associated with the verbal complaint about feeling hot). ERP data showed larger amplitude N400 responses in the affective and somatosensory states, while the P400 component displayed greater amplitudes for the secondary and visceral states. Furthermore, the two components were also discernibly responsive to the 12 micro-categories (e.g., joy vs. pain or hunger), by providing a distinctive electric pattern for mostly all microstates. The reconstruction of the intracranial generators of surface signals revealed common imagery-related activations, including the middle and superior frontal gyri, the fusiform and lingual gyri, supramarginal, and middle occipital regions, as well as the middle temporal region. Additionally, specific regions were identified that were active for distinct mentally represented content, such as that visceral needs were associated with activations in the medial and inferior frontal gyri, uncus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus. Affective states were associated with activations in the medial frontal, superior temporal, and middle temporal gyri. Somatosensory states (e.g., pain or cold) activated regions in the parietal cortex and the crave for music was linked to activations in the auditory and motor regions. These findings support the use of ERP markers for BCI applications.

">Efficient pheromone navigation via antagonistic detectors</a></h4>

              
                Chemotaxis to a potential mate who is moving and emitting a volatile sex pheromone poses a navigation challenge that requires rapid, precise responses to maximize reproductive success. We demonstrate that Caenorhabditis elegans males address this challenge by utilizing two pheromone detectors located in head and tail sensory neurons. Despite sharing a receptor SRD-1, AWA head neurons promote forward movement and acceleration, while tail PHD neurons induce reversals and deceleration. In increasing pheromone gradients AWA dominates; whereas weakening gradients inactivate AWAs, allowing PHDs to fine-tune the response and correct the path. Head AWAs are essential for mate-searching, while tail PHDs are crucial for complex tasks. The navigation mode and velocity adapt as males climb a pheromone gradient. A minimal-parameter computational model recapitulates key findings and illuminates the interplay between head and tail signals in adaptive navigation.

">Higher-Order Interaction Analysis via Hypergraph Models for Studying Multidimensional Neuroscience Data.</a></h4>

              
                Higher-Order Interaction (HOI) theory offers a powerful framework for capturing complex, non-linear relationships within multidimensional systems, moving beyond traditional pairwise graph methods to encompass multi-way interactions. This study applies HOI analysis, specifically using hypergraph theory, to explore intricate connectivity patterns in electrophysiological signals from neuroscience. Hypergraphs were constructed from connectivity data across various frequency bands, characterized through metrics such as spectral entropy, hyperedge centrality, and vertex centrality, and compared using spectral and centrality distance measures. Three distinct neurophysiological datasets were analyzed: intracranial EEG signals from rats during different sleep stages, scalp EEG data to distinguish between epilepsy types, and MEG recordings of seizure dynamics. The findings highlight the effectiveness of hypergraph-based HOI analysis in mapping neural dynamics across normal and pathological brain states. In sleep studies, it reveals distinct connectivity patterns between REM and NREM stages, while in epilepsy, it differentiates seizure types and stages, identifying spectral entropy as a potential marker for seizure onset. Notably, HOI analysis captures differences between primary and secondary generalized epilepsy, suggesting enhanced diagnostic accuracy. This approach provides a powerful tool for understanding complex neural interactions in high-dimensional data.

">Effects of sex, mating status, and genetic background on circadian behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms play a crucial role in regulating behavior, physiology, and health. Sexual dimorphism, a widespread phenomenon across species, influences circadian behaviors. Additionally, post-mating physiological changes in females are known to modulate various behaviors, yet their effects on circadian rhythms remain underexplored. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful model for studying circadian mechanisms, we systematically assessed the impact of sex and mating status on circadian behavior. We measured circadian period length and rhythm strength in virgin and mated males and females, including females mated to males lacking Sex Peptide (SP), a key mediator of post-mating changes. Across four wild-type and control strains, we found that males consistently exhibited shorter circadian periods than females, regardless of mating status, suggesting that circadian period length is a robust sexually dimorphic trait. In contrast, rhythm strength was influenced by the interaction between sex and mating status, with female mating generally reducing rhythm strength in the presence of SP signaling. Notably, genetic background significantly modulated these effects on rhythm strength. Our findings demonstrate that while circadian period length is a stable sex-specific trait, rhythm strength is shaped by a complex interplay between sex, mating status, and genetic background. This study advances our understanding of how sex and mating influence circadian rhythms in Drosophila and provides a foundation for future research into sexually dimorphic mechanisms underlying human diseases associated with circadian disruptions.

">Brain-Cognitive Gaps in relation to Dopamine and Health-related Factors: Insights from AI-Driven Functional Connectome Predictions</a></h4>

              
                A key question in human neuroscience is to understand how individual differences in brain function are related to cognitive differences. However, the optimal condition of brain function to study between-person differences in cognition remains unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of objective biomarkers to accurately predict cognitive function, with brain age emerging as a potential candidate. Recent research suggests that brain age offers minimal additional information on cognitive decline beyond what chronological age provides, prompting a shift toward approaches focused directly on cognitive prediction. Using a novel deep learning approach, we evaluated the predictive power of the functional connectome during various states (resting state, movie-watching, and n-back) on episodic memory and working memory performance. Our findings show that while task-based connectomes, especially during movie watching, better predict working memory, resting state connectomes are equally effective in predicting episodic memory. Furthermore, individuals with a negative brain-cognition gap (where brain predictions underestimate actual performance) exhibited lower physical activity, lower education, and higher cardiovascular risk compared to those with a positive gap. This shows that knowledge of the brain-cognition gap provides insights into factors contributing to cognitive resilience. Further lower PET-derived measures of dopamine binding were linked to a greater brain-cognition gap, mediated by regional functional variability. Together, our study introduces the brain-cognitive gap, as a new marker, modulated by the dopamine system, to identify individuals at risk of compromised brain function.

">Stimulation of the Frontal Aslant Tract's origin in the caudal superior frontal gyrus alters ongoing spontaneous rhythmic activity independently from the effector. Evidence from tractography-guided Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.</a></h4>

              
                The crown of the human Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG-crown) is a functionally independent region, nestled between the dorsal premotor and supplementary motor cortices, that supports internally-timed action control. The unique SFG-crown's connectivity fingerprint by the Frontal Aslant Tract (FAT), suggests a caudal-rostral pattern of increasing abstractness of action representations. Coherently, since the mid-portion of the caudal SFG contains a representation of action strategies that involve internal timing, we hypothesized that the caudal portion of the SFG may be involved in action execution of internally-timed actions. To test this, we asked 21 healthy participants to perform a self-paced tapping movement with the right index finger or a self-paced articulation of the syllable /da/ while applying online single-pulse TMS to the posterior, middle and anterior origins of the FAT in the left SFG-crown. Results showed that effective TMS (compared to sham) impacted rhythm production in both tasks, only when applied to the posterior SFG region, by reducing the probability of motor events in the 200 ms following TMS. The present data support the hypothesis, that the posterior SFG-crown, associated with the most posterior origin of the FAT fibers, is involved in the production of internally-timed actions, in an effector-independent modality, suggesting a domain-general role in the execution of internally-timed movements.

">Speech motor cortex enables BCI cursor control and click</a></h4>

              
                Decoding neural activity from ventral (speech) motor cortex is known to enable high-performance speech brain-computer interface (BCI) control. It was previously unknown whether this brain area could also enable computer control via neural cursor and click, as is typically associated with dorsal (arm and hand) motor cortex. We recruited a clinical trial participant with ALS and implanted intracortical microelectrode arrays in ventral precentral gyrus (vPCG), which the participant used to operate a speech BCI in a prior study. We developed a cursor BCI driven by the participant's vPCG neural activity, and evaluated performance on a series of target selection tasks. The reported vPCG cursor BCI enabled rapidly-calibrating (40 seconds), accurate (2.90 bits per second) cursor control and click. The participant also used the BCI to control his own personal computer independently. These results suggest that placing electrodes in vPCG to optimize for speech decoding may also be a viable strategy for building a multi-modal BCI which enables both speech-based communication and computer control via cursor and click.

	<p>Background: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as an effective treatment for managing chronic pain that is unresponsive to traditional therapies. While SCS is well documented for conditions like failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), its effectiveness in managing pain related to spinal cord injuries (SCI) is less studied. This study aims to assess the efficacy of SCS in alleviating SCI-related pain and improving patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life, filling a gap in the existing literature. Methods: This cohort study included 15 adult patients with traumatic and non-traumatic SCIs, treated between 2016 and 2022. Patients received SCS implants after either a trial or direct implantation. Pain levels were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) scores, while quality of life was evaluated using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) scale. The SCS devices were implanted at different spinal levels, with various stimulation protocols applied, including high-frequency stimulation (10 kHz). Results: In patients with traumatic SCI, the mean VAS score decreased from 8.6 to 4.5, with 71% reporting more than 50% pain relief. Non-traumatic SCI patients experienced a reduction from 8.5 to 2.5, with all showing more than 50% pain relief. EQ-5D scores improved in both groups. A 49% reduction in pain medication usage was also observed, though one patient required revision surgery due to an adverse event. Conclusions: SCS significantly reduces pain and improves quality of life for SCI patients, particularly with high-frequency protocols.

	<p>Background/Objectives: As a form of visual input, bodily expressions can be maintained and manipulated in visual working memory (VWM) over a short period of time. While the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an indispensable role in top-down control, it remains largely unclear whether this region also modulates the VWM storage of bodily expressions during a delay period. Therefore, the two primary goals of this study were to examine whether the emotional bodies would elicit heightened brain activity among areas such as the PFC and extrastriate body area (EBA) and whether the emotional effects subsequently modulate the functional connectivity patterns for active maintenance during delay periods. Methods: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, participants performed a delayed-response task in which they were instructed to view and maintain a body stimulus in working memory before emotion categorization (happiness, anger, and neutral). If processing happy and angry bodies consume increased cognitive demands, stronger PFC activation and its functional connectivity with perceptual areas would be observed. Results: Results based on univariate and multivariate analyses conducted on the data collected during stimulus presentation revealed an enhanced processing of the left PFC and left EBA. Importantly, subsequent functional connectivity analyses performed on delayed-period data using a psychophysiological interaction model indicated that functional connectivity between the PFC and EBA increases for happy and angry bodies compared to neutral bodies. Conclusions: The emotion-modulated coupling between the PFC and EBA during maintenance deepens our understanding of the functional organization underlying the VWM processing of bodily information.</p>

	<p>Creativity and the production of artwork can have an impact on the course and treatment of comorbid severe mental illness and neurodegeneration. We report on a 70-year-old male patient with highly original artistic behavior, who suffered from lifelong recurrent major depression and subsequently developed symptoms of progressive bulbar palsy (PBP). In the context of a systematic literature review, we detail the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s personal and artistic biographies and portray artwork from his artistic portfolio together with his disease history, clinical examination, psychopathological and neuropsychological evaluations, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, neuroimaging, neurophysiological testing, and psychotherapeutic treatment. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s 1&amp;amp;ndash;2-year history of primarily bulbar motor symptoms and signs aligned with electromyography, showing widespread signs of continuing denervation/chronic neurogenic changes. Slight impairments in semantic fluency, executive control, and visuoconstructive abilities were observed in neuropsychological testing, in conjunction with right-sided medial temporal lobe atrophy in an MRI. He was prescribed medication, including extended-release venlafaxine, trazodone, pramipexole, and zolpidem, and took his medication regularly, usually at high doses. For most of his life, the patient had attributed professional &amp;amp;ldquo;success&amp;amp;rdquo; and artistic output to, at times, excessive alcohol consumption. Later, however, his interest in creative work continued despite alcohol reduction and cessation. Psychotherapy grounded him in reality via goal-centered behaviors, making him realize that his physical and mental ailments rather hindered his creative output. In summary, creative behavior can be utilized in the treatment of patients with psychiatric conditions (affective or addictive disorders) and/or neurodegenerative diseases. In the reported case, specific psychopharmacology and psychotherapy that address goal-directed self-efficacy experiences of reality were critical to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: The link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) and the complexity of their differential diagnosis has been vastly investigated. Growing attention has been paid to the presence of problematic Internet use (PIU) in autistic individuals. Studies assessing OCD traits in autistic individuals are scarce and even less take into account the role that this overlap may have on the development and maintenance of PIU. We aimed to investigate OCD features in ASD individuals and their association with autism severity and the prevalence of PIU, and the potential dimensions associated with a greater probability of PIU. Methods: a total of 46 participants with ASD and 53 controls were assessed with the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum questionnaire and the Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Spectrum&amp;amp;mdash;Short Version. Results: There were significantly higher OCD features in ASD participants along with important correlations between OCD and ASD dimensions and a higher prevalence of PIU in the ASD group. Participants with putative PIU reported greater scores on some ASD and OCD dimensions, the with Doubt and Non-verbal communication domains emerging as significant predictors of the presence of putative PIU. Conclusions: These results support the three-way link between ASD, OCD, and PIU, contributing to the hypothesis of a neurodevelopmental basis for those conditions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prematurely born individuals are at risk for developing socio-emotional difficulties and psychopathologies such as autism spectrum disorder. Particular difficulties processing social information conveyed by the face may underlie these vulnerabilities. Methods: This comprehensive review provides an overview of 27 studies published between 2000 and mid-2022 concerning face processing in individuals born preterm and/or born with low birth weight across different age ranges, paradigms, and outcome measures. The results were interpreted across different developmental stages. Results: Behavioural studies indicated that prematurity is associated with poorer facial identity and expression processing compared to term-born controls, especially for negative emotions. Structural alterations and delayed maturation in key neural face processing structures could explain these findings. Neuroimaging also revealed functional atypicalities, which may either be rooted in the structural alterations or may partly compensate for the delayed maturation. Conclusions: The results suggest that altered face processing may be associated with an increased risk of developing psychopathologies in individuals born prematurely. Future studies should investigate the preterm behavioural phenotype and the potential need for face processing rehabilitation programs.</p>

	<p>Objectives: The present open-label multicenter pilot study sought to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of rimegepant in treating migraine attacks. Methods: The primary endpoint was pain freedom at two hours post-dose, while the co-primary efficacy endpoints included a reduction in the headache intensity and freedom from the most bothersome symptoms (MBS) associated with migraine at the same time point. To test the potential efficacy of rimegepant, patients were asked to record in a questionnaire all the relevant changes with each migraine attack treated with rimegepant at two hours post-dose vs. two hours before. The attending neurologists provided information on the basic demographics, medical anamnesis, and migraine history as well as the triptan use history. Results: A total of 54 patients (32 with episodic and 22 with chronic migraine) received rimegepant 75 mg at least once during a single migraine attack (overall, 140 dosage intakes). Pain freedom at 2 h was achieved in 45/140 (32.1%) intakes. Regarding the efficacy of the first rimegepant dose (n = 54), significant reductions in the headache intensity were observed between the pre- and 2 h post-treatment average VAS scores (&amp;amp;minus;4.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8 mean; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Likewise, the same mean reductions in the average VAS scores occurred when the 2 h response to all 140 doses was analyzed (&amp;amp;minus;5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Freedom from MBS at 2 h post-dose was achieved for photophobia in 43%, for phonophobia in 53%, and for nausea in 57%. The ability to fully return to everyday activities at 2 h post-dose was achieved in 83/140 instances (59%). We only recorded mild adverse events in 24/140 dosages. Conclusions: Our preliminary results demonstrate that rimegepant is effective, safe, and well tolerated in treating acute migraine attacks.</p>

	<p>Background: Educational professionals face significant challenges in determining the most appropriate educational placement for each child with ASD, which is a major concern for their parents. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors in the development of students with ASD (language development, cognitive development, and socio-emotional development) that are most relevant in determining the modalities of schooling in early childhood education. Methods: A total of 381 Psychopedagogical Evaluation Reports from students with ASD aged 3 to 5 years were reviewed. The importance of each variable was identified using artificial neural network analysis. Classification trees were used to determine their distribution in the two schooling modalities. Results: A total of 42.9% of boys aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years with ASD and 54.12% of girls aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years with ASD were enrolled in specific modalities. Conclusions: Cognitive development and comprehensive language were the two variables that best explained whether children with ASD were educated in specific or ordinary modalities. The presence of a significantly impaired level of cognitive development was the best predictor of schooling in specific modalities, and for the rest of the cognitive levels, the greater the difficulties in comprehensive language, the greater the likelihood of schooling in specific modalities.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Studies have shown that emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) multimodal physiological signals exhibits superior performance compared to that of unimodal approaches. Nonetheless, there remains a paucity of in-depth investigations analyzing the inherent relationship between EEG and fNIRS and constructing brain networks to improve the performance of emotion recognition. Methods: In this study, we introduce an innovative method to construct hybrid brain networks in the source space based on simultaneous EEG-fNIRS signals for emotion recognition. Specifically, we perform source localization on EEG signals to derive the EEG source signals. Subsequently, causal brain networks are established in the source space by analyzing the Granger causality between the EEG source signals, while coupled brain networks in the source space are formed by assessing the coupling strength between the EEG source signals and the fNIRS signals. The resultant causal brain networks and coupled brain networks are integrated to create hybrid brain networks in the source space, which serve as features for emotion recognition. Results: The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated on multiple emotion datasets. The experimental results indicate that the recognition performance of our approach significantly surpasses that of the baseline method. Conclusions: This work offers a novel perspective on the fusion of EEG and fNIRS signals in an emotion-evoked experimental paradigm and provides a feasible solution for enhancing emotion recognition performance.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (NSCNP) exhibit sensorimotor disturbances, with proprioception impairment considered an important aspect. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a novel inertial sensor-based electrogoniometer (KFORCE Sens&amp;amp;reg;) for cervical spine (CS) proprioception measurement in patients with NSCNP. Methods: The within-day intra-rater reliability of CS proprioception and its association with patient demographics and clinical status were examined in fifty-nine patients with NSCNP, aged between 25&amp;amp;ndash;65 years, recruited from primary care. CS proprioception was examined via angle reproduction, in angles set mid-range in the available CS range of motion (ROM) in each motion direction. The clinical status evaluation comprised the maximum and average pain intensity in the last week, disability, fear of movement/re-injury, catastrophizing, neck awareness, and CS-ROM. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1), standard error of the measurement (SEM), and minimum detectable change (MDC95%). Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s R assessed between-measures associations. Results: CS proprioception reliability was good (ICC2,1 = 0.75&amp;amp;ndash;0.89), with low measurement error (SEM = 1.38&amp;amp;ndash;3.02&amp;amp;deg; and MDC95% = 3.83&amp;amp;ndash;8.38&amp;amp;deg;). Correlations between participants&amp;amp;rsquo; CS proprioception and their clinical status or demographics were not significant. Conclusions: The reliability of CS proprioception assessment with the KFORCE Sens&amp;amp;reg; was good in a sample of mildly to moderately disabled patients with CNP and thus deemed suitable for further research in this field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-265/v2?src=rss">Ambient Air Pollution and Chronic kidney disease risk in Deltan communities: A Policy Brief, 2023 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                Background The impact and changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis affect the patient’s fulfilment and quality of life. Objective This study aims to thoroughly investigate the experiences of end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This research uses a qualitative descriptive approach with in-depth interview methods. Participants numbered 15 people from Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital and Hasanuddin University Hospital, which were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Result There are three themes produced in this research: 1) various responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) various impacts, and 3) coping mechanisms developed. Conclusion These findings indicate that patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo hemodialysis have attempted to build adaptive coping strategies in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they still need support from healthcare providers in the hemodialysis unit to overcome various problems and impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Hemodialysis nurses are expected to be able to carry out holistic assessments and continuous evaluation in order to provide comprehensive nursing care to meet patient needs for hemodialysis in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1403/v1?src=rss">Mental health status of caregivers of cancer patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The global prevalence of cancer is rapidly increasing, and patients often require ancillary non-clinical care during treatment. Caregivers, in turn, experience several mental health challenges as they fulfil their responsibilities. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among caregivers of cancer patients at a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar; and explore the psychosocial factors contributing to their mental health. Methods For objective 1, a cross-sectional study design was employed to collect data from 230 caregivers accompanying cancer patients who attended a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha during February-April 2024. A licensed version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate the levels of anxiety and depression, while the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used to assess stress. For objective 2, ten in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers, then recorded, transcribed and translated for thematic analysis. Results The prevalence of anxiety, depression and perceived stress among caregivers was found to be 45.2%, 43.4% and 44.8%, respectively. ‘Being the sole caregiver’ was identified as a significant predictor of caregivers’ mental health, affecting levels of depression, stress, and anxiety. Further, qualitative analysis identified factors like social support, financial hardships, emotional toll, personal wellbeing, communication with healthcare provider and transportation as key contributors to caregivers’ mental health decline. Conclusion Caregivers of cancer patients face significant mental health challenges that need focused attention. Integrating informal social networks, counselling services, creating support groups and offering financial assistance into cancer care programs can help address their needs.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                <p>Neuroinflammation can lead to chronic maladaptive pain affecting millions of people worldwide. Neurotransmitters, cytokines, and ion channels are implicated in neuroimmune cell signaling, but their roles in specific behavioral responses are not fully elucidated. Voltage-gated Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity in skin controls rapid and transient heat hypersensitivity induced by intradermal (i.d.) capsaicin via IL-1a cytokine signaling. Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are not, however, involved in mechanical hypersensitivity that developed in the i.d. capsaicin animal model. Here, we show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are also critical for heat hypersensitivity induced by i.d. complete Freund adjuvant (CFA). i.d. CFA, a model of chronic neuroinflammation, involves ongoing cytokine signaling for days leading to pronounced edema and hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli. Peripheral Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity in the skin was required for the full development and week-long time course of heat hypersensitivity induced by i.d. CFA, but paw edema and mechanical hypersensitivity were independent of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity. CFA induced increases in several cytokines in hindpaw fluid including IL-6 which was also dependent on Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity. Using IL-6&ndash;specific neutralizing antibodies in vivo, we show that IL-6 contributes to heat hypersensitivity and that neutralizing both IL-1a and IL-6 was even more effective at reducing the magnitude and duration of CFA-induced heat hypersensitivity. Our findings demonstrate a functional link between Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity and the release of IL-6 in the skin and show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels have a privileged role in the induction and maintenance of heat hypersensitivity during chronic forms of neuroinflammation in the skin.</p>

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) approach is considered as one of the minimally invasive interventions. The success of restoration depends on various clinical factors like material, patient and operator factor. Conjoint analysis is a technique for measuring individual’s preference structures via systematical variations of products attributes in an experimental design. Aim Assess Pedodontists’ perception of non-clinical factors and investigate influence of child’s age, level of cooperation and vulnerability status on their decisions to perform Atraumatic Restorative Approach (ART) approach using hypothetical patient scenario’s and conjoint design. Materials and methods A cross-sectional exploratory survey using a web-based questionnaire was performed among Pedodontists registered as life members under Indian Association of Pedodontic and Preventive Dentistry. Self-designed structured scenario-based questionnaire was prepared and validated. Three non-clinical factors Age of child, Cooperation level and Vulnerability status were considered. Using orthogonal design, SPSS software nine profiles were created randomly along with two holdouts. Final study proforma consisted of three sections with description of eleven clinical scenarios. It was administered to participants using Google forms. Using SPSS conjoint software relative utilities for each factor on decision for using ART was estimated. Results Four hundred and thirty-two pedodontists had completed the survey (35.9%). Pedodontists considered vulnerability status of the child as the most important factor for their decision to use ART treatment. For the vulnerability status, the factor vulnerable had the greatest utility (-0.364) compared to non-vulnerable factor (0.364). For cooperation level, factor uncooperative had greater utility (-0.343), as compared to moderately cooperative (0.066) and uncooperative (0.277). For the age factor, the age of 4 years had the greatest utility (-0.175) compared with age 6 (-0.013) and age 12 (0.19). Conclusion The most preferred scenario by pedodontists to consider ART as treatment of choice was child belonging to vulnerable section, being very young and uncooperative.

                Consumer satisfaction is an outcome of business marketing activities, bridging the buying and usage phases with subsequent consequences such as attitude changes, recurring purchases, and brand loyalty. Most studies have utilized variations of the disconfirmation paradigm, which posits that satisfaction is influenced by the degree and type of disconfirmation experienced and initial expectations. Despite the importance of satisfaction, there remains a paucity of evidence on the cause and effect leading to expectation-confirmation and disconfirmation paradigm. This paper explores the reasons and the key factors in the perspectives of the relevant literature and aims to identify the intention of confirmation and disconfirmation in satisfaction theories. This conceptual paper also suggests various critical analyses based on the arguments for and against the paradigm in customer satisfaction. Consequently, the paper seeks to examine existing gaps in the literature regarding customer satisfaction theories for business sustainability and decision making, which may need to be more concise in the satisfaction generation process.

                Background Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly morbid disease. Chemotherapy for NSCLC lacks specificity and efficacy mainly because of drug resistance. The current study aimed to explore computational tools to target allosteric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sites and screen for the top molecules in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. Methods Molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamic studies revealed that acenocoumarol and silodosin are the top two allosteric EGFR inhibitors. They were further tested for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle, and gene expression by qPCR, western blotting, A549 cell xenograft anti-proliferative activity, and tumor regression efficacy analysis. Results Acenocoumarol and silodosin exhibited cytotoxicity in A549 and IMR-90 cells at concentrations below 50 and 80 μM, respectively. Acenocoumarol and silodosin induced S-phase and G2/M-phase arrest in A549 cells in the cell cycle analysis. Both drugs showed early apoptosis at their IC50 doses (acenocoumarol 50 μM and silodosin 25 μM). KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) gene regulation in A549 cells was confirmed using qPCR. KRAS and ERK2 activities were quantified by western blot analysis. In the xenograft study, tumor size, body weight, and organ weight were significantly attenuated by the test drugs compared with the standard cisplatin. Immunoblotting and western blot results of the A549-xenograft tissue indicated downregulation of KRAS and ERK2. Furthermore, the test drugs have upregulated caspase-3 gene expression. Conclusion The drugs acenocoumarol and silodosin downregulate KRAS and ERK2 both in cell line and in Xenograft model. KRAS and ERK2 are associated with EGFR inhibition. Hence, acenocoumarol and silodosin can be further explored for repurposing studies in human trials.

                <p>by Wyatt G. Madden, Wei Jin, Benjamin Lopman, Andreas Zufle, Benjamin Dalziel, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Bryan T. Grenfell, Max S. Y. Lau</p>

Measles is an important infectious disease system both for its burden on public health and as an opportunity for studying nonlinear spatio-temporal disease dynamics. Traditional mechanistic models often struggle to fully capture the complex nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in measles outbreaks. In this paper, we first develop a high-dimensional feed-forward neural network model with spatial features (SFNN) to forecast endemic measles outbreaks and systematically compare its predictive power with that of a classical mechanistic model (TSIR). We illustrate the utility of our model using England and Wales measles data from 1944-1965. These data present multiple modeling challenges due to the interplay between metapopulations, seasonal trends, and nonlinear dynamics related to demographic changes. Our results show that while the TSIR model yields similarly performant short-term (1 to 2 biweeks ahead) forecasts for highly populous cities, our neural network model (SFNN) consistently achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) across other forecasting windows. Furthermore, we show that our spatial-feature neural network model, without imposing mechanistic assumptions <i>a priori</i>, can uncover gravity-model-like spatial hierarchy of measles spread in which major cities play an important role in driving regional outbreaks. We then turn our attention to integrative approaches that combine mechanistic and machine learning models. Specifically, we investigate how the TSIR can be utilized to improve a state-of-the-art approach known as Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks (PINN) which explicitly combines compartmental models and neural networks. Our results show that the TSIR can facilitate the reconstruction of latent susceptible dynamics, thereby enhancing both forecasts in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and parameter inference of measles dynamics within the PINN. In summary, our results show that appropriately designed neural network-based models can outperform traditional mechanistic models for short to long-term forecasts, while simultaneously providing mechanistic interpretability. Our work also provides valuable insights into more effectively integrating machine learning models with mechanistic models to enhance public health responses to measles and similar infectious disease systems.

We combine an off-lattice agent-based mathematical model and experimentation to explore filamentous growth of a yeast colony. Under environmental stress, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> yeast cells can transition from a bipolar (sated) to unipolar (pseudohyphal) budding mechanism, where cells elongate and bud end-to-end. This budding asymmetry yields spatially non-uniform growth, where filaments extend away from the colony centre, foraging for food. We use approximate Bayesian computation to quantify how individual cell budding mechanisms give rise to spatial patterns observed in experiments. We apply this method of parameter inference to experimental images of colonies of two strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, in low and high nutrient environments. The colony size at the transition from sated to pseudohyphal growth, and a forking mechanism for pseudohyphal cell proliferation are the key features driving colony morphology. Simulations run with the most likely inferred parameters produce colony morphologies that closely resemble experimental results.

                <p>by Yaoda Xu</p>

The key to adaptive visual processing lies in the ability to maintain goal-directed visual representation in the face of distraction. In visual working memory (VWM), distraction may come from the coding of distractors or other concurrently retained targets. This fMRI study reveals a common representational geometry that our brain uses to combat both types of distractions in VWM. Specifically, using fMRI pattern decoding, the human posterior parietal cortex is shown to orthogonalize the representations of different streams of information concurrently coded in VWM, whether they are targets and distractors, or different targets concurrently held in VWM. The latter is also seen in the human occipitotemporal cortex. Such a representational geometry provides an elegant and simple solution to enable independent information readout, effectively combating distraction from the different streams of information, while accommodating their concurrent representations. This representational scheme differs from mechanisms that actively suppress or block the encoding of distractors to reduce interference. It is likely a general neural representational principle that supports our ability to represent information beyond VWM in other situations where multiple streams of visual information are tracked and processed simultaneously.

                <p>by Román Zapién-Campos, Florence Bansept, Arne Traulsen</p>

How can we figure out how the different microbes interact within microbiomes? To combine theoretical models and experimental data, we often fit a deterministic model for the mean dynamics of a system to averaged data. However, in the averaging procedure a lot of information from the data is lost—and a deterministic model may be a poor representation of a stochastic reality. Here, we develop an inference method for microbiomes based on the idea that both the experiment and the model are stochastic. Starting from a stochastic model, we derive dynamical equations not only for the average, but also for higher statistical moments of the microbial abundances. We use these equations to infer distributions of the interaction parameters that best describe the biological experimental data—improving identifiability and precision. The inferred distributions allow us to make predictions but also to distinguish between fairly certain parameters and those for which the available experimental data does not give sufficient information. Compared to related approaches, we derive expressions that also work for the relative abundance of microbes, enabling us to use conventional metagenome data, and account for cases where not a single host, but only replicate hosts, can be tracked over time.

                <p>by Cécile Courret, Lucas W. Hemmer, Xiaolu Wei, Prachi D. Patel, Bryce J. Chabot, Nicholas J. Fuda, Xuewen Geng, Ching-Ho Chang, Barbara G. Mellone, Amanda M. Larracuente</p>

Centromeres reside in rapidly evolving, repeat-rich genomic regions, despite their essential function in chromosome segregation. Across organisms, centromeres are rich in selfish genetic elements such as transposable elements and satellite DNAs that can bias their transmission through meiosis. However, these elements still need to cooperate at some level and contribute to, or avoid interfering with, centromere function. To gain insight into the balance between conflict and cooperation at centromeric DNA, we take advantage of the close evolutionary relationships within the <i>Drosophila simulans</i> clade—<i>D</i>. <i>simulans</i>, <i>D</i>. <i>sechellia</i>, and <i>D</i>. <i>mauritiana—</i>and their relative, <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i>. Using chromatin profiling combined with high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization on stretched chromatin fibers, we characterize all centromeres across these species. We discovered dramatic centromere reorganization involving recurrent shifts between retroelements and satellite DNAs over short evolutionary timescales. We also reveal the recent origin (<240 Kya) of telocentric chromosomes in <i>D</i>. <i>sechellia</i>, where the X and fourth centromeres now sit on telomere-specific retroelements. Finally, the Y chromosome centromeres, which are the only chromosomes that do not experience female meiosis, do not show dynamic cycling between satDNA and TEs. The patterns of rapid centromere turnover in these species are consistent with genetic conflicts in the female germline and have implications for centromeric DNA function and karyotype evolution. Regardless of the evolutionary forces driving this turnover, the rapid reorganization of centromeric sequences over short evolutionary timescales highlights their potential as hotspots for evolutionary innovation.

                <p>by Anantu Sunil, Olivia Pedroncini, Andreas T. Schaefer, Tobias Ackels</p>

Odors are transported by seemingly chaotic plumes, whose spatiotemporal structure contains rich information about space, with olfaction serving as a gateway for obtaining and processing this spatial information. Beyond tracking odors, olfaction provides localization and chemical communication cues for detecting conspecifics and predators, and linking external environments to internal cognitive maps. In this Essay, we discuss recent physiological, behavioral, and methodological advancements in mammalian olfactory research to present our current understanding of how olfaction can be used to navigate the environment. We also examine potential neural mechanisms that might convert dynamic olfactory inputs into environmental maps along this axis. Finally, we consider technological applications of odor dynamics for developing bio-inspired sensor technologies, robotics, and computational models. By shedding light on the principles underlying the processing of odor dynamics, olfactory research will pave the way for innovative solutions that bridge the gap between biology and technology, enriching our understanding of the natural world.

                <p>Mutations in colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) result in CSF1R-related disorder (CSF1R-RD). Our previous study demonstrated a proteolytic generation of a soluble CSF1R (sCSF1R) that could potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker of CSF1R-RD. Herein, we observed that sCSF1R is released into peripheral serum as a highly glycosylated monomer in <i>Csf1r</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice that mimic the clinical symptoms of CSF1R-RD patients. Notably, we found that serum sCSF1R could distinguish CSF1R-RD cohorts from controls with high accuracy as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. This study demonstrates that reduced sCSF1R in serum may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for CSF1R-RD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Many antidiabetic medications with distinct modes of action are available, The sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are among the most recent oral antihyperglycemic medications. The American Diabetes Association recommends metformin, a biguanide medication, as the first option for oral control of type 2 diabetes because it has demonstrated promise in this regard. Aim of the study To evaluate and compare the effects of metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors on general urine parameters in T2DM patients from Iraq. Method a prospective cohort study where 101 adult patients of both sexes aged under 70 years and newly diagnosed with T2DM, patients were divided into two groups, Metformin group (n=52), where metformin was prescribed as monotherapy by the clinician and SGLT-2 inhibitors group (n=49) where either dapagliflozin or empagliflozin were prescribed by the clinician, general urine examination was done for each patient in the first contact and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results The mean age was 57±9 years for the metformin group and 54±9 years for the SGLT-2 inhibitors group. There was no significant difference in leukocytes, erythrocytes, or epithelial cell counts between the metformin group and the SGLT2 inhibitor group before and after 12 weeks of treatment. There was a significant difference (p-value =0.043) in leukocytes and a non-significant difference in erythrocytes and epithelial cell counts before and after treatment in the SGLT-2 inhibitors group. Conclusions Diabetic patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors treatment demonstrated higher leukocyte count than metformin group patients, an indicator and predictor for higher susceptibility to urinary tract infections.

                Background The zoonotic infection caused by tapeworms Echinococcus is a neglected tropical disease in poor regions with limited access to suitable sanitary conditions. Hydatid cysts produced by Echinococcus granulosus use fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABP) to obtain the fatty acids and cholesterol necessary for their survival from the host. In this work, we analyzed the behaviour of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids against EgFABP1. Methods We used computational biology and chemistry techniques and binding free energy estimations by molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA). Results This research has enabled us to clarify the EgFABP1 isoforms identified in the database, suggesting their potential involvement in diverse cellular activities of Echinococcus granulosus. Conversely, examining the global and local chemical reactivity of 14 fatty acids revealed that liposolubility is contingent upon the degree of unsaturation in the FAs. Additionally, FAs exhibited acceptable levels of oral absorption and bioavailability. The binding of EgFABP1 with FAs analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation showed us that these are highly stable, where the best affinity was with docosahexaenoic acid. Conclusions Our results suggest that the action of fatty acids could play an interesting role in detecting early Echinococcus granulosus.

                Neurodegenerative disorders represent a leading cause of disability among the elderly population, and Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent. Emerging evidence suggests a frequent co-occurrence of circadian disruption and PD. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear: is circadian disruption a cause, consequence, or a parallel feature of the disease that shares the same root cause? This review seeks to address this question by highlighting and discussing clinical evidence and findings from experiments using vertebrate and invertebrate animal models. While research on causality is still in its early stages, the available data suggest reciprocal interactions between PD progression and circadian disruption.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96953">The actomyosin system is essential for the integrity of the endosomal system in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei</a></h4>

              
                The actin cytoskeleton is a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic cells, yet its complexity varies across different taxa. In the parasitic protist <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, a rudimentary actomyosin system consisting of one actin gene and two myosin genes has been retained despite significant investment in the microtubule cytoskeleton. The functions of this highly simplified actomyosin system remain unclear, but appear to centre on the endomembrane system. Here, advanced light and electron microscopy imaging techniques, together with biochemical and biophysical assays, were used to explore the relationship between the actomyosin and endomembrane systems. The class I myosin (TbMyo1) had a large cytosolic pool and its ability to translocate actin filaments in vitro was shown here for the first time. TbMyo1 exhibited strong association with the endosomal system and was additionally found on glycosomes. At the endosomal membranes, TbMyo1 colocalised with markers for early and late endosomes (TbRab5A and TbRab7, respectively), but not with the marker associated with recycling endosomes (TbRab11). Actin and myosin were simultaneously visualised for the first time in trypanosomes using an anti-actin chromobody. Disruption of the actomyosin system using the actin-depolymerising drug latrunculin A resulted in a delocalisation of both the actin chromobody signal and an endosomal marker, and was accompanied by a specific loss of endosomal structure. This suggests that the actomyosin system is required for maintaining endosomal integrity in <i>T. brucei</i>.

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, the pathophysiology and genetic basis of which are incompletely understood. Using a forward genetic screen in multiplex families with SLE, we identified an association between SLE and compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) <i>ACK1</i> and <i>BRK</i>. Experimental blockade of ACK1 or BRK increased circulating autoantibodies in vivo in mice and exacerbated glomerular IgG deposits in an SLE mouse model. Mechanistically, NRTKs regulate activation, migration, and proliferation of immune cells. We found that the patients’ <i>ACK1</i> and <i>BRK</i> variants impair efferocytosis, the MERTK-mediated anti-inflammatory response to apoptotic cells, in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived macrophages, which may contribute to SLE pathogenesis. Overall, our data suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies are associated with human SLE and impair efferocytosis in macrophages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99303">Sequential replacement of PSD95 subunits in postsynaptic supercomplexes is slowest in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                The concept that dimeric protein complexes in synapses can sequentially replace their subunits has been a cornerstone of Francis Crick’s 1984 hypothesis, explaining how long-term memories could be maintained in the face of short protein lifetimes. However, it is unknown whether the subunits of protein complexes that mediate memory are sequentially replaced in the brain and if this process is linked to protein lifetime. We address these issues by focusing on supercomplexes assembled by the abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95, which plays a crucial role in memory. We used single-molecule detection, super-resolution microscopy and MINFLUX to probe the molecular composition of PSD95 supercomplexes in mice carrying genetically encoded HaloTags, eGFP, and mEoS2. We found a population of PSD95-containing supercomplexes comprised of two copies of PSD95, with a dominant 12.7 nm separation. Time-stamping of PSD95 subunits in vivo revealed that each PSD95 subunit was sequentially replaced over days and weeks. Comparison of brain regions showed subunit replacement was slowest in the cortex, where PSD95 protein lifetime is longest. Our findings reveal that protein supercomplexes within the postsynaptic density can be maintained by gradual replacement of individual subunits providing a mechanism for stable maintenance of their organization. Moreover, we extend Crick’s model by suggesting that synapses with slow subunit replacement of protein supercomplexes and long-protein lifetimes are specialized for long-term memory storage and that these synapses are highly enriched in superficial layers of the cortex where long-term memories are stored.

                Wnt signaling plays crucial roles in embryonic patterning including the regulation of convergent extension (CE) during gastrulation, the establishment of the dorsal axis, and later, craniofacial morphogenesis. Further, Wnt signaling is a crucial regulator of craniofacial morphogenesis. The adapter proteins Dact1 and Dact2 modulate the Wnt signaling pathway through binding to Disheveled. However, the distinct relative functions of Dact1 and Dact2 during embryogenesis remain unclear. We found that <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> genes have dynamic spatiotemporal expression domains that are reciprocal to one another suggesting distinct functions during zebrafish embryogenesis. Both <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> contribute to axis extension, with compound mutants exhibiting a similar CE defect and craniofacial phenotype to the <i>wnt11f2</i> mutant. Utilizing single-cell RNAseq and an established noncanonical Wnt pathway mutant with a shortened axis (<i>gpc4</i>), we identified <i>dact1/2</i>-specific roles during early development. Comparative whole transcriptome analysis between wildtype and <i>gpc4</i> and wildtype and <i>dact1/2</i> compound mutants revealed a novel role for <i>dact1/2</i> in regulating the mRNA expression of the classical calpain <i>capn8</i>. Overexpression of <i>capn8</i> phenocopies <i>dact1/2</i> craniofacial dysmorphology. These results identify a previously unappreciated role of <i>capn8</i> and calcium-dependent proteolysis during embryogenesis. Taken together, our findings highlight the distinct and overlapping roles of <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> in embryonic craniofacial development, providing new insights into the multifaceted regulation of Wnt signaling.

">Machine Learning Identifies Genes Linked to Neurological Disorders Induced by Equine Encephalitis viruses (EEV), Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI), and Organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA)</a></h4>

              
                Venezuelan, eastern, and western equine encephalitis viruses (collectively referred to as equine encephalitis viruses---EEV) cause serious neurological diseases and are a significant threat to the civilian population and the warfighter. Likewise, organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA) are highly toxic chemicals that pose serious health threats of neurological deficits to both military and civilian personnel around the world. Consequently, only a select few approved research groups are permitted to study these dangerous chemical and biological warfare agents. This has created a significant gap in our scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurological diseases. Valuable insights may be gleaned by drawing parallels to other extensively researched neuropathologies, such as traumatic brain injuries (TBI). By examining combined gene expression profiles, common and unique molecular characteristics may be discovered, providing new insights into medical countermeasures (MCMs) for TBI, EEV infection and OPNA neuropathologies and sequelae. In this study, we collected transcriptomic datasets for neurological disorders caused by TBI, EEV, and OPNA injury, and implemented a framework to normalize and integrate gene expression datasets derived from various platforms. Effective machine learning approaches were developed to identify critical genes that are associated, either shared among the three neuropathologies or to either TBI, EEV, and OPNA. With the aid of deep neural networks, we were able to extract important association signals for accurate prediction of different neurological disorders by using integrated gene expression datasets of VEEV, OPNA, and TBI samples. Gene ontology and pathway analyses further identified neuropathologic features with specific gene product attributes and functions, shedding light on the fundamental biology of these neurological disorders. Collectively, we highlight a workflow to analyze published transcriptomic data using machine learning, which can be used for both identification of gene biomarkers that are unique to specific neurological conditions, as well as genes shared across multiple neuropathologies. These shared genes could serve as potential neuroprotective drug targets for conditions like EEV, TBI, and OPNA.

">Regional heterogeneities of oligodendrocytes determine biased distribution pattern of Ranvier nodes along single axons in sound localization circuit</a></h4>

              
                Distribution of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, significantly influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. The patterns of nodal distribution are not necessarily uniform but vary across brain regions and even along individual axons. Although various factors could contribute to these patterns, the complexity arising from multicellular interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons has left the underlying regulatory mechanisms unclear. In this study, we identified the factors contributing to the emergence of a biased nodal distribution pattern along single axons using the chick brainstem auditory circuit as a model, in which the distance between adjacent nodes (internodal length) varies along the axons of avian cochlear nucleus neurons in a region-dependent manner, thereby enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length and oligodendrocyte morphology, either, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes determines the biased nodal distribution pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.

">Global and local nature of cortical slow waves</a></h4>

              
                Explaining the macroscopic activity of a recorded neuronal population from its known microscopic properties still poses a great challenge, not just because of the many local agents that shape the output of a circuit, but due to the impact of long-range connections from other brain regions. Here we use a computational model to explore how local and global components of a network shape the Slow Wave Activity (SWA). We performed a sensitivity analysis of multiple cellular and synaptic features in models of isolated and connected networks. This allowed us to explore how the interaction of local properties and long-range connections shape the SWA of a population and its neighbors, as well as how the sequential propagation of active Up states lead to the emergence of preferred modes of propagation. We described relevant features of cortical Up states that are modulated by stiff combinations of parameters of the local circuit as opposed to other that are sensitive to the level of excitability of the whole network and the input coming from neighbor populations. We found that while manipulations in the synaptic excitatory/inhibitory balance can create local changes, cellular components that modulate the excitability or adaptation of a population have a long-range effect that leads to changes in neighbor populations too. Additionally, our simulations guided in vivo experiments that showed how heterogeneities in excitability between cortical areas can determine the directionality of travelling waves during SWA. We expect these results to motivate future research exploring and comparing cortical circuits through the analysis of their Up states.

">Oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei bidirectionally modulate food intake</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide produced in the paraventricular (PVH) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus. Either peripheral or central administration of OT suppresses food intake through reductions in meal size. However, pharmacological approaches do not differentiate whether observed effects are mediated by OT neurons located in the PVH or in the SON. To address this, we targeted OT neuron-specific designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in either the PVH or SON in rats, thus allowing for evaluation of food intake following selective activation of OT neurons separately in each nucleus. Results revealed that DREADDs-mediated excitation of PVH OT neurons reduced consumption of both standard chow and a high fat high sugar diet (HFHS) via reductions in meal size. On the contrary, SON OT neuron activation had the opposite effect by increasing both standard chow and liquid sucrose consumption, with the former effect mediated by an increase in meal size. To further examine the physiological role of OT neurons in eating behavior, a viral-mediated approach was used to silence synaptic transmission of OT neurons separately in either the PVH or SON. Results from these studies revealed that PVH OT neuron silencing significantly increased consumption of HFHS by increasing meal size whereas SON OT neuron silencing reduced chow consumption by decreasing meal size. Collectively these data reveal that PVH and SON OT neurons differentially modulate food intake by either increasing or decreasing satiation signaling, respectively.

">Soma-centered control of synaptic autophagy by Rab39-regulated anterograde trafficking of Atg9</a></h4>

              
                Presynaptic terminals can be located far from the neuronal cell body and are thought to independently regulate protein and organelle turnover. In this work, we report a soma-centered mechanism that regulates autophagy-driven protein turnover at distant presynaptic terminals in Drosophila. We show that this system is regulated by Rab39, whose human homolog is mutated in Parkinson's disease. Although Rab39 is localized in the soma, its loss of function causes increased autophagy at presynaptic terminals, resulting in faster synaptic protein turnover and neurodegeneration. Using a large-scale unbiased genetic modifier screen, we identified genes encoding cytoskeletal and axonal organizing proteins, including Shortstop (Shot), as suppressors of synaptic autophagy. We demonstrate that Rab39 controls Shot- and Unc104/KIF1a-mediated transport of autophagy-related Atg9 vesicles to synapses. Under starvation conditions, Rab39 in the soma shifts its localization from endosomes to lysosomes, thereby controlling the availability of Atg9 vesicles for trafficking to synapses. Our findings indicate that Rab39-mediated trafficking in the soma orchestrates a cross-compartmental mechanism that regulates the abundance of autophagy at synapses.

">Beta burst characteristics and coupling within the sensorimotor cortical-subthalamic nucleus circuit in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bursts of exaggerated subthalamic nucleus (STN) beta activity contribute to clinical impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD). Few studies have explored the characteristics and coupling of bursts across the sensorimotor cortical-STN circuit. Objective: We sought to (1) establish the characteristics of sensorimotor cortical and STN bursts during naturalistic behaviours, and (2) determine the predictability of STN bursts from motor cortical recordings. Methods: We analysed 1,478 hours of wirelessly streamed bilateral sensorimotor cortical and STN recordings from 5 PD patients. Results: STN bursts were longer than cortical bursts and had shorter inter-burst intervals. Long bursts (>200ms) in both structures displayed temporal overlap (>30%), with an estimated cortico-STN conduction delay of 8ms. Furthermore, approximately 27% of all STN bursts were preceded by a cortical burst. Conclusion: Cortical beta bursts tend to precede STN beta bursts, with short delays. However, subcortical mechanisms are also likely to contribute to STN burst initiation and propagation.

">Nanoparticles loaded with a CSF1R antagonist selectively depletes microglial cells and modulates inflammation in spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is a principal event occurring after spinal cord injury (SCI). M1-like microglia are key players in the inflammatory response after injury. We hypothesize that the depletion of this microglia subtype would result in a more pro-resolutive environment, favorable to SCI repair. The colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) antagonist PLX5622 has been used to deplete microglia in the central nervous system. Although PLX5622 can freely cross the blood-brain barrier after systemic administration, the low drug concentration within the SCI site hampers its effectiveness. Additionally, systemic administration of PLX5622 in the scope of SCI treatment can induce side effects due to off-target accumulation. In this study, we specifically depleted M1-like microglia by designing polymeric nanoparticles loaded with PLX5622 (PLX NPs) to locally treat spinal cord contusion. PLX NP was prepared using a microfluidic-assisted approach showing high encapsulation efficiency (approx. 84%), nanosized dimensions (100 nm), and batch-to-batch reproducibility. PLX NP displayed selective activity in depleting M1-like microglial cells in both resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mixed microglial cell models compared with the free drug counterparts while preserving non-targeted glial cells. Furthermore, locally administered PLX NP downregulated proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}), increasing the M2/M1-like microglia ratio, thus reducing inflammation in a SCI contusion model. Our data support the hypothesis that local treatment with PLX NPs, a formulation with a high translational value, reduces neuroinflammation, with potential applications in SCI and central nervous system inflammatory diseases.

">Semantic integration demands modulate large-scale network interactions in the brain</a></h4>

              
                The ability to integrate semantic information into the context of a sentence is essential for human communication. Several studies have shown that the predictability of a final keyword based on the sentence context influences semantic integration on the behavioral, neurophysiological, and neural level. However, the architecture of the underlying network interactions for semantic integration across the lifespan remains unclear. In this study, 32 healthy participants (30-75 years) performed an auditory cloze probability task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), requiring lexical decisions on the sentence's final words. Semantic integration demands were implicitly modulated by presenting sentences with expected, unexpected, anomalous, or pseudoword endings. To elucidate network interactions supporting semantic integration, we combined univariate task-based fMRI analyses with seed-based connectivity and between-network connectivity analyses. Behavioral data revealed typical semantic integration effects, with increased integration demands being associated with longer response latencies and reduced accuracy. Univariate results demonstrated increased left frontal and temporal brain activity for sentences with higher integration demands. Between-network interactions highlighted the role of task-positive and default mode networks for sentence processing with increased semantic integration demands. Furthermore, increasing integration demands led to a higher number of behaviorally relevant network interactions, suggesting that the increased between-network coupling becomes more relevant for successful task performance as integration demands increase. Our findings elucidate the complex network interactions underlying semantic integration across the aging continuum. Stronger interactions between various task-positive and default mode networks correlated with more efficient processing of sentences with increased semantic integration demands. These results may inform future studies with healthy old and clinical populations.

">The human claustrum activates across multiple cognitive tasks</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control, the ability to manage information during purposeful actions, is crucial for everyday functioning and can become impaired in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. The claustrum, a subcortical brain structure, has recently been implicated in functional mechanisms underlying cognitive control. A current theory on the claustrum's function, the Network Instantiation in Cognitive Control (NICC) model, proposes that the claustrum acts as a cortical network hub synchronizing distant parts of the brain to optimize task performance across cognitive domains. Testing this in this study, we examined the claustrum signal within a dataset (n = 55) that includes functional MRI (fMRI) of healthy participants engaged in four well-established cognitive tasks: the Stroop task, AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT), cued task-switching, and Sternberg working memory task. Bilateral claustrum activation was observed during certain conditions and trial phases of all four tasks, particularly during active use of cognitive control, and coinciding with task-positive cortical network activations. These findings provide further support for the NICC model of claustrum function, demonstrating claustrum activation across multiple cognitive tasks, and potentially paving the way for new insights into how cognitive processes can become compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Elevated EGR1 Binding at Enhancers in Excitatory Neurons Correlates with Neuronal Subtype-Specific Epigenetic Regulation</a></h4>

              
                Brain development and neuronal cell specification are accompanied with epigenetic changes to achieve diverse gene expression regulation. Interacting with cell-type specific epigenetic marks, transcription factors bind to different sets of cis-regulatory elements in different types of cells. Currently, it remains largely unclear how cell-type specific gene regulation is achieved for neurons. In this study, we generated epigenetic maps to perform comparative histone modification analysis between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We found that neuronal cell-type specific histone modifications are enriched in super enhancer regions containing abundant EGR1 motifs. Further CUT&RUN data validated that more EGR1 binding sites can be detected in excitatory neurons and primarily located in enhancers. Integrative analysis revealed that EGR1 binding is strongly correlated with various epigenetic markers for open chromatin regions and associated with distinct gene pathways with neuronal subtype-specific functions. In inhibitory neurons, the majority of genomic regions hosting EGR1 binding sites become accessible at early embryonic stages. In contrast, the super enhancers in excitatory neurons hosting EGR1 binding sites gained their accessibility during postnatal stages. This study highlights the significance of transcription factor binding to enhancer regions, which may play a crucial role in establishing cell-type specific gene regulation in neurons.

                Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is a crucial process in which blood flow is dynamically adjusted to meet the metabolic demands of active neurons. In this study, we introduce an innovative method for in-vivo imaging of retinal blood vessel dilation in response to visible light stimulation, offering insights into the functional regulation of retinal blood flow. Using high-resolution, high-speed phase contrast imaging, we continuously monitored retinal vessel dynamics in eight healthy subjects, capturing precise temporal and spatial changes in vessel size under both stimulated and baseline conditions. We have measured a significant vessel dilation of 5.2% +/- 1.6% (4.4 um +/- 1.3 um) during flicker-stimulation compared to a dilation of 2.5% +/- 1% (2.1 um +/- 0.9 um) without stimulation. The flexibility of our method also allowed for the exploration of various acquisition and stimulation settings, broadening possibilities for investigating neurovascular coupling in the retina. This work not only enhances our understanding of neurovascular coupling but also has the potential to identify new biomarkers for vision-impairing conditions and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Neural signatures of temporal anticipation in human cortex represent event probability density</a></h4>

              
                Temporal prediction is a fundamental function of neural systems. Recent advances suggest that humans anticipate future events by calculating probability density functions, rather than hazard rates. However, direct neural evidence for this mechanism is lacking. We recorded neural activity using magnetoencephalography as participants anticipated auditory and visual events distributed in time. We show that temporal anticipation, measured as reaction times, approximates the event probability density function, but not hazard rate. Temporal anticipation manifests as spatiotemporally patterned activity in three anatomically and functionally distinct parieto-temporal and sensorimotor cortical areas. In both audition and vision, each of these areas revealed a marked neural signature of anticipation: Prior to sensory cues, activity in a specific frequency band of neural oscillations, spanning alpha and beta ranges, encodes the event probability density function. Strikingly, these neural signals predicted reaction times to imminent sensory cues. These results show that supra-modal representations of probability density across cortex underlie the anticipation of future events.

">Exploring the Neural Basis and Validity of Ordinal Emotion Representation through EEG</a></h4>

              
                Accurately measuring emotion is a major challenge in advancing the understanding of human emotion and developing emotional artificial intelligence. In many existing studies, participants' emotional ratings in interval scales are considered the true reflection of their emotional experiences. However, recent research suggests that ordinal annotations of emotions can more accurately capture the emotional expression process, providing a potential method for more precise emotion measurement. However, our understanding of the characteristics and validity of this new form of emotion representation is still relatively lacking. In particular, there is a lack of research using neural signals to explore the validity and neural basis of ordinal emotion representation. In this study, we used a video-elicited EEG dataset (n = 123) to identify the neural basis of ordinal emotion representation and demonstrate its validity from a neural perspective. Furthermore, we explored various characteristics of ordinal emotion representation, showing how it is superior to the interval form. First, we conducted inter-situation representational similarity analysis (RSA) and inter-subject RSA to test the degree to which ordinal representation captures both group commonalities and individual differences of emotion. Next, we investigated the characteristics of ordinal representation under different combinations of emotion items, including uni-variate and multivariate emotions, positive and negative emotions. Our results show that both group commonalities and inter-subject variations in EEG features are better explained by ordinal emotion representations than by interval ones. Multivariate ordinal representations showed better inter-subject reliability and higher representational similarity with EEG features compared to univariate counterparts, highlighting the co-occurrence nature of human emotions. Compared to negative emotions, ordinal representation showed greater improvements for positive emotions, suggesting that the complexity of positive emotions is well captured by ordinal representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that multivariate ordinal emotion ratings provide a more accurate measure of real emotional experience, which is crucial for enabling machines to precisely understand and express human emotions.

">Pupillometry and Whole-Brain c-Fos Mapping Uncover Multimodal Mirror Mechanisms in Emotional Contagion Networks of Mice</a></h4>

              
                Emotional contagion (ECo) represents a fundamental form of empathy. In this study, we used pupillometry to quantify ECo by assessing pupil responses of a mouse watching another mouse receive a tail shock. Pupil dilation effectively measured both direct and vicarious emotional response thresholds at the individual level through psychometric curve analysis. The pupillary ECo response diminished when the observer could not see the demonstrator, suggesting a multisensory process involving vision. Viewing videos of tail-shocked mice was sufficient to elicit a pupil response in the observer. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping revealed a broad network of 88 brain regions activated during ECo, with all areas activated in the demonstrator also engaged in the observer. Additionally, in certain brain regions, correlated activation was detected between each observer-demonstrator pair, indicating that ECo promotes a shared neural state. These findings advance our understanding of the neural basis of empathy, with implications for analyzing neuropsychiatric disorder models.

">Astrocyte-specific secretome profiling reveals its correlation with neurological disorders</a></h4>

              
                Secreted proteins mediate intercellular communication throughout the lives of multicellular organisms. However, due to the lack of new technology for secreted protein capturing, the progress of "secretomics" lags behind. Here, we report a two-step secretome enrichment method (tsSEM) combining unnatural amino acid labeling and click chemistry-based biorthogonal reaction, which enables in vitro secretome profiling in the presence of serum. Using this novel method, we systematically investigated the secretome of human iPSCs-derived astrocytes (iAst) in different disease models and identified a panel of astrocyte-secreted proteins that are responsible for its non-cell autonomous toxicity under disease conditions. Furthermore, we validated two astrocytes-derived novel neurotrophic proteins, FAM3C and KITLG, which we identified from disease models, and found that they could boost neurite outgrowth, protect neurons, and promote neural progenitor proliferation. Our study highlights the utility of secretome profiling of iAst and demonstrates its applications in disease study and target identification and validation in drug development.

">Development of Non-Spatial Grid-Like Neural Codes Predicts Inference and Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Piaget's theory emphasizes children develop structured knowledge schemas for assimilating new concepts, yet the neural mechanisms and their link to intelligence remain unclear. In 203 participants aged 8-25 years, we investigated how maturation of neural representations of a two-dimensional knowledge map supports inferential reasoning and assimilation. We found that grid-cell-like neural codes in the entorhinal cortex (EC) strengthen with age, forming structured representations in non-spatial conceptual spaces. This maturation is directly linked to improved inferential reasoning. These grid-like codes support the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in encoding distance relationships between concepts. As participants assimilated new information, they integrated it into existing grid patterns in the EC. Furthermore, maturation of these neural codes predicts real-world intelligence measures, particularly in abstract reasoning. Our findings show that the development of non-spatial grid-like neural codes underpins inference and knowledge assimilation, providing a neural basis for cognitive development and linking cellular neuroscience with intelligence.

	<p>This paper presents the basis for LoGlo PDT, a new treatment for glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is currently treated with maximal safe resection, temozolomide, and ionizing irradiation. Mortality in 2024 remains over 80% within several years from diagnosis. Oral 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is an FDA/EMA approved drug that is selectively taken up by malignant cells, including by glioblastoma. In photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma, intense intraoperative light causes glioblastoma tissue that has taken up 5-ALA to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. The requirement for intense light flux has restricted photodynamic treatment to a single one-hour intraoperative session. We analyze here published data showing that external light, illuminating the entire intact scalp, can attain low &amp;amp;mu;W/cm2 flux several cm into intact brain that would be sufficient to mediate 5-ALA photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma if the light and 5-ALA are delivered continuously over 24 h. At the core of LoGlo PDT regimen is the dataset showing that, for a given fluence, as the duration of PDT light delivery goes down, light intensity (flux) delivered must go up to achieve the same glioblastoma cell cytotoxicity as would a weaker light (lower flux) delivered over a longer time. Thus, a repetitive, noninvasive PDT of glioblastoma using an external light source may be possible. We analyze 5-ALA cellular physiology to show that three non-oncology drugs, ciprofloxacin, deferiprone, and telmisartan, can be repurposed to increase light energy capture after 5-ALA, thereby increasing photodynamic treatment&amp;amp;rsquo;s glioblastoma cell cytotoxicity. The LoGlo PDT approach uses both drug augmentation and prolonged ultra-low noninvasive transcranial light delivery for a repetitive, noninvasive 5-ALA photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 1% of population over age 60. It is defined by motor and nonmotor symptoms including a spectrum of cognitive impairments known as Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease dementia (PDD). Currently, the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for PDD is rivastigmine, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase increasing the level of acetylcholine in the brain. Due to its limited efficacy and side effect profile, rivastigmine is often not prescribed, leaving patients with no treatment options. PD has several derangements in neurotransmitter pathways (dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, kynurenine pathway (KP), acetylcholine, &amp;amp;alpha;7 nicotinic receptor, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors) and rivastigmine is only partially effective as it only targets one pathway. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of tryptophan metabolism, affects the pathophysiology of PDD in multiple ways. Both galantamine (&amp;amp;alpha;7 nicotinic receptor) and memantine (antagonist of the NMDA subtype of the glutamate receptor) are KYNA modulators. When used in combination, they target multiple pathways. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with each drug alone for PD have failed, the combination of galantamine and memantine has demonstrated a synergistic effect on cognitive enhancement in animal models. It has therapeutic potential that has not been adequately assessed, warranting future randomized controlled trials. In this review, we summarize the KYNA-centric model for PD pathophysiology and discuss how this treatment combination is promising in improving cognitive function in patients with PDD through its action on KYNA.</p>

	<p>Background: Individualizing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) parameters can improve precision in neuropsychiatric disorders. One important decision for the clinician is the selection of an appropriate montage&amp;amp;mdash;conventional or high-definition (HD)&amp;amp;mdash;to implement dose-controlled tDCS while maintaining the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s safety. Method: The present study simulated tDCS administration using T1-weighted brain images of 50 dementia, 25 depression patients, and 25 healthy individuals for two conventional and HD montages, targeting the regions of interest (ROIs) in the dorsal and ventral pathways that support language processing. For each tDCS configuration, the electric fields at the ROIs and the individualized dose required to achieve the desired current intensity at the target ROI across the subjects were estimated. Linear regression was performed on these parameters. Result: A significant relationship between atrophy and current dose that varies according to the disease was found. The dementia patients with significant brain atrophy required a higher personalized dosage for HD montage, as the current intensity at the target ROIs was lower and more variable than that of conventional montage. For dementia, tDCS individualization is pathway-dependent, wherein HD configuration of the dorsal route requires current dosages above the safety limit (&amp;amp;gt;4 mA) for 46% of individuals. However, there was no significant difference in electrode configurations between the HD and traditional setups for depression and healthy volunteers without significant brain atrophy. Conclusions: HD-tDCS with fixed locations is limited, making conventional tDCS more effective for dose-controlled applications. In patients with atrophy, individualized adjustments based on simulations are needed due to the variable stimulation strength in the ROI.</p>

                <p>A previous epidemiological study in Northern Europe showed that the A673T mutation (Icelandic mutation) in the amyloid precursor protein gene (<I>APP</I>) can protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the effect of the A673T mutation on APP processing has been investigated primarily in vitro, its in vivo impact has not been evaluated. This is mainly because most existing AD mouse models carry the Swedish mutation. The Swedish and Icelandic mutations are both located near the &beta;-cleavage site, and each mutation is presumed to have the opposite effect on &beta;-cleavage. Therefore, in the AD mouse models with the Swedish mutation, its effects could compete with the effects of the Icelandic mutation. Here, we introduced the A673T mutation into <I>App</I> knock-in mice devoid of the Swedish mutation (<I>App<sup>G-F</sup></I> mice) to avoid potential deleterious effects of the Swedish mutation and generated <I>App<sup>G-F-A673T</sup></I> mice. APP-A673T significantly downregulated &beta;-cleavage and attenuated the production of A&beta; and amyloid pathology in the brains of these animals. The Icelandic mutation also reduced neuroinflammation and neuritic alterations. Both sexes were studied. This is the first successful demonstration of the protective effect of the Icelandic mutation on amyloid pathology in vivo. Our findings indicate that specific inhibition of the APP-BACE1 interaction could be a promising therapeutic approach.

                <p>In daily life, we coordinate both simultaneous and sequential bimanual movements to manipulate objects. Our ability to rapidly account for different object dynamics suggests there are neural mechanisms to quickly deal with them. Here we investigate how actions of one arm can serve as a contextual cue for the other arm and facilitate adaptation. Specifically, we examine the temporal characteristics that underlie motor memory formation and recall, by testing the contextual effects of prior, simultaneous, and post contralateral arm movements in both male and female human participants. To do so, we measure their temporal generalization in three bimanual interference tasks. Importantly, the timing context of the learned action plays a pivotal role in the temporal generalization. While motor memories trained with post adaptation contextual movements generalize broadly, motor memories trained with prior contextual movements exhibit limited generalization, and motor memories trained with simultaneous contextual movements do not generalize to prior or post contextual timings. This highlights temporal tuning in sensorimotor plasticity: different training conditions yield substantially different temporal generalization characteristics. Since these generalizations extend far beyond any variability in training times, we suggest that the observed differences may stem from inherent differences in the use of prior, current, and post adaptation contextual information in the generation of natural behavior. This would imply differences in the underlying neural circuitry involved in learning and executing the corresponding coordinated bimanual movements.</p>

                <p>Merkel cell&ndash;neurite complexes (MNCs) are enriched in touch-sensitive areas, including whisker hair follicles and the glabrous skin of the rodent's paws, where tactile stimulation elicits slowly adapting type 1 (SA1) tactile impulses to encode for the sense of touch. Recently, we have shown with rodent whisker hair follicles that SA1 impulses are generated through fast excitatory synaptic transmission at MNCs and driven by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). However, it is currently unknown whether, besides whisker hair follicles, ASICs also play an essential role in generating SA1 impulses from MNCs of other body parts in mammals. In the present study, we attempted to address this question by using the skin&ndash;nerve preparations made from the hindpaw glabrous skin and tibial nerves of both male and female rodents and applying the pressure-clamped single&ndash;fiber recordings. We showed that SA1 impulses elicited by tactile stimulation to the rat hindpaw glabrous skin were largely diminished in the presence of amiloride and diminazene, two ASIC channel blockers. Furthermore, using the hindpaw glabrous skin and tibial nerve preparations made from the mice genetically deleted of ASIC3 channels (ASIC3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>), we showed that the frequency of SA1 impulses was significantly lower in ASIC3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice than in littermate wild-type ASIC3<sup>+/+</sup> mice, a result consistent with the pharmacological experiments with ASIC channel blockers. Our findings suggest that ASIC channels are essential for generating SA1 impulses to underlie the sense of touch in the glabrous skin of rodent hindpaws.</p>

                <p>The human auditory cortex is organized according to the timing and spectral characteristics of speech sounds during speech perception. During listening, the posterior superior temporal gyrus is organized according to onset responses, which segment acoustic boundaries in speech, and sustained responses, which further process phonological content. When we speak, the auditory system is actively processing the sound of our own voice to detect and correct speech errors in real time. This manifests in neural recordings as suppression of auditory responses during speech production compared with perception, but whether this differentially affects the onset and sustained temporal profiles is not known. Here, we investigated this question using intracranial EEG recorded from seventeen pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with medication-resistant epilepsy while they performed a reading/listening task. We identified onset and sustained responses to speech in the bilateral auditory cortex and observed a selective suppression of onset responses during speech production. We conclude that onset responses provide a temporal landmark during speech perception that is redundant with forward prediction during speech production and are therefore suppressed. Phonological feature tuning in these "onset suppression" electrodes remained stable between perception and production. Notably, auditory onset responses and phonological feature tuning were present in the posterior insula during both speech perception and production, suggesting an anatomically and functionally separate auditory processing zone that we believe to be involved in multisensory integration during speech perception and feedback control.</p>

                <p>Viewing brain function through the lens of other physiological processes has critically added to our understanding of human cognition. Further advances though may need a closer look at the interactions between these physiological processes themselves. Here we characterize the interplay of the highly periodic, and metabolically vital respiratory process and fluctuations in arousal neuromodulation, a process classically seen as nonperiodic. In the data from three experiments (<I>N</I> = 56 / 27 / 25 women and men), we tested for covariations in respiratory and pupil size (arousal) dynamics. After substantiating a robust coupling in the largest dataset, we further show that coupling strength decreases during task performance compared with rest and that it mirrors a decreased respiratory rate when participants take deeper breaths. Taken together, these findings suggest a stronger link between respiratory and arousal processes than previously thought. Moreover, these links imply a stronger coupling during periods of rest, and the effect of respiratory rate on the coupling suggests a driving role. As a consequence, studying the role of neuromodulatory arousal on cortical function may also need to consider respiratory influences.</p>

                <p>The primary cilium, a single microtubule-based organelle protruding from the cell surface and critical for neural development, also functions in adult neurons. While some dorsal root ganglion neurons elaborate a primary cilium, whether it is expressed by and functional in nociceptors is unknown. Recent studies have shown the role of Hedgehog, whose canonical signaling is primary cilium dependent, in nociceptor sensitization. We establish the presence of primary cilia in soma of rat nociceptors, where they contribute to mechanical threshold, prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB> (PGE<SUB>2</SUB>)-induced hyperalgesia, and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CIPN). Intrathecal administration of siRNA targeting <I>Ift88</I>, a primary cilium-specific intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein required for ciliary integrity, resulted in attenuation of <I>Ift88</I> mRNA and nociceptor primary cilia. Attenuation of primary cilia was associated with an increase in mechanical nociceptive threshold in vivo and decrease in nociceptor excitability in vitro, abrogation of hyperalgesia, and nociceptor sensitization induced by both a prototypical pronociceptive inflammatory mediator PGE<SUB>2</SUB> and paclitaxel CIPN, in a sex-specific fashion. siRNA targeting <I>Ift52</I>, another IFT protein, and knockdown of NompB, the <I>Drosophila Ift88</I> ortholog, also abrogated CIPN and reduced baseline mechanosensitivity, respectively, providing independent confirmation for primary cilia control of nociceptor function. Hedgehog-induced hyperalgesia is attenuated by <I>Ift88</I> siRNA, supporting the role for primary cilia in Hedgehog-induced hyperalgesia. Attenuation of CIPN by cyclopamine (intradermal and intraganglion), which inhibits Hedgehog signaling, supports the role of Hedgehog in CIPN. Our findings support the role of the nociceptor primary cilium in control of mechanical nociceptive threshold and inflammatory and neuropathic pain, the latter Hedgehog-dependent.</p>

                <p>Sequential information permeates daily activities, such as when watching for the correct series of buildings to determine when to get off the bus or train. These sequences include periodicity (the spacing of the buildings), the identity of the stimuli (the kind of house), and higher-order more abstract rules that may not depend on the exact stimulus (e.g., house, house, house, business). Previously, we found that the posterior fundus of area 46 in the monkey lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) responds to rule changes in such abstract visual sequences. However, it is unknown if this region responds to other components of the sequence, i.e., image periodicity and identity, in isolation. Further, it is unknown if this region dissociates from other, more ventral LPFC subregions that have been associated with sequences and their components. To address these questions, we used awake functional magnetic resonance imaging in three male macaque monkeys during two no-report visual tasks. One task contained abstract visual sequences, and the other contained no visual sequences but maintained the same image periodicity and identities. We found the fundus of area 46 responded only to abstract sequence rule violations. In contrast, the ventral bank of area 46 responded to changes in image periodicity and identity, but not changes in the abstract sequence. These results suggest a functional specialization within anatomical substructures of LPFC to signal different kinds of stimulus regularities. This specialization may provide key scaffolding to identify abstract patterns and construct complex models of the world for daily living.</p>

                <p>Chronic pain remains a significant health challenge with limited effective treatments. This study investigates the metabolic changes underlying pain progression and resolution, uncovering a novel compensatory mechanism in sensory neurons. Using the hyperalgesic priming model in male mice, we demonstrate that nerve growth factor (NGF) initially disrupted mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, leading to acute allodynia. Surprisingly, this metabolic disruption persisted even after the apparent resolution of allodynia. We discovered that during the resolution phase, sensory neurons exhibit increased glutamine oxidation and upregulation of the major glutamine transporter ASCT2 in dorsal root ganglia. This compensatory response plays a crucial role in pain resolution, as demonstrated by our experiments. Knockdown of ASCT2 prevents the resolution of NGF-induced allodynia and precipitates the transition to a chronic state. Furthermore, we show that the glutamine catabolite &alpha;-ketoglutarate attenuated glycolytic flux and alleviated allodynia in both acute and chronic phases of the hyperalgesic priming model. The importance of ASCT2 is further confirmed in a translational model, where its knockdown prevented the resolution of allodynia following plantar incision. These findings highlight the pivotal role of metabolic changes in pain resolution and identify ASCT2-mediated glutamine metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain. Understanding these endogenous mechanisms that promote pain resolution can guide the development of novel interventions to prevent the transition pain from acute to chronic.</p>

                <p>Growth hormone (GH) action in the brain regulates neuroendocrine axes, energy and glucose homeostasis, and several neurological functions. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contains numerous neurons that respond to a systemic GH injection by expressing the phosphorylated STAT5, a GH receptor (GHR) signaling marker. However, the potential role of GHR signaling in the LHA is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that ~70% of orexin- and leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing neurons in the LHA are responsive to GH. Male mice carrying inactivation of the <I>Ghr</I> gene in the LHA were generated via bilateral injections of an adeno-associated virus. In <I>ad libitum</I>-fed mice, GHR ablation in LHA neurons did not significantly change energy and glucose homeostasis. Subsequently, mice were subjected to 5&nbsp;d of 40% food restriction. Food restriction decreased body weight, energy expenditure, and carbohydrate oxidation. These effects were similarly observed in control and LHA<sup>GHR</sup> mice. While food-deprived control mice progressively increased ambulatory/exploratory activity and food-seeking behavior, LHA<sup>GHR</sup> mice did not show hyperactivity induced by food restriction. GHR ablation in the LHA reduced the percentage of orexin neurons expressing c-Fos during food restriction. Additionally, an acute GH injection increased the expression of c-Fos in LHA<sup>ORX</sup> neurons. Inactivation of <I>Ghr</I> in LepR-expressing cells did not prevent hyperactivity in food-deprived mice, whereas whole-brain <I>Ghr</I> knock-out mice showed reduced ambulatory activity during food restriction. Our findings indicate that GHR signaling in the LHA regulates the activity of orexin neurons and is necessary to increase food-seeking behavior in food-deprived male mice.</p>

                <p>Humans possess a remarkable ability to rapidly access diverse information from others&rsquo; faces with just a brief glance, which is crucial for intricate social interactions. While previous studies using event-related potentials/fields have explored various face dimensions during this process, the interplay between these dimensions remains unclear. Here, by applying multivariate decoding analysis to neural signals recorded with optically pumped magnetometer magnetoencephalography, we systematically investigated the temporal interactions between invariant and variable aspects of face stimuli, including race, gender, age, and expression. First, our analysis revealed unique temporal structures for each face dimension with high test&ndash;retest reliability. Notably, expression and race exhibited a dominant and stably maintained temporal structure according to temporal generalization analysis. Further exploration into the mutual interactions among face dimensions uncovered age effects on gender and race, as well as expression effects on race, during the early stage (~200&ndash;300&nbsp;ms postface presentation). Additionally, we observed a relatively late effect of race on gender representation, peaking ~350&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the neural dynamics underlying the multidimensional aspects of face perception and illuminate the promising future of utilizing OPM-MEG for exploring higher-level human cognition.</p>

                Background Falls affect 40-70% within the first year and contributing to increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. Dual-task assessments, such as the Walking While Talking (WWT) and Stops Walking While Talking (SWWT) tests, are potential tools for predicting fall risk, but their comparative effectiveness remains underexplored. Methods This cross-sectional study included 68 stroke survivors who completed WWT-Simple (WWT-S), WWT-Complex (WWT-C), and SWWT assessments, as well as the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Falls Efficacy Scale (FES). Spearman correlations assessed relationships between balance, fear of falling, and dual-task performance. Logistic regression identified predictors of fall risk, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated predictive accuracy. The study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results BBS scores were strongly negatively correlated with WWT-S (r = -0.734, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C (r = -0.737, p < 0.0001), indicating poorer balance with slower dual-task completion. Positive correlations were found between WWT-S and FES (r = 0.668, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C and FES (r = 0.610, p < 0.0001), linking slower completion times with higher fear of falling. SWWT was significantly negatively correlated with BBS (r = -0.625, p < 0.0001). WWT tests had higher sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (99%) than SWWT (sensitivity = 68.9%; specificity = 91.3%). Logistic regression identified SWWT (Positive) as a significant predictor of fall risk (p = 0.009), and ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.911, indicating excellent predictive power. Conclusions Findings highlight the superior predictive value of WWT tests over SWWT in assessing fall risk among stroke survivors. Incorporating dual-task measures into clinical practice may enhance fall risk evaluation, supporting targeted stroke rehabilitation.

                Introduction Transomental hernias are a rare type of internal hernia, accounting for less than 1% of all internal hernias. They occur when abdominal contents protrude through a defect in the omentum, leading to bowel obstruction and potential strangulation. We report the case of a young male admitted for the management of an acute bowel obstruction. Case report A 38-year-old male patient with no significant medical or surgical history presented with a proximal bowel obstruction syndrome. Upon physical examination, he exhibited mild abdominal distension, tenderness in the right iliac fossa, and tympanism. Laboratory tests indicated elevated inflammatory markers. An emergency computed tomography (CT) scan suggested the presence of a congenital band or an internal hernia. A laparoscopic procedure was performed, which identified a transomental hernia with a segment of the ileum protruding through an omental defect adjacent to the transverse colon. The herniated loop of small intestine was found to be compromised and gangrenous. Due to the severity of the condition, a midline incision was made to convert the procedure, allowing for resection of the affected segment of the small intestine while preserving 2.5 meters of viable bowel distal to the duodenojejunal junction. The remaining small intestine was exteriorized as a double-barrel ileostomy, and the transomental defect was subsequently repaired. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. Conclusion Although internal hernias account for a relatively small percentage of cases, they are frequently overlooked as a cause of bowel obstruction. Diagnosis this condition is challenging, both clinically and radiologically. Facilitating prompt surgical intervention to mitigate high mortality is essential.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate versus placebo in a phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-period cross-over clinical trial in patients with isolated laryngeal dystonia (LD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2021, pausing during the COVID-19 pandemic, at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in 106 patients with alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) and alcohol-non-responsive (EtOH−) LD (53 to receive 1.5g of sodium oxybate first, 53 to receive matching placebo first). The primary outcome was a change from baseline in LD symptom severity 40 minutes after drug intake. Safety was based on vital signs, cognitive function, suicidality, daytime sleepiness, and adverse events. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to study procedures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to baseline, EtOH+ but not EtOH− patients had a statistically significant improvement in LD symptoms following sodium oxybate versus placebo (EtOH+: 98.75% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6–26.9; <i>p</i> = 0.008; EtOH−: 98.75% CI = −6.2 to 18.7; <i>p</i> = 0.42). Statistically significant minimum drug efficacy in EtOH+ patients was found at ≥16% symptom improvement (OR = 2.09; 98.75% CI = 0.75–5.80; <i>p</i> = 0.036), with an average of 40.81% benefits (98.75% CI = 34.7–48.6). Drug efficacy waned by 300 minutes after intake without a rebound. No changes were found in cognitive function, suicidality, or vital signs. Common adverse events included mild dizziness, nausea, and daytime sleepiness.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sodium oxybate showed clinically meaningful improvement of symptoms in EtOH+ LD patients, with acceptable tolerability. Sodium oxybate offers the first pathophysiologically relevant oral treatment for laryngeal dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) will increase bnAb therapeutic benefits. Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction. One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented, which likely affects models’ generalizability across subtypes. A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb, and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem. Recently, machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, a strategy called multi-task learning (MTL), have been shown to improve predictions. We develop a new model and show that, beyond the boost in performance, MTL also helps address the previous two challenges. Specifically, we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes, and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies, thus providing tools to predict antibodies’ epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations. Our analyses, publicly available at https://github.com/iaime/LBUM, can be adapted to other infectious diseases that are treated with antibody therapy.

                <p>by Bastien Berret, Dorian Verdel, Etienne Burdet, Frédéric Jean</p>

Despite our environment often being uncertain, we generally manage to generate stable motor behaviors. While reactive control plays a major role in this achievement, proactive control is critical to cope with the substantial noise and delays that affect neuromusculoskeletal systems. In particular, muscle co-contraction is exploited to robustify feedforward motor commands against internal sensorimotor noise as was revealed by stochastic optimal open-loop control modeling. Here, we extend this framework to neuromusculoskeletal systems subjected to random disturbances originating from the environment. The analytical derivation and numerical simulations predict a characteristic relationship between the degree of uncertainty in the task at hand and the optimal level of anticipatory co-contraction. This prediction is confirmed through a single-joint pointing task experiment where an external torque is applied to the wrist near the end of the reaching movement with varying probabilities across blocks of trials. We conclude that uncertainty calls for impedance control via proactive muscle co-contraction to stabilize behaviors when reactive control is insufficient for task success.

                <p>by Baike She, Rebecca Lee Smith, Ian Pytlarz, Shreyas Sundaram, Philip E. Paré</p>

During pandemics, countries, regions, and communities develop various epidemic models to evaluate spread and guide mitigation policies. However, model uncertainties caused by complex transmission behaviors, contact-tracing networks, time-varying parameters, human factors, and limited data present significant challenges to model-based approaches. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that centers around reproduction number estimates to perform counterfactual analysis, strategy evaluation, and feedback control of epidemics. The framework 1) introduces a mechanism to quantify the impact of the testing-for-isolation intervention strategy on the basic reproduction number. Building on this mechanism, the framework 2) proposes a method to reverse engineer the effective reproduction number under different strengths of the intervention strategy. In addition, based on the method that quantifies the impact of the testing-for-isolation strategy on the basic reproduction number, the framework 3) proposes a closed-loop control algorithm that uses the effective reproduction number both as feedback to indicate the severity of the spread and as the control goal to guide adjustments in the intensity of the intervention. We illustrate the framework, along with its three core methods, by addressing three key questions and validating its effectiveness using data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and Purdue University: 1) How severe would an outbreak have been without the implemented intervention strategies? 2) What impact would varying the intervention strength have had on an outbreak? 3) How can we adjust the intervention intensity based on the current state of an outbreak?

                <p>by Hyun Joo Ji, Steven L. Salzberg</p>

Several recent studies have presented evidence that the human gene catalogue should be expanded to include thousands of short open reading frames (ORFs) appearing upstream or downstream of existing protein-coding genes, each of which might create an additional bicistronic transcript in humans. Here we explore an alternative hypothesis that would explain the translational and evolutionary evidence for these upstream ORFs without the need to create novel genes or bicistronic transcripts. We examined 2,199 upstream ORFs that have been proposed as high-quality candidates for novel genes, to determine if they could instead represent protein-coding exons that can be added to existing genes. We checked for the conservation of these ORFs in four recently sequenced, high-quality human genomes, and found a large majority (87.8%) to be conserved in all four as expected. We then looked for splicing evidence that would connect each upstream ORF to the downstream protein-coding gene at the same locus, thus creating a novel splicing variant using the upstream ORF as its first exon. These protein coding exon candidates were further evaluated using protein structure predictions of the protein sequences that included the proposed new exons. We determined that 541 out of 2,199 upstream ORFs have strong evidence that they can form protein coding exons that are part of an existing gene, and that the resulting protein is predicted to have similar or better structural quality than the currently annotated isoform.
