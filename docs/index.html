                arXiv:2410.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the functional architecture of the early stages of three-dimensional vision by extending the neurogeometric sub-Riemannian model for stereo-vision introduced in \cite{BCSZ23}. A new framework for correspondence is introduced that integrates a neural-based algorithm to achieve stereo correspondence locally while, simultaneously, organizing the corresponding points into global perceptual units. The result is an effective scene segmentation. We achieve this using harmonic analysis on the sub-Riemannian structure and show, in a comparison against Riemannian distance, that the sub-Riemannian metric is central to the solution.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02972">Bayesian Mechanics of Synaptic Learning under the Free Energy Principle</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain is a biological system comprising nerve cells and orchestrates its embodied agent's perception, behavior, and learning in the dynamic environment. The free energy principle (FEP) advocated by Karl Friston explicates the local, recurrent, and self-supervised neurodynamics of the brain's higher-order functions. In this paper, we continue to finesse the FEP through the physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight change and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying the generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic plasticity in the brain with a simple model: we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03510">Cognitive maps and schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured internal representations (cognitive maps) shape cognition, from imagining the future and counterfactual past, to transferring knowledge to new settings. Our understanding of how such representations are formed and maintained in biological and artificial neural networks has grown enormously. The cognitive mapping hypothesis of schizophrenia extends this enquiry to psychiatry, proposing that diverse symptoms - from delusions to conceptual disorganisation - stem from abnormalities in how the brain forms structured representations. These abnormalities may arise from a confluence of neurophysiological perturbations (excitation-inhibition imbalance, resulting in attractor instability and impaired representational capacity), and/or environmental factors such as early life psychosocial stressors (which impinge on representation learning). This proposal thus links knowledge of neural circuit abnormalities, environmental risk factors, and symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03548">Seizure freedom after surgical resection of diffusion-weighted MRI abnormalities</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Importance: Many individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy continue to have seizures after resective surgery. Accurate identification of focal brain abnormalities is essential for successful neurosurgical intervention. Current clinical approaches to identify structural abnormalities for surgical targeting in epilepsy do not use diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), despite evidence that dMRI abnormalities are present in epilepsy and may relate to the epileptogenic zone. Objective: To investigate whether surgical resection of diffusion abnormalities relates to post-operative seizure freedom. Design: This retrospective case-control study was conducted between 2009 and 2022. Data were acquired at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UK. Study participants included 200 individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, who underwent resective surgery, and 97 healthy controls used as a normative baseline. Main Outcomes: Spatial overlap between diffusion abnormality clusters and surgical resection masks, and relation to post-surgical outcome. Results: Surgical resections overlapping with the largest abnormal cluster significantly correlated with sustained seizure freedom at 12 months (83% vs 55%; p<0.0001) and over five years (p<0.0001). Notably, resecting only a small proportion of the largest cluster was associated with better seizure outcomes than cases with no resection of this cluster (p=0.008). Furthermore, sparing the largest cluster but resecting other large clusters still improved seizure freedom rates compared to no overlap (p=0.03). Conclusions: Our results suggest that abnormal clusters, identified using dMRI, are integral to the epileptogenic network, and even a partial removal of such an abnormal cluster is sufficient to achieve seizure freedom. The study highlights the potential of incorporating dMRI into pre-surgical planning to improve outcomes in focal epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03657">A low-dimensional model for adaptive networks of spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a large ensemble of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with heterogeneous input currents and adaptation variables. For a particular class of adaptation, which we call quadratic spike-frequency adaptation (QSFA), the high-dimensional system admits an exact reduction to a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for three mean-field variables: the population's firing rate, the mean membrane potential, and a mean adaptation variable. These low-dimensional firing rate equations (FRE) reveal an important generic feature of heterogeneous networks with spike frequency adaptation: Both the center and the width of the distribution of the neurons' firing frequencies are reduced, and this largely favors the emergence of collective synchronization in the network. These results are confirmed by the bifurcation analysis of the FRE, which faithfully describe the collective dynamics of the spiking neuron network, including collective oscillations, bursting, and macroscopic chaos.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03385">From Epilepsy Seizures Classification to Detection: A Deep Learning-based Approach for Raw EEG Signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy represents the most prevalent neurological disease in the world. One-third of people suffering from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) exhibit drug resistance, urging the need to develop new treatments. A key part in anti-seizure medication (ASM) development is the capability of detecting and quantifying epileptic seizures occurring in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which is crucial for treatment efficacy evaluation. In this study, we introduced a seizure detection pipeline based on deep learning models applied to raw EEG signals. This pipeline integrates: a new pre-processing technique which segments continuous raw EEG signals without prior distinction between seizure and seizure-free activities; a post-processing algorithm developed to reassemble EEG segments and allow the identification of seizures start/end; and finally, a new evaluation procedure based on a strict seizure events comparison between predicted and real labels. Models training have been performed using a data splitting strategy which addresses the potential for data leakage. We demonstrated the fundamental differences between a seizure classification and a seizure detection task and showed the differences in performance between the two tasks. Finally, we demonstrated the generalization capabilities across species of our best architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Network and a Transformer encoder. The model was trained on animal EEGs and tested on human EEGs with a F1-score of 93% on a balanced Bonn dataset.

                arXiv:2410.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The taste electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked by the taste stimulation can reflect different brain patterns and be used in applications such as sensory evaluation of food. However, considering the computational cost and efficiency, EEG data with many channels has to face the critical issue of channel selection. This paper proposed a channel selection method called class activation mapping with attention (CAM-Attention). The CAM-Attention method combined a convolutional neural network with channel and spatial attention (CNN-CSA) model with a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) model. The CNN-CSA model exploited key features in EEG data by attention mechanism, and the Grad-CAM model effectively realized the visualization of feature regions. Then, channel selection was effectively implemented based on feature regions. Finally, the CAM-Attention method reduced the computational burden of taste EEG recognition and effectively distinguished the four tastes. In short, it has excellent recognition performance and provides effective technical support for taste sensory evaluation.

Abstract: Results of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies can be impacted by many sources of variability including differences due to: the sampling of the participants, differences in acquisition protocols and material but also due to different analytical choices in the processing of the fMRI data. While variability across participants or across acquisition instruments have been extensively studied in the neuroimaging literature the root causes of analytical variability remain an open question. Here, we share the \textit{HCP multi-pipeline dataset}, including the resulting statistic maps for 24 typical fMRI pipelines on 1,080 participants of the HCP-Young Adults dataset. We share both individual and group results - for 1,000 groups of 50 participants - over 5 motor contrasts. We hope that this large dataset covering  a wide range of analysis conditions will provide new opportunities to study analytical variability in fMRI.

                arXiv:2410.01022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of the mammalian brain exhibit a strikingly regular hexagonal firing field over space. These cells are learned after birth and are thought to support spatial navigation but also more abstract computations. Although various computational models, including those based on artificial neural networks, have been proposed to explain the formation of grid cells, the process through which the MEC circuit ${\it learns}$ to develop grid cells remains unclear. In this study, we argue that predictive coding, a biologically plausible plasticity rule known to learn visual representations, can also train neural networks to develop hexagonal grid representations from spatial inputs. We demonstrate that grid cells emerge robustly through predictive coding in both static and dynamic environments, and we develop an understanding of this grid cell learning capability by analytically comparing predictive coding with existing models. Our work therefore offers a novel and biologically plausible perspective on the learning mechanisms underlying grid cells. Moreover, it extends the predictive coding theory to the hippocampal formation, suggesting a unified learning algorithm for diverse cortical representations.

Abstract: Is artificial consciousness theoretically possible? Is it plausible? If so, is it technically feasible? To make progress on these questions, it is necessary to lay some groundwork clarifying the logical and empirical conditions for artificial consciousness to arise and the meaning of relevant terms involved. Consciousness is a polysemic word: researchers from different fields, including neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and philosophy, among others, sometimes use different terms in order to refer to the same phenomena or the same terms to refer to different phenomena. In fact, if we want to pursue artificial consciousness, a proper definition of the key concepts is required. Here, after some logical and conceptual preliminaries, we argue for the necessity of using dimensions and profiles of consciousness for a balanced discussion about their possible instantiation or realisation in artificial systems. Our primary goal in this paper is to review the main theoretical questions that arise in the domain of artificial consciousness. On the basis of this review, we propose to assess the issue of artificial consciousness within a multidimensional account. The theoretical possibility of artificial consciousness is already presumed within some theoretical frameworks; however, empirical possibility cannot simply be deduced from these frameworks but needs independent empirical validation. We break down the complexity of consciousness by identifying constituents, components, and dimensions, and reflect pragmatically about the general challenges confronting the creation of artificial consciousness. Despite these challenges, we outline a research strategy for showing how "awareness" as we propose to understand it could plausibly be realised in artificial systems.

                arXiv:2410.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are an advanced fusion of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, requiring stable and long-term decoding of neural signals. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their neuronal dynamics and spike-based signal processing, are inherently well-suited for this task. This paper presents a novel approach utilizing a Multiscale Fusion enhanced Spiking Neural Network (MFSNN). The MFSNN emulates the parallel processing and multiscale feature fusion seen in human visual perception to enable real-time, efficient, and energy-conserving neural signal decoding. Initially, the MFSNN employs temporal convolutional networks and channel attention mechanisms to extract spatiotemporal features from raw data. It then enhances decoding performance by integrating these features through skip connections. Additionally, the MFSNN improves generalizability and robustness in cross-day signal decoding through mini-batch supervised generalization learning. In two benchmark invasive BCI paradigms, including the single-hand grasp-and-touch and center-and-out reach tasks, the MFSNN surpasses traditional artificial neural network methods, such as MLP and GRU, in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, the MFSNN's multiscale feature fusion framework is well-suited for the implementation on neuromorphic chips, offering an energy-efficient solution for online decoding of invasive BCI signals.

Abstract: Disruptions to medical infrastructure during disasters pose significant risks to critically ill patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. To enhance patient access to dialysis treatment under such conditions, it is crucial to assess the vulnerabilities of critical care facilities to hazardous events. This study proposes optimization models for patient reallocation and the strategic placement of temporary medical facilities to bolster the resilience of the critical care system, with a focus on equitable outcomes. Utilizing human mobility data from Texas, we evaluate patient access to critical care and dialysis centers under simulated hazard scenarios. The proposed bio-inspired optimization model, based on the Ant Colony optimization method, efficiently reallocates patients to mitigate disrupted access to dialysis facilities. The model outputs offer valuable insights into patient and hospital preparedness for disasters. Overall, the study presents a data-driven, analytics-based decision support tool designed to proactively mitigate potential disruptions in access to critical care facilities during disasters, tailored to the needs of health officials, emergency managers, and hospital system administrators in both the private and public sectors.

                arXiv:2410.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years, the formulation of real-world optimization problems and their efficient solution via metaheuristic algorithms has been a catalyst for a myriad of research studies. In spite of decades of historical advancements on the design and use of metaheuristics, large difficulties still remain in regards to the understandability, algorithmic design uprightness, and performance verifiability of new technical achievements. A clear example stems from the scarce replicability of works dealing with metaheuristics used for optimization, which is often infeasible due to ambiguity and lack of detail in the presentation of the methods to be reproduced. Additionally, in many cases, there is a questionable statistical significance of their reported results. This work aims at providing the audience with a proposal of good practices which should be embraced when conducting studies about metaheuristics methods used for optimization in order to provide scientific rigor, value and transparency. To this end, we introduce a step by step methodology covering every research phase that should be followed when addressing this scientific field. Specifically, frequently overlooked yet crucial aspects and useful recommendations will be discussed in regards to the formulation of the problem, solution encoding, implementation of search operators, evaluation metrics, design of experiments, and considerations for real-world performance, among others. Finally, we will outline important considerations, challenges, and research directions for the success of newly developed optimization metaheuristics in their deployment and operation over real-world application environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03409">Comparative study of regression vs pairwise models for surrogate-based heuristic optimisation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heuristic optimisation algorithms explore the search space by sampling solutions, evaluating their fitness, and biasing the search in the direction of promising solutions. However, in many cases, this fitness function involves executing expensive computational calculations, drastically reducing the reasonable number of evaluations. In this context, surrogate models have emerged as an excellent alternative to alleviate these computational problems. This paper addresses the formulation of surrogate problems as both regression models that approximate fitness (surface surrogate models) and a novel way to connect classification models (pairwise surrogate models). The pairwise approach can be directly exploited by some algorithms, such as Differential Evolution, in which the fitness value is not actually needed to drive the search, and it is sufficient to know whether a solution is better than another one or not. Based on these modelling approaches, we have conducted a multidimensional analysis of surrogate models under different configurations: different machine learning algorithms (regularised regression, neural networks, decision trees, boosting methods, and random forests), different surrogate strategies (encouraging diversity or relaxing prediction thresholds), and compare them for both surface and pairwise surrogate models. The experimental part of the article includes the benchmark problems already proposed for the SOCO2011 competition in continuous optimisation and a simulation problem included in the recent GECCO2021 Industrial Challenge. This paper shows that the performance of the overall search, when using online machine learning-based surrogate models, depends not only on the accuracy of the predictive model but also on both the kind of bias towards positive or negative cases and how the optimisation uses those predictions to decide whether to execute the actual fitness function.

                arXiv:2410.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there is growing demand for effective and efficient long sequence modeling, with State Space Models (SSMs) proving to be effective for long sequence tasks. To further reduce energy consumption, SSMs can be adapted to Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using spiking functions. However, current spiking-formalized SSMs approaches still rely on float-point matrix-vector multiplication during inference, undermining SNNs' energy advantage. In this work, we address the efficiency and performance challenges of long sequence learning in SNNs simultaneously. First, we propose a decoupled reset method for parallel spiking neuron training, reducing the typical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model's training time from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L\log L)$, effectively speeding up the training by $6.57 \times$ to $16.50 \times$ on sequence lengths $1,024$ to $32,768$. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that parallel computation with a reset mechanism is implemented achieving equivalence to its sequential counterpart. Secondly, to capture long-range dependencies, we propose a Parallel Resonate and Fire (PRF) neuron, which leverages an oscillating membrane potential driven by a resonate mechanism from a differentiable reset function in the complex domain. The PRF enables efficient long sequence learning while maintaining parallel training. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed spike-driven architecture using PRF achieves performance comparable to Structured SSMs (S4), with two orders of magnitude reduction in energy consumption, outperforming Transformer on Long Range Arena tasks.

Abstract: Bio-inspired optimization (including Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence) is a growing research topic with many competitive bio-inspired algorithms being proposed every year. In such an active area, preparing a successful proposal of a new bio-inspired algorithm is not an easy task. Given the maturity of this research field, proposing a new optimization technique with innovative elements is no longer enough. Apart from the novelty, results reported by the authors should be proven to achieve a significant advance over previous outcomes from the state of the art. Unfortunately, not all new proposals deal with this requirement properly. Some of them fail to select appropriate benchmarks or reference algorithms to compare with. In other cases, the validation process carried out is not defined in a principled way (or is even not done at all). Consequently, the significance of the results presented in such studies cannot be guaranteed. In this work we review several recommendations in the literature and propose methodological guidelines to prepare a successful proposal, taking all these issues into account. We expect these guidelines to be useful not only for authors, but also for reviewers and editors along their assessment of new contributions to the field.

                arXiv:2401.08632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to exhibit a wide range of effective behaviors. Inspired by this principle, Quality-Diversity algorithms, such as MAP-Elites, are evolutionary methods designed to generate a set of diverse and high-fitness solutions. However, as a genetic algorithm, MAP-Elites relies on random mutations, which can become inefficient in high-dimensional search spaces, thus limiting its scalability to more complex domains, such as learning to control agents directly from high-dimensional inputs. To address this limitation, advanced methods like PGA-MAP-Elites and DCG-MAP-Elites have been developed, which combine actor-critic techniques from Reinforcement Learning with MAP-Elites, significantly enhancing the performance and efficiency of Quality-Diversity algorithms in complex, high-dimensional tasks. While these methods have successfully leveraged the trained critic to guide more effective mutations, the potential of the trained actor remains underutilized in improving both the quality and diversity of the evolved population. In this work, we introduce DCRL-MAP-Elites, an extension of DCG-MAP-Elites that utilizes the descriptor-conditioned actor as a generative model to produce diverse solutions, which are then injected into the offspring batch at each generation. Additionally, we present an empirical analysis of the fitness and descriptor reproducibility of the solutions discovered by each algorithm. Finally, we present a second empirical analysis shedding light on the synergies between the different variations operators and explaining the performance improvement from PGA-MAP-Elites to DCRL-MAP-Elites.

                arXiv:2406.02923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are posited as a computationally efficient and biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural architectures, with their core computational framework primarily using the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. However, the limited hidden state representation of LIF neurons, characterized by a scalar membrane potential, and sequential spike generation process, poses challenges for effectively developing scalable spiking models to address long-range dependencies in sequence learning tasks. In this study, we develop a scalable probabilistic spiking learning framework for long-range dependency tasks leveraging the fundamentals of state space models. Unlike LIF neurons that rely on the determinitic Heaviside function for a sequential process of spike generation, we introduce a SpikeSampler layer that samples spikes stochastically based on an SSM-based neuronal model while allowing parallel computations. To address non-differentiability of the spiking operation and enable effective training, we also propose a surrogate function tailored for the stochastic nature of the SpikeSampler layer. To enhance inter-neuron communication, we introduce the SpikeMixer block, which integrates spikes from neuron populations in each layer. This is followed by a ClampFuse layer, incorporating a residual connection to capture complex dependencies, enabling scalability of the model. Our models attain state-of-the-art performance among SNN models across diverse long-range dependency tasks, encompassing the Long Range Arena benchmark, permuted sequential MNIST, and the Speech Command dataset and demonstrate sparse spiking pattern highlighting its computational efficiency.

                arXiv:2410.02543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a convergence of machine learning and biology, we reveal that diffusion models are evolutionary algorithms. By considering evolution as a denoising process and reversed evolution as diffusion, we mathematically demonstrate that diffusion models inherently perform evolutionary algorithms, naturally encompassing selection, mutation, and reproductive isolation. Building on this equivalence, we propose the Diffusion Evolution method: an evolutionary algorithm utilizing iterative denoising -- as originally introduced in the context of diffusion models -- to heuristically refine solutions in parameter spaces. Unlike traditional approaches, Diffusion Evolution efficiently identifies multiple optimal solutions and outperforms prominent mainstream evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, leveraging advanced concepts from diffusion models, namely latent space diffusion and accelerated sampling, we introduce Latent Space Diffusion Evolution, which finds solutions for evolutionary tasks in high-dimensional complex parameter space while significantly reducing computational steps. This parallel between diffusion and evolution not only bridges two different fields but also opens new avenues for mutual enhancement, raising questions about open-ended evolution and potentially utilizing non-Gaussian or discrete diffusion models in the context of Diffusion Evolution.

                arXiv:2307.00526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional token embeddings underpin Large Language Models (LLMs), as they can capture subtle semantic information and significantly enhance the modelling of complex language patterns. However, this high dimensionality also introduces considerable model parameters and prohibitively high model storage and memory requirements, which is particularly unaffordable for low-end devices. Targeting no extra training data and insufficient computation cases, we propose a training-free model compression approach based on the Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD), whereby each pre-trained token embedding is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS). We then comprehensively investigate the low-rank structures extracted by this approach, in terms of the compression ratio, the language task performance, and latency on a typical low-end device (i.e. Raspberry Pi). Taking GPT family models (i.e. GPT-2 and CerebrasGPT) as case studies, our approach theoretically results in $46.89\%$ fewer parameters of the entire model, with a compression ratio $39.38\times$ - $65.64\times$ for the embedding layers. With different hyperparameter choices, the model compressed with our approach can achieve a comparable language task performance to the original model with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression. This empirically proves the existence of low-rank structure in GPT family models, and demonstrates that about half of the parameters in the embedding layers are redundant.

Both cognitive neuroscience and reinforcement learning (RL) have proposed a number of interacting functional components that together implement search and evaluation in multi-step decision making. These components include conflict monitoring, state prediction, state evaluation, task decomposition, and orchestration. To improve planning with LLMs, we propose an agentic architecture, the Modular Agentic Planner (MAP), in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent interaction of the specialized modules mentioned above, each implemented using an LLM. MAP improves planning through the interaction of specialized modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief automated calls to the LLM. We evaluate MAP on three challenging planning tasks -- graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi, and the PlanBench benchmark -- as well as an NLP task requiring multi-step reasoning (strategyQA). We find that MAP yields significant improvements over both standard LLM methods (zero-shot prompting, in-context learning) and competitive baselines (chain-of-thought, multi-agent debate, and tree-of-thought), can be effectively combined with smaller and more cost-efficient LLMs (Llama3-70B), and displays superior transfer across tasks. These results suggest the benefit of a modular and multi-agent approach to planning with LLMs.

                arXiv:2401.14557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) has become popular in recent years thanks to its fast and efficient computational capabilities. Standard RC has been shown to be equivalent in the asymptotic limit to Recurrent Kernels, which helps in analyzing its expressive power. However, many well-established RC paradigms, such as Leaky RC, Sparse RC, and Deep RC, are yet to be systematically analyzed in such a way. We define the Recurrent Kernel limit of all these RC topologies and conduct a convergence study for a wide range of activation functions and hyperparameters. Our findings provide new insights into various aspects of Reservoir Computing. First, we demonstrate that there is an optimal sparsity level which grows with the reservoir size. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that Deep RC should use reservoir layers of decreasing sizes. Finally, we perform a benchmark demonstrating the efficiency of Structured Reservoir Computing compared to vanilla and Sparse Reservoir Computing.

                arXiv:2410.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.

">Neuronal plasticity at puberty in hypothalamic neurons controlling fertility in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Puberty is a critical transition period to achieve fertility and reproductive capacity in all mammalian species. At puberty, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) is activated by neuroendocrine changes in the brain. Central to this are Kiss1 neurons that produce kisspeptin, a neuropeptide which is a potent stimulator of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate region of the hypothalamus (Kiss1ARC) increase pulsatile secretion of GnRH at puberty. Other developmental maturational changes in the brain are often accompanied by neuronal plasticity changes but this has not been studied in Kiss1 neurons. Electrophysiological characterisation of Kiss1ARC neurons from female mice shows that these neurons undergo profound intrinsic plasticity at puberty with a critical window between 3 and 4 weeks. Immature Kiss1ARC neurons cannot sustain depolarisation-evoked firing for even 500 ms and instead fire a brief burst of high frequency spikes before falling silent. This would make them unsuitable for the sustained activity that is needed to activate GnRH neurons and trigger LH secretion in the HPG axis. After puberty, sustained firing can be maintained, which endows post-puberty Kiss1ARC neurons with a mature physiological phenotype that is amenable to neuropeptide modulation for generation of burst firing and pulsatile release of kisspeptin. There is a corresponding decrease in the threshold for action potential initiation, a more hyperpolarised post-spike trough and a larger medium after-hyperpolarisation (mAHP). Gene expression analysis showed a significant decrease in Scn2a (Nav1.2 channel), Kcnq2 (Kv7.2 channel) and Lrrc55 (BK channel auxiliary {gamma}3-subunit) expression and an increase in Hcn1 (hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel) expression which may contribute to the observed electrophysiological changes. Ovariectomy and {beta}-estradiol replacement defined a window of estrogen-dependent plasticity of action potential firing at puberty, such that post-puberty Kiss1ARC neurons achieve a mature physiological phenotype for activation of the HPG axis.

">Canary Mating Season Songs Move Between Order and Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Many complex behaviors involve sequences of basic motor or vocal elements governed by syntactic rules, which facilitate flexible and adaptive actions. Songbirds that crystallize their repertoire of vocal syllables and transitions allow researchers to build probabilistic models of syntax rules, providing insight into underlying neural mechanisms. However, in many complex behaviors, syntax rules change over time, such as during learning or in response to new environmental and social contexts. In this study, we investigated the songs of canaries, a seasonal songbird species. Canaries learn a repertoire of 30-50 syllable types, produce syllables in repeat phrases, and organize these phrases into sequences with long-range syntactic dependencies. Since canaries are known to adapt their repertoire annually, we recorded their songs during the spring mating season and examined the syntactic properties that determine syllable sequencing. Over days and weeks, we observed changes in syllable usage rates, syllable numbers within phrases, phrase positions in songs, and in the long-range dependencies of phrase transitions. Acoustic features of syllables were also found to shift alongside these syntactic changes. Quantifying the variability of these properties revealed that the observed changes were not random. Most birds exhibited a clear trend of moving between order and disorder in their song's syntactic and acoustic features. Interestingly, this trend varied across individuals; some birds increased their stereotypy and decreased variability across days, while others adopted more disordered and variable song structures. These findings establish canaries as a valuable animal model for studying the neural mechanisms underlying syntax rules in complex motor sequences, their plasticity in social and environmental adaptation, and in implementing individual-specific strategies.

">Differential Speed and Accuracy Trade-off in Working Memory Retrieval and Bilateral Precuneus between Older Men and Women</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite various hypotheses, including differences in longevity, hormones, genetics, and neuroanatomy, the reasons for the higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in older women compared to men remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that the precuneus, a key region of the default mode network, is linked to internally focused processes like memory retrieval. This study examined sex differences in the relationship between precuneus volumes and working memory retrieval speed in cognitively normal older adults, hypothesizing that disparities in precuneus size and function contribute to reduced working memory performance in older women. Method: A cohort of participants (N=45; 25 women; Mage =77) from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center completed the Bluegrass Working Memory Task while undergoing 3T Siemens magnetic resonance imaging scans. Result: Applying Spearman correlation analyses, the results revealed correlations between working memory accuracy and volumes in the left (r=-.43, p<.01) and right (r=-.36, p<.05) precuneus across all subjects. Sex difference analysis indicated a tendency for the accuracy of the memory task to correlate more frequently with the left precuneus in women (r= 0.54; p < 0.05) than in men. Similarly, volumes in the left precuneus displayed a significant negative correlation with reaction time in response to memory target (r = -0.426; p < 0.05) and memory distractor (r = -0.549; p < 0.01) in women. There is a sex difference in accuracy and speed trade-off. While men were faster in reaction time, women were better in the accuracy of the memory task. Particularly noteworthy was the consistent association in women, where neurocognitive measures (Trail A, r= -.50, p<.01; Trail B, r= -.06, p<.01) reliably correlated with volumes in the left precuneus--a relationship not observed in men. Discussion: Our findings suggest that the left precuneus volume is associated with processing speed and accuracy of working memory performance, especially in women. Given that the left precuneus plays a key role in supporting various aspects of cognition, including memory retrieval, our findings point to the potential of reaction time serving as a surrogate marker for fMRI in predicting cognitive decline, particularly when considering sex differences.

">Continuous cell type diversification throughout the embryonic and postnatal mouse visual cortex development</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian cortex is composed of a highly diverse set of cell types and develops through a series of temporally regulated events that build out the cell type and circuit foundation for cortical function. The mechanisms underlying the development of different cell types remain elusive. Single-cell transcriptomics provides the capacity to systematically study cell types across the entire temporal range of cortical development. Here, we present a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and epigenomic cell type atlas of the developing mouse visual cortex. The atlas was built from a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of 568,674 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes and a single-nucleus Multiome dataset of 194,545 high-quality nuclei providing both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles, densely sampled throughout the embryonic and postnatal developmental stages from E11.5 to P56. We computationally reconstructed a transcriptomic developmental trajectory map of all excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal cell types in the visual cortex, identifying branching points marking the emergence of new cell types at specific developmental ages and defining molecular signatures of cellular diversification. In addition to neurogenesis, gliogenesis and early postmitotic maturation in the embryonic stage which gives rise to all the cell classes and nearly all subclasses, we find that increasingly refined cell types emerge throughout the postnatal differentiation process, including the late emergence of many cell types during the eye-opening stage (P11-P14) and the onset of critical period (P21), suggesting continuous cell type diversification at different stages of cortical development. Throughout development, we find cooperative dynamic changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in specific cell types, identifying both chromatin peaks potentially regulating the expression of specific genes and transcription factors potentially regulating specific peaks. Furthermore, a single gene can be regulated by multiple peaks associated with different cell types and/or different developmental stages. Collectively, our study provides the most detailed dynamic molecular map directly associated with individual cell types and specific developmental events that reveals the molecular logic underlying the continuous refinement of cell type identities in the developing visual cortex.

">Leveraging Single-Cell RNA-Seq to Generate Robust Microglia Aging Clocks</a></h4>

              
                'Biological aging clocks' - composite molecular markers thought to capture an individual's biological age - have been traditionally developed through bulk-level analyses of mixed cells and tissues. However, recent evidence highlights the importance of gaining single-cell-level insights into the aging process. Microglia are key immune cells in the brain shown to adapt functionally in aging and disease. Recent studies have generated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets that transcriptionally profile microglia during aging and development. Leveraging such datasets, we develop and compare computational approaches for generating transcriptome-wide summaries to establish robust microglia aging clocks. Our results reveal that unsupervised, frequency-based featurization approaches strike a balance in accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. We further extrapolate and demonstrate applicability of such microglia clocks to readily available bulk RNA-seq data with environmental inputs. Single-cell-derived clocks can yield insights into the determinants of brain aging, ultimately promoting interventions that beneficially modulate health and disease trajectories.

">Biologically Realistic Computational Primitives of Neocortex Implemented on Neuromorphic Hardware Improve Vision Transformer Performance</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the computational principles of the brain and replicating them on neuromorphic hardware and modern deep learning architectures is crucial for advancing neuro-inspired AI (NeuroAI). Here, we develop an experimentally-constrained biophysical network model of neocortical circuit motifs, focusing on layers 2-3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBM's TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a pre-processing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning. Our approach provides a framework for translating brain-inspired computations to neuromorphic hardware, with potential applications on platforms like Intel's Loihi2 and IBM's Northpole. By integrating biophysically accurate models with neuromorphic hardware and advanced machine learning techniques, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for embedding neural computation into NeuroAI systems.

">Neural dynamics for working memory and evidence integration during olfactory navigation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                To navigate towards an unknown food source, animals must accumulate evidence about the location of a goal and store this information in working memory. Here we identify a population of local neurons in the fan-shaped body of Drosophila that exhibits both evidence integration and working memory dynamics. Imaging from these neurons during virtual odor-guided navigation reveals a bump of activity that is activated by odor, but can outlast the odor stimulus by several seconds. Persistent bump activity is associated with persistent movement in the direction adopted during odor, arguing that these neurons represent a directional working memory. When the fly navigates a virtual odor plume, bump activity slowly ramps up with successive odor encounters, indicating that it integrates odor information over time. We do not observe these dynamics in a set of neighboring local neurons, although both populations show slow modulation correlated with engagement in the task. Silencing the first population impairs the integration of odor encounters and the persistence of upwind heading. Our work identifies a small group of genetically-identified neurons that integrate and store stochastic sensory evidence to support navigation in complex natural environments.

">Genetically encoded biosensor for fluorescence lifetime imaging of PTEN dynamics in the intact brain</a></h4>

              
                The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a vital signaling protein which maintains an inhibitory brake that is critical for cellular metabolism, proliferation, and growth. The importance of PTEN signaling is evident from the broad spectrum of human pathologies associated with its loss of function. Moreover, loss or gain of PTEN function in animal models leads to aberrant cellular morphology, function, and metabolic regulation. However, despite the important role of PTEN signaling, there is currently no method to dynamically monitor its activity with cellular specificity within intact biological systems. Here, we describe the development of a novel PTEN biosensor, optimized for two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM). This biosensor is designed to measure PTEN activity within intact cells, tissues, and organisms. Our approach is based on monitoring FRET-dependent changes in PTEN conformation, which serves as a proxy for the activity state in living cells. We identify a point mutation that allow us to express this biosensor with minimal interference to endogenous PTEN signaling and cellular function. We demonstrate the utility of imaging PTEN signaling in cell lines, developing C. elegans, and in the living mouse brain. To complement this approach, we developed a red-shifted PTEN sensor variant that permits simultaneous imaging with GFP-based sensors. Finally, we use in vivo PTEN imaging in the mouse brain to identify cell-type specific dynamics of PTEN activity in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cells. In summary, our approach enables dynamic imaging of PTEN activity in vivo with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.

">A complete account of the behavioral repertoire uncovers principles of larval zebrafish hunting behavior</a></h4>

              
                In goal-directed behavior animals select actions from a diverse repertoire of possible movements. Accurately quantifying the complete behavioral repertoire can uncover the underlying rules that guide such goal-directed behavior. However, these movements are usually complex, high-dimensional, and lead to various outcomes, posing a challenge to fully capture the complete repertoire. By tracking freely hunting zebrafish larvae using a highspeed camera and analyzing their movements, we developed a mathematical model that accurately reproduces the complete repertoire. Using the model, we show that fish position and change in heading angle following a movement are coupled, such that the choice of one of them limits the possibilities of the other. This repertoire structure uncovered fundamental principles of movements, showing that fish rotate around an identified rotation point and then move forward or backward along straight lines. From the uncovered movement principles, we identified a new guiding rule for prey interaction: in each movement, fish turn to face the prey and then move forward or backward. This enables decoupling between orientation and distance selections of the fish during the hunt. These results provide a comprehensive and continuous description of the repertoire of movements, reveal underlying algorithmic rules that govern the behavior, and offer insights into the potential neural implementation of the repertoire.

">Parent-offspring brain similarity: Specificities and commonalities across gender combinations - the Transmit Radiant Individuality to Offspring (TRIO) study</a></h4>

              
                Research suggests that parent-offspring brain similarities may underlie intergenerational transmission of psychopathology. However, most studies have focused on mothers and offspring, with few including fathers. This study aimed to extend understanding of parent-offspring neural similarities by examining parent-offspring trios. The study included 152 Japanese biological parent-offspring trios who participated in the Transmit Radiant Individuality to Offspring (TRIO) study. We analyzed the parent-offspring similarities in brain structural features (cortical thickness, surface area, local gyrification index, and subcortical volume) across different parent-offspring gender combinations (father-son, father-daughter, mother-son, and mother-daughter). Additionally, we investigated the relationship between brain similarities and similarities in intelligence and personality traits in parents and offspring. Our findings confirmed that correlations in brain structural features between father-offspring or mother-offspring dyads were significantly stronger than those between unrelated individuals. Notably, both sons and daughters exhibited brain regions similar to their fathers only, mothers only, both parents, or neither parent. Furthermore, a significant association was observed between similarities in general intelligence and the surface area of auditory regions in both father-offspring and mother-offspring dyads. These results provide valuable insights into the genetic and environmental factors influencing brain development and aging across generations. This study is expected to contribute to future research elucidating the mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of psychiatric disorders.

">Gradual consolidation of skilled sequential movements in primary motor cortex of non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Expert-level performance of sequential movements can be achieved through extensive practice. The primary motor cortex (M1) is suggested to play a key role in acquiring and retaining sequential movements, with evidence of reorganization in M1 following prolonged practice, such as changes in fMRI activation in humans and altered neuron activity in monkeys. Here, we examined the timeline of plastic changes in M1 of monkeys during learning of sequential movements. A challenge in studying a role of M1 in learning is that its inactivation impairs movement, masking learning processes. To address this, we used a protein synthesis inhibitor to disrupt memory consolidation in M1 during learning. Our results show that inhibiting protein synthesis in M1 disrupted memory-guided performance at all stages of learning, though the effect decreased with continued practice. This suggests that neural traces for sequential movements are repeatedly consolidated through protein synthesis, with the rate of consolidation slowing as learning progresses.

">Neuromodulatory influences on propagation of brain waves along the unimodal-transmodal gradient</a></h4>

              
                Brain activity fluctuates over time, and understanding the factors that influence such fluctuations is important to understand the flexible nature of the brain and cognition. Growing evidence suggests that fMRI brain activity shows spatio-temporal patterns of propagation following specific gradients. In particular, activity around global peaks propagates as a travelling wave following a gradient from unimodal to associative areas. Some properties of these travelling waves seem to be related to behavioral and arousal states, however their meaning remains unknown. Here we assess the possibility that travelling waves explain the finding that there are specific time points when the brain presents larger brain integration. We reasoned that a faster speed of propagation would be related to more brain integration as measured with fMRI. Furthermore, we explored whether increased pupil-linked arousal, which has been related to more integration in specific brain regions, would be increased during periods of whole brain propagation. To test these hypotheses, we detected brain travelling waves and characterized them in terms of speed, directionality and ratio. We compared these features between different task conditions, and after a pharmacological challenge affecting neuromodulatory tone. We then studied the relation between travelling wave speed, pupil size and a graph-based measure of brain integration. Our results suggest that neuromodulatory tone affects travelling wave propagation, and that this propagation reflects changes in arousal and integrated functional connectivity features. This study provides a novel view of brain dynamics in terms of the effects of neruomodulatory influences across time scales.

                Menopause significantly impacts women's health, yet hypothalamic changes during this transition remain poorly understood. We analyzed gene expression in human hypothalamic samples across menopausal stages, revealing significant changes in inflammatory pathways, KNDy neuron signaling, and thermoregulatory genes. This analysis also identified novel central markers of menopause, including AKAP5 and CDKN1A (p21). To further investigate these changes, we developed a novel mouse model based on long-term (4 months) ovariectomy (OVX) that mimics the gonadotropin and temperature fluctuations of menopausal transition. Remarkably, the posterior hypothalamus of 4-month OVX mice closely mirrored the transcriptional changes observed in perimenopausal women. Both species exhibited increased inflammatory signaling and glial activation, alongside altered KNDy neuron activity. Our findings provide new insights into the central mechanisms of menopausal symptoms and offer a valuable preclinical model for testing interventions.

                Mental imagery is a remarkable phenomenon that allows us to remember previous experiences and imagine new ones. Animal studies have yielded rich insight into mechanisms for visual perception, but the neural mechanisms for visual imagery remain poorly understood. Here, we first determined that ~80% of visually responsive single neurons in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) used a distributed axis code to represent objects. We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that ~40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code. Our findings reveal that visual imagery is supported by reactivation of the same neurons involved in perception, providing single neuron evidence for existence of a generative model in human VTC.

">Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons induce high gamma oscillations through cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways</a></h4>

              
                Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons are an excitatory neuron class with projections to both cortex and thalamus. L6CT neurons have been reported to induce multiple effects, including the up- and down-modulation of cortical and thalamic firing rates, and the enhancement of high gamma oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) of the surrounding cortex. These recently reported oscillations offer a neuronal substrate to link recurrent thalamocortical interactions, a critical connection hinging on L6CT neurons, to high frequency oscillations, that have been implicated in several cognitive and pathological conditions. We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations induced by L6CT neurons in the cortex depend on the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice selectively expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway of awake, head-fixed mice, we presented LED ramp-and-hold inputs of different intensities while recording neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1), the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm), and the reticular nucleus (TRN) of thalamus using silicon probes. First, we confirmed that the activation of L6CT neurons induces high-frequency oscillation of S1 local field potential. These oscillations are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across LED intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the evolution over time of the firing rate of cortical neurons across layers and electrophysiologic cell classes, VPm, and TRN. While the firing rate of most cortical and TRN neurons was steadily suppressed over time, the firing rate of VPm and Layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to being facilitated within 500 ms. Using dimensionality reduction, we found that this pattern reflects two underlying components: one stable component that is represented across all units, and one evolving component that is mainly represented in VPm and in L4 FS neurons, suggestive of differential recruitment of the cortico-cortical vs cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we related the firing rate of each unit to the amplitude and frequency of S1 LFP, finding that the evolution of S1 LFP amplitude weakly correlates with all neurons, while its frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons generate high gamma oscillations in S1 LFP through a combination of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways and can sculpt its oscillation frequency through the cortico-thalamo-cortical pathway. Our findings provide a neuronal substrate for linking recurrent interactions, mediated by L6CT neurons, to the modulations of high gamma oscillations observed in several brain states and pathological conditions.

	<p>Background: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a common consequence of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV-related TBI contributes to adverse health outcomes among women, but it is unknown whether a history of IPV-related TBI negatively impacts safety outcomes following healthcare-based interventions for IPV. Methods: Using data from a larger randomized clinical trial, we explored the impact of IPV-related TBI status on safety-related outcomes in two healthcare-based IPV interventions. At baseline, 35% (n = 21) of the sample screened positive for IPV-related TBI history. We used repeated measures ANOVAs to examine differences in safety outcomes at post-treatment and 1-month follow-up based on treatment condition and IPV-related TBI status. Results: Significant interaction effects were found for safety outcomes, such that women with IPV-related TBI history experienced larger reductions in the frequency of physical IPV and similar reductions in sexual IPV across both treatment conditions compared to women without IPV-TBI (F(2, 102) = 10.88, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; F(2, 98) = 3.93, p = 0.036). Conclusions:&amp;amp;nbsp;Findings suggest that brief healthcare-based IPV interventions may result in improvements in safety outcomes for women with a history of IPV-TBI. This highlights the continued need for implementation of promising IPV-focused interventions to promote safety and protect women from experiencing further IPV.</p>

	<p>We used numerical methods to define the normative structure of the different stages of sleep and wake (W) in a pilot study of 19 participants without pathology (18&amp;amp;ndash;64 years old) using a double-banana bipolar montage. Artefact-free 120&amp;amp;ndash;240 s epoch lengths were visually identified and divided into 1 s windows with a 10% overlap. Differential channels were grouped into frontal, parieto-occipital, and temporal lobes. For every channel, the power spectrum (PS) was calculated via fast Fourier transform and used to compute the areas for the delta (0&amp;amp;ndash;4 Hz), theta (4&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz), alpha (8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz), and beta (13&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz) bands, which were log-transformed. Furthermore, Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation coefficient and coherence by bands were computed. Differences in logPS and synchronization from the whole scalp were observed between the sexes for specific stages. However, these differences vanished when specific lobes were considered. Considering the location and stages, the logPS and synchronization vary highly and specifically in a complex manner. Furthermore, the average spectra for every channel and stage were very well defined, with phase-specific features (e.g., the sigma band during N2 and N3, or the occipital alpha component during wakefulness), although the slow alpha component (8.0&amp;amp;ndash;8.5 Hz) persisted during NREM and REM sleep. The average spectra were symmetric between hemispheres. The properties of K-complexes and the sigma band (mainly due to sleep spindles&amp;amp;mdash;SSs) were deeply analyzed during the NREM N2 stage. The properties of the sigma band are directly related to the density of SSs. The average frequency of SSs in the frontal lobe was lower than that in the occipital lobe. In approximately 30% of the participants, SSs showed bimodal components in the anterior regions. qEEG can be easily and reliably used to study sleep in healthy participants and patients.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Topographical projection patterns from the entorhinal cortex to area CA1 of the hippocampus have led to a hypothesis that proximal CA1 (pCA1, closer to CA2) is spatially more selective than distal CA1 (dCA1, closer to the subiculum). While earlier studies have shown evidence supporting this hypothesis, we recently showed that this difference does not hold true under all experimental conditions. In a complex environment with distinct local texture cues on a circular track and global visual cues, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable spatial selectivity. Correlated with the spatial selectivity differences, the earlier studies also showed differences in theta phase coding dynamics between pCA1 and dCA1 neurons. Here we show that there are no differences in theta phase coding dynamics between neurons in these two regions under the experimental conditions where pCA1 and dCA1 neurons are equally spatially selective. These findings challenge the established notion of dCA1 being inherently less spatially selective and theta modulated than pCA1 and suggest further experiments to understand theta-mediated activation of the CA1 sub-networks to represent space.</p>

<p>Treatment-resistant depression was particularly associated with the functional dysconnectivity of the thalamus with the insula and superior temporal cortex, as well as the anterior paracingulate cortex and cerebellum crus II.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Thalamocortical connectivity is associated with cognitive and affective processing. The role of thalamocortical connectivity in the pathomechanism of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unclear. This study included 48 patients with TRD and 48 healthy individuals. We investigated thalamocortical connectivity by performing resting-state functional MRI with the bilateral thalamus as the seed. In addition, patients with TRD were evaluated using the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Compared with the healthy individuals, the patients with TRD exhibited increased functional connectivity (FC) of the thalamus with the insula and superior temporal cortex and reduced the FC of the thalamus with the anterior paracingulate cortex and cerebellum crus II. Our study may support the crucial role of thalamocortical dysconnectivity in the TRD pathomechanism. However, the small sample size may limit the statistical power. A future study with a large sample size of patients with TRD would be required to validate our findings.</p>

">Adult lifespan effects on functional specialization along the hippocampal long axis</a></h4>

              
                There has been increasing attention to differences in function along the hippocampal long axis, with posterior regions proposed to have properties that are well suited to representing fine-grained details and coarser representations in anterior regions. Whether long axis functional specialization persists into older age is not known, despite well documented memory changes in older age. In this study, we used a large database of fMRI data (n =323 humans of both sexes included) from across the adult lifespan (ages 18-88) to determine the degree of functional differentiation across the hippocampal posterior-anterior axis. Our first approach was to measure the similarity among signals within each hippocampal subregion. We found that intra-region signals within the most posterior hippocampal subregion became more similar in older age, but did not relate to episodic memory performance. As a second approach, we measured functional connectivity between hippocampal subregions and the rest of the brain. The functional connectivity profiles of the posterior and anterior hippocampal subregions became more distinct from one another with increasing age, and age-related reductions in connectivity were strongest for the intermediate portion of the hippocampus. In contrast, anterior hippocampal functional connectivity remained relatively stable across the adult lifespan, and stronger anterior hippocampus connectivity with the anterior cingulate was associated with better episodic memory in older adults, suggesting that the anterior hippocampus may help some older adults compensate for age-related changes to more posterior hippocampal regions to preserve episodic memory.

">Human and Mouse Models for Kabuki Syndrome Reveal Increase in Inhibitory Synapse Development.</a></h4>

              
                Intellectual disability, affecting 2-3% of the general population, often coincides with neurodevelopmental disorders and is frequently caused by mutations that impair synaptic function. Kabuki syndrome, a rare multisystem disorder associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, results from mutations in either KMT2D (type 1) or KDM6A (type 2), which encode a chromatin-modifying methyltransferase and demethylase, respectively. However, the mechanisms contributing to intellectual disability in Kabuki syndrome remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated synapse development in neurons using both in vitro human models of Kabuki syndrome types 1 and 2, as well as an in vivo mouse model of Kabuki syndrome type 1. Our findings revealed that both mature human iPSC-derived neurons and mice harboring disease-causing mutations exhibited increased inhibitory synapse development. This synaptic imbalance led to impaired excitatory information transfer within neural networks, which may underlie the cognitive deficits observed in Kabuki syndrome.

">Human gray matter microstructure mapped using Neurite Exchange Imaging (NEXI) on a clinical scanner</a></h4>

              
                Biophysical models of diffusion in gray matter (GM) can provide unique information about microstructure of the human brain, in health and disease. Therefore, their compatibility with clinical settings is key. Neurite Exchange Imaging (NEXI) is a two-compartment model of GM microstructure that accounts for inter-compartment exchange, whose parameter estimation requires multi-shell multi-diffusion time data. In this work, we report the first estimates of NEXI in human cortex obtained on a clinical MRI scanner. To do that, we establish an acquisition protocol and fitting routine compatible with clinical scanners. The model signal equation can be expressed either in the narrow-pulse approximation, NEXINPA, or accounting for the actual width of the diffusion gradient pulses, NEXIWP. While NEXINPA enables a faster analytical fit and is a valid approximation for data acquired on high-performance gradient systems (preclinical and Connectom scanners), on which NEXI was first implemented, NEXIWP has significant relevance for data acquired on clinical scanners with longer gradient pulses. We establish that, in the context of broad pulses, NEXIWP estimates were more comparable to previous literature values. Furthermore, we evaluate the repeatability of NEXI estimates in the human cortex on a clinical MRI scanner and show intra-subject variability to be lower than inter-subject variability, which is promising for characterizing healthy and patient cohorts. Finally, we analyze the relationship of NEXI parameters on the cortical surface to the Myelin Water Fraction (MWF), estimated using an established multicomponent T2 relaxation technique. Indeed, although it is present in small quantities in the cortex, myelin can be expected to decrease permeability. We confirm a strong correlation between the exchange time (tex) estimates and the MWF, although the spatial correspondence between the two is brain-region specific and other drivers of tex than myelin density are likely at play.

">Early auditory and adult mating experiences interact with singer identity to shape neural responses to song in female zebra finches</a></h4>

              
                Social and sensory experiences across the lifespan can shape social interactions, however, experience-dependent plasticity is widely studied within discrete life stages. In the socially monogamous zebra finch, in which females use learned vocal signals to identify individuals and form long-lasting pair bonds, developmental exposure to song is key for females to show species-typical song perception and preferences. While adult mating experience can still lead to pair-bonding and song preference learning even in birds with limited previous song exposure ("song-naive"), whether similarities in adult behavioral plasticity between normally-reared and song-naive females reflect convergent patterns of neural activity is unknown. We investigated this using expression of a marker of neural activity and plasticity (phosphorylated S6) in mated normally-reared and song-naive females in response to song from either their mate, a neighbor, or an unfamiliar male. We found that in portions of a secondary auditory region (the caudomedial nidopallium NCM) and in dopaminergic neurons of the caudal ventral tegmental area hearing the mate's song significantly increased pS6 expression in females from both rearing conditions. In contrast, within other NCM subregions, song-identity drove different patterns of pS6 expression depending on the rearing condition. These data suggest that developmental experiences can have long-lasting impacts on the neural signatures of behaviors acquired in adulthood and that socially-driven behavioral plasticity in adults may arise through both shared and divergent neural circuits depending on an individual's developmental experiences.

                A six nucleotide repeat expansion in intron-1 of the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic mutation affecting individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia. Bi-directional transcription of the repeat expansion generates sense and antisense repeat RNAs that can then be translated in all reading frames to produce six distinct dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins with unique termini. The precise site of translation initiation of these proteins within the C9ORF72 repeat expansion remains elusive. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to investigate the contribution of different AUG codons in the antisense repeat RNA to the production of DPR proteins, poly(GP) and poly(PR) in C9ORF72 expansion carrier motor neurons and lymphoblast cells. We then utilized ASOs targeting C9ORF72 sense repeat RNA to examine whether sense or antisense RNA is the major source of the poly(GP) protein - a question for which conflicting evidence exists. We found that these ASOs reduced the intended sense RNA target, but also the antisense RNA, thus preventing the production of poly(PR). Our data highlights the importance of the sequences preceding the antisense CCCCGG repeat expansion for the synthesis of antisense DPR proteins and supports the use of sense C9ORF72 ASOs to prevent the accumulation of both sense- and antisense-dependent DPR proteins in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD.

">Superior colliculus projections drive dopamine neuron activity and movement but not value</a></h4>

              
                To navigate complex environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are key for creating and maintaining associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict, through Pavlovian learning. However, it remains unclear how relevant sensory information is integrated into dopamine (DA) pathways to guide exploration and learning. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is anatomically positioned as a relay for rapid sensory augmentation of dopamine neurons, which could underlie the formation of Pavlovian associations. Here, we characterize the anatomical organization and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA and SNc in rats. First, using anatomical tracing techniques, we show that neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing directly with neurons projecting to the striatum and ventral pallidum. Using fiber photometry, we find that these SC projections excite both dopamine and GABA neurons in the VTA and dopamine neurons in the SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC terminal stimulation did not reliably evoke behavior on their own in an optogenetic Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. Further, optogenetic activation of SC terminals in the VTA/SNc did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference or avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC terminals in the VTA and SNc reliably evoked head turning behavior. This body reorientation increased in intensity with repeated stimulations, suggesting that strengthening this circuit could underlie sensorimotor learning related to exploration and attentional bias. Together our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided learning by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with dopamine systems.

">Impact of Optogenetic Activation of the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus on Sleep Architecture in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide and is often accompanied by significant sleep disturbances, such as sleep fragmentation, early awakenings, decreased sleep efficiency, and insomnia. It has been suggested that the alterations in activity of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) are closely associated with sleep disruptions in AD. Evidence suggests that activating neurons expressing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the TRN may enhance sleep quality and potentially ameliorate neuropathology associated with AD. However, the precise mechanisms through which TRN influences sleep disruptions and AD pathophysiology remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether activating GABAergic TRN neurons could alter sleep architecture in wild-type mice. Utilizing optogenetic stimulation, we observed that activation of these neurons did not significantly alter sleep state durations or delta wave power, a key indicator of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS). Furthermore, the application of a two-virus strategy inadvertently led to non-specific opsin expression beyond the targeted TRN area. We discuss the potential factors that contributed to these outcomes, providing directions for future investigations to better delineate the role of the TRN in sleep and AD.

">Investigation of cellular and molecular changes linked with neuropathic pain in healthy and injured human trigeminal nerves</a></h4>

              
                Injuries to the trigeminal nerve, responsible for sensory innervation to the face, may occur during routine dental procedures, resulting in the formation of a neuroma accompanied by loss of sensation and/or symptoms of pain. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning the sensory changes, single nuclei RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics were employed to profile the transcriptional landscape at single cell resolution of human trigeminal nerves and neuromas. Cellular and transcriptional changes were identified that correlated with the presence of pain, including an expansion of endothelial cells with a pro-inflammatory phenotype and over-expression of HLA-A, CXCL2 and CXCL8. Interactome analysis highlighted signalling changes linked with the presence of pain. HLA-A protein expression was confirmed in neuromas and positively correlated with symptoms of pain. The atlas generated represents a valuable resource for pain research, highlighting the role of inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction and chemokine signalling in neuropathic pain.

">A preprocessing toolbox for 2-photon subcellular calcium imaging</a></h4>

              
                Recording the spiking activity from subcellular compartments of neurons such as axons and dendrites during behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging is increasingly common yet remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise, inaccurate region-of-interest (ROI) identification, movement artifacts, and difficulty in grouping ROIs from the same neuron. To address these issues, we present a computationally efficient pre-processing pipeline for subcellular signal detection, movement artifact identification, and ROI grouping. For subcellular signal detection, we capture the frequency profile of calcium transient dynamics by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on smoothed time-series calcium traces collected from axon ROIs. We then apply band-pass filtering methods (e.g. 0.05 to 0.12 Hz) to select ROIs that contain frequencies that match the power band of transients. To remove motion artifacts from z-plane movement, we apply Principal Component Analysis on all calcium traces and use a Bottom-Up Segmentation change-point detection model on the first principal component. After removing movement artifacts, we further identify calcium transients from noise by analyzing their prominence and duration. Finally, ROIs with high activity correlation are grouped using hierarchical or k-means clustering. Using axon ROIs in the CA1 region, we confirm that both clustering methods effectively determine the optimal number of clusters in pairwise correlation matrices, yielding similar groupings to "ground truth" data. Our approach provides a guideline for standardizing the extraction of physiological signals from subcellular compartments during behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging.

">Dynamic Models of Neural Population Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) increase the hope that AI can provide a powerful tool to facilitate scientific discovery and to generate and validate new ideas for scientific research autonomously. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Their potential extends beyond simple language tasks, offering transformative possibilities in scientific research of all fields. By leveraging vast amounts of data and advanced computational power, LLMs can assist researchers in generating novel ideas, automating routine tasks, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. On September 12, 2024, OpenAI released their updated generative artificial intelligence system called ChatGPTo1. This new AI system, built upon chain-of-thought and reinforcement learning, has greatly enhanced logical reasoning abilities and can effectively solve various complex problems from elementary-level mathematical problems to modern scientific research issues in physics, chemistry, and biology. Unlike previous LLMs in which logical reasoning and data analysis abilities are developed through training on actual data, ChatGPTo1 logical reasoning ability and capacity to generate new scientific ideas are primarily acquired through chain-of-thought processes and reinforcement learning rather than pre-training. To examine this, we specifically tested ChatGPTo1 current reasoning and scientific discovery capabilities by developing theoretically complex and quantitatively challenging scientific equations in various fields of neuroscience, such as dynamical systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, dynamical systems on differential manifolds, neural field theory, nonlinear divergence theorems, nonlinear heat conduction equations and Laplace equations and their extensions on differential manifolds, nonlinear statistical analysis methods, deep learning, and other topics involving multiple fields. The current large language models may illustrate a certain degree of general intelligence, even if fundamentally it may be different from human intelligence. However, it does not mean the current LLMs can fully apply such ability in practical applications or that their reasoning potential can be fully tapped. It is essential to explore specific pathways and methods to cultivate their potential for scientific discovery. To accomplish this, we consider how to integrate them with common search engines (such as Google) capabilities and ChatGPT4o cross-modal abilities to better understand new disciplines and scientific discoveries. To this point, the major shortcoming of ChatGPTo1 is that it is not an end-to-end scientific discovery method and lacks the ability to achieve full automation. It also lacks methods for image analysis and full-scale data analysis, making it difficult to use simulation and data analysis to evaluate and test proposed new theories and methods.

">Automated, Stress-Free, and Precise Measurement of Songbird Weight in Neuroscience Experiments</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring the health and well-being of research animals is essential for both ethical and scientific purposes. In songbirds, body weight is one of the main indicators for their overall condition, yet traditional weighing methods can be intrusive and stress-inducing, which could decrease their song rate. We developed a novel, automated system designed to continuously monitor the weight of untethered and tethered birds without disrupting their natural behavior in neuroscience experiments. We used the system to track weight fluctuations in six canaries over several weeks, revealing physiological patterns such as overnight weight loss, with one bird losing approximately 5.17% of its body weight during a 9.5-hour period of inactivity. Our system's high sensitivity detected weight changes below 1% of body mass, validating its reliability for long-term studies. Control experiments confirmed that weight fluctuations observed were physiological rather than due to equipment deviations. By eliminating the need for manual handling, this system offers a non-invasive, hands-free approach that reduces stress and improves the accuracy of health assessments. This study demonstrates the system's potential for expanding research on how environmental factors, diet, and other variables influence bird physiology and behavior. Future applications could integrate additional health metrics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of animal welfare in neuroscience and behavioral studies.

">Heterogeneous distribution of inhibitory inputs among motor units as a key mechanism for motor adaptations to pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain significantly influences movement, yet the precise neural mechanisms underlying the wide range of observed motor adaptations remain unclear. This study combined experimental data and in silico models to investigate the contribution of inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs to motor unit behaviour during submaximal contractions performed in the presence of pain. Specifically, we aimed to unravel the distribution pattern of inhibitory inputs to the motor unit pool. Seventeen participants performed isometric knee extension tasks under three conditions: Control, Pain (induced by injecting hypertonic saline into the infra-patellar fat pad), and Washout. We identified large samples of motor units in the vastus lateralis (up to 53/participant) from high-density electromyographic signals, which led to three key observations. First, while motor unit discharge rates significantly decreased during Pain, a substantial proportion of motor units (14.8-24.8%) did not show this decrease and, in some cases, even exhibited an increase. Second, using complementary approaches we showed that pain did not alter the amplification and prolongation effects of persistent inward currents on motor unit discharge, providing evidence that neuromodulatory drive to motor neurons remained unchanged. Third, we observed a significant reduction in the proportion of common inputs to motor units during Pain. To explore potential neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these experimental results, we simulated the behaviour of motor unit pools with varying distribution patterns of inhibitory inputs. Our simulation supports the hypothesis of a non-homogeneous distribution of inhibitory inputs, independent of motor unit size, as a key neural mechanism underlying motor adaptations to experimental pain.

">Representation of Verbal Thought in Motor Cortex and Implications for Speech Neuroprostheses</a></h4>

              
                Speech brain-computer interfaces show great promise in restoring communication for people who can no longer speak, but have also raised privacy concerns regarding their potential to decode private verbal thought. Using multi-unit recordings in three participants with dysarthria, we studied the representation of inner speech in the motor cortex. We found a robust neural encoding of inner speech, such that individual words and continuously imagined sentences could be decoded in real-time This neural representation was highly correlated with overt and perceived speech. We investigated the possibility of "eavesdropping" on private verbal thought, and demonstrated that verbal memory can be decoded during a non-speech task. Nevertheless, we found a neural "overtness" dimension that can help to avoid any unintentional decoding. Together, these results demonstrate the strong representation of verbal thought in the motor cortex, and highlight important design considerations and risks that must be addressed as speech neuroprostheses become more widespread.

">Subcortical Hubs of Brain Networks Sustaining Human Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation of subcortical network hubs by pharmacologic, electrical, or ultrasonic stimulation is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). However, optimal subcortical targets for therapeutic stimulation are not well established. Here, we leveraged 7 Tesla resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from 168 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project to map the subcortical connectivity of six canonical cortical networks that modulate higher-order cognition and function: the default mode, executive control, salience, dorsal attention, visual, and somatomotor networks. Based on spatiotemporally overlapped networks generated by the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition method, our goal was to identify subcortical hubs that are functionally connected to multiple cortical networks. We found that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain and the central lateral (CL) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei of the thalamus - regions that have historically been targeted by neuromodulatory therapies to restore consciousness - are subcortical hubs widely connected to multiple cortical networks. Further, we identified a subcortical hub in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum that overlapped with multiple reticular and extrareticular arousal nuclei and that encompassed a well-established "hot spot" for coma-causing brainstem lesions. Multiple hubs within the brainstem arousal nuclei and thalamic intralaminar nuclei were functionally connected to both the DMN and SN, emphasizing the importance of these cortical networks in integrative subcortico-cortical signaling. Additional subcortical connectivity hubs were observed within the caudate head, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, regions classically associated with modulation of cognition, behavior, and sensorimotor function. Collectively, these results suggest that multiple subcortical hubs in the brainstem tegmentum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe modulate cortical function in the human brain. Our findings strengthen the evidence for targeting subcortical hubs in the ventral tegmental area, central lateral thalamus, and pontomesencephalic tegmentum to restore consciousness in patients with DoC. We release all subcortical connectivity maps to support ongoing efforts at therapeutic neuromodulation of consciousness.

">Brain-like neural dynamics for behavioral control develop through reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                During development, neural circuits are shaped continuously as we learn to control our bodies. The ultimate goal of this process is to produce neural dynamics that enable the rich repertoire of behaviors we perform with our limbs. What begins as a series of "babbles" coalesces into skilled motor output as the brain rapidly learns to control the body. However, the nature of the teaching signal underlying this normative learning process remains elusive. Here, we test two well-established and biologically plausible theories-supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL)-that could explain how neural circuits develop the capacity for skilled movements. We trained recurrent neural networks to control a biomechanical model of a primate arm using either SL or RL and compared the resulting neural dynamics to populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex of monkeys performing the same movements. Intriguingly, only RL-trained networks produced neural activity that matched their biological counterparts in terms of both the geometry and dynamics of population activity. We show that the similarity between RL-trained networks and biological brains depends critically on matching biomechanical properties of the limb. We then demonstrated that monkeys and RL-trained networks, but not SL-trained networks, show a strikingly similar capacity for robust short-term behavioral adaptation to a movement perturbation, indicating a fundamental and general commonality in the neural control policy. Together, our results support the hypothesis that neural dynamics for behavioral control emerge through a process akin to reinforcement learning. The resulting neural circuits offer numerous advantages for adaptable behavioral control over simpler and more efficient learning rules and expand our understanding of how developmental processes shape neural dynamics.

	<p>Background: Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) remains a complex neurosurgical condition with ongoing debate regarding its optimal management. Methods: This narrative review examines key controversies surrounding the pathophysiology, surgical indications, and treatment strategies for CM1. Results: We highlight the challenges posed by the wide spectrum of CM variants and the evolving understanding of its association with syringomyelia, basilar invagination, and craniovertebral instability. Emerging surgical techniques, including minimally invasive approaches and the use of new technologies such as endoscopes and exoscopes, are evaluated for their potential to improve outcomes. Recent consensus guidelines are also discussed. Conclusions: The need for individualized treatment plans for CM1 is emphasized, with special focus put on the connection between novel pathophysiological insights, technological advancements and opportunities for a more nuanced surgical management. Further research is necessary to establish solid foundations for more individualized treatments.</p>

                <p>Ischemic stroke (IS) poses a serious threat to patient survival. The inhibition of ferroptosis can effectively alleviate ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, suggesting potential targets in the ferroptosis pathway for the treatment of IS. In this study, MCAO/R mice and OGD/R-induced HT22 cell were constructed. It was found that baicalein decreased ROS, MDA, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels, upregulated GSH levels, and enhanced the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins (GPX4 and SLC7A11), downregulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins (Bax, cytochrome <I>c</I>, and cleaved caspase-3), and upregulated the expression of an antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2), ameliorating cerebral I/R injury. In animal and cell models, Sirtuin6 (SIRT6) is downregulated, and Forkhead boxA2 (FOXA2) expression and acetylation levels are abnormally upregulated. SIRT6 inhibited FOXA2 expression and acetylation. Baicalein promoted FOXA2 deacetylation by upregulating SIRT6 expression. FOXA2 transcriptionally inhibits SLC7A11 expression. In conclusion, baicalein inhibited apoptosis and partially suppressed the role of ferroptosis to alleviate cerebral I/R injury via SIRT6-mediated FOXA2 deacetylation to promote SLC7A11 expression.</p>

                <p>This article allows readers to assess their ability to detect errors in thinking in seven case histories of psychologists&rsquo; thoughts about cognitive science. It explains the nature of the errors and shows that some of them reflect faulty reasoning. It presents a "model method" to improve reasoning. It is based on the theory of mental models, which gives a general account of how individuals think, both deductively and indicatively, and which postulates that individuals construct mental models of possibilities in the world. The model method enhances both the accuracy and speed of reasoning. The article concludes with some general reflections on the role of knowledge of meanings, the world, and context in thinking.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1134/v1?src=rss">Searching for non-English literature may be unnecessary for HTA Reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Health technology assessment (HTA) reports are based on comprehensive information retrieval. Current standards discourage the use of search restrictions, such as publication date and language. Given limited resources, it was unclear whether the effort invested in screening and translating studies published in languages other than English provided relevant additional information compared with the inclusion of English-language publications alone. We therefore analysed the impact of non-English publications on the conclusions of HTA reports produced by the German HTA agency, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Methods We determined whether non-English publications were included in all HTA reports on non-drug interventions and on selected drug interventions (search period: 01/2011 to 08/2018). If at least one non-English publication was included, we assessed for each endpoint whether or not the exclusion of non-English publications changed the conclusion. If a non-English publication did not contain information relevant to the HTA report, we classified the publication as “not relevant”. Results Of 70 HTA reports, 38 (54%) included 128 non-English publications. In 4 reports (6%) with 50 endpoints investigated in 39 PICO questions, the exclusion of a total of 10 non-English publications led to a change in the conclusions for 13 endpoints (8 PICO questions). This was largely due to the fact that in many cases, non-English publications were the predominant or only literature available, resulting in a lack of analysable data after their exclusion. Conclusions In general, studies published in non-English languages have little influence on the conclusions of HTA reports. For the vast majority of topics, a language restriction to English seems justified. Studies published in non-English languages may be useful in exceptional cases, for example when an intervention is only available in certain countries.

                Background Fluoride-releasing adhesives in orthodontics help protect enamel. The study compared the fluoride release, recharge, and re-release properties of three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives: Group A: TransbondTM Plus Color Change, Group B: Waldent Orthobond LC, and Group C: Koden EZ Bond. Methods The study conducted an in-vitro investigation using 24 maxillary first premolar teeth bonded with one of three fluoride-releasing adhesives after etching. Each sample was placed in artificial saliva, and fluoride release was measured over 60 days using a fluoride electrode. After initial release measurement, specimens were soaked in 1000 ppm fluoride solution for 5 minutes, rinsed, and placed in new containers with distilled water before re-release measurements. Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA tests were used to determine significance, with the Bonferroni posthoc test for further analysis. Results The fluoride release rate decreased gradually over time for all three groups. The highest fluoride release occurred on Day 1 for all three bonding agents, with a significantly reduced fluoride release by Day 2. Group A exhibited consistent and highest overall fluoride release throughout the 60 days. Group B gradually declined to release fluoride until Day 7, releasing the least fluoride throughout the study. Group C had a higher fluoride release on Day 1 and Day 2 but slowly declined until Day 14. Group B and Group C sharply declined fluoride release by Day 30 and almost negligible amounts on Day 60. All three agents noted enhanced fluoride release post-recharge, with continuous release until day 14. Greater release on days 7 and 14 compared to the initial release in all three groups. Conclusion Transbond Plus Color Change: Consistent high fluoride was released initially and post-recharge. Waldent Orthobond LC: Lower release throughout the study. Koden EZ Bond: High initial release and post-recharge but continuing to decrease until Day 14.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-601/v2?src=rss">A Case Study on Assessing AI Assistant Competence in Narrative Interviews [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Researchers are leading the development of AI designed to conduct interviews. These developments imply that AI's role is expanding from mere data analysis to becoming a tool for social researchers to interact with and comprehend their subjects. Yet, academic discussions have not addressed the potential impacts of AI on narrative interviews. In narrative interviews, the method of collecting data is a collaborative effort. The interviewer also contributes to exploring and shaping the interviewee's story. A compelling narrative interviewer has to display critical skills, such as maintaining a specific questioning order, showing empathy, and helping participants delve into and build their own stories. Methods This case study configured an OpenAI Assistant on WhatsApp to conduct narrative interviews with a human participant. The participant shared the same story in two distinct conversations: first, following a standard cycle and answering questions earnestly, and second, deliberately sidetracking the assistant from the main interview path as instructed by the researcher, to test how well the metrics could reflect the deliberate differences between different conversations. The AI's performance was evaluated through conversation analysis and specific narrative indicators, focusing on its adherence to the interview structure, empathy, narrative coherence, complexity, and support for human participant agency. The study sought to answer these questions: 1) How can the proposed metrics help us, as social researchers without a technical background, understand the quality of the AI-driven interviews in this study? 2) What do these findings contribute to our discussion on using AI in narrative interviews for social research? 3) What further research could these results inspire? Results The findings show to what extent the AI maintained structure and adaptability in conversations, illustrating its potential to support personalized, flexible narrative interviews based on specific needs. Conclusions These results suggest that social researchers without a technical background can use observation-based metrics to gauge how well an AI assistant conducts narrative interviews. They also prompt reflection on AI's role in narrative interviews and spark further research.

                Background The intensity and frequency of climate extremes are exacerbating agricultural droughts, particularly impacting smallholder farming. This study assessing daily precipitation and temperature extremes in the context of climate change is crucial for local-scale climate change adaptation. Spatial changes of climate indices from 1981 to 2018 in three different agroecologies in the Hamassa watershed, Ethiopia, were examined based on the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Methods We obtained Daily temperature and precipitation data from the Ethiopia National Meteorological Agency (NMA). Additionally, I used data from focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) to corroborate the findings. We conducted the Mann- Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimation to assess the significance and magnitude of rainfall and extreme temperature changes in the watershed between 1981 and 2018. Furthermore, I examined the correlation between crop and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Results The temperature data indicated that the warming condition is increasing overall agroecologies. However, the extreme indices from rainfall data indicate insignificant positive and negative trends in all agroecological zones (AEZs). The warmest day (Txx) is significantly increasing overall AEZs having magnitude values close to each other, 0.0420c, 0.03960c, and 0.03850c in the highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. The coldest day (Txn) also showed an increasing insignificant and significant trend in the highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. Results of cool days (TX10p) indicate a significant decreasing trend over all three AEZs. The magnitude of the decreasing trend is about -0.040c, -0.0450c, and -0.0360c in highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation result indicated a strong and significant relationship between crop production and climate variables (SPEI-), which varied degrees across Conclusions Results differ in different agroecologies demanding technical, institutional, and policy responses respective of Agroecologies.

                Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword “liquefaction” emerges as the most popular term in these publications.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002826">Reviving collapsed plant–pollinator networks from a single species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gaurav Baruah, Meike Wittmann</p>

Mutualistic ecological networks can suddenly transition to undesirable states due to small changes in environmental conditions. Recovering from such a collapse can be difficult as restoring the original environmental conditions may be infeasible. Additionally, such networks can also exhibit a phenomenon known as hysteresis, whereby the system could exhibit multiple states under the same environmental conditions, implying that ecological networks may not recover. Here, we attempted to revive collapsed mutualistic networks to a high-functioning state from a single species, using concepts from signal propagation theory and an eco-evolutionary model based on network structures of 115 empirical plant–pollinator networks. We found that restoring the environmental conditions rarely aided in recovery of collapsed networks, but a positive relationship between recovering pollinator density and network nestedness emerged, which was qualitatively supported by empirical plant–pollinator restoration data. In contrast, network resurrection from a collapsed state in undesirable environmental conditions where restoration has minimal impacts could be readily achieved by perturbing a single species or a few species that controls the response of the dynamical networks. Additionally, nestedness in networks and a moderate amount of trait variation could aid in the revival of networks even in undesirable environmental conditions. Our work suggests that focus should be applied to a few species whose dynamics could be steered to resurrect entire networks from a collapsed state and that network architecture could play a crucial role in reviving collapsed plant–pollinator networks.

                Invasive plant species pose ecological threats to native ecosystems, particularly in areas adjacent to roadways, considering that roadways represent lengthy corridors through which invasive species can propagate. Traditional manual survey methods for monitoring invasive plants are labor-intensive and limited in coverage. This paper introduces a high-speed camera system, named CamAlien, designed to be mounted on vehicles for efficient invasive plant species monitoring along roadways. The camera system captures high-quality images at rapid intervals, to monitor the full roadside when following traffic speed. The system utilizes a global shutter sensor to reduce distortion and geotagging for precise localistion. The camera system makes it possible to collect extensive data sets, which can be used for a digital library of the invasive species and their locations, but also subsequent training of machine learning algorithms for automated species recognition.

                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida and other closely related genera, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 yeast Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Pichia fermentans (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Pichia kudriavzevii (24.4%), Kluyveromyces marxianus (22.2%), Clavispora lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Meyerozyma guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, together with the intrinsically resistant P. kudriavzevii, most isolates of P. fermentans, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                Introduction and Importance Cornual pregnancy (CP) is a rare and dangerous type of ectopic pregnancy, occurring in 2% to 4% of cases. Due to its atypical location in the uterine horn, it poses a high risk for severe complications, such as rupture of the uterus, and life-threatening bleeding, particularly when diagnosis is delayed. Case Presentation We report the case of a 35-year-old female patient presenting with severe pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding, with 12 weeks of amenorrhea. Clinical evaluation revealed elevated β-HCG levels and transvaginal ultrasound showed a 7-week unruptured right cornual pregnancy. Surgical management involved a mini-laparotomy, which confirmed the diagnosis and a cornuostomy along with a right salpingectomy was performed. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and follow-up confirmed complete recovery. Clinical Discussion Cornual pregnancies, though rare, carry a significant risk of serious complications and maternal death due to delayed diagnosis. Risk factors encompass a history of miscarriage, elective abortion, sexually transmitted infections, and smoking, all contributing to abnormal implantation. Early diagnosis is challenging but crucial, with ultrasound being key for detection. Management depends on gestational age, patient stability, and future reproductive plans, with methotrexate or surgical intervention being standard options. Conclusion Cornual pregnancy, despite its rarity, demands prompt and accurate diagnosis to prevent catastrophic outcomes. This case underscores the need for individualized treatment strategies and highlights the importance of early intervention. Ongoing research is vital to improving diagnostic approaches and therapeutic outcomes.

                Background Free radical attacks have been implicated in the aetiology of many diseases and several plants are used traditionally for the management of many oxidative-stress related diseases. Khaya senegalensis is used traditionally for the management diseases such as diabetes and for the treatment of infections. However, mechanisms underlying actions of K. senegalensis are poorly understood. Purpose This study aimed at the preliminary determination of the phytochemical constituents and investigation of the antioxidative and hepatoprotective actions of K. senegalensis in acetaminophen-treated rats. Method Aqueous extracts of K. senegalensis were screened for the presence of key phytochemicals. Total flavonoid and phenolic contents were quantified. Wistar albino rats were pre-treated with saline (control) or graded concentrations of K. senegalensis (50 – 200mg/kgbw) for 10 days prior to acetaminophen (2g/kg body weight) administration. Serum levels of vitamin C, thiobarbituric reactive substances, catalase activities, enzyme markers of liver function were assessed. Cholesterol-phospholipid ratio in treated-rats were determined. Results K. senegalensis extract showed the presence of saponins, tannins, cardiac glycosides, alkaloids, flavonoids and phenolic compounds. Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were determined as 57.14±0.85mgQE/g and 51.72±0.77mgGE/g. Acetaminophen (2g/kg bw) raised serum TBARS (4.7-fold, P<0.001), H2O2 levels (2.3-fold, P<0.001), AST (5.9-fold, P<0.001), ALT (6.6-fold, P<0.001) and ALP (4.2-fold, P<0.001) and reduced serum levels of vitamin C (54%, P<0.001) and catalase activity (74.6%, P<0.001). Treatment of K. senegalensis extracts inhibited effects of acetaminophen on TBARS (18.2% - 46.4%, P<0.05 – 0.001), vitamin C (1.4 – 1.8-fold, P<0.001 – 0.05), H2O2 levels (19.1 – 50.1%, P<0.001-0.05), catalase activities (1.4 – 3.1-fold, P<0.001 – 0.05), AST (27.7 – 62.8%, P<0.001 – 0.05), ALT (35.6 – 57.5%, P<0.001 – 0.05) and ALP (15.9 – 46.2%, P<0.01 – 0.05). The extract reduced cholesterol-phospholipid ratio (21 – 31%, P<0.05). Conclusion These results motivate further development of the therapeutic potential of K. senegalensis

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1128/v1?src=rss">Fostering healthcare system sustainability through efficient practices: Can adopting biosimilars ease the financial burden of rheumatoid arthritis? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been successfully treated using biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. These medications are not utilized as first-line treatment, in part because of their high cost, but they are frequently seen to be cost-effective for RA patient populations that do not respond adequately to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Moreover, not all RA patients who meet clinical eligibility criteria can access biologics, not even as second-line therapy. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in biosimilars that are highly comparable to their originator biologics in terms of efficacy and safety but generally come at a lower price. This review summarizes the potential role of biosimilars in reducing RA expenditure and increasing RA patient access to biologic therapies. As the global landscape for biosimilars continues to evolve, it is essential to consider the unique challenges and opportunities in different healthcare systems. By leveraging the potential of biosimilars, healthcare systems can improve RA management, ease its economic burden and ensure that patients have access to effective and affordable treatments. The future of RA treatment lies in the integration of biosimilars into clinical practice, offering hope for more sustainable and equitable healthcare systems.

<p>We generated Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–ChR2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–ChR2 mice that exhibited nocifensive behavior to blue light exposure. All Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice showed no behavioral differences in response to mechanical and thermal stimuli compared to wild-type mice. Blue light exposure caused paw withdrawal in Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice, and time spent in a room with a blue LED floor was shorter in Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice compared to wild-type mice.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Voltage-gated sodium channels, including Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9, play important roles in pain transmission and chronic pain development. However, the specific mechanisms of their action remain unclear, highlighting the need for in vivo stimulation studies of these channels. Optogenetics, a novel technique for targeting the activation or inhibition of specific neural circuits using light, offers a promising solution. In our previous study, we used optogenetics to selectively excite Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-expressing neurons in the dorsal root ganglion of mice to induce nocifensive behavior. Here, we further characterize the impact of nocifensive behavior by activation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9-expressing neurons. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–iCre, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–iCre, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–iCre mice expressing iCre recombinase under the control of the endogenous Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 gene promoter were produced. These mice were then bred with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) Cre–reporter Ai32 mice to obtain Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–ChR2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–ChR2 mice. Blue light exposure triggered paw withdrawal in all mice, with the strongest response in Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2 mice. These light sensitivity differences observed across Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice may be dependent on ChR2 expression or reflect the inherent disparities in their pain transmission roles. In conclusion, we have generated noninvasive pain models, with optically activated peripheral nociceptors. We believe that studies using optogenetics will further elucidate the role of sodium channel subtypes in pain transmission.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Empathy is usually regarded as the ability to perceive the emotional state of others, which is an altruistic motivation to promote prosocial behavior and thus plays a key role in human life and social development. Empathic pain—the capacity to feel and understand the pain of others—constitutes a significant aspect in the study of empathy behaviors. For an extended duration, investigations into empathic pain have predominantly centered on human neuroimaging studies. Fortunately, recent advancements have witnessed the utilization of animal models in the exploration of the fundamental neural underpinnings of empathic pain. There is substantial evidence implicating multiple brain regions and neural networks in the generation and maintenance of empathic pain. Nevertheless, further elucidation of the neural mechanisms underlying empathic pain is warranted. This review provides a concise overview of prior studies on the neural mechanisms of empathic pain, outlining the pertinent brain regions, neural pathways, synaptic mechanisms, and associated molecules while also delving into future prospects.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The mammalian brain comprises two structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the gray matter (GM) and the white matter (WM). In humans, the WM constitutes approximately half of the brain volume, yet it remains significantly less investigated than the GM. The major cellular elements of the WM are neuronal axons and glial cells. However, the WM also contains cell bodies of the interstitial neurons, estimated to number 10 to 28 million in the adult bat brain, 67 million in Lar gibbon brain, and 450 to 670 million in the adult human brain, representing as much as 1.3%, 2.25%, and 3.5% of all neurons in the cerebral cortex, respectively. Many studies investigated the interstitial WM neurons (IWMNs) using immunohistochemistry, and some information is available regarding their electrophysiological properties. However, the functional role of IWMNs in physiologic and pathologic conditions largely remains unknown. This review aims to provide a concise update regarding the distribution and properties of interstitial WM neurons, highlight possible functions of these cells as debated in the literature, and speculate about other possible functions of the IWMNs and their interactions with glial cells. We hope that our review will inspire new research on IWMNs, which represent an intriguing cell population in the brain.

                The monoaminergic nuclei are thought to be some of the earliest sites of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in the brain, with tau-containing pretangles appearing in these nuclei decades before the onset of clinical impairments. It has increasingly been recognized that monoamine systems represent a critical target of investigation towards understanding the progression of AD and designing early detection and treatment approaches. This review synthesizes evidence across animal studies, human neuropathology, and state-of-the-art neuroimaging and daily life assessment methods in humans, which demonstrate robust relationships between monoamine systems and AD pathophysiology and behavior. Further, the review highlights the promise of multimethod, multisystem approaches to studying monoaminergic mechanisms of resilience to AD pathology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91634">The role of Imp and Syp RNA-binding proteins in precise neuronal elimination by apoptosis through the regulation of transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal stem cells generate a limited and consistent number of neuronal progenies, each possessing distinct morphologies and functions, which are crucial for optimal brain function. Our study focused on a neuroblast (NB) lineage in <i>Drosophila</i> known as Lin A/15, which generates motoneurons (MNs) and glia. Intriguingly, Lin A/15 NB dedicates 40% of its time to producing immature MNs (iMNs) that are subsequently eliminated through apoptosis. Two RNA-binding proteins, Imp and Syp, play crucial roles in this process. Imp+ MNs survive, while Imp−, Syp+ MNs undergo apoptosis. Genetic experiments show that Imp promotes survival, whereas Syp promotes cell death in iMNs. Late-born MNs, which fail to express a functional code of transcription factors (mTFs) that control their morphological fate, are subject to elimination. Manipulating the expression of Imp and Syp in Lin A/15 NB and progeny leads to a shift of TF code in late-born MNs toward that of early-born MNs, and their survival. Additionally, introducing the TF code of early-born MNs into late-born MNs also promoted their survival. These findings demonstrate that the differential expression of Imp and Syp in iMNs links precise neuronal generation and distinct identities through the regulation of mTFs. Both Imp and Syp are conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that they play a fundamental role in precise neurogenesis across species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95427">Noncaloric monosaccharides induce excessive sprouting angiogenesis in zebrafish via foxo1a-marcksl1a signal</a></h4>

              
                Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. Nevertheless, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood. We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Utilizing this model, we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs). The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced <i>foxo1a</i> mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of <i>marcksl1a</i>. This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86860">A chromatic feature detector in the retina signals visual context changes</a></h4>

              
                The retina transforms patterns of light into visual feature representations supporting behaviour. These representations are distributed across various types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose spatial and temporal tuning properties have been studied extensively in many model organisms, including the mouse. However, it has been difficult to link the potentially nonlinear retinal transformations of natural visual inputs to specific ethological purposes. Here, we discover a nonlinear selectivity to chromatic contrast in an RGC type that allows the detection of changes in visual context. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then used this model to search in silico for stimuli that maximally excite distinct types of RGCs. This procedure predicted centre colour opponency in transient suppressed-by-contrast (tSbC) RGCs, a cell type whose function is being debated. We confirmed experimentally that these cells indeed responded very selectively to Green-OFF, UV-ON contrasts. This type of chromatic contrast was characteristic of transitions from ground to sky in the visual scene, as might be elicited by head or eye movements across the horizon. Because tSbC cells performed best among all RGC types at reliably detecting these transitions, we suggest a role for this RGC type in providing contextual information (i.e. sky or ground) necessary for the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to other stimuli, such as looming objects. Our work showcases how a combination of experiments with natural stimuli and computational modelling allows discovering novel types of stimulus selectivity and identifying their potential ethological relevance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99194">Cyclic di-GMP as an antitoxin regulates bacterial genome stability and antibiotic persistence in biofilms</a></h4>

              
                Biofilms are complex bacterial communities characterized by a high persister prevalence, which contributes to chronic and relapsing infections. Historically, persister formation in biofilms has been linked to constraints imposed by their dense structures. However, we observed an elevated persister frequency accompanying the stage of cell adhesion, marking the onset of biofilm development. Subsequent mechanistic studies uncovered a comparable type of toxin-antitoxin (TA) module (TA-like system) triggered by cell adhesion, which is responsible for this elevation. In this module, the toxin HipH acts as a genotoxic deoxyribonuclease, inducing DNA double strand breaks and genome instability. While the second messenger c-di-GMP functions as the antitoxin, exerting control over HipH expression and activity. The dynamic interplay between c-di-GMP and HipH levels emerges as a crucial determinant governing genome stability and persister generation within biofilms. These findings unveil a unique TA system, where small molecules act as the antitoxin, outlining a biofilm-specific molecular mechanism influencing genome stability and antibiotic persistence, with potential implications for treating biofilm infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94849">Inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase activates type I interferon-dependent antitumor immunity by bridging cGAS-STING pathway</a></h4>

              
                The <i>O</i>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is an essential enzyme that mediates protein <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation, a unique form of posttranslational modification of many nuclear and cytosolic proteins. Recent studies observed increased OGT and <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation levels in a broad range of human cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, indicating a universal effect of OGT in promoting tumorigenesis. Here, we show that OGT is essential for tumor growth in immunocompetent mice by repressing the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-dependent DNA sensing pathway. We found that deletion of OGT (<i>Ogt<sup>−/−</sup></i>) caused a marked reduction in tumor growth in both syngeneic mice tumor models and a genetic mice colorectal cancer (CRC) model induced by mutation of the <i>Apc</i> gene (<i>Apc<sup>min</sup></i>). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of OGT induced a robust genomic instability (GIN), leading to cGAS-dependent production of the type I interferon (IFN-I) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). As a result, deletion of <i>Cgas</i> or <i>Sting</i> from <i>Ogt<sup>−/−</sup></i> cancer cells restored tumor growth, and this correlated with impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, we found that OGT-dependent cleavage of host cell factor C1 (HCF-1) is required for the avoidance of GIN and IFN-I production in tumors. In summary, our results identify OGT-mediated genomic stability and activate cGAS-STING pathway as an important tumor-cell-intrinsic mechanism to repress antitumor immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86827">A MSTNDel73C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep by CRISPR/Cas9 promotes skeletal muscle myofiber hyperplasia</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the well-known Myostatin (<i>MSTN</i>) produce a ‘double-muscle’ phenotype, which makes it commercially invaluable for improving livestock meat production and providing high-quality protein for humans. However, mutations at different loci of the <i>MSTN</i> often produce a variety of different phenotypes. In the current study, we increased the delivery ratio of Cas9 mRNA to sgRNA from the traditional 1:2 to 1:10, which improves the efficiency of the homozygous mutation of biallelic gene. Here, a <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout sheep, in which the <i>MSTN</i> and <i>FGF5</i> dual-gene biallelic homozygous mutations were produced via the deletion of 3-base pairs of AGC in the third exon of <i>MSTN</i>, resulting in cysteine-depleted at amino acid position 73, and the <i>FGF5</i> double allele mutation led to inactivation of <i>FGF5</i> gene. The <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout sheep highlights a dominant ‘double-muscle’ phenotype, which can be stably inherited. Both F0 and F1 generation mutants highlight the excellent trait of high-yield meat with a smaller cross-sectional area and higher number of muscle fibers per unit area. Mechanistically, the <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout mediated the activation of <i>FOSL1</i> via the MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis. The activated <i>FOSL1</i> promotes skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and inhibits myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the expression of MyoD1, and resulting in smaller myotubes. In addition, activated ERK1/2 may inhibit the secondary fusion of myotubes by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CaMKII activation pathway, leading to myoblasts fusion to form smaller myotubes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87928">Whole genomes from the extinct Xerces Blue butterfly can help identify declining insect species</a></h4>

              
                The Xerces Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche xerces</i>) is considered to be the first butterfly to become extinct in historical times. It was notable for its chalky lavender wings with conspicuous white spots on the ventral wings. The last individuals were collected in their restricted habitat, in the dunes near the Presidio military base in San Francisco, in 1941. We sequenced the genomes of four 80- to 100-year-old Xerces Blue, and seven historical and one modern specimens of its closest relative, the Silvery Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche lygdamus</i>). We compared these to a novel annotated genome of the Green-Underside Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche alexis</i>). Phylogenetic relationships inferred from complete mitochondrial genomes indicate that Xerces Blue was a distinct species that diverged from the Silvery Blue lineage at least 850,000 years ago. Using nuclear genomes, both species experienced population growth during the Eemian interglacial period, but the Xerces Blue decreased to a very low effective population size subsequently, a trend opposite to that observed in the Silvery Blue. Runs of homozygosity and deleterious load in the former were significantly greater than in the later, suggesting a higher incidence of inbreeding. These signals of population decline observed in Xerces Blue could be used to identify and monitor other insects threatened by human activities, whose extinction patterns are still not well known.

	<p>Background: Moral evaluation is identified as the first stage in the theory of moral judgment, and academics believe that it may align with the social intuitionist model. This study aims to prove that the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional dominance hypothesis applies to moral evaluation by presenting a computational decision-making model that mathematically formalizes this emotional dominance decision-making process. We also compared different types of valence evaluation tasks to test the emotional priority hypothesis. Methods: We used a convenience sampling method to randomly recruit 30 enrolled college students. The drift-diffusion model was employed to analyze reaction times for words with various emotional and moral valences Additionally, we designed different valence evaluation tasks based on the response relevance hypothesis and evaluated the processing order through reaction time comparisons. Results: The analysis revealed that the emotional mechanism of immoral evaluation differs from moral evaluation. An increase in emotional valence accelerates the speed of evidence accumulation (v) for moral evaluation (M = 1.21, 0.2% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 99.8%) but lowers decision caution (a) in immoral evaluation (M = &amp;amp;minus;0.64, 96.1% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 3.9%). In contrast, moral valence does not have a significant influence on evaluation processes (v, M = &amp;amp;minus;0.28, 72.1% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 27.9%; a, M = &amp;amp;minus;0.32, 79.3% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 20.7%). Furthermore, We found no significant difference in reaction times between moral and immoral words in the emotional evaluation task (F(1,29) = 0.55, p = 0.464, partial &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.02), but a significant difference existed in the moral evaluation task (F(1,29) = 17.99, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, partial &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.38), indicating that the tendency of relatively fast immoral evaluation in emotional evaluation tasks may be caused by emotional priority. Conclusions: Our findings support the intuitive model&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional dominance hypothesis and introduce a new emotional mechanism into moral evaluation. This study clarifies the distinct emotional processes in moral and immoral evaluations, fills a gap in the research on moral evaluation, and offers insights into human decision-making in moral contexts.</p>

                <p>Despite decades of preclinical investigation, there remains limited understanding of the etiology and biological underpinnings of anxiety disorders. Sensitivity to potential threat is characteristic of anxiety-like behavior in humans and rodents, but traditional rodent behavioral tasks aimed to assess threat responsiveness lack translational value, especially with regard to emotionally valenced stimuli. Therefore, development of novel preclinical approaches to serve as analogues to patient assessments is needed. In humans, the fearful face task is widely used to test responsiveness to socially communicated threat signals. In rats, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are analogous social cues associated with positive or negative affective states that can elicit behavioral changes in the receiver. It is therefore likely that when rats hear aversive alarm call USVs (22&nbsp;kHz), they evoke translatable changes in brain activity comparable with the fearful face task. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in male and female rats to assess changes in BOLD activity induced by exposure to aversive 22&nbsp;kHz alarm calls emitted in response to threatening stimuli, prosocial (55&nbsp;kHz) USVs emitted in response to appetitive stimuli, or a computer-generated 22&nbsp;kHz tone. Results show patterns of regional activation that are specific to each USV stimulus. Notably, limbic regions clinically relevant to psychiatric disorders (e.g., amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) are preferentially activated by either aversive 22&nbsp;kHz or appetitive 55&nbsp;kHz USVs. These results support the use of USV playback as a promising translational tool to investigate affective processing under conditions of distal threat in preclinical rat models.</p>

                <p>Human and mouse dorsal root ganglia (hDRG and mDRG) neurons are important tools in understanding the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie nociception and drive pain behaviors. One of the simplest differences in firing phenotypes is that neurons are single-firing (exhibit only one action potential) or multi-firing (exhibit 2 or more action potentials). To determine if single- and multi-firing hDRG neurons exhibit differences in intrinsic properties, firing phenotypes, and AP waveform properties, and if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing, we measured 22 electrophysiological properties by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of 94 hDRG neurons from six male and four female donors. We then analyzed the data using several machine learning models to determine if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing. We used 1,000 iterations of Monte Carlo cross-validation to split the data into different train and test sets and tested the logistic regression, <I>k</I>-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector classifier, and XGBoost machine learning models. All models tested had a &gt;80% accuracy on average, with support vector classifier, and XGBoost performing the best. We found that several properties correlated with multi-firing hDRG neurons and together could be used to predict multi-firing neurons in hDRG including a long decay time, a low rheobase, and long first spike latency. We also found that the hDRG models were able to predict multi-firing with 90% accuracy in mDRG neurons. Understanding these properties could be beneficial in the elucidation of targets on peripheral sensory neurons related to pain.</p>

                This case report presents a case of infected corneal laceration with traumatic endophthalmitis in a pediatric patient. A boy in his middle childhood sustained an ocular injury with scissors, resulting in a full-thickness corneal laceration and infection. Despite the delay in seeking treatment, the patient underwent successful surgical interventions, including corneal scraping, pars plana lensectomy, vitrectomy, and secondary intraocular lens implantation (IOL). The infection was managed with targeted antibiotics, and Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed as the causative organism. Remarkably, these efforts led to a satisfactory improvement in the patient’s vision to 20/50. This case underscores the importance of early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach in the management of pediatric ocular trauma to optimize outcomes.

                Background This study investigated the determinants of community preventive behavior in complying with the Indonesian regulations to prevent COVID-19 local transmission. Methods A cross-sectional study used to collect the data via an online cross using a form created from a google questionnaire forms. A total of 1,802 respondents were gathered at a single point in time. The authors used the Health Belief Model (HBM) approach to measure and create a model for the prevention of local transmission of COVID-19. Results This study found that more than half of the respondents still had low perceived susceptibility (16%) and severity (43%). There were only 3% respondents with perceived barriers and 19% with strong self-efficacy. The findings showed that self-efficacy and perceived barriers had statistically significant relationships with preventive behavior (p-value <0.05). The goodness of fit index showed that the proposed model was not fit for the data (RMSE<0.080, GFI>0.950, AGFI>0.950, SRMR<0.100), which means that it was not fit to describe the empirical phenomenon under study. Conclusions This study found that more than half of the respondents still had low perceived susceptibility (84%) and severity (67%), but more than half had high perceived benefits (54%). Only a few respondents had significant barriers to implementing COVID-19 transmission prevention behaviours (3%). Still, most respondents had low perceived self-efficacy (81%), and only 60% had good behaviours related to COVID-19 prevention. In the context of COVID-19 preventive behaviour, we recommended to improve perceived susceptibility and severity by providing the correct information (which contain information about how people susceptible to the virus and the impact of infected by the virus) with the local cultural context.

                Abstract* Background A positive exercise stress test (EST) is common among pilots, and it may indicate a greater risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to determine the incidence of recurrently positive EST and their predictors among civilian pilots in Indonesia. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study among civilian pilots who had the first positive EST test between January 2019 and June 2020 at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta. The data were retrieved from medical records. Subjects were included if there were data on subsequent ESTs at 6 and 12 months. Risk factors included total flight hours (TFH) in the last 6 months, license type, aircraft cabin pressurization system, flying limitation such as multicrew, cardiac intervention, age, smoking habit, family history of coronary artery disease, body mass index, blood pressure levels, lipid profile, and fasting blood glucose. Results Eighty-seven pilots were included; 54 of them (62.1%) had recurrent positive ESTs. All subjects were men, and the median age was 51 (range 40-64) years. Independent predictors of recurrent positive ESTs were age 60-65 years (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.12–23.16, p= 0.035), a TFH of > 275 hours (ORadj 5.1, 95% CI: 1.28–20.65, p= 0.021), and dyslipidemia (ORadj: 4.2 95% CI: 1.468–12.275, p=0.015). Having these three risk factors increased the probability of a recurrent positive EST up to 100%. Conclusion The incidence of recurrently positive ESTs among civilian pilots in Indonesia was high. Airlines may want to implement a more aggressive health policy for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases among their pilots.

                Introduction Spontaneous tendon ruptures in end stage kidney disease patients have the potential to cause long- term morbidity, and timely intervention is required to prevent complications that can severely affect the functional status of the patient Case presentation A series of six tendons (two triceps tendons and two bilateral quadriceps tendons) in three patients with ESKD undergoing hemodialysis is discussed in this case series. Patients were aged 61, 44 and 26 years, and on hemodialysis for 5, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Conclusion End -stage kidney disease is associated with a multitude of physiological changes, and the musculoskeletal system is no exception to this. Spontaneous tendon rupture is a multifactorial complication of ESKD, with serious implications for mobility and quality of life. As a result, these patients require a multifaceted approach to ensure optimum results and an early return to activity. We report a series of 6 spontaneous tendon ruptures in 3 patients with ESKD at our institution. We would like to outline the methods of repair for each case and further attempt to assess biochemical parameters that may have contributed to the disease process.

                Purpose Detailed reports of the assessments used in rehabilitation wards are lacking. This study aimed to examine the common evaluations used in rehabilitation wards and discuss the necessary assessments for treatment plans and patient management. Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Ichushi Web for articles published between June 2013 and June 2023. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO. Data extraction and blind selection were performed, and a consensus was reached among experts in case of conflicts. Results We identified 220 studies, 31 meeting the inclusion criteria post-screening. The Functional Independence Measure was the most used assessment (96.8%), followed by grip strength (32.3%) and the 10-m walk test (9.7%). Other assessments included the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set, Short Physical Performance Battery, and Timed Up and Go Test. Although fall-related incidents are frequent, significantly affecting patient outcomes in rehabilitation units, balance assessments were underutilized. Conclusions Although the FIM is an extensively used assessment in rehabilitation wards, balance assessments critical for fall prevention are significantly underused. Therefore, these assessment tools should be evaluated in future research and clinical practice.

                <p>by Chenxi Liao, Masataka Sawayama, Bei Xiao</p>

We can visually discriminate and recognize a wide range of materials. Meanwhile, we use language to describe what we see and communicate relevant information about the materials. Here, we investigate the relationship between visual judgment and language expression to understand how visual features relate to semantic representations in human cognition. We use deep generative models to generate images of realistic materials. Interpolating between the generative models enables us to systematically create material appearances in both well-defined and ambiguous categories. Using these stimuli, we compared the representations of materials from two behavioral tasks: visual material similarity judgments and free-form verbal descriptions. Our findings reveal a moderate but significant correlation between vision and language on a categorical level. However, analyzing the representations with an unsupervised alignment method, we discover structural differences that arise at the image-to-image level, especially among ambiguous materials morphed between known categories. Moreover, visual judgments exhibit more individual differences compared to verbal descriptions. Our results show that while verbal descriptions capture material qualities on the coarse level, they may not fully convey the visual nuances of material appearances. Analyzing the image representation of materials obtained from various pre-trained deep neural networks, we find that similarity structures in human visual judgments align more closely with those of the vision-language models than purely vision-based models. Our work illustrates the need to consider the vision-language relationship in building a comprehensive model for material perception. Moreover, we propose a novel framework for evaluating the alignment and misalignment between representations from different modalities, leveraging information from human behaviors and computational models.

                <p>by Fuyin Yang, Hao Zhu, Xinyi Cao, Hui Li, Xinyu Fang, Lingfang Yu, Siqi Li, Zenan Wu, Chunbo Li, Chen Zhang, Xing Tian</p>

Distinguishing reality from hallucinations requires efficient monitoring of agency. It has been hypothesized that a copy of motor signals, termed <i>efference copy (EC)</i> or <i>corollary discharge (CD)</i>, suppresses sensory responses to yield a sense of agency; impairment of the inhibitory function leads to hallucinations. However, how can the sole absence of inhibition yield positive symptoms of hallucinations? We hypothesize that selective impairments in functionally distinct signals of <i>CD</i> and <i>EC</i> during motor-to-sensory transformation cause the positive symptoms of hallucinations. In an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment with a delayed articulation paradigm in schizophrenic patients with (AVHs) and without auditory verbal hallucinations (non-AVHs), we found that preparing to speak without knowing the contents (general preparation) did not suppress auditory responses in both patient groups, suggesting the absent of inhibitory function of <i>CD</i>. Whereas, preparing to speak a syllable (specific preparation) enhanced the auditory responses to the prepared syllable in non-AVHs, whereas AVHs showed enhancement in responses to unprepared syllables, opposite to the observations in the normal population, suggesting that the enhancement function of <i>EC</i> is not precise in AVHs. A computational model with a virtual lesion of an inhibitory inter-neuron and disproportional sensitization of auditory cortices fitted the empirical data and further quantified the distinct impairments in motor-to-sensory transformation in AVHs. These results suggest that “broken” <i>CD</i> plus “noisy” <i>EC</i> causes erroneous monitoring of the imprecise generation of internal auditory representation and yields auditory hallucinations. Specific impairments in functional granularity of motor-to-sensory transformation mediate positivity symptoms of agency abnormality in mental disorders.

                <p>by Suresha G. Prabhu, Vineeta N. Pillai, Lizna Mohamed Ali, Valérie Vivet-Boudou, Akhil Chameettachal, Serena Bernacchi, Farah Mustafa, Roland Marquet, Tahir A. Rizvi</p>

The packaging of genomic RNA (gRNA) into retroviral particles relies on the specific recognition by the Gag precursor of packaging signals (<i>Psi</i>), which maintain a complex secondary structure through long-range interactions (LRIs). However, it remains unclear whether the binding of Gag to <i>Psi</i> alone is enough to promote RNA packaging and what role LRIs play in this process. Using mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), we investigated the effects of mutations in 4 proposed LRIs on gRNA structure and function. Our findings revealed the presence of an unsuspected extended LRI, and hSHAPE revealed that maintaining a wild-type–like <i>Psi</i> structure is crucial for efficient packaging. Surprisingly, filter-binding assays demonstrated that most mutants, regardless of their packaging capability, exhibited significant binding to Pr77<sup>Gag</sup>, suggesting that Gag binding to <i>Psi</i> is insufficient for efficient packaging. Footprinting experiments indicated that efficient RNA packaging is promoted when Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> binds to 2 specific sites within <i>Psi</i>, whereas binding elsewhere in <i>Psi</i> does not lead to efficient packaging. Taken together, our results suggest that the 3D structure of the <i>Ps</i>i/Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> complex regulates the assembly of viral particles around gRNA, enabling effective discrimination against other viral and cellular RNAs that may also bind Gag efficiently.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                Background Despite the success of titanium (Ti) implants in dental rehabilitation, emerging evidence implicates the release of titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) from the implant surface as a potential contributor to the initiation of the pathogenic process leading to peri-implantitis and ultimately failure of the implants. However, a comprehensive investigation to elucidate the dose-dependent effects of TiO2NPs on cytotoxicity and inflammatory responses is lacking. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of TiO2NPs on the cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine expression in Human Gingival Fibroblasts (HGFs). Methods HGFs were isolated from gingival tissue samples obtained from periodontally and systemically healthy subjects. Ti standard solution for ICP was diluted to create concentrations of (0.001 ppm, 0.01 ppm, 0.1 ppm, 1 ppm, 10 ppm, and 100 ppm) for cell culture media containing titanium. HGFs were then cultured in these varying concentrations for specific time periods (days 1, 3, 5, and 7) to assess cell viability. A cytotoxicity assay was performed to determine the levels and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β) using qRT-PCR and ELISA techniques. Results Our findings demonstrate a concentration and duration-dependent decrease in HGF viability upon exposure to titanium nanoparticles. Notably, a 50% reduction in cell viability was observed at the highest concentration (100 ppm). qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β and IL-6, in HGFs exposed to titanium. Interestingly, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, and TGF-β) remained comparable or even equivalent compared to controls across different titanium concentrations. Conclusions The study revealed a concentration and duration-dependent influence on HGF viability and cytokine profile, suggesting potential cytotoxicity and modulation of the inflammatory response mediated by TiO2NPs. Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and their implications for dental implant biocompatibility.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-908/v2?src=rss">Trends of machine learning for dental caries research in Southeast Asia: insights from a bibliometric analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental caries is a common chronic oral disease, posing a serious public health issue. By analyzing large datasets, machine learning shows potential in addressing this problem. This study employs bibliometric analysis to explore emerging topics, collaborations, key authors, and research trends in Southeast Asia related to the application of machine learning in dental caries management. Methods A comprehensive selection using the Scopus database to obtain relevant research, covering publications from inception to July 2024 was done. We employed the Bibliometric approaches, including co-authorship networks, yearly publishing trends, institutional and national partnerships, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and citation analysis, for the collected data. To explore the visualization and network analysis, we employed the tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix in R package. Results The final bibliometric analysis included 246 papers. We found that Malaysia became the top contributor with 59 publications, followed by Indonesia (37) and Thailand (29). Malaysia had the highest Multiple Country Publications (MCP) ratio at 0.407. Top institutions including the Universiti Sains Malaysia led with 39 articles, followed by Chiang Mai University (36) and the National University of Singapore (30) became the leader. Co-authorship analysis using VOSviewer revealed six distinct clusters. A total of 1220 scholars contributed to these publications. The top 10 keywords, including ‘human’ and ‘dental caries,’ indicated research hotspots. Conclusion We found growing evidence of machine learning applications to address dental caries in Southeast Asia. The bibliometric analysis highlights key authors, collaborative networks, and emerging topics, revealing research trends since 2014. This study underscores the importance of bibliometric analysis in tackling this public health issue.

                Here, Schmid et al. develop a series of NTRK fusion-driven GEMMs of pediatric-type glioma. Treatment with TRK kinase inhibitors significantly prolongs survival, but tumors eventually recur due to treatment-resistant persister cells. These tumors upregulate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways, and MEK inhibition by itself leads to a significant growth inhibition.

                Poschel et al. observed that loss of host PD-L1 function leads to increased inflammation-driven colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mechanistically, loss of PD-L1 expands the PD-1+Nrp1loTGFβ+ Treg to recruit IL6+ neutrophils to inhibit CTL activation. PD-L1 therefore functions as a suppressor of inflammation-driven colorectal tumor via restraining PD-1+Nrp1loTGFβ+ Treg cells.

                Yang et al. found that inhalation of lavender essential oil confers antinociceptive effects in inflammatory pain model mice by activating projections from the anterior piriform cortex to the insular cortex. These findings provide compelling evidence supporting further development of aroma-based treatments for pain management.

                Martínez et al. provide mechanistic evidence on how the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) attenuates the degradation of prominent ABA receptor PYL8 in Arabidopsis. This mechanism involves ABA-mediated disassembly and inhibition of the evolutionary conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4-CDDD, which leads to the stabilization of PYL8 and sustained ABA responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91598">Peptidoglycan-tethered and free forms of the Braun lipoprotein are in dynamic equilibrium in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Peptidoglycan (PG) is a giant macromolecule that completely surrounds bacterial cells and prevents lysis in hypo-osmotic environments. This net-like macromolecule is made of glycan strands linked to each other by two types of transpeptidases that form either 4→3 (PBPs) or 3→3 (LDTs) cross-links. Previously, we devised a heavy isotope-based PG full labeling method coupled to mass spectrometry to determine the mode of insertion of new subunits into the expanding PG network (Atze et al., 2022). We showed that PG polymerization operates according to different modes for the formation of the septum and of the lateral cell walls, as well as for bacterial growth in the presence or absence of β-lactams in engineered strains that can exclusively rely on LDTs for PG cross-linking when drugs are present. Here, we apply our method to the resolution of the kinetics of the reactions leading to the covalent tethering of the Braun lipoprotein (Lpp) to PG and the subsequent hydrolysis of that same covalent link. We find that Lpp and disaccharide-peptide subunits are independently incorporated into the expanding lateral cell walls. Newly synthesized septum PG appears to contain small amounts of tethered Lpp. LDTs did mediate intense shuffling of Lpp between PG stems leading to a dynamic equilibrium between the PG-tethered and free forms of Lpp.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96848">Recording γ-secretase activity in living mouse brains</a></h4>

              
                γ-Secretase plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system. Our recent development of genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors has enabled the spatiotemporal recording of γ-secretase activity on a cell-by-cell basis in live neurons <i>in culture</i>. Nevertheless, how γ-secretase activity is regulated <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear. Here, we employ the near-infrared (NIR) C99 720–670 biosensor and NIR confocal microscopy to quantitatively record γ-secretase activity in individual neurons in living mouse brains. Intriguingly, we uncovered that γ-secretase activity may influence the activity of γ-secretase in neighboring neurons, suggesting a potential ‘cell non-autonomous’ regulation of γ-secretase in mouse brains. Given that γ-secretase plays critical roles in important biological events and various diseases, our new assay <i>in vivo</i> would become a new platform that enables dissecting the essential roles of γ-secretase in normal health and diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93666">Novel risk loci for COVID-19 hospitalization among admixed American populations</a></h4>

              
                The genetic basis of severe COVID-19 has been thoroughly studied, and many genetic risk factors shared between populations have been identified. However, reduced sample sizes from non-European groups have limited the discovery of population-specific common risk loci. In this second study nested in the SCOURGE consortium, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for COVID-19 hospitalization in admixed Americans, comprising a total of 4702 hospitalized cases recruited by SCOURGE and seven other participating studies in the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative. We identified four genome-wide significant associations, two of which constitute novel loci and were first discovered in Latin American populations (<i>BAZ2B</i> and <i>DDIAS</i>). A trans-ethnic meta-analysis revealed another novel cross-population risk locus in <i>CREBBP</i>. Finally, we assessed the performance of a cross-ancestry polygenic risk score in the SCOURGE admixed American cohort. This study constitutes the largest GWAS for COVID-19 hospitalization in admixed Latin Americans conducted to date. This allowed to reveal novel risk loci and emphasize the need of considering the diversity of populations in genomic research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95185">Evaluation of Gremlin-1 as a therapeutic target in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis</a></h4>

              
                Gremlin-1 has been implicated in liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) via inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling and has thereby been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Using rat in vivo and human in vitro and ex vivo model systems of MASH fibrosis, we show that neutralisation of Gremlin-1 activity with monoclonal therapeutic antibodies does not reduce liver inflammation or liver fibrosis. Still, Gremlin-1 was upregulated in human and rat MASH fibrosis, but expression was restricted to a small subpopulation of COL3A1/THY1<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts. Lentiviral overexpression of Gremlin-1 in LX-2 cells and primary hepatic stellate cells led to changes in BMP-related gene expression, which did not translate to increased fibrogenesis. Furthermore, we show that Gremlin-1 binds to heparin with high affinity, which prevents Gremlin-1 from entering systemic circulation, prohibiting Gremlin-1-mediated organ crosstalk. Overall, our findings suggest a redundant role for Gremlin-1 in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, which is unamenable to therapeutic targeting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87922">A unique cell division protein critical for the assembly of the bacterial divisome</a></h4>

              
                Identification of unique essential bacterial genes is important for not only the understanding of their cell biology but also the development of new antimicrobials. Here, we report a previously unrecognized core component of the <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> divisome. Our results reveal that the protein, termed Aeg1 interacts with multiple cell division proteins, including FtsN, which is required for components of the divisome to localize to the midcell. We demonstrate that the FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> and FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> mutants effectively bypassed the need of Aeg1 by <i>A. baumannii</i>, as did the activation variants FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>. Our results suggest that Aeg1 is a cell division protein that arrives at the division site to initiate cell division by recruiting FtsN, which activates FtsQLB and FtsA to induce the septal peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI. The discovery of the new essential cell division protein has provided a new target for the development of antibacterial agents.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93975">An in vitro approach reveals molecular mechanisms underlying endocrine disruptor-induced epimutagenesis</a></h4>

              
                Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as bisphenol S (BPS) are xenobiotic compounds that can disrupt endocrine signaling due to steric similarities to endogenous hormones. EDCs have been shown to induce disruptions in normal epigenetic programming (epimutations) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that predispose disease states. Most interestingly, the prevalence of epimutations following exposure to many EDCs persists over multiple generations. Many studies have described direct and prolonged effects of EDC exposure in animal models, but many questions remain about molecular mechanisms by which EDC-induced epimutations are introduced or subsequently propagated, whether there are cell type-specific susceptibilities to the same EDC, and whether this correlates with differential expression of relevant hormone receptors. We exposed cultured pluripotent (iPS), somatic (Sertoli and granulosa), and primordial germ cell-like (PGCLC) cells to BPS and found that differential incidences of BPS-induced epimutations and DEGs correlated with differential expression of relevant hormone receptors inducing epimutations near relevant hormone response elements in somatic and pluripotent, but not germ cell types. Most interestingly, we found that when iPS cells were exposed to BPS and then induced to differentiate into PGCLCs, the prevalence of epimutations and DEGs was largely retained, however, &gt;90% of the specific epimutations and DEGs were replaced by novel epimutations and DEGs. These results suggest a unique mechanism by which an EDC-induced epimutated state may be propagated transgenerationally.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96943">Pectin methylesterase activity is required for RALF1 peptide signalling output</a></h4>

              
                The extracellular matrix plays an integrative role in cellular responses in plants, but its contribution to the signalling of extracellular ligands largely remains to be explored. Rapid alkalinisation factors (RALFs) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we address a crucial connection between the de-methylesterification machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with pectin methyl esterases (PMEs) abolishes RALF1-induced root growth repression. Our data suggest that positively charged RALF1 peptides bind negatively charged, de-methylesterified pectin with high avidity. We illustrate that the RALF1 association with de-methylesterified pectin is required for its FERONIA-dependent perception, contributing to the control of the extracellular matrix and the regulation of plasma membrane dynamics. Notably, this mode of action is independent of the FER-dependent extracellular matrix sensing mechanism provided by FER interaction with the leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) proteins. We propose that the methylation status of pectin acts as a contextualizing signalling scaffold for RALF peptides, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to peptide hormone-mediated responses.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study investigated the behavior of postural adjustments throughout the entire action: from the preparatory phase (anticipatory postural adjustment, APA), the focal movement phase (online postural adjustments, OPA), to the compensatory phase (compensatory postural adjustment, CPA) while raising the arms in a standing position, both with eyes opened and closed. The goal was to analyze the effects of reduced sensorial information and different heights on postural muscle activity during these three phases. Methods: Eight young women performed rapid shoulder flexion while standing on the ground and on a 1-m elevated platform. The EMG activity of the trunk and lower limb muscles was recorded during all three phases. Results: Although average muscle activity was similar on the ground and the elevated platform, the pattern of postural muscle activation varied across the motor action. During OPA, all postural muscle activity was the highest, while it was the lowest during APA. On the elevated platform postural muscles have increased their activation during APA. In the most stable condition (standing on the ground with eyes opened), muscle activity showed a negative correlation between APA and OPA, but there was no correlation between OPA and CPA. Conclusions: Our results suggest postural control adapts to sensory, motor, and cognitive conditions. Therefore, the increased demand for postural control due to the height of the support base demands greater flexibility in postural synergies and alters muscle activity.</p>

                <p>Executive control of movement enables inhibiting impulsive responses critical for successful navigation of the environment. Circuits mediating stop commands involve prefrontal and basal ganglia structures with fMRI evidence demonstrating increased activity during response inhibition in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)&mdash;often ascribed to maintaining task attentional demands. Using direct intraoperative cortical recordings in male and female human subjects, we investigated oscillatory dynamics along the rostral-caudal axis of dlPFC during a modified Go/No-go task, probing components of both proactive and reactive motor control. We assessed whether cognitive control is topographically organized along this axis and observed that low-frequency power increased prominently in mid-rostral dlPFC when inhibiting and delaying responses. These findings provide evidence for a key role for mid-rostral dlPFC low-frequency oscillations in sculpting motor control.</p>

                <p>The surprising omission or reduction of vital resources (food, fluid, social partners) can induce an aversive emotion known as frustrative nonreward (FNR), which can influence subsequent behavior and physiology. FNR is an integral mediator of irritability/aggression, motivation (substance use disorders, depression), anxiety/fear/threat, learning/conditioning, and social behavior. Despite substantial progress in the study of FNR during the twentieth century, research lagged in the later part of the century and into the early twenty-first century until the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria initiative included FNR and loss as components of the negative valence domain. This led to a renaissance of new research and paradigms relevant to basic and clinical science alike. The COVID-19 pandemic's extensive individual and social restrictions were correlated with increased drug and alcohol use, social conflict, irritability, and suicide, all potential consequences of FNR. This article highlights animal models related to these psychiatric disorders and symptoms and presents recent advances in identifying the brain regions and neurotransmitters implicated.</p>

                <p>Emotionally salient experiences are encoded and remembered more strongly, an effect that can be amplified by hormones like cortisol. Such memories can in turn profoundly influence later behavior. However, little is known about the link between amplified salience encoding and subsequent behavior. This pathway may be particularly important for risky alcohol drinking, which has been linked to sensitized salience responses, memory, and cortisol. To test this possibility, we integrated pharmacology using a double-blind cross-over design with fMRI, cognitive, and motivation assays across a range of healthy male and female social drinkers. As anticipated, cortisol enhanced memory for salient alcohol-related events; critically, this bias was in turn associated with later alcohol motivation. Increased alcohol motivation was particularly pronounced in more susceptible risky drinkers, for whom cortisol enhanced brain salience responses to alcohol. These sensitized salience responses predicted both memory biases and alcohol motivation. Together, these findings reveal maladaptive consequences of enhanced salience encoding.</p>

                <p>Communication between neurons and glia significantly influences the development maturation, plasticity, and disease progressions of the nervous system. As a new signaling modality, extracellular vesicles display a diverse role for robust functional regulation of neurons through their protein and nucleic acid cargoes. This review highlights recent breakthroughs in the research of signaling mechanisms between glia and neurons mediated by extracellular vesicles that are important for neural development, axonal maintenance, synaptic functions, and disease progression in the mammalian nervous system. We will discuss the biological roles of extracellular vesicles released from neurons, astroglia, microglia, and oligodendroglia in the nervous system and their implications in neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                <p>The brain is a highly adaptable organ that is molded by experience throughout life. Although the field of neuroscience has historically focused on intrinsic neuronal mechanisms of plasticity, there is growing evidence that multiple glial populations regulate the timing and extent of neuronal plasticity, particularly over the course of development. This review highlights recent discoveries on the role of glial cells in the establishment of cortical circuits and the regulation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity during critical periods of neurodevelopment. These studies provide strong evidence that neuronal circuit maturation and plasticity are non-cell autonomous processes that require both glial&ndash;neuronal and glial&ndash;glial cross talk to proceed. We conclude by discussing open questions that will continue to guide research in this nascent field.</p>

                <p>Primates, as social beings, have evolved complex brain mechanisms to navigate intricate social environments. This review explores the neural bases of body perception in both human and nonhuman primates, emphasizing the processing of social signals conveyed by body postures, movements, and interactions. Early studies identified selective neural responses to body stimuli in macaques, particularly within and ventral to the superior temporal sulcus (STS). These regions, known as body patches, represent visual features that are present in bodies but do not appear to be semantic body detectors. They provide information about posture and viewpoint of the body. Recent research using dynamic stimuli has expanded the understanding of the body-selective network, highlighting its complexity and the interplay between static and dynamic processing. In humans, body-selective areas such as the extrastriate body area (EBA) and fusiform body area (FBA) have been implicated in the perception of bodies and their interactions. Moreover, studies on social interactions reveal that regions in the human STS are also tuned to the perception of dyadic interactions, suggesting a specialized social lateral pathway. Computational work developed models of body recognition and social interaction, providing insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Despite advances, significant gaps remain in understanding the neural mechanisms of body perception and social interaction. Overall, this review underscores the importance of integrating findings across species to comprehensively understand the neural foundations of body perception and the interaction between computational modeling and neural recording.</p>

                <p>Palmitoylation, a lipid-based posttranslational protein modification, plays a crucial role in regulating various aspects of neuronal function through altering protein membrane-targeting, stabilities, and protein&ndash;protein interaction profiles. Disruption of palmitoylation has recently garnered attention as disease mechanism in neurodegeneration. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and associated neuronal dysfunction, including but not limited to amyloid precursor protein, &beta;-secretase (BACE1), postsynaptic density protein 95, Fyn, synaptotagmin-11, mutant huntingtin, and mutant superoxide dismutase 1, undergo palmitoylation, and recent evidence suggests that altered palmitoylation contributes to the pathological characteristics of these proteins and associated disruption of cellular processes. In addition, dysfunction of enzymes that catalyze palmitoylation and depalmitoylation has been connected to the development of neurological disorders. This review highlights some of the latest advances in our understanding of palmitoylation regulation in neurodegenerative diseases and explores potential therapeutic implications.</p>

                <p>The traditional view of glial cells as mere supportive tissue has shifted, due to advances in technology and theoretical conceptualization, to include a diversity of other functions, such as regulation of complex behaviors. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), have been shown to modulate synaptic functions through gliotransmitter-mediated neurotransmitter reuptake, influencing neuronal signaling and behavioral functions. Contemporary studies further highlight astrocytes&rsquo; involvement in complex cognitive functions. For instance, inhibiting astrocytes in the hippocampus can lead to memory deficits, suggesting their integral role in memory processes. Moreover, astrocytic calcium activity and astrocyte&ndash;neuron metabolic coupling have been linked to changes in synaptic strength and learning. Microglia, another type of glial cell, also extend beyond their supportive roles, contributing to learning and memory processes, with microglial reductions impacting these functions in a developmentally dependent manner. Oligodendrocytes, traditionally thought to have limited roles postdevelopment, are now recognized for their activity-dependent modulation of myelination and plasticity, thus influencing behavioral responses. Recent advancements in technology and computational modeling have expanded our understanding of glial functions, particularly how astrocytes influence neuronal circuits and behaviors. This review underscores the importance of glial cells in CNS functions and the need for further research to unravel the complexities of neuron&ndash;glia interactions, the impact of these interactions on brain functions, and potential implications for neurological diseases.</p>

                <p>The motor cortex is essential for controlling the flexible movements underlying complex behaviors. Behavioral flexibility involves the ability to integrate and refine new movements, thereby expanding an animal's repertoire. This review discusses recent strides in motor learning mechanisms across spatial and temporal scales, describing how neural networks are remodeled at the level of synapses, cell types, and circuits and across time as animals' learn new skills. It highlights how changes at each scale contribute to the evolving structure and function of neural circuits that accompanies the expansion and refinement of motor skills. We review new findings highlighted by advanced imaging techniques that have opened new vistas in optical physiology and neuroanatomy, revealing the complexity and adaptability of motor cortical circuits, crucial for learning and control. At the structural level, we explore the dynamic regulation of dendritic spines mediating corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs to the motor cortex. We delve into the role of perisynaptic astrocyte processes in maintaining synaptic stability during learning. We also examine the functional diversity among pyramidal neuron subtypes, their dendritic computations and unique contributions to single cell and network function. Further, we highlight how cortical activation is characterized by increased consistency and reduced strength as new movements are learned and how external inputs contribute to these changes. Finally, we consider the motor cortex's necessity as movements unfold over long time scales. These insights will continue to drive new research directions, enhancing our understanding of motor cortical circuit transformations that underpin behavioral changes expressed throughout an animal's life.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/40/e1234242024?rss=1">Challenges and Approaches in the Study of Neural Entrainment</a></h4>

              
                <p>When exposed to rhythmic stimulation, the human brain displays rhythmic activity across sensory modalities and regions. Given the ubiquity of this phenomenon, how sensory rhythms are transformed into neural rhythms remains surprisingly inconclusive. An influential model posits that endogenous oscillations entrain to external rhythms, thereby encoding environmental dynamics and shaping perception. However, research on neural entrainment faces multiple challenges, from ambiguous definitions to methodological difficulties when endogenous oscillations need to be identified and disentangled from other stimulus-related mechanisms that can lead to similar phase-locked responses. Yet, recent years have seen novel approaches to overcome these challenges, including computational modeling, insights from dynamical systems theory, sophisticated stimulus designs, and study of neuropsychological impairments. This review outlines key challenges in neural entrainment research, delineates state-of-the-art approaches, and integrates findings from human and animal neurophysiology to provide a broad perspective on the usefulness, validity, and constraints of oscillatory models in brain&ndash;environment interaction.</p>
