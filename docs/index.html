              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Global Motor Inhibition Precedes Stuttering Events</a></h4>

              
                Research points to neurofunctional differences underlying fluent speech production in stutterers and non-stutterers. There has been considerably less work focusing on the processes that underlie stuttered speech, primarily due to the difficulty of reliably eliciting stuttering in the unnatural contexts associated with neuroimaging experiments. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to test the hypothesis that stuttering events result from global motor inhibition -a "freeze" response typically characterized by increased beta power in nodes of the action-stopping network. We leveraged a novel clinical interview to develop participant-specific stimuli in order to elicit a comparable amount of stuttered and fluent trials. Twenty-nine adult stutterers participated. The paradigm included a cue prior to a go signal, which allowed us to isolate processes associated with stuttered and fluent trials prior to speech initiation. During this pre-speech time window, stuttered trials were associated with greater beta power in the right pre-supplementary motor area, a key node in the action-stopping network, compared to fluent trials. Beta power in the right pre-supplementary area was related to a clinical measure of stuttering severity. We also found that anticipated words identified independently by participants were stuttered more often than those generated by the researchers, which were based on the participants' reported anticipated sounds. This suggests that global motor inhibition results from stuttering anticipation. This study represents the largest comparison of stuttered and fluent speech to date. The findings provide a foundation for clinical trials that test the efficacy of neuromodulation on stuttering. Moreover, our study demonstrates the feasibility of using our approach for eliciting stuttering during MEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments so that the neurobiological bases of stuttered speech can be further elucidated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception of dynamic facial expressions activates a cortico-subcortico-cerebellar network in marmosets</a></h4>

              
                The perception and identification of faces and facial emotional expressions are critical for social communication in the daily life of all primates. Here, we investigated the neural network activated by dynamic facial expressions in awake New World common marmosets with ultra-high field fMRI at 9.4T. Our results show that dynamic facial expressions activate several areas along the occipitotemporal axis (V2/V3, V4/TEO, FST, caudal TE, rostral TE, TPO), frontal cortex (areas 45/47, 13, 8a and orbital cortex), amygdala, motion-sensitive areas, premotor area, and in the posterior lobe of the cerebellum. Negative faces increased the monkeys' respiration rates and elicited stronger responses along the occipitotemporal cortical axis, in the amygdala and in the hypothalamus. This cortico-subcortico-cerebellar network may play an important role in the perception of behaviorally relevant facial expressions that are vital for social communication in marmosets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels regulates the velocity of backpropagating action potentials in cortical pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated sodium channels located in axon initial segments (AIS) trigger action potentials (AP) and play pivotal roles in the excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons. The differential electrophysiological properties and distributions of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 channels lead to distinct contributions to AP initiation and backpropagation. While NaV1.6 at the distal AIS promotes AP initiation and forward propagation, NaV1.2 at the proximal AIS promotes backpropagation of APs to the soma. Here, we show the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway modulates persistent sodium current (INaP) generation at the AIS to increase neuronal gain and the speed of backpropagation. Since SUMO does not affect NaV1.6, these effects were attributed to SUMOylation of NaV1.2. Moreover, SUMO effects were absent in a mouse engineered to express NaV1.2-Lys38Gln channels that lack the site for SUMO linkage. Thus, SUMOylation of NaV1.2 exclusively controls INaP generation and AP backpropagation, thereby playing a prominent role in synaptic integration and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-type specific effects of somatostatin on corticocortical information processing in the anterior cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory modulation of glutamatergic information processing is a prerequisite for proper network function. Among the many groups of interneurons, somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM-INs) seem to play an important role in the maintenance of physiological brain activity. We have previously shown that bath application of somatostatin (SOM) causes a reduction in pyramidal cell (PC) excitability. However, the mechanisms of action of the peptide on cortical synaptic circuits are still unclear. To gain further insight into the function of SOM-INs, we analyzed the effect of SOM on synaptic transmission in PCs, in SOM-INs and in layer 1 interneurons (L1-INs) of the anterior cingulate cortex. We found that SOM produced pronounced postsynaptic effects in PCs while having little or no postsynaptic effects on either IN type. Accordingly, it is proposed here, that SOM - by acting differentially on SOM-INs and L1-INs - increases spontaneous GABAergic transmission, while at the same time, decreasing spontaneous glutamatergic transmission. In addition, we show that SOM specifically modulates GABAB receptor (GABABR)-mediated synaptic transmission but has little effect on GABAA receptor-mediated (GABAAR) transmission.

                <p><b>Brain Sciences, Vol. 12, Pages 1028: Creativity, Eye-Movement Abnormalities, and Aesthetic Appreciation of Magritte&amp;rsquo;s Paintings</b></p>

	<p>Dyslexic children have been shown to be more creative than their non-dyslexic counterparts. They have also been shown to have an abnormal oculomotor profile while viewing targets in free space, making vergence or saccadic eye movements while reading or when viewing Op art. They show a slower deceleration of their eye movements and a difficulty in coordinating their two eyes to obtain single fused vision in depth. Interestingly, their abnormal oculo-motor profile is exacerbated while reading more difficult texts. Given these differences, we postulate that dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; increased creativity may be related to their different eye movement control affecting how they perceive the world. Therefore, we decided to measure adolescent dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; creativity, oculomotor profile, and subjective responses while they viewed three paintings by Magritte. These were chosen to stimulate the perception of hidden conceptual spaces or stimulate conflict between the perception of the figural and textural content. For the first time to our knowledge, dyslexic adolescents were demonstrated to be more creative in terms of flexibility and fluidity than their non-dyslexic peers. Subjectively, while viewing the Magritte paintings, dyslexics reported fewer conceptual spaces and fewer hidden words than their non-dyslexic peers; thus, they confabulated less than non-dyslexics. Dyslexics also demonstrated an abnormal oculomotor profile similar to those that we have shown when reading, viewing randomized targets, and while perceiving illusions of depth in Op art paintings, in that they demonstrated difficulty with disconjugation and abnormalities in their eye velocity profiles. We propose there may be a link between dyslexic increased creativity and their eye movement abnormalities. Similar to reading nonsense text, we propose that Magritte&amp;amp;rsquo;s contradictory paintings exacerbate dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; eye movement abnormalities. These eye movement abnormalities while viewing these particular paintings might provide a physiological signature suggesting a contribution of their unusual eye control to their higher creativity scores.</p>

	<p>Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) linked by tight junctions play important roles in cerebral ischemia. Intercellular signaling via extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an underappreciated mode of cell&amp;amp;ndash;cell crosstalk. This study aims to explore the potential function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in BMECs&amp;amp;rsquo; secreted EVs. We subjected primary human and rat BMECs to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). EVs were enriched for RNA sequencing. A comparison of the sequencing results revealed 146 upregulated lncRNAs and 331 downregulated lncRNAs in human cells and 1215 upregulated lncRNAs and 1200 downregulated lncRNAs in rat cells. Next, we analyzed the genes that were coexpressed with the differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs on chromosomes and performed Gene Ontology (GO) and signaling pathway enrichment analyses. The results showed that the lncRNAs may play roles in apoptosis, the TNF signaling pathway, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Next, three conserved lncRNAs between humans and rats were analyzed and confirmed using PCR. The binding proteins of these three lncRNAs in human astrocytes were identified via RNA pulldown and mass spectrometry. These proteins could regulate mRNA stability and translation. Additionally, the lentivirus was used to upregulate them in human microglial HMC3 cells. The results showed NR_002323.2 induced microglial M1 activation. Therefore, these results suggest that BMECs&amp;amp;rsquo; EVs carry the lncRNAs, which may regulate gliocyte function after cerebral ischemia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An adapted behavioural activation intervention (DiaDeM) for people with diabetes and depression in South Asia: A feasibility study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The burden of depression is a rapidly growing problem worldwide. Its prevalence is particularly high among individuals with chronic physical conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), precipitating poorer health outcomes. There is a lack of evidence around treatments that can work among such groups, particularly in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). This study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted Behavioural Activation (BA) intervention (DiaDeM) for people with T2DM and depression in two LMICs in South Asia. Methods: A multicentre, randomised-controlled feasibility trial will be conducted from March 2022 to February 2023. We will recruit 128 adults from health facilities in Bangladesh and Pakistan with a diagnosis of T2DM and depression. Using a 1:1 allocation ratio, consenting individuals will be randomised to either optimised usual care or the DiaDeM intervention. The latter will involve six face-to-face or remotely delivered BA sessions conducted by non-mental health facilitators over six to twelve weeks. Participants will be followed up at three and six months post-randomisation. Feasibility outcomes include the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and retention, the feasibility of intervention delivery and the feasibility of data collection at baseline and follow-up (including economic data). An embedded mixed-methods process evaluation will also be carried out to inform the main trial. Conclusions: BA is a low resource intervention for depression treatment that can be optimised for delivery in LMIC settings such as South Asia. The planned feasibility trial will directly inform a larger trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such an intervention in people with T2DM and depression. It will also contribute to the wider evidence base around BA in patients with chronic physical illnesses, with particular relevance to South Asian, as well as wider LMIC regions and populations. Trial registration: ISRCTN 75501608

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Observation of SARS-CoV-2 genome characteristics and clinical manifestations within eight family clusters from GH and GK clades in Jakarta, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 rapid mutation generates many concerning new strains. Although lockdown had been applied to contain the disease, the household remains a critical place for its transmission. This study aimed to assess the variation of SARS-CoV-2 strains and their clinical manifestations within family clusters in Jakarta, Indonesia. Method: Naso-oropharyngeal swab specimens from family clusters positive for SARS-CoV-2 were collected for whole-genome sequencing. Their baseline data, symptoms, and source of infection were recorded. The whole-genome data was then analyzed with the bioinformatics program to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 genome characteristic and submitted to GISAID for strain identification. The phylogenetic tree was built to observe the relationship between virus strain within the family cluster and its clinical manifestation. Result: This study obtained eight family clusters from twenty-two patients. Half of the cluster's source of infection was a family member who had to work at the office. The infection rate ranged from 37.5% to 100%. The phylogenetic tree showed that the same virus within a cluster could generate various clinical outcomes. Five clusters had one family member with pneumonia, while others had mild to no symptoms. Four breakthrough cases were detected in this study, which were infected by the virus from GH and GK clade.  Conclusion: Our study observed the SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the household setting through the workplace, which might become a common pathway if the pandemic status is removed. Although vaccination is expected to reduce the burden of COVID-19, adequate control measures remain essential, given that breakthrough infections are evident.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lupeol and pristimerin do not inhibit activation of the human sperm CatSper Ca(2+)-channel [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Opposing findings have been published on the regulation of the sperm-specific Ca2+ channel CatSper (cation channel of sperm) in human sperm cells by the plant triterpenoids lupeol and pristimerin. While the original study on this topic found these triterpenoids to act as potent inhibitors of human CatSper, subsequent studies have failed to replicate such an inhibitory effect. It has been suggested that these issues could in part be due to purity issues and/or batch variation between the plant-derived extracts of lupeol and pristimerin obtained for the studies. The aim of this study was to elucidate this controversy by investigating the batches of lupeol and pristimerin used in our previous study with state-of-the-art 1H-, 13C- and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to reveal potential purity and/or batch variation issues. When comparing the NMR-spectra obtained from 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR with previously published NMR-spectra for lupeol and pristimerin, we could confirm that both the lupeol and pristimerin batch were ≥95 % pure. These results confirm the validity of the findings in our previous study for lupeol and pristimerin, showing that lupeol and pristimerin do not inhibit activation of CatSper in human sperm. In conclusion, using 1H-, 13C- and 2D-NMR methods, we confirm that the lupeol and pristimerin batches used in our previous study were ≥95 % pure and thereby fail to identify any purity issues and/or batch variation that could explain the observed inability of lupeol and pristimerin to inhibit activation of CatSper in human sperm.

                Background: Leptomeningeal metastasis is an infrequent form of cancer expression, and it has a poor prognosis due to its torpid evolution and its challenging diagnosis. Case report: We report the case of a 68-year-old woman with rapidly progressing cognitive decline and focal epilepsy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive gyriform hypersignal in the right precentral sulcus region, without mass effect, tenuous contrast uptake, and hydrocephalus with transependymal edema. The body tomographic study was negative for solid cancer and the 18F-FDG PET-CT revealed a severe hypermetabolism in the right lung upper lobe. These findings were suggestive of lung cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis. We performed a brain biopsy, finding atypical cells in the leptomeningeal region with positive immunohistochemical staining for CK7 and negative for CK20 corresponding to lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was evaluated in the oncology service and scheduled for radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusions: Focal leptomeningeal disease is an entity that should be considered as a differential diagnosis in all cases of focal leptomeningitis. Timely diagnosis and adequate cancer management can increase patient survival.

                In correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), the fluorescent images must be registered to the EM images with high precision. Due to the different contrast of EM and fluorescence images, automated correlation-based alignment is not directly possible, and registration is often done by hand using a fluorescent stain, or semi-automatically with fiducial markers. We introduce “DeepCLEM”, a fully automated CLEM registration workflow. A convolutional neural network predicts the fluorescent signal from the EM images, which is then automatically registered to the experimentally measured chromatin signal from the sample using correlation-based alignment. The complete workflow is available as a Fiji plugin and could in principle be adapted for other imaging modalities as well as for 3D stacks.

                Background: A high rate of student abuse has been reported in various studies; however, few studies substantiate the seriousness of the issue in Latin American contexts. This study aimed to characterize the abuse of university students in five Latin American countries and its association with student satisfaction.   Methods: An analytical transversal study was conducted, in which 2,141 undergraduate students from Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama were surveyed. A validated questionnaire was applied to evaluate four types of abuse (Cronbach's Alpha: 0.90): psychological, physical, academic, and sexual. In addition, students’ perception of satisfaction of four items in the university environment (Cronbach's Alpha: 0.85) was also analyzed.   Results: It was found that the older students were, the more dissatisfied they were with “logistics” (aPR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.04; p-value; 0.014) and the top-third segment of those who perceived “sexual abuse” were more dissatisfied with the teaching provided by their universities (aPR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.00-1.52; p-value: 0.048). Moreover, those who were most dissatisfied with the agreements were part of the top-third segment of those who perceived sexual abuse (aPR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.32; p-value: 0.016) and those in the country of Panama were less dissatisfied with “agreements” (RPa: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.66-0.073; p-value<0.001). The countries of Colombia (aPR: 0.08; IC95%: 0.01-0.59; p-value: 0.014) and Panama (aPR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.52-0.64; p-value<0.001) were less dissatisfied with investigation programs.   Conclusions: The perception of ‘sexual abuse’ was the only risk factor statistically associated with dissatisfaction with teaching and agreements.

                We report a rare case of a vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula (VVAVF) manifesting as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 76-year-old female patient presented with progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, fasciculation, and preserved deep tendon reflexes in the right upper limb. Electrophysiological testing showed lower motor neuron dysfunction. The patient was suspected to have ALS, but cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed enlarged blood vessels in the spinal canal, which compressed the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots. Angiography showed a shunt from the right vertebral artery to the right intervertebral vein and the vertebral venous plexus; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with VVAVF. Transarterial embolization was performed to obliterate the shunt, and weakness in the patient’s right upper limb subsequently improved. It is worth considering VVAVF as a differential diagnosis of ALS-like diseases.

                Background: The purpose of this work is to study the prospects of using charity lotteries as a marketing tool for involving consumers and employees in charitable activities. Methods: The research methodology is based on the principles of the theory of planned behavior by Ajzen. Results: The study confirmed that behavioral intention is correlated with actual behavior. Subjective norms factors have the most significant influence on behavioral intention. Conclusions: Correlation analysis allowed us to establish a weak effect of socio-demographic characteristics (Age, Gender, Capital Status, Ownership of Home, Educational Qualification, Employment, Annual Income) on behavior. The experience of participating in the lottery in the past also turned out to be insignificant. There is reason to believe that Russian consumers' decision to participate in the charity lottery is impulsive or due to pressure from their surroundings.

                Background: A pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a common benign vascular lesion found in the oral cavity. The gold standard treatment of this lesion, comprising surgical excision and the elimination of etiological factors, cannot avoid tooth loss in the case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Because of the prominent properties of 980 nm and 635 nm diode lasers in photocoagulation and photobiomodulation, we applied these wavelengths in the treatment of a large pyogenic granuloma with alveolar bone loss. Case presentation: Our objective was to use a combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and laser-assisted new attachment procedure (LANAP) to preserve the teeth and periodontal tissue in a case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Results: The patient was a 13-year-old Thai male with a pyogenic granuloma involving the interdental papilla and lingual gingiva of the lower left first and second molars. The teeth were also displaced by the lesion. After treatment with three sessions of photocoagulation, three sessions of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and two sessions of LANAP, the lesion was completely resolved. The periodontal status of the teeth was improved at the six-month follow-up. Conclusion: The combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and LANAP was able to treat an aggressive pyogenic granuloma with tooth preservation.

                Background: Most HIV-positive adults in Kenya with prior non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) failure are currently on ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r). Dolutegravir (DTG) has shown good efficacy among treatment-experienced adults. Objective: Our study is the first to evaluate the efficacy of switching from ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) to DTG among virally suppressed adults with prior NNRTI failure and with no knowledge of susceptibility to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Methods: This open-label, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial was conducted at four sites in Kenya. Virally suppressed HIV-1 positive adults (≥ 18 years) on a second-line regimen of PI/r and 2 NRTIs were randomized (1:1) to switch to DTG or continue their pre-enrollment PI/r. The primary endpoint is proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48 with a 4% non-inferiority margin. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04229290. Results: Between Feb 10 and Sep 3, 2020, 1,114 adults were screened, 795 were randomized and 791 treated (397 DTG, 394 baseline PI/r). All participants were black, 66.3% were female, median age was 46 years, and median CD4 count was 423 cells/μl. Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities at baseline included 44.6% with reduced creatinine clearance and 9.7% with elevated lipids. Conclusions: This is the first randomized trial evaluating a switch strategy from PI/r to DTG for virally suppressed adults who have previously failed NNRTI, and is expected to provide critical evidence to inform large HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa. We found high rates of baseline laboratory abnormalities that were not detected during routine care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Making European performance and impact assessment frameworks for research infrastructures glocal [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Sustainability of research infrastructures (RIs) is a big challenge for funders, stakeholders and operators, and the development and adoption of adequate management tools is a major concern, namely tools for monitoring and evaluating their performance and impact. BioData.pt is the Portuguese Infrastructure of Biological and Portuguese node of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures "Landmark" ELIXIR. The foundations of this national research infrastructure were laid under the “Building BioData.pt” project, for four years. During this period, performance and impact indicators were collected and analysed under the light of international guidelines for assessing the performance and impact of European research infrastructures produced by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU-funded RI-PATHS project. The exercise shared herein showed that these frameworks can be adopted by national RIs, with the necessary adaptations, namely to reflect the national landscape and specificity of activities, and can be powerful tools in supporting the management of RIs. “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted, counts”.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A model of coercive control in higher education: a qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A growing body of research indicates that psychological coercive control poses a threat in academic environments. Little is known, however, about the process, the dynamics, and the phases used to impose silently a variety of non-violent assaults on students and academics. A lack of awareness of coercive intimidation and psychological coercive control obstructs a student’s path to academic achievement, which can have an impact on his or her emotional and mental well-being and diminishes the prosperity of society.   Methods: A methodological selection and review of the scientific literature, theories, and practice on psychological intimidation, coercive control, and systems thinking has been employed in this study. A comprehensive reflective analysis and critical synthesis of the relevant scientific literature were conducted to gain insight into the design of a model of psychological coercive control applicable to educational environments.   Results: This article identifies gaps in research theory and practice and examines critical issues of intimidation and psychological coercive control that is relevant to educational contexts. The article proposes a conceptual model of psychological coercive control as a direction for further research.   Conclusions: Adequate awareness, models, and training programmes in relation to coercive infiltration are missing at higher education institutions. There is an urgent need for a curriculum change that may serve to promote support systems thinking and security awareness in educational environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Wessex Fit-4-Cancer Surgery Trial (WesFit): a protocol for a factorial-design, pragmatic randomised-controlled trial investigating the effects of a multi-modal prehabilitation programme in patients undergoing elective major intra–cavity cancer surgery</a></h4>

              
                Background: Surgical resection remains the primary curative treatment for intra-cavity cancer. Low physical fitness and psychological factors such as depression are predictive of post–operative morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. Prolonged post-operative morbidity is associated with persistently elevated risk of premature death. We aim to investigate whether a structured, responsive exercise training programme, a psychological support programme or combined exercise and psychological support, delivered between treatment decision and major intra-cavity surgery for cancer, can reduce length of hospital stay, compared with standard care. Methods: WesFit is a pragmatic, 2x2 factorial-design, multi-centre, randomised-controlled trial, with planned recruitment of N=1560. Participants will be randomised to one of four groups. Group 1 (control) will receive usual pre-operative care, Group 2 (exercise) patients will undergo 2/3 aerobic, high-intensity interval training sessions per week supervised by personal trainers. Group 3 (psychological support) patients are offered 1 session per week at a local cancer support centre. Group 4 will receive both exercise and psychological support. All patients undergo baseline and pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing, complete self-report questionnaires and will be followed up at 30 days, 12 weeks and 12 months post-operatively. Primary outcome is post-operative length-of-stay. Secondary outcomes include disability-adjusted survival at 1-year postoperatively, post-operative morbidity, and health-related quality of life. Exploratory investigations include objectively measured changes in physical fitness assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test, disease-free and overall mortality at 1-year postoperatively, longer-term physical activity behaviour change, pre-operative radiological tumour regression, pathological tumour regression, pre and post-operative body composition analysis, health economics analysis and nutritional characterisation and its relationship to post-operative outcome. Conclusions: The WesFit trial will be a randomised controlled study investigating whether a high-intensity exercise training programme +/- psychological intervention results in improvements in clinical and patient reported outcomes in patients undergoing major inter-cavity resection of cancer.

                Background: The objective of this study was to test the validity of automated audiometry as a method of hearing examination in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Methods: This was a cross-sectional comparative study with a retrospective approach, using patient medical records. Patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were recruited based-on medical records that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria at the Pulmonology outpatient unit, then referred to the Otorhinolaryngology outpatient unit of the Dr. Soetomo Academic Medical Center. The subjects’ hearing function was measured with two different devices (automated audiometer and conventional audiometer) before being given anti-tuberculosis drug therapy (aminoglycoside injection) as ototoxicity monitoring from July to December 2019 period. Sensitivity and specificity analysis was used to assess the validity of the test. Results: A total of 36 patients (72 ears) were included. The comparison test results using the Mann-Whitney test showed that there were significant differences between automated audiometry and conventional audiometry in both ears. Analysis values were: sensitivity 80-97%, specificity 37-96%, positive predictive value 74-98%, and negative predictive value 59-96%. Conclusions: Automated audiometry is valid for use as a method of hearing examination and monitoring in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Role of transesophageal echocardiography in a patient with an initially misdiagnosed acute pulmonary embolism [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, chest computerized tomography (CT) angiography is considered as the gold standard. However, echocardiography could be useful especially in cases of high suspicion with normal CT scan or for patient with hemodynamic instability. Case presentation: We present a case of a 47-year-old man admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability 24 hours after closed fracture of the right leg. Before his admission, a thoracic CT angiography was done but did not show any sign of acute pulmonary embolism. During the first hours, he presented a bad evolution with a respiratory status which failed to respond to high dose of vasopressor, oxide nitric and ventilatory support. Therefore, due to the poor echocardiographic window, transesophageal echocardiography examination was done in emergency. It revealed high-probability diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism based on right ventricular dysfunction and the presence of thrombus in the right pulmonary artery. Anticoagulant therapy (non-fractioned heparin) was administrated immediately achieving a favorable clinical outcome with rapid withdrawal of dobutamine, nitric oxide and norepinephrine. Conclusions: This case illustrates the fundamental role of transesophageal echocardiography in a critically ill patient with shock due to high-probability pulmonary embolism. Echocardiography allows the initiation of adequate treatment without further delay.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of contact tracing surveillance for COVID-19 among healthcare workers in secondary referral hospital, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Tracing and screening cases among healthcare workers are essential to overcome the spread of COVID-19. We held surveillance at the second-referral hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia, to inspect the associating factors of infected HCWs. Methods: From 776 HCWs, we conducted a structured retrospective review of all COVID-19-confirmed HCWs and ones having contact with COVID-19 patients between February-July 2021. We associated general characteristics (i.e age, gender, working sites, etc) of the sample with the positive cases, analyzed the vaccination status, then did bivariate and multivariate regression logistic analyses to determine related factors putting HCWs at risk for COVID-19 infection.   Results: Bivariate analysis significantly revealed that 72.86% patients had a close contact (OR = 2.61; p<0.05), with medical staffs as the most frequent source (85.71%; OR = 2.19; p=0.033), for > 15 minutes contact duration (90%; OR = 1.1; p<0.05). Healthcare workers wearing proper PPE (N-95 and face shields) were significantly less exposed to COVID-19 (OR = 0.47; p<0.05; and OR = 0.46; p<0.05). Even fully-vaccinated samples were still prone to infection. (OR=1.25; p= 0.042). Common symptoms consisted of fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and vomiting (p=0.025l p=0.002; p<0.05; p=0.002). Multivariate regression logistic analysis disclosed that the use of N95 masks, contact duration >15 minutes, and the vaccine were the most influential factors (aOR = 1.72. 95% CI (1.029-2.88); aOR = 3.92. 95% CI (1.75-8.78); aOR = 0.39. 95% CI (0.13-0.82 )) Conclusions: Close contact, lack of compliance in wearing N95 masks, and unvaccinated status are risk factors for COVID-19 exposure to HCWs; thus, to achieve maximum prevention of intra-hospital transmission, the use of N-95 masks, contact avoidance, and vaccination, along with immediate tracing and strict health-protocols are all compulsory.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of coffee on contralateral suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coffee is a popular non-alcoholic beverage consumed by humans across the world. It contains caffeine, which is a type of stimulant of the central nervous system. In the auditory system, it has a positive effect on auditory brainstem response and perception of speech in noise. Further, caffeine has an inhibitory effect in the cochlea, but studies have rarely investigated its effect on otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) in humans. OAEs are low-intensity sounds produced by the cochlea, which could be recorded in the ear canal. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of coffee on transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and contralateral suppression of TEOAE. Method: A total of 52 young adults participated in the study. A cross-over study design was used for the present investigation. The TEOAE and contralateral suppression of TEOAE were recorded before and after consumption of coffee and milk. The contralateral suppression of TEOAE was measured by presenting white noise to the contralateral ear at 40, 50, and 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL). Results: The mean amplitude of TEOAE before and after consumption of coffee was similar in both ears. Further, the mean contralateral suppression of TEOAE was slightly larger after consumption of coffee in both ears. However, the mean difference was not significant in both the ears. Conclusions: Based on the findings of present study, coffee has no significant effect on the amplitude of TEOAE and contralateral suppression of TEOAE.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">An inhibitory brainstem input to dopamine neurons encodes nicotine aversion</a></h4>

              
                Liu, Tose et al. reveal that a high dose of nicotine causes behavioral aversion and reduces dopamine release in the lateral nucleus accumbens through α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on an inhibitory brainstem input. Suppressing this input to dopamine neurons prevents the reduction of dopamine release and behavioral aversion to nicotine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Artificial selection methods from evolutionary computing show promise for directed evolution of microbes</a></h4>

              
                Directed microbial evolution harnesses evolutionary processes in the laboratory to construct microorganisms with enhanced or novel functional traits. Attempting to direct evolutionary processes for applied goals is fundamental to evolutionary computation, which harnesses the principles of Darwinian evolution as a general purpose search engine for solutions to challenging computational problems. Despite their overlapping approaches, artificial selection methods from evolutionary computing are not commonly applied to living systems in the laboratory. In this work, we ask if parent selection algorithms-procedures for choosing promising progenitors-from evolutionary computation might be useful for directing the evolution of microbial populations when selecting for multiple functional traits. To do so, we introduce an agent-based model of directed microbial evolution, which we used to evaluate how well three selection algorithms from evolutionary computing (tournament selection, lexicase selection, and non-dominated elite selection) performed relative to methods commonly used in the laboratory (elite and top-10% selection). We found that multi-objective selection techniques from evolutionary computing (lexicase and non-dominated elite) generally outperformed the commonly used directed evolution approaches when selecting for multiple traits of interest. Our results motivate ongoing work transferring these multi-objective selection procedures into the laboratory and a continued evaluation of more sophisticated artificial selection methods.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrated analyses of growth differentiation Factor-15 concentration and cardiometabolic diseases in humans</a></h4>

              
                Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a stress response cytokine that is elevated in several cardiometabolic diseases and has attracted interest as a potential therapeutic target. To further explore the association of GDF15 with human disease, we conducted a broad study into the phenotypic and genetic correlates of GDF15 concentration in up to 14,099 individuals. Assessment of 772 traits across 6,610 participants in FINRISK identified associations of GDF15 concentration with a range of phenotypes including all-cause mortality, cardiometabolic disease, respiratory diseases and psychiatric disorders as well as inflammatory markers. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of GDF15 concentration across 3 different assay platforms (n=14,099) confirmed significant heterogeneity due to a common missense variant rs1058587 in <i>GDF15</i>, potentially due to epitope-binding artefacts. After conditioning on rs1058587, statistical fine-mapping identified 4 independent putative causal signals at the locus. Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis found evidence of a causal relationship between GDF15 concentration and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) but not body mass index (BMI). Using reverse MR, we identified a potential causal association of BMI on GDF15 (IVW <i>p</i><sub>FDR</sub>=0.0040). Taken together, our data do not support a role for elevated GDF15 concentrations as a causal factor in human cardiometabolic disease but support its role as a biomarker of metabolic stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Disruption in structural-functional network repertoire and time-resolved subcortical fronto-temporoparietal connectivity in disorders of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Understanding recovery of consciousness and elucidating its underlying mechanism is believed to be crucial in the field of basic neuroscience and medicine. Ideas such as the global neuronal workspace and the mesocircuit theory hypothesize that failure of recovery in conscious states coincide with loss of connectivity between subcortical and frontoparietal areas, a loss of the repertoire of functional networks states and metastable brain activation. We adopted a time-resolved functional connectivity framework to explore these ideas and assessed the repertoire of functional network states as a potential marker of consciousness and its potential ability to tell apart patients in the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). In addition, prediction of these functional network states by underlying hidden spatial patterns in the anatomical network, i.e. so-called eigenmodes, were supplemented as potential markers. By analysing time-resolved functional connectivity from functional MRI data, we demonstrated a reduction of metastability and functional network repertoire in UWS compared to MCS patients. This was expressed in terms of diminished dwell times and loss of nonstationarity in the default mode network and subcortical fronto-temporoparietal network in UWS compared to MCS patients. We further demonstrated that these findings co-occurred with a loss of dynamic interplay between structural eigenmodes and emerging time-resolved functional connectivity in UWS. These results are, amongst others, in support of the global neuronal workspace theory and the mesocircuit hypothesis, underpinning the role of time-resolved thalamo-cortical connections and metastability in the recovery of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutamine metabolism modulates chondrocyte inflammatory response</a></h4>

              
                Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease in the world with significant societal consequences, but lacks effective disease modifying interventions. The pathophysiology consists of a prominent inflammatory component that can be targeted to prevent cartilage degradation and structural defects. Intracellular metabolism has emerged as a culprit of the inflammatory response in chondrocytes, with both processes co-regulating each other. The role of glutamine metabolism in chondrocytes, especially in the context of inflammation, lacks a thorough understanding and is the focus of this work. We display that mouse chondrocytes utilize glutamine for energy production and anabolic processes. Furthermore, we show that glutamine deprivation itself causes metabolic reprogramming and decreases the inflammatory response of chondrocytes through inhibition of NF-κB activity. Finally, we display that glutamine deprivation promotes autophagy and that ammonia is an inhibitor of autophagy. Overall, we identify a relationship between glutamine metabolism and inflammatory signaling and display the need for increased study of chondrocyte metabolic systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A paternal bias in germline mutation is widespread in amniotes and can arise independently of cell divisions</a></h4>

              
                In humans and other mammals, germline mutations are more likely to arise in fathers than in mothers. Although this sex bias has long been attributed to DNA replication errors in spermatogenesis, recent evidence from humans points to the importance of mutagenic processes that do not depend on cell division, calling into question our understanding of this basic phenomenon. Here, we infer the ratio of paternal-to-maternal mutations, α, in 42 species of amniotes, from putatively neutral substitution rates of sex chromosomes and autosomes. Despite marked differences in gametogenesis, physiologies and environments across species, fathers consistently contribute more mutations than mothers in all the species examined, including mammals, birds and reptiles. In mammals, α is as high as 4 and correlates with generation times; in birds and snakes, α appears more stable around 2. These observations are consistent with a simple model, in which mutations accrue at equal rates in both sexes during early development and at a higher rate in the male germline after sexual differentiation, with a conserved paternal-to-maternal ratio across species. Thus, α may reflect the relative contributions of two or more developmental phases to total germline mutations, and is expected to depend on generation time even if mutations do not track cell divisions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genomic epidemiology of the first two waves of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada</a></h4>

              
                Tracking the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using phylogenetics has proven critical to inform the timing and stringency of COVID-19 public health interventions. We investigated the effectiveness of international travel restrictions at reducing SARS-CoV-2 importations and transmission in Canada in the first two waves of 2020 and early 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were used to infer viruses’ geographic origins, enabling identification of 2263 (95% confidence interval: 2159–2366) introductions, including 680 (658–703) Canadian sublineages, which are international introductions resulting in sampled Canadian descendants, and 1582 (1501–1663) singletons, introductions with no sampled descendants. Of the sublineages seeded during the first wave, 49% (46–52%) originated from the USA and were primarily introduced into Quebec (39%) and Ontario (36%), while in the second wave, the USA was still the predominant source (43%), alongside a larger contribution from India (16%) and the UK (7%). Following implementation of restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals on 21 March 2020, importations declined from 58.5 (50.4–66.5) sublineages per week to 10.3-fold (8.3–15.0) lower within 4 weeks. Despite the drastic reduction in viral importations following travel restrictions, newly seeded sublineages in summer and fall 2020 contributed to the persistence of COVID-19 cases in the second wave, highlighting the importance of sustained interventions to reduce transmission. Importations rebounded further in November, bringing newly emergent variants of concern (VOCs). By the end of February 2021, there had been an estimated 30 (19–41) B.1.1.7 sublineages imported into Canada, which increasingly displaced previously circulating sublineages by the end of the second wave.Although viral importations are nearly inevitable when global prevalence is high, with fewer importations there are fewer opportunities for novel variants to spark outbreaks or outcompete previously circulating lineages.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Focal seizures are organized by feedback between neural activity and ion concentration changes</a></h4>

              
                Human and animal EEG data demonstrate that focal seizures start with low-voltage fast activity, evolve into rhythmic burst discharges and are followed by a period of suppressed background activity. This suggests that processes with dynamics in the range of tens of seconds govern focal seizure evolution. We investigate the processes associated with seizure dynamics by complementing the Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical model with the physical laws that dictate ion movement and maintain ionic gradients. Our biophysically realistic computational model closely replicates the electrographic pattern of a typical human focal seizure characterized by low voltage fast activity onset, tonic phase, clonic phase and postictal suppression. Our study demonstrates, for the first time <i>in silico</i>, the potential mechanism of seizure initiation by inhibitory interneurons via the initial build-up of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> due to intense interneuronal spiking. The model also identifies ionic mechanisms that may underlie a key feature in seizure dynamics, i.e., progressive slowing down of ictal discharges towards the end of seizure. Our model prediction of specific scaling of inter-burst intervals is confirmed by seizure data recorded in the whole guinea pig brain in vitro and in humans, suggesting that the observed termination pattern may hold across different species. Our results emphasize ionic dynamics as elementary processes behind seizure generation and indicate targets for new therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of motion in the neural representation of social interactions in the posterior temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans are an inherently social species, with multiple focal brain regions sensitive to various visual social cues such as faces, bodies, and biological motion. More recently, research has begun to investigate how the brain responds to more complex, naturalistic social scenes, identifying a region in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (SI-pSTS; i.e., social interaction pSTS), among others, as an important region for processing social interaction. This research, however, has presented images or videos, and thus the contribution of motion to social interaction perception in these brain regions is not yet understood. In the current study, 22 participants viewed videos, image sequences, scrambled image sequences and static images of either social interactions or non-social independent actions. Combining univariate and multivariate analyses, we confirm that bilateral SI-pSTS plays a central role in dynamic social interaction perception but is much less involved when interactiveness is conveyed solely with static cues. Regions in the social brain, including SI-pSTS and extrastriate body area (EBA), showed sensitivity to both motion and interactive content. While SI-pSTS is somewhat more tuned to video interactions than is EBA, both bilateral SI-pSTS and EBA showed a greater response to social interactions compared to non-interactions and both regions responded more strongly to videos than static images. Indeed, both regions showed higher responses to interactions than independent actions in videos and intact sequences, but not in other conditions. Exploratory multivariate regression analyses suggest that selectivity for simple visual motion does not in itself drive interactive sensitivity in either SI-pSTS or EBA. Rather, selectivity for interactions expressed in point-light animations, and selectivity for static images of bodies, make positive and independent contributions to this effect across the LOTC region. Our results strongly suggest that EBA and SI-pSTS work together during dynamic interaction perception, at least when interactive information is conveyed primarily via body information. As such, our results are also in line with proposals of a third visual stream supporting dynamic social scene perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Idiosyncratic relation between human brain activity and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Human behavior is known to be idiosyncratic, yet research in neuroscience typically assumes a universal brain-behavior relationship. Here we test this assumption by estimating the level of idiosyncrasy in individual brain-behavior maps obtained using human neuroimaging. We first show that task-based activation maps are both stable within an individual and similar across people. Critically, although behavior-based activation maps are also stable within an individual, they strongly diverge across people. A computational model that jointly generates brain activity and behavior explains these results and reveals that within-person factors have much larger effect than group factors in determining behavior-based activations. These findings demonstrate that unlike task-based activity that is mostly similar among people, the relation between brain activity and behavioral outcomes is largely idiosyncratic. Thus, contrary to popular assumptions, group-level behavior-based maps reveal relatively little about each individual.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Processing of Different Social Scales in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                For an individual to lead a healthy and fulfilling social life, it is essential to have relationships with multiple people who are at different levels of emotional closeness. Based on ethological, sociological and psychological evidence, social networks have been divided into five scales of emotional closeness, gradually increasing in size and decreasing in emotional proximity. Is this division also reflected in different brain processes? During functional MRI, participants compared their emotional closeness to different members of their social network. We examined the brain area that was differentially activated for levels of emotional closeness, and found that its vast majority (78%) showed preference for people who are closest to participants, including the temporoparietal junction, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A different system, which includes the medial temporal lobe, retrosplenial cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed preference for all other social scales. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between brain responses to emotionally close people and smaller spaces (room, building) as well as between emotionally distant people and larger spaces (neighborhood, city). Finally, brain activity at the default mode network (DMN) was associated with social scale preference, such that its subnetwork DMN A, related to social processing, showed preference to closer social scales, while DMN C, related to spatiotemporal processing, showed preference to farther social scales. Our results show that the cognitive processing of a few intimately close people differs from the rest of the social network, emphasizing their crucial role in social life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcranial electrical stimulation modulates emotional experience and metabolites in the prefrontal cortex in a donation task</a></h4>

              
                In this study we investigated whether transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied to two prefrontal cortex regions, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC, anode) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, cathode) can be used to induce changes in self-reported emotions and modulate metabolite concentrations under both electrodes. We employed in vivo quantitative MR Spectroscopy (MRS) in healthy adult participants and quantified the changes in GABA and Glx complex (Glutamate and Glutamine) before and after five sessions of tDCS stimulation. tDCS was delivered at 2mA intensity for 20 minutes for the active group and 1 minute for the sham group. tDCS was applied over five days while participants were engaged in a charitable donation task, known to engage the reward network. We observed increased levels of GABA in vmPFC, but not in DLPFC. Glx levels were decreased in both vmPFC and DLPFC. We found that self-reported happiness increased significantly over time only in the active group. There was a decrease in self-reported guiltiness in both active and sham groups. Altogether, the results indicate that self-reported emotions can be modulated by prefrontal stimulation. This may be because the changes in GABA and Glx concentrations following repeated stimulation induce remote changes in the reward network through interactions with other metabolites, previously thought to be unreachable with noninvasive stimulation techniques.

                Objective assays of human cochlear synaptopathy have been equivocal. We posited relative changes in the cochlear summating potential (SP) may offer a superior biomarker for synaptic integrity. We recruited young, normal-hearing adults assigned to low- vs. high-risk groups based on their extended high-frequency (9-16 kHz) audiograms. SPs to paired-clicks with varying inter-click intervals isolated non-refractory receptor components of cochlear activity. We observed abrupt increases in SPs to paired- vs. single-clicks in high-risk listeners. Critically overexaggerated SP amplitudes also predicted speech-in-noise and subjective hearing abilities, suggesting relative SP changes to rapid clicks might help identify putative synaptopathic listeners with speech-listening difficulties.

                Craving reflects the subjective urge to use drugs and can be triggered by both positive and negative emotional states. However, no studies have systematically investigated the relative roles of these mechanisms in the pathophysiology of substance misuse or distinguished the mechanisms in individual vulnerability to substance use disorders. In the current study, we performed meta-analyses of drug cue-elicited reactivity and win and loss processing in the monetary incentive delay task to identify distinct neural correlates of appetitive and aversive responses during cue exposure. We then characterized the appetitive and aversive cue responses in seventy-six alcohol drinkers performing a cue craving task during fMRI. Imaging data were processed according to published routines. The appetitive circuit involved medial cortical regions and the ventral striatum, and the aversive circuit involved the insula, caudate and mid-cingulate cortex. We observed a significant correlation of beta estimates of cue-elicited activity of the appetitive and aversive circuit. However, individuals varied in appetitive and aversive cue responses. From the regression of appetitive (y) vs. aversive (x) beta estimates, we identified participants in the top 1/3 each of those with positive (n = 15) and negative (n = 11) residuals as 'approach' and 'avoidance' biotype, with the others as the 'mixed' biotype (n = 50). For clinical characteristics, the avoidance biotype showed higher sensitivity to punishment. In contrast, the approach biotype showed higher levels of sensation seeking and alcohol expectancy for social and physical pressure. The findings highlighted distinct neural underpinnings of appetitive and aversive components of cue-elicited reactivity and substantiated the importance of biotyping substance misuse.

                Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is characterized by spontaneous pain in the extremities. Incidence of DPN continues to rise with the global diabetes epidemic. However, there remains a lack of safe, effective analgesics to control this chronic painful condition. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) contain soma of sensory neurons and modulate sensory signal transduction into the central nervous system. In this study, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of changes in molecular pathways in the DRG of DPN patients with chronic pain. We recently reported transcriptomic changes in the DRG with DPN. Here, we expand upon those results with integrated metabolomic, proteomic, and phospho-proteomic analyses to compare the molecular profiles of DRG from DPN donors and DRG from control donors without diabetes or chronic pain. Our analyses identified decreases of select amino acids and phospholipid metabolites in the DRG from DPN donors, which are important for cellular maintenance. Additionally, our analyses revealed changes suggestive of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and altered mRNA processing. These results reveal new insights into changes in the molecular profiles associated with DPN.

                Whole brain tractography is commonly used to study the brain's white matter fiber pathways, but the large number of streamlines generated - up to one million per brain - can be challenging for large-scale population studies. We propose a robust dimensionality reduction framework for tractography, using a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (ConvVAE) to learn low-dimensional embeddings from white matter bundles. The resulting embeddings can be used to facilitate downstream tasks such as outlier and abnormality detection, and mapping of disease effects on white matter tracts in individuals or groups. We design experiments to evaluate how well embeddings of different dimensions preserve distances from the original high-dimensional dataset, using distance correlation methods. We find that streamline distances and inter-bundle distances are well preserved in the latent space, with a 6-dimensional optimal embedding space. The generative ConvVAE model allows fast inference on new data, and the smooth latent space enables meaningful decodings that can be used for downstream tasks. We demonstrate the use of a ConvVAE model trained on control subjects' data to detect structural anomalies in white matter tracts in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using ConvVAEs to facilitate population analyses, we identified 6 tracts with statistically significant differences between AD and controls after controlling for age and sex effect, visualizing specific locations along the tracts with high anomalies despite large inter-subject variations in fiber bundle geometry.

                Defects in the Sortilin-related receptor 1 gene, SORL1, are highly pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease (AD), on par with other causal AD genes. SORL1 is a key regulator of endosomal trafficking in neurons, and loss of SORL1 function disrupts trafficking pathways that are vital for neuronal health. SORL1 has been found to interact with retromer, a protein complex that is a 'master conductor' of endosomal trafficking. Here we rely on retromer pharmacological chaperones that stabilize retromer in vitro, and thus enhance retromer function in cells. to test the hypothesis that they will correct AD-associated neuronal pathologies. We used an isogenic series of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs) lines either deficient in SORL1 expression (SORL1 KO or SORL1+/-) or harboring one copy of a missense variant linked to increased risk for AD (SORL1Var). We treated neurons derived from these hiPSCs with the established retromer chaperone, TPT-260, and tested whether they corrected indicators of AD's defining endosomal, amyloid, and Tau pathologies. We observed that TPT-260 treatment was able to correct all these pathological indicators; however, the degree of rescue of some of the phenotypes was dependent on whether the neurons harbor at least one functional copy of SORL1 or whether they are fully deficient. More than just validating that SORL1-retromer acts as a functional trafficking unit in neurons, our work sheds new light on how SORL1-retromer is linked to AD's cardinal pathologies and illuminates how this pathway can be therapeutically harnessed.

                Current studies have shown that perception of one's own name involves multiple multimodal brain regions, while activities in unimodal sensory regions (i.e., primary auditory cortex) and their interaction with multimodal regions during self-processing remain unclear. To answer this, we combined multivariate pattern analysis and dynamic causal modelling analysis to explore the regional activation pattern and inter-region effective connection during self-name processing. We found that subject's own name and other names could be decoded from the activation pattern in the primary auditory cortex. In addition, we found an excitatory effect of SON on connections from the anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus to the primary auditory cortex, and to the temporal parietal junction. Our findings extended the current knowledge of self-processing by showing that primary sensory cortex could discriminate one's own name from other names. Furthermore, our findings highlighted the importance of influence of the insula on the primary auditory cortex during self-processing.

                For people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), recalling traumatic memories often displays as intrusions that differ profoundly from processing of "regular" negative memories. These mnemonic features fueled theories speculating a qualitative divergence in cognitive state linked with traumatic memories. Yet to date, little empirical evidence supports this view. Here, we examined neural activity of PTSD patients who were listening to narratives depicting their own memories. An inter-subject representational similarity analysis of cross-subject semantic content and neural patterns revealed a differentiation in hippocampal representation by narrative type: Semantically similar sad autobiographical memories elicited similar neural representations across participants. By contrast, within the same individuals, semantically thematically similar trauma memories were not represented similarly. Furthermore, we were able to decode memory type from hippocampal multivoxel patterns. Finally, individual symptom severity modulated semantic representation of the traumatic narratives in the posterior cingulate cortex. Taken together, these findings suggest that traumatic memories are a qualitatively divergent cognitive entity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial attention in perceptual decision making as revealed by response-locked classification image analysis</a></h4>

              
                In many situations, humans serially sample information from many locations in an image to make an appropriate decision about a visual target. Spatial attention plays a crucial role in this serial vision process. To investigate the effect of spatial attention in such dynamic decision making, we applied a classification image (CI) analysis locked to the observer's reaction time (RT). We asked human observers to detect as rapidly as possible a target whose contrast gradually increased on the left or right side of dynamic noise, with the presentation of a spatial cue. The analysis revealed a spatiotemporally biphasic profile of the CI which peaked at ~350 ms before the observer's response. We found that a valid cue presented at the target location shortened the RT and increased the overall amplitude of the CI, especially when the cue appeared 500-1250 ms before the observer's response. The results were quantitatively accounted for by a simple perceptual decision mechanism that accumulates the outputs of the spatiotemporal contrast detector, whose gain is increased by sustained attention to the cued location.

                Remote memories play an important role in how we perceive the world and are rooted in ensembles in the CA1 and ACC, however the evolution of these components during systems consolidation has not yet been comprehensively addressed. By applying transgenic approaches for ensemble identification, CLARITY, retro-AAV and rabies virus for circuit mapping, and chemogenetics for functional interrogation, we addressed the dynamics of CA1-ACC ensembles and their connectivity as well as the contribution of astrocytes to the process. We found that the CA1 engrams remain stable between recent and remote recall, and, the inhibition of the engram for recent recall during remote recall functionally impairs memory. We also found that the new cells in the remote recall engram in the CA1 are not added randomly, but differ according to their connections: First, the anterograde CA1toACC engram cell projection grows larger. Second, in the retrograde projections, the ACC reduces input to CA1 engram cells, while input from the entorhinal cortex and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus increases. Finally, we found that activating CA1 astrocytes during acquisition improves recent but not remote recall, and that CA1toACC projecting cells are recruited earlier when the astrocytes are stimulated. Our results shine fresh light on systems consolidation by providing a deeper understanding of engram stability and maturation in the transition from recent to remote memory.

                Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by restricted interest and repetitive behaviors and social-communication deficit. These traits are associated with atypicality in functional brain networks. The modular organization plays a crucial role in network stability and adaptability for evolution and neurodevelopment. Previous neuroimaging research demonstrates developmental discontinuity in results, especially in studies of functional brain modular organization in ASD. This discontinuity results from the examination of mixed young and adolescent age groups. Furthermore, studies have also reported that brain developmental aberration at a young age (5-10 years) is associated with functional brain connectivity however, the large-scale and regional brain modular properties are yet to be explored in young children with ASD. Recent work has demonstrated that the atypicality in global modular properties arises from alterations in the topological roles of specific brain regions in autistic children. Here we used graph-theoretical measures to examine the implications of altered large-scale and regional modular properties in individuals with ASD. We utilized multicentre resting-state BOLD fMRI datasets of 74 participants - 34 ASD and 40 typically developing (age: 5-10years, males, IQ>75, righthanded), obtained from Autism Brain Image Data Exchange (ABIDE) I and II. Analyses demonstrated the alteration in the topological roles and modular cohesiveness of brain regions majorly from Default mode, Sensorimotor, and Salience networks contributed to the discrepancy in a global modular configuration. These results demonstrate that the identification of aberration in modular properties at the brain-regional scale can be used as a potential biomarker of ASD.

                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and serious consequence of cancer treatment that causes autonomic, motor, and sensory deficits, often resulting in severe pain. CIPN progression frequently leads to reduction or termination of chemotherapy medication in patients, negatively impacting their prognoses. With cancer survival rates improving dramatically, addressing side effects of cancer treatment has become pressing. Furthermore, as much of our knowledge on how CIPN develops derives from rodent studies with uncertain translatability, studying it in human neurons is critical. Here, we use iPSC-derived human neurons to investigate the molecular mechanisms that lead to neurotoxicity induced by vincristine, a common chemotherapeutic used to treat solid tumors. Our results uncover a novel mechanism by which vincristine causes a local increase in mitochondrial proteins that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the axon. Vincristine triggers a cascade of axon pathology leading from elevated axonal ROS levels to mitochondrial dysfunction and SARM1-dependent axon degeneration. Importantly, we show that the neurotoxic effect of increased axonal ROS can be mitigated by the small molecule mdivi-1, identifying a novel therapeutic avenue to treat CIPN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Standing balance in aging is robust against head rotation during visual tracking.</a></h4>

              
                Standing balance is relatively more unstable when visually pursuing a moving target than when fixating a stationary one. These effects are common across age groups if the head is restrained during visual task performance. The present study focused on the role of the head motion on standing balance during the pursuit of a moving target as a function of age. Three predictions were tested: a) standing balance is compromised to a greater extent in older than young adults by gaze target pursuit compared to fixation, b) older adults pursue a moving target with greater and more variable head rotation than young adults, and c) greater and more variable head rotation during the gaze pursuit task is associated with greater postural sway. Twenty-two (22) older and twenty-three (23) young adults stood on a force plate in front of a 60-inch monitor while performing two visual tasks: fixation at a stationary target and gaze pursuit of a horizontally moving target. Centre of pressure (CoP) and head kinematics were synchronously recorded with the Vicon motion analysis system, while head-unconstrained gaze was captured by the Pupil Labs Invisible mobile tracking system. Postural sway, reflected in the interquartile CoP range and the root mean square (RMS) of CoP velocity increased during the gaze pursuit compared to the fixation task (p<.05), and this effect was more pronounced in older than young participants (p<.05). Older adults pursued the moving target employing more variable (p=.022) head yaw rotation than young participants although the amplitude of head rotation was not systematically different between groups (p=.077). The amplitude and variance of head yaw rotation did not correlate with postural sway measures. Results suggest that older adults may engage more variable head rotation when tracking a moving target to compensate for age-related deficits in eye smooth pursuit movement. However, this strategy does not seem to compromise standing balance.

                Highly precise neuromodulation with a high efficacy poses great importance in neuroscience. Here, we developed a candle soot fiber optoacoustic emitter (CSFOE), capable of generating a high pressure of over 10 MPa, enabling highly efficient neuromodulation in vitro. The design of the fiber optoacoustic emitter, including the choice of the material and the thickness of the layered structure, was optimized in both simulations and experiments. The optoacoustic conversion efficiency of the optimized CSFOE was found to be ten times higher than the other carbon-based fiber optoacoustic emitters. Driven by a single laser, the CSFOE can perform dual-site optoacoustic activation of neurons, confirmed by calcium (Ca) imaging. Our work opens potential avenues for more complex and programmed control in neural circuits using a simple design for multisite neuromodulation in vivo.

                The eye is instrumental for the control of circadian rhythms in nocturnal mammals. Here we address the conservation of this function in the larva of a diurnal fish: the zebrafish, using lakritz (lak) mutant larvae which completely lack Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCS). Our results show that while a functional eye is required for masking of locomotor activity, it is largely dispensable for the establishment of circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. In addition, the eye is not required for the induction of a phase delay following a pulse of white light at CT 16 but contributes to the induction of a phase advance upon a pulse of white light at CT21. Since melanopsin photopigments are important mediators of photoentrainment in nocturnal mammals and since one of the melanopsin genes opn4xa is expressed in pineal projection neurons in addition to RGCs, we generated a CrispR/Cas9 opn4xa mutant to address the role of opn4xa photosensitivity. opn4xa photosensitivity is dispensable for masking and circadian rhythms of locomotor activity as well as for the induction of phase shifts but is required for period length control in LL. Furthermore, analysis of opn4xa-/-; lak-/- larvae did not reveal a redundancy between the function of the eye and opn4xa photosensitivity for photoentrainment to pulses of white light performed at CT 16 or CT21. Altogether our results challenge the dogma that light influences circadian rhythms using the eye as a sole mediator and highlight profound differences in the circadian system and photoentrainment mechanism between nocturnal rodents and zebrafish.

                Our memories form a rich, colorful tapestry of emotions, events, people, and places, woven across the decades of our lives. However, research has typically been limited in its ability to assess the multidimensional nature of episodic memory, given the short time scales and artificial stimulus sets often required in experiments. In an era when people are constantly recording their lives through social media, we can now examine key questions about the behavioral and neural underpinnings of diverse and extensive real-world memories. Here, we tested the neural representations of episodic memory in a naturalistic setting, specifically focusing on the age, location, subjective memory strength, and emotional content of memories. We recruited 23 users of a video diary app ("1 Second Everyday"), who had recorded a total of 9,266 daily memory videos spanning up to 7 years prior to our study. During a 3T fMRI scan, participants viewed a set of 300 of their own memory videos intermixed with 300 videos from another individual. We identified key areas specifically engaged for one's own memories versus another's. Delving into the multidimensional nature of these memories, we find that their features are tightly interrelated, highlighting the need to consider these features in conjunction when conducting memory research. Importantly, when looking at the distinct contributions of these features, we find a topography of memory content extending across the medial parietal lobe with separate representations of a memory's age, it's strength, and the familiarity of the people and places involved.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Causal contributions to sensory-based decision-making by cell-type specific circuits in the tail striatum</a></h4>

              
                The striatum comprises distinct types of neurons giving rise to the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways and local circuits. A large amount of work has been focusing on cell-type specific striatal circuits in the context of movement control, proposing several models on their functional roles. But it remains to be elucidated how the cell-type specific striatal circuits contribute to decision-making behavior and whether the existing models apply. Here, we investigate the causal roles of the cell-type specific circuits in the posterior tail of the dorsal striatum (TS) of mice in an auditory-guided decision-making behavior. Transient unilateral activation of the direct- or indirect-pathway striatal spiny projection neurons (dSPNs or iSPNs) both biased decisions in opposite directions. These effects, however, were not due to a direct influence on movement, but was specific to the decision period preceding action execution. Optogenetic inactivation of dSPNs and iSPNs revealed their opposing causal contributions to decisions. At the local circuit level, simutaneous optical recording and manipulation of dSPNs and iSPNs revealed their antagnizing interactions. Inactivation of PV interneurons, a common inhibitory input to both dSPNs and iSPNs, facilitated contraversive choices, supporting a causal contribution of coordinated striatal circuits. Using a neural circuit model, we further demonstrated the computational implemenation of the causal circuit mechanism. Our results indicate that while the causal roles of the cell-type specific striatal circuits in decision-making largely agree with classic models in movement control, they show decision task-related specificity involving local circuit coordination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia Depletion Selectively Eliminates a Singular Form of Hippocampal Long Term Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                There has been considerable recent interest in the possibility that microglia contribute to synaptic plasticity and some forms of learning. We report here that elimination of the cells in young adult male mice with a 7-12 day treatment with an antagonist (PLX5622) of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor causes a profound but highly selective impairment to long-term potentiation (LTP) expressed by lateral perforant path (LPP) synapses with the dentate gyrus. Input-output functions and frequency facilitation to repetitive stimulation were not measurably affected. Direct infusion of PLX5622 into slices from untreated mice did not reduce the magnitude of LPP-LTP. Microglial depletion had no detectable effects on LTP in either the medial perforant path input to the dentate gyrus or the Schaffer-commissural projections between fields CA3 and CA1. We conclude that microglia discretely regulate the unusual form of LTP expressed by the LPP and thus exert region specific effects on circuit function within hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensing the Full Dynamics of the Human Hand with a Neural Interface and Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                Theories on the neural control of movement are largely based on movement-sensing devices that capture the dynamics of predefined anatomical landmarks. Neuromuscular interfaces, such as surface electromyography (sEMG), can in theory surpass the limitations imposed by motion-based technologies by sensing the motor commands transmitted by the final pathway of movement, the motor units. The recording of motor unit activity may allow the prediction of the kinetics and kinematics continuously in time and space, without being limited to several biological and physical boundaries that digital cameras or inertial sensors suffer. However, current sEMG decoding algorithms can only predict few degrees of freedom (<3). By combining markerless machine vision and high-density sEMG electrodes, we aimed to test the hypothesis that a physiologically inspired deep neural network can reconstruct the movement of the human hand as precise as digital cameras and with the additional benefit of predicting the underlying forces (i.e., grasping a cup of coffee). We demonstrate that our deep learning model can continuously predict all degrees of freedom of the hand with negligible errors during natural motion tasks from 320 sEMG sensors placed only on the extrinsic hand muscles. Our deep learning model was able to display the 3D hand kinematics and the full force range of the hand digits during isometric contractions. The current results demonstrate that deep learning applied to EMG signals gives access to an unprecedented representation of the final neural code of movement.

                The precise execution of coordinated movements depends on proprioception, the sense of body position in space. However, the molecular underpinnings of proprioceptive neuron subtype identities are not clear yet. In this study, we searched for molecular correlates of proprioceptor subtypes defined according to the identity of the muscle they innervate. We identified and validated signatures for subtypes monitoring the activity of back, abdominal, and hindlimb muscles. We found that proprioceptor muscle identity is acquired early in development and comprise programs controlling wiring specificity. Altogether this work paves the way for defining the mechanisms underlying the development of proprioceptor subtypes to the single muscle level and dissect their contributions to motor control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating the in vivo Spatial Distribution of Hippocampal Microstructure and Macrostructure</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is classically divided into mesoscopic subfields which contain varying microstructure that contribute to their unique functional roles. It has been challenging to characterize this microstructure with current MR based neuroimaging techniques. In this work, we used a novel surface-based approach in the hippocampus to show distinct microstructural distributions of myelin, neurite density and dispersion, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity using diffusion MRI. To get at this issue we used the Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model optimized for gray matter diffusivity and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We found that neurite dispersion was highest in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1 and subiculum subfields which likely captures the large heterogeneity of tangential and radial fibers, such as the Schaffer collaterals, perforant path, and pyramidal neurites. Neurite density and myelin content were highest in the subiculum and lowest in CA1, which may reflect known myeloarchitecture differences between these subfields. We show macrostructural measures of gyrification, thickness, and curvature which were in line with ex vivo descriptions of hippocampal anatomy. We employed a multivariate orthogonal projective non-negative matrix factorization (OPNNMF) approach to capture co-varying regions of macro- and microstructure across the hippocampus. The clusters were highly variable along the medial-lateral (proximal-distal) direction, which is expected as there are known differences in morphology, cytoarchitectonic profiles, and connectivity. Long-axis (anterior-posterior) differences can also be seen in the OPNNMF components, where the body of the hippocampus has more parcellations than the head and tail. Finally, we show that by examining the main direction of diffusion relative to canonical hippocampal axes, we could identify microstructure that may map onto specific tangential fiber pathways, such as the Schaffer collaterals and perforant path. These results highlight the value of combining in vivo diffusion MRI with computational approaches for capturing hippocampal microstructure, which may provide useful features for understanding cognition and for diagnosis of disease states.

	<p>Background/Problem. Given the treatment-resistant gait deficits after stroke and known elevated energy cost of gait after stroke, it is important to study the patterns of mechanical energies of the lower limb segments. There is a dearth of information regarding mechanical energies specifically for the thigh and shank across the gait cycle. Therefore, the purpose of the current work was to characterize the following: (1) relative patterns of oscillation kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE) within lower limb segments and across lower limb segments in healthy adults during the swing phase at chosen and slow gait speeds; (2) KE and PE swing phase patterns and values for stroke survivors versus healthy adults walking at slow speed; and (3) KE and PE patterns during the swing phase for two different compensatory gait strategies after stroke,. Methods. This was a gait characterization study, a two-group, parallel-cohort study of fourteen stroke survivors with gait deficits, walking at &amp;amp;lt;0.4 m/s and eight adults with no gait deficits. For testing, the eight healthy adults walked at their chosen speed, and then at the imposed slow speed of &amp;amp;lt;0.04 m/s. We used a standard motion capture system and calculation methods to acquire, calculate, and characterize oscillation patterns of KE and PE of the limb segments (thigh and shank) across the gait cycle. Results. In healthy adults, we identified key energy conservation mechanisms inherent in the interactions of KE and PE, both within the thigh and shank segments and across those limb segments, partially explaining the low cost of energy of the normal adult chosen speed gait pattern, and the underlying mechanism affording the known minimal set of activated muscles during walking, especially during the early swing phase. In contrast, KE was effectively absent for both healthy adults at imposed slow walking speed and stroke survivors at their very slow chosen speed, eliminating the normal conservation of energy between KE and PE within the thigh and across the thigh and shank. Moreover, and in comparison to healthy adult slow speed, stroke survivors exhibited greater abnormalities in mechanical energies patterns, reflected in either a compensatory stepping strategy (over-flexing the hip) or circumducting strategy (stiff-legged gait, with knee extended throughout the swing phase). Conclusions and contribution to the field. Taken together, these findings support targeted training to restore normal balance control and normal activation and de-activation coordination of hip, knee, and ankle muscles, respectively (agonist/antagonist at each joint), so as to eliminate the known post-stroke abnormal co-contractions; this motor training is critical in order to release the limb to swing normally in response to mechanical energies and afford the use of conservation of KE and PE energies within the thigh and across thigh and shank.</p>

	<p>Objective: This pilot study aims to show the feasibility of noninvasive and real-time cerebral hemodynamic monitoring during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) via diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods: Cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) was measured unilaterally in seven patients and bilaterally in seventeen patients via DCS. In fourteen patients, hemoglobin oxygenation changes were measured bilaterally and simultaneously via NIRS. Cerebral autoregulation (CAR) and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) were estimated using CBFi and arterial blood pressure data. Further, compensatory responses to the ipsilateral hemisphere were investigated at different contralateral stenosis levels. Results: Clamping of carotid arteries caused a sharp increase of CVR (~70%) and a marked decrease of ipsilateral CBFi (57%). From the initial drop, we observed partial recovery in CBFi, an increase of blood volume, and a reduction in CVR in the ipsilateral hemisphere. There were no significant changes in compensatory responses between different contralateral stenosis levels as CAR was intact in both hemispheres throughout the CEA phase. A comparison between hemispheric CBFi showed lower ipsilateral levels during the CEA and post-CEA phases (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, 0.03). Conclusion: DCS alone or combined with NIRS is a useful monitoring technique for real-time assessment of cerebral hemodynamic changes and allows individualized strategies to improve cerebral perfusion during CEA by identifying different hemodynamic metrics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Enhanced Stability of Complex Sound Representations Relative to Simple Sounds in the Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Typical everyday sounds, such as those of speech or running water, are spectrotemporally complex. The ability to recognize complex sounds (CxSs) and their associated meaning is presumed to rely on their stable neural representations across time. The auditory cortex is critical for the processing of CxSs, yet little is known of the degree of stability of auditory cortical representations of CxSs across days. Previous studies have shown that the auditory cortex represents CxS identity with a substantial degree of invariance to basic sound attributes such as frequency. We therefore hypothesized that auditory cortical representations of CxSs are more stable across days than those of sounds that lack spectrotemporal structure such as pure tones (PTs). To test this hypothesis, we recorded responses of identified layer 2/3 auditory cortical excitatory neurons to both PTs and CxSs across days using two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice. Auditory cortical neurons showed significant daily changes of responses to both types of sounds, yet responses to CxSs exhibited significantly lower rates of daily change than those of PTs. Furthermore, daily changes in response profiles to PTs tended to be more stimulus-specific, reflecting changes in sound selectivity, compared with changes of CxS responses. Last, the enhanced stability of responses to CxSs was evident across longer time intervals as well. Together, these results suggest that spectrotemporally CxSs are more stably represented in the auditory cortex across time than PTs. These findings support a role of the auditory cortex in representing CxS identity across time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Traces of Semantization, from Episodic to Semantic Memory in a Spiking Cortical Network Model</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Episodic memory is a recollection of past personal experiences associated with particular times and places. This kind of memory is commonly subject to loss of contextual information or "semantization," which gradually decouples the encoded memory items from their associated contexts while transforming them into semantic or gist-like representations. Novel extensions to the classical Remember/Know (R/K) behavioral paradigm attribute the loss of episodicity to multiple exposures of an item in different contexts. Despite recent advancements explaining semantization at a behavioral level, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we suggest and evaluate a novel hypothesis proposing that Bayesian&ndash;Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanisms might cause semantization of episodic memory. We implement a cortical spiking neural network model with a Bayesian&ndash;Hebbian learning rule called Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), which captures the semantization phenomenon and offers a mechanistic explanation for it. Encoding items across multiple contexts leads to item-context decoupling akin to semantization. We compare BCPNN plasticity with the more commonly used spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule in the same episodic memory task. Unlike BCPNN, STDP does not explain the decontextualization process. We further examine how selective plasticity modulation of isolated salient events may enhance preferential retention and resistance to semantization. Our model reproduces important features of episodicity on behavioral timescales under various biological constraints while also offering a novel neural and synaptic explanation for semantization, thereby casting new light on the interplay between episodic and semantic memory processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Paroxetine Increases {delta} Opioid Responsiveness in Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>There are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved -opioid receptor (DOR)-selective agonists, despite having fewer side effects in rodents and nonhuman primates compared with traditional &mu;-opioid receptor (MOR) therapeutics (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B55">Vanderah, 2010</cross-ref>). Targeting peripheral receptors is an attractive strategy to reduce abuse potential. However, peripheral opioid receptors do not readily respond to agonists unless primed by inflammation, which would limit their efficacy in noninflammatory pain patients (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B51">Stein et al., 1989</cross-ref>). It was recently identified that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) maintains DOR incompetence in noninflamed nociceptors (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B6">Brackley et al., 2016</cross-ref>, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B7">2017</cross-ref>). Here, we report that paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and potent GRK2 inhibitor (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B54">Thal et al., 2012</cross-ref>), reduces chronic GRK2 association with membrane DOR, thereby enhancing peripheral DOR-mediated analgesic competence in the absence of inflammation. Interestingly, paroxetine&rsquo;s effects on GRK2 <I>in vivo</I> are limited to peripheral tissues in the male rat. The effects of paroxetine on DOR competence are notably antagonized by GRK2 overexpression. This is the first study to suggest that paroxetine induces peripheral DOR analgesic competence through a GRK2-dependent mechanism, improving analgesic efficacy in noninflamed tissue. Because paroxetine targets the protein that governs peripheral opioid receptor responsiveness, and does so in the absence of inflammation, we propose that paroxetine may be suitable as a co-therapy with peripherally-restrictive doses of opioids to improve analgesic efficacy in noninflammatory pain conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Confirmation of Decreased Rates of Cerebral Protein Synthesis In Vivo in a Mouse Model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in intellectual disability and, in ~50% of patients, autism spectrum disorder. The protein products that are altered in TSC (TSC1 and TSC2) form a complex to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR; mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)] pathway. This pathway has been shown to affect the process of mRNA translation through its action on ribosomal protein S6 and 4-elongation binding protein 1. It is thought that mutations in the TSC proteins lead to upregulation of the mTORC1 pathway and consequently an increase in protein synthesis. Unexpectedly, our previous study of a mouse model of TSC (<I>Tsc2<sup>Djk</sup></I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup>) demonstrated decreased <I>in vivo</I> rates of protein synthesis throughout the brain. In the present study, we confirm those results in another <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mouse model, one with a different mutation locus and on a mixed background (<I>Tsc2<sup>Mjg</sup></I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup>). We also examine mTORC1 signaling and possible effects of prior isoflurane anesthesia. Because measurements of protein synthesis rates <I>in vivo</I> require surgical preparation of the animal and anesthesia, we examine mTORC1 signaling pathways both under baseline conditions and following recovery from anesthesia. Our results demonstrate regionally selective effects of prior anesthesia. Overall, our results in both <I>in vivo</I> models suggest divergences from the central hypothesis regarding TSC and show the importance of studying protein synthesis <I>in vivo</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Recommendations for connecting molecular sequence and biodiversity research infrastructures through ELIXIR [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Threats to global biodiversity are increasingly recognised by scientists and the public as a critical challenge. Molecular sequencing technologies offer means to catalogue, explore, and monitor the richness and biogeography of life on Earth. However, exploiting their full potential requires tools that connect biodiversity infrastructures and resources. As a research infrastructure developing services and technical solutions that help integrate and coordinate life science resources across Europe, ELIXIR is a key player. To identify opportunities, highlight priorities, and aid strategic thinking, here we survey approaches by which molecular technologies help inform understanding of biodiversity. We detail example use cases to highlight how DNA sequencing is: resolving taxonomic issues; Increasing knowledge of marine biodiversity; helping understand how agriculture and biodiversity are critically linked; and playing an essential role in ecological studies. Together with examples of national biodiversity programmes, the use cases show where progress is being made but also highlight common challenges and opportunities for future enhancement of underlying technologies and services that connect molecular and wider biodiversity domains. Based on emerging themes, we propose key recommendations to guide future funding for biodiversity research: biodiversity and bioinformatic infrastructures need to collaborate closely and strategically; taxonomic efforts need to be aligned and harmonised across domains; metadata needs to be standardised and common data management approaches widely adopted; current approaches need to be scaled up dramatically to address the anticipated explosion of molecular data; bioinformatics support for biodiversity research needs to be enabled and sustained; training for end users of biodiversity research infrastructures needs to be prioritised; and community initiatives need to be proactive and focused on enabling solutions. For sequencing data to deliver their full potential they must be connected to knowledge: together, molecular sequence data collection initiatives and biodiversity research infrastructures can advance global efforts to prevent further decline of Earth’s biodiversity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of beliefs, knowledge, and attitude on herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicines are gaining a greater degree of popularity as complementary and alternative medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, there is a lack of data concerning the rationale for and factors influencing their use. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based online study involving 1,621 participants was conducted to explore the effects of magical health beliefs, holistic health beliefs, knowledge, and pro- complementary alternative medicine (CAM) attitudes on herbal medicine use in the Indonesian population. Results: Logistic regression findings showed that knowledge about herbal medicines was independently and positively associated with herbal medicine use to a greater extent than herbal medicine non-use (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval; CI = 1.16 to 1.24). The participants who used herbal medicines had a greater magical health belief score than herbal medicine non-users, with AOR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.06. Moreover, holistic health beliefs and pro-CAM attitudes were also found to be independently associated with herbal medicine use. Conclusion: These findings alert nurses to assess the roles of magical health beliefs, holistic health belief, knowledge, and attitudes toward herbal medicine use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Culling and mortality of dairy cows: why it happens and how it can be mitigated [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The United Nations estimates that the global population will total 9.7 billion in 2050. Rapid population growth pose a significant obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly eradicating hunger and poverty. In view of the expanding population growth, food production ideally should triple to prevent massive food shortages. Sustainable food and nutrition security is the focal point of the dairy industry. Dairy production plays a pivotal role in addressing and advancing global food and nutrition security. It serves as a major source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus in many families in developing countries with a fast-growing population. Consequently, the dairy industry is expected to grow by approximately 26% in the next 10 years and produce an estimated 1077 million tonnes of milk by 2050. However, the growth and distribution of the dairy industry is limited by many factors such as culling and mortality of dairy cows. Several studies highlight reproduction failures, old age, poor milk yield, diseases (mastitis, lameness, and dystocia), and heat stress as some reasons for culling of dairy cows. Hence, this review highlights the factors influencing culling and mortality in dairy production farms, and discusses mitigating measures to limit culling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A framework for macroscopic phase-resetting curves for generalised spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grégory Dumont, Alberto Pérez-Cervera, Boris Gutkin</p>

Brain rhythms emerge from synchronization among interconnected spiking neurons. Key properties of such rhythms can be gleaned from the phase-resetting curve (PRC). Inferring the PRC and developing a systematic phase reduction theory for large-scale brain rhythms remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present a theoretical framework and methodology to compute the PRC of generic spiking networks with emergent collective oscillations. We adopt a renewal approach where neurons are described by the time since their last action potential, a description that can reproduce the dynamical feature of many cell types. For a sufficiently large number of neurons, the network dynamics are well captured by a continuity equation known as the refractory density equation. We develop an adjoint method for this equation giving a semi-analytical expression of the infinitesimal PRC. We confirm the validity of our framework for specific examples of neural networks. Our theoretical framework can link key biological properties at the individual neuron scale and the macroscopic oscillatory network properties. Beyond spiking networks, the approach is applicable to a broad class of systems that can be described by renewal processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Amyloid pathology disrupts gliotransmitter release in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anup Gopalakrishna Pillai, Suhita Nadkarni</p>

Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) is associated with synaptic dysfunction and destabilization of astrocytic calcium homeostasis. A growing body of evidence support astrocytes as active modulators of synaptic transmission via calcium-mediated gliotransmission. However, the details of mechanisms linking Aβ signaling, astrocytic calcium dynamics, and gliotransmission are not known. We developed a biophysical model that describes calcium signaling and the ensuing gliotransmitter release from a single astrocytic process when stimulated by glutamate release from hippocampal neurons. The model accurately captures the temporal dynamics of microdomain calcium signaling and glutamate release via both kiss-and-run and full-fusion exocytosis. We investigate the roles of two crucial calcium regulating machineries affected by Aβ: plasma-membrane calcium pumps (PMCA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). When we implemented these Aβ-affected molecular changes in our astrocyte model, it led to an increase in the rate and synchrony of calcium events. Our model also reproduces several previous findings of Aβ associated aberrant calcium activity, such as increased intracellular calcium level and increased spontaneous calcium activity, and synchronous calcium events. The study establishes a causal link between previous observations of hyperactive astrocytes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Aβ-induced modifications in mGluR and PMCA functions. Analogous to neurotransmitter release, gliotransmitter exocytosis closely tracks calcium changes in astrocyte processes, thereby guaranteeing tight control of synaptic signaling by astrocytes. However, the downstream effects of AD-related calcium changes in astrocytes on gliotransmitter release are not known. Our results show that enhanced rate of exocytosis resulting from modified calcium signaling in astrocytes leads to a rapid depletion of docked vesicles that disrupts the crucial temporal correspondence between a calcium event and vesicular release. We propose that the loss of temporal correspondence between calcium events and gliotransmission in astrocytes pathologically alters astrocytic modulation of synaptic transmission in the presence of Aβ accumulation.

                <p>by Nora Heitzman-Breen, Stanca M. Ciupe</p>

The relationship between transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the amount of virus present in the proximity of a susceptible host is not understood. Here, we developed a within-host and aerosol mathematical model and used it to determine the relationship between viral kinetics in the upper respiratory track, viral kinetics in the aerosols, and new transmissions in golden hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. We determined that infectious virus shedding early in infection correlates with transmission events, shedding of infectious virus diminishes late in the infection, and high viral RNA levels late in the infection are a poor indicator of transmission. We further showed that viral infectiousness increases in a density dependent manner with viral RNA and that their relative ratio is time-dependent. Such information is useful for designing interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Phage endolysins are adapted to specific hosts and are evolutionarily dynamic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frank Oechslin, Xiaojun Zhu, Moira B. Dion, Rong Shi, Sylvain Moineau</p>

Endolysins are produced by (bacterio)phages to rapidly degrade the bacterial cell wall and release new viral particles. Despite sharing a common function, endolysins present in phages that infect a specific bacterial species can be highly diverse and vary in types, number, and organization of their catalytic and cell wall binding domains. While much is now known about the biochemistry of phage endolysins, far less is known about the implication of their diversity on phage–host adaptation and evolution. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we could genetically exchange a subset of different endolysin genes into distinct lactococcal phage genomes. Regardless of the type and biochemical properties of these endolysins, fitness costs associated to their genetic exchange were marginal if both recipient and donor phages were infecting the same bacterial strain, but gradually increased when taking place between phage that infect different strains or bacterial species. From an evolutionary perspective, we observed that endolysins could be naturally exchanged by homologous recombination between phages coinfecting a same bacterial strain. Furthermore, phage endolysins could adapt to their new phage/host environment by acquiring adaptative mutations. These observations highlight the remarkable ability of phage lytic systems to recombine and adapt and, therefore, explain their large diversity and mosaicism. It also indicates that evolution should be considered to act on functional modules rather than on bacteriophages themselves. Furthermore, the extensive degree of evolvability observed for phage endolysins offers new perspectives for their engineering as antimicrobial agents.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Human electromagnetic and haemodynamic networks systematically converge in unimodal cortex and diverge in transmodal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Golia Shafiei, Sylvain Baillet, Bratislav Misic</p>

Whole-brain neural communication is typically estimated from statistical associations among electromagnetic or haemodynamic time-series. The relationship between functional network architectures recovered from these 2 types of neural activity remains unknown. Here, we map electromagnetic networks (measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG)) to haemodynamic networks (measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)). We find that the relationship between the 2 modalities is regionally heterogeneous and systematically follows the cortical hierarchy, with close correspondence in unimodal cortex and poor correspondence in transmodal cortex. Comparison with the BigBrain histological atlas reveals that electromagnetic–haemodynamic coupling is driven by laminar differentiation and neuron density, suggesting that the mapping between the 2 modalities can be explained by cytoarchitectural variation. Importantly, haemodynamic connectivity cannot be explained by electromagnetic activity in a single frequency band, but rather arises from the mixing of multiple neurophysiological rhythms. Correspondence between the two is largely driven by MEG functional connectivity at the beta (15 to 29 Hz) frequency band. Collectively, these findings demonstrate highly organized but only partly overlapping patterns of connectivity in MEG and fMRI functional networks, opening fundamentally new avenues for studying the relationship between cortical microarchitecture and multimodal connectivity patterns.

Children typically experience more mild symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) when compared to adults. There is a strong body of evidence that children are also less susceptible to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with the ancestral viral isolate. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has been associated with an increased number of pediatric infections. Whether this is the result of widespread adult vaccination or fundamental changes in the biology of SARS-CoV-2 remain to be determined. Here, we use primary nasal epithelial cells (NECs) from children and adults, differentiated at an air–liquid interface to show that the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 replicates to significantly lower titers in the NECs of children compared to those of adults. This was associated with a heightened antiviral response to SARS-CoV-2 in the NECs of children. Importantly, the Delta variant also replicated to significantly lower titers in the NECs of children. This trend was markedly less pronounced in the case of Omicron. It is also striking to note that, at least in terms of viral RNA, Omicron replicated better in pediatric NECs compared to both Delta and the ancestral virus. Taken together, these data show that the nasal epithelium of children supports lower infection and replication of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, although this may be changing as the virus evolves.

Galanin is a neuropeptide expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it regulates various processes including neuroendocrine release, cognition, and nerve regeneration. Three G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for galanin have been discovered, which is the focus of efforts to treat diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, and addiction. To understand the basis of the ligand preferences of the receptors and to assist structure-based drug design, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to solve the molecular structure of GALR2 bound to galanin and a cognate heterotrimeric G-protein, providing a molecular view of the neuropeptide binding site. Mutant proteins were assayed to help reveal the basis of ligand specificity, and structural comparison between the activated GALR2 and inactive hβ<sub>2</sub>AR was used to relate galanin binding to the movements of transmembrane (TM) helices and the G-protein interface.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The fibro‐ and cyto‐architecture demarcating the border between the dentate gyrus and CA3 in sheep (Ovis aries) and domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampal formation is essential for spatial navigation and episodic memory. The anatomical structure is largely similar across mammalian species, apart from the deep polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus and the adjacent part of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) which feature substantial variations. In rodents, the polymorphic layer has a triangular cross-section abutting on the end of the CA3 pyramidal layer, while in primates it is long and band-shaped capping the expanded CA3 end, which here lacks a distinct pyramidal layer. This structural variation has resulted in a confusing nomenclature and unclear anatomical criteria for the definition of the dentate-ammonic border. Seeking to clarify the border, we present here a light microscopic investigation based on Golgi-impregnated and Timm–thionin-stained sections of the Artiodactyla sheep and domestic pig, in which the dentate gyrus and CA3 end have some topographical features in common with primates. In short, the band-shaped polymorphic layer coincides with the Timm-positive mossy fiber collateral plexus and the Timm-negative subgranular zone. While the soma and excrescence-covered proximal dendrites of the mossy cells are localized within the plexus, the peripheral mossy cell dendrites extend outside the plexus, both into the granular and molecular layers, and the CA3. The main mossy fibers leave the collateral plexus in a scattered formation to converge gradually through the CA3 end in between the dispersed pyramidal cells, which are of three subtypes, as in monkey, with the classical apical subtype dominating near the hidden blade, the nonapical subtype near the exposed blade, and the dentate subtype being the only pyramidal cells that extend dendrites into the dentate gyrus. In agreement with our previous study in mink, the findings show that the border between the dentate gyrus and the CA3 end can be more accurately localized by the mossy fiber system than by cyto-architecture alone.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Rhesus macaque versus rat divergence in the corticospinal projectome</a></h4>

              
                Sinopoulou et al. map the entire projection network of the corticospinal motor system in rats and monkeys, including all collaterals. They find extensive corticospinal collateralization in rats yet far more direct corticospinal convergence on the spinal cord in monkeys. These findings have important implications for translational research.

Here the authors provide an integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis of mouse and marmoset neocortical neuronal classes. Pan-neuronal programs active during early development are more evolutionary conserved but not neuron-specific, whereas pan-neuronal programs active during later stages of maturation are more neuron- and species-specific.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hypoxia-induced proteasomal degradation of DBC1 by SIAH2 in breast cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                DBC1 has been characterized as a key regulator of physiological and pathophysiological activities, such as DNA damage, senescence and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism by which the functional stability of DBC1 is regulated has yet to be elucidated. Here, we report that the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of DBC1 is regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH2 and deubiquitinase OTUD5 under hypoxic stress. Mechanistically, hypoxia promoted DBC1 to interact with SIAH2 but not OTUD5, resulting in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of DBC1 through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. <i>SIAH2</i> knockout inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration, which could be rescued by double knockout of <i>SIAH2/CCAR2</i>. Human tissue microarray analysis further revealed that the SIAH2/DBC1 axis was responsible for tumor progression under hypoxic stress. These findings define a key role of the hypoxia-mediated SIAH2-DBC1 pathway in the progression of human breast cancer and provide novel insights into the metastatic mechanism of breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Prolonged β-adrenergic stimulation disperses ryanodine receptor clusters in cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs) exhibit dynamic arrangements in cardiomyocytes, and we previously showed that 'dispersion' of RyR clusters disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during heart failure (HF) (Kolstad <i>et al.</i>, eLife, 2018). Here, we investigated whether prolonged β-adrenergic stimulation, a hallmark of HF, promotes RyR cluster dispersion, and examined the underlying mechanisms. We observed that treatment of healthy rat cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol for 1 hour triggered progressive fragmentation of RyR clusters. Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII reversed these effects, while cluster dispersion was reproduced by specific activation of CaMKII, and in mice with constitutively active Ser2814-RyR. A similar role of protein kinase A (PKA) in promoting RyR cluster fragmentation was established by employing PKA activation or inhibition. Progressive cluster dispersion was linked to declining Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark fidelity and magnitude, and slowed release kinetics from Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between more numerous RyR clusters. In healthy cells, this served to dampen the stimulatory actions of β-adrenergic stimulation over the longer term, and protect against pro-arrhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. However, during HF, RyR dispersion was linked to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Thus, RyR localization and function are intimately linked via channel phosphorylation by both CaMKII and PKA which, while finely tuned in healthy cardiomyocytes, underlies impaired cardiac function during pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The unmitigated profile of COVID-19 infectiousness</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying the temporal dynamics of infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for understanding the spread of COVID-19 and for evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Many studies have estimated the infectiousness profile using observed serial intervals. However, statistical and epidemiological biases could lead to underestimation of the duration of infectiousness. We correct for these biases by curating data from the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China (when mitigation was minimal), and find that the infectiousness profile of the original strain is longer than previously thought. Sensitivity analysis shows our results are robust to model structure, assumed growth rate and potential observational biases. Although unmitigated transmission data is lacking for variants of concern (VOC), previous analyses suggest that the alpha and delta variants have faster within-host kinetics, which we extrapolate to crude estimates of variant-specific unmitigated generation intervals. Knowing the unmitigated infectiousness profile of infected individuals can inform estimates of the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine measures. The framework presented here can help design better quarantine policies in early stages of future epidemics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanism of the cadherin-catenin F-actin catch bond interaction</a></h4>

              
                Mechanotransduction at cell-cell adhesions is crucial for the structural integrity, organization, and morphogenesis of epithelia. At cell-cell junctions, ternary E-cadherin/β-catenin/αE-catenin complexes sense and transmit mechanical load by binding to F-actin. The interaction with F-actin, described as a two-state catch bond, is weak in solution but is strengthened by applied force due to force-dependent transitions between weak and strong actin-binding states. Here, we provide direct evidence from optical trapping experiments that the catch bond property principally resides in the αE-catenin actin-binding domain (ABD). Consistent with our previously proposed model, deletion of the first helix of the five-helix ABD bundle enables stable interactions with F-actin under minimal load that are well-described by a single-state slip bond, even when αE-catenin is complexed with β-catenin and E-cadherin. Our data argue for a conserved catch bond mechanism for adhesion proteins with structurally similar ABDs. We also demonstrate that a stably bound ABD strengthens load-dependent binding interactions between a neighboring complex and F-actin, but the presence of the other αE-catenin domains weakens this effect. These results provide mechanistic insight to the cooperative binding of the cadherin-catenin complex to F-actin, which regulate dynamic cytoskeletal linkages in epithelial tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microscopic colitis: Etiopathology, diagnosis, and rational management</a></h4>

              
                Microscopic colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease divided into two subtypes: collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. With an increasing incidence of microscopic colitis exceeding those of ulcerative and Crohn’s disease among elderly people in some countries, microscopic colitis is a debilitating life experience. Therefore, physicians should be familiar with its clinical features and management strategies because the disease deserves the same attention as the classical inflammatory bowel diseases. Here, state-of-the-art knowledge of microscopic colitis is provided from a global perspective with reference to etiopathology and how to establish the diagnosis with the overall aim to create awareness and improve rational management in clinical practice. The immune system and a dysregulated immune response seem to play a key role combined with risk factors (e.g. cigarette smoking) in genetically predisposed individuals. The symptoms are characterized by recurrent or chronic nonbloody, watery diarrhea, urgency, weight loss, and a female preponderance. As biomarkers are absent, the diagnosis relies on colonoscopy with a histological assessment of biopsy specimens from all parts of the colon. Although the disease is not associated with a risk of colorectal cancer, a recent nationwide, population-based cohort study found an increased risk of lymphoma and lung cancer. Budesonide is the first-line therapy for management, whereas immunomodulatory drugs (including biologics) and drugs with antidiarrheal properties may be indicated in those failing, dependent, or intolerant to budesonide. In microscopic colitis induced by checkpoint inhibitors, a drug class used increasingly for a wide range of malignancies, a more aggressive therapeutic approach with biologics introduced early seems reasonable. However, particular attention needs to be drawn to the existence of incomplete forms of microscopic colitis with the risk of being overlooked in routine clinical settings.

Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are the principal chemosensors in the GI tract, but investigation of their role in behavior has been limited by the difficulty of selectively targeting these cells in vivo. Here we describe an intersectional genetic approach for manipulating EEC subtypes in behaving mice. We show that multiple EEC subtypes inhibit food intake but have different effects on learning. Conditioned flavor preference is driven by release of cholecystokinin whereas conditioned taste aversion is mediated by serotonin and substance P. These positive and negative valence signals are transmitted by vagal and spinal afferents, respectively. These findings establish a cellular basis for how chemosensing in the gut drives learning about food.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure-activity relationships of mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide pharmacological compounds</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria play a central role in metabolic homeostasis, and dysfunction of this organelle underpins the etiology of many heritable and aging-related diseases. Tetrapeptides with alternating cationic and aromatic residues such as SS-31 (elamipretide) show promise as therapeutic compounds for mitochondrial disorders. In this study, we conducted a quantitative structure-activity analysis of three alternative tetrapeptide analogs, benchmarked against SS-31, that differ with respect to aromatic side chain composition and sequence register. We present the first structural models for this class of compounds, obtained with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics approaches, showing that all analogs except for SS-31 form compact reverse turn conformations in the membrane-bound state. All peptide analogs bound cardiolipin-containing membranes, yet they had significant differences in equilibrium binding behavior and membrane interactions. Notably, analogs had markedly different effects on membrane surface charge, supporting a mechanism in which modulation of membrane electrostatics is a key feature of their mechanism of action. The peptides had no strict requirement for side chain composition or sequence register to permeate cells and target mitochondria in mammalian cell culture assays. All four peptides were pharmacologically active in serum withdrawal cell stress models yet showed significant differences in their abilities to restore mitochondrial membrane potential, preserve ATP content, and promote cell survival. Within our peptide set, the analog containing tryptophan side chains, SPN10, had the strongest impact on most membrane properties and showed greatest efficacy in cell culture studies. Taken together, these results show that side chain composition and register influence the activity of these mitochondria-targeted peptides, helping provide a framework for the rational design of next-generation therapeutics with enhanced potency.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of multiple omics approaches to define pathophysiology of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS), though both common and deadly in critically ill children, lacks targeted therapies. The development of effective pharmacotherapies has been limited, in part, by lack of clarity about the pathobiology of pediatric ARDS. Epithelial lung injury, vascular endothelial activation, and systemic immune activation are putative drivers of this complex disease process. Prior studies have used either hypothesis-driven (e.g., candidate genes and proteins, in vitro investigations) or unbiased (e.g., genome-wide association, transcriptomic, metabolomic) approaches to predict clinical outcomes and to define subphenotypes. Advances in multiple omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have permitted more comprehensive investigation of PARDS pathobiology. However, omics studies have been limited in children compared to adults, and analyses across multiple tissue types are lacking. Here, we synthesized existing literature on the molecular mechanism of PARDS, summarized our interrogation of publicly available genomic databases to determine the association of candidate genes with PARDS phenotypes across multiple tissues and cell types, and integrated recent studies that used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We conclude that novel profiling methods such as scRNA-seq, which permits more comprehensive, unbiased evaluation of pathophysiological mechanisms across tissue and cell types, should be employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PRDS toward the goal of identifying targeted therapies.

                C. elegans neurons under stress can produce giant vesicles, several microns in diameter, called exophers. Current models suggest that exophers are neuroprotective, providing a mechanism for stressed neurons to eject toxic protein aggregates and organelles. However, little is known of the fate of the exopher once it leaves the neuron. We found that exophers produced by mechanosensory neurons in C. elegans are engulfed by surrounding hypodermal skin cells, and are then broken up into numerous smaller vesicles that acquire hypodermal phagosome maturation markers, with vesicular contents gradually degraded by hypodermal lysosomes. Consistent with the hypodermis acting as an exopher phagocyte, we found that the hypodermal plasma membrane adjacent to newly formed exophers surrounds the exopher and accumulates F-actin. Efficient fission of engulfed exopher-phagosomes to produce smaller vesicles and degrade their contents required phagosome maturation factors SAND-1/Mon1, GTPase RAB-35, the CNT-1 ARF-GAP, and microtubule motor associated GTPase ARL-8, suggesting a close coupling of phagosome fission and phagosome maturation. Lysosome activity was required to degrade exopher contents in the hypodermis but not for exopher-phagosome resolution into smaller vesicles. Importantly, we found that GTPase ARF-6 and effector SEC-10/Exocyst activity in the hypodermis, along with the CED-1 phagocytic receptor, is required for efficient production of exophers by the neuron. Our results indicate that the neuron requires specific interaction with the phagocyte for an efficient exopher response, a mechanistic feature potentially conserved with mammalian exophergenesis, and similar to neuronal pruning by phagocytic glia that influences neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging the columnar functional organization of human area MT+ to axis-of-motion stimuli using VASO at 7 Tesla</a></h4>

              
                Cortical columns of direction-selective neurons in the motion sensitive area (MT) have been successfully established as a microscopic feature of the neocortex in animals. The same property has been investigated at mesoscale (<1mm) in the homologous brain area (hMT+) in living humans by using ultra-high field fMRI. Despite the reproducibility of the selective response to axis-of-motion stimuli, clear quantitative evidence for the columnar organization of hMT+ is still lacking. Using cerebral blood volume (CBV)-sensitive fMRI at 7 Tesla with submillimeter resolution and high spatial specificity to microvasculature, we investigate the columnar functional organization of hMT+ (V5) in 5 participants perceiving axis-of-motion stimuli for both blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and vascular space occupancy (VASO) contrast mechanisms provided by the used Slab-Selective Slice Inversion (SS-SI)-VASO sequence. With the development of a new searchlight-like algorithm for column detection, we provide the first quantitative columnarity map that characterizes the entire 3D hMT+ volume. We demonstrate the advantage of using CBV-sensitive fMRI to detect mesoscopic cortical features by showing, through our new voxel-wise measures of sensitivity and specificity, the higher specificity of axis-of-motion cortical columns detected by VASO compared to BOLD contrast. These voxel-wise metrics also provide further insights on how to mitigate the highly debated draining veins effect. We conclude that using CBV-VASO fMRI together with voxel-wise measurements of sensitivity, specificity and columnarity offers a promising avenue to quantify the mesoscopic organization of hMT+ with respect to axis-of-motion stimuli. Furthermore, our approach and methodological developments are generalizable and applicable to other human brain areas where similar mesoscopic research questions are addressed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Complement-dependent loss of inhibitory synapses on pyramidal neurons following Toxoplasma gondii infection</a></h4>

              
                The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has developed mechanisms to establish a central nervous system infection in virtually all warm-blooded animals. Acute T. gondii infection can cause neuroinflammation, encephalitis, and seizures. Meanwhile, studies in humans, non-human primates, and rodents have linked chronic T. gondii infection with altered behavior and increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. We previously demonstrated that T. gondii infection triggers the loss of perisomatic inhibitory synapses, an important source of inhibition on excitatory pyramidal cells, and a type of synapse that is disrupted in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Similar to other instances of inflammation and neurodegeneration, we showed that phagocytic cells (including microglia and infiltrating monocytes) contribute to the loss of these inhibitory synapses. However, in the case of T. gondii-induced synapse loss, phagocytic cells target and ensheath the cell bodies of telencephalic neurons. Here, we show that these phagocytic cells specifically ensheath excitatory pyramidal neurons, leading to the preferential loss of perisomatic synapses on these neurons. In contrast, inhibitory cortical interneuron subtypes are not extensively ensheathed by phagocytic cells following infection. Moreover, we show that infection induces expression of complement C3 protein by these excitatory neurons and that C3 is required for the loss of perisomatic inhibitory synapses, albeit not through activation of the classical complement pathway. Together, these findings provide evidence that T. gondii infection induces changes in excitatory pyramidal neurons that trigger selective removal of inhibitory perisomatic synapses in the infected neocortex and provide a novel role for complement in remodeling of inhibitory circuits in the infected brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Laminar VASO fMRI in focal hand dystonia patients</a></h4>

              
                Focal Hand Dystonia (FHD) is a disabling movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements, cramps and spasms. It is associated with pathological neural microcircuits in the cortical somatosensory system. While invasive preclinical modalities allow researchers to probe specific neural microcircuits of cortical layers and columns, conventional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) cannot resolve such small neural computational units. In this study, we take advantage of recent developments in ultra-high-field MRI hardware and MR-sequences to capture altered digit representations and laminar processing in FHD patients. We aim to characterize the capability and challenges of layer-specific imaging and analysis tools in resolving laminar and columnar structures in clinical research setups. We scanned N=4 affected and N=5 unaffected hemispheres at 7T and found consistent results of altered neural microcircuitry in FHD patients: a) In affected hemispheres of FHD patients, we found a breakdown of ordered finger representation in the primary somatosensory cortex, as suggested from previous low-resolution fMRI. b) In affected primary motor cortices of FHD patients, we furthermore found increased fMRI activity in superficial cortico-cortical neural input layers (II/III), compared to relatively weaker activity in the cortico-spinal output layers (Vb/VI). Overall, we show that layer-fMRI acquisition and analysis tools are applicable to address clinically-driven neuroscience research questions about altered computational mechanisms at the spatial scales that were previously only accessible in animal models. We believe that this study paves the way for easier translation of preclinical work into clinical research in focal hand dystonia and beyond.

                Based on our expectations about material properties we can implicitly predict an object's future states, e.g. a wine glass falling down will break when it hits the ground. How these expectations affect relatively low level perceptual decisions, however, has not been systematically studied previously. To seek an answer to this question we conducted a behavioral experiment using animations of various familiar objects (e.g. key, wine glass etc.) freely falling and hitting the ground. During a training session participants first built expectations about the dynamic properties of those objects. Half of the participants (N=28) built expectations consistent with our daily lives (e.g. a key bounces rigidly), whereas the other half learned an anomalous behavior (e.g. a key wobbles). This was followed by experimental sessions, in which expectations were unmet in 20% of the trials. In both training and experimental sessions, participants' task was to report whether the objects broke or not upon hitting the ground. Critically a specific object always remained intact or broke, only the manner with which it did so differed. For example, a key could wobble or remain rigid, but it never broke. We found that participants' reaction times were longer when expectations were unmet even when those expectations were anomalous and learned during the training session. Furthermore, we found an interplay between long-term and newly learned expectations, which could be predicted by a Bayesian updating approach. Overall, our results show that expectations about material properties can have an impact on relatively low-level perceptual decision making processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid Color Categorization in the Brain Revealed by Frequency-tagging-based EEG</a></h4>

              
                The origin of color categories has been debated extensively. Linguistic relativists claim that color categories are shaped by the language we speak and that color terms subsequently affect our perception of color, while universalists postulate that color categories are independent of language and formed based on perceptual mechanisms. Our study adopted a sensitive frequency-tagging-based EEG paradigm where the color stimuli were presented sequentially at a fast speed of 10 Hz (SOA: 100 ms) to probe fast, feedforward processing of color categories. We showed that EEG responses to cross-category oddball colors at the frequency where the oddball stimuli were presented was significantly larger than the responses to within-category oddball colors. This finding suggested that the categories of color stimuli were likely to be encoded automatically and in a feedforward manner, as the color stimuli were only briefly flashed and irrelevant to the task. The findings support the view that the categorical processing of color emerges at the early perceptual stage.

                The rigid, stimulus-bound nature of drug seeking that characterizes Substance-use disorder (SUD) has been related to a dysregulation of motivational and early attentional reflexive and inhibitory reflective systems. However, the mechanisms by which these systems are engaged by drug-paired conditioned stimuli CSs) when they promote the enactment of seeking habits in individuals with a SUD have not been elucidated. The present study aimed behaviorally and electrophysiologically to characterize the nature of the interaction between the reflexive and reflective systems recruited by CSs in individuals with a smoking habit. For this, we measured the behavioral performance and associated ERPs of 20 individuals with a smoking habit and 20 controls, who never smoked regularly, in a modified Go/NoGo task during which smoking-related CSs, appetitive, and neutral pictures, presented either in first-person or as a third-person visual perspective were displayed 250 ms before the Go/NoGo cue. We show that smoking-related cues selectively influence early incentive motivation-related attentional bias (N2 after picture onset), motor readiness and behavioral inhibition (Go-P3, NoGo-P3 and Pc) of individuals with a smoking habit only when presented from a first-person perspective. These data together identify the neural signature of the aberrant engagement of the reflexive and reflective systems during the recruitment of an incentive habit by CSs presented as if they had been response-produced, i.e., as conditioned reinforcers.

                Understanding the patterns of changes in brain function and structure under the influence of various disorders is of utmost importance. There have been numerous efforts towards successful biomarker discovery for complex brain disorders by utilizing neuroimaging datasets accompanied by analytical frameworks. However, due to the multi-faceted nature of the disorders involving a wide and overlapping range of symptoms as well as complex changes in structural and functional brain networks, it is increasingly important to devise computational frameworks that can take into account underlying patterns of heterogeneous changes with specific target assessments, at the same time producing a summarizing output from the high-dimensional neuroimaging data. While various machine learning approaches focus on diagnostic frameworks, many learning frameworks have been utilized to break down the neuroimaging features into lower dimensional components using unsupervised methods, as well as to analyze important features at the level of brain regions involved in prediction using supervised methods. However, most frameworks either do not take into account the target assessment information while extracting brain subspaces, or are able to extract only higher dimensional importance associations as an ordered list of involved features, making manual interpretation at the level of subspaces difficult. We present a novel multimodal active subspace learning framework to understand various subspaces within the brain that are associated with changes in particular biological and cognitive traits. Our framework decomposes the multimodal feature importances associated with a battery of biological and cognitive assessments to extract robust multimodal subspaces that define the highest change in a given assessment. Through a repeated sub-sampling procedure on an Alzheimer's dataset, we show that our framework is able to extract subspaces covering both functional and structural modalities, which are specific to a given group assessment and also retain predictive performance in standard machine learning algorithms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Basolateral amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, but not dorsal hippocampus, are necessary for the control of reward-seeking by occasion setters</a></h4>

              
                Reward-seeking in the world is driven by cues that can have ambiguous predictive and motivational value. To produce adaptive, flexible reward-seeking it is necessary to exploit occasion setters, other distinct features in the environment, to resolve the ambiguity of Pavlovian reward-paired cues. Despite this, very little research has investigated the neurobiological underpinnings of occasion setting and as a result little is known about which brain regions are critical for occasion setting. To address this, we exploited a recently developed task that was amenable to neurobiological inquiry where a conditioned stimulus is only predictive of reward delivery if preceded in time by the non-overlapping presentation of a separate cue - an occasion setter. This task required male rats to maintain and link cue-triggered expectations across time to produce adaptive reward-seeking. We interrogated the contributions of the basolateral amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex to occasion setting as these regions are thought to be critical for the computation and exploitation of state value, respectively. Reversible inactivation of either structure prior to the occasion-setting task resulted in a profound inability of rats to use the occasion setter to guide reward seeking. In contrast, inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus, a region fundamental for context-specific responding was without effect nor did inactivation of the basolateral amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex in a standard Pavlovian conditioning preparation affect conditioned responding. We conclude that neural activity within the orbitofrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala circuit is necessary to update and resolve ambiguity in the environment to promote cue-driven reward-seeking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical dynamics of speech feedback control in non-fluent Primary Progressive Aphasia</a></h4>

              
                Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which patients progressively lose speech and language abilities. The non-fluent variant of PPA (nfvPPA) is characterised by impaired motor speech and agrammatism. To date, no study in nfvPPA patients has either examined speech motor control behaviour or imaged the speech motor control network during vocal production. Here, we did this using a novel structure-function imaging approach integrating magnetoencephalographic imaging of neural oscillations with voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We examined task-induced non-phase-locked neural oscillatory activity during a vocal motor control task, where participants were prompted to phonate the vowel /[a]/ for ~2.4s while the pitch of their auditory feedback was shifted either up or down by 100 cents for a period of 400ms mid-utterance. Participants were 18 nfvPPA patients (14 female, mean age = 67.79 +/- 8.02 years) and 17 controls (13 female, mean age = 64.81 +/- 5.76 years). Patients showed a smaller compensation response to pitch perturbation than controls (p < 0.05). Task-induced neural oscillations across five frequency bands were reconstructed in source space for each subject during pitch feedback perturbation. Patients exhibited reduced task-induced alpha-band (8-12Hz) neural activity unrelated to their atrophy patterns, in the right temporal lobe and the right temporoparietal junction (p < 0.01) from 250ms to 750ms after pitch perturbation onset. Patients also showed increased task-induced beta-band (12-30Hz) activity also unrelated to cortical atrophy in the left dorsal sensorimotor cortex, left premotor cortex and the left supplementary motor area (p < 0.01) from 50ms to 150ms after pitch perturbation onset. Reduced average alpha-band power at the peak voxel in the temporoparietal cluster in the right hemisphere could predict speech motor impairment in patients ({beta} = 3.41, F = 8.31, p = 0.0128) whereas increased average beta-band power at the peak voxel in the left dorsal sensorimotor cluster could not ({beta} = -1.75, F = 1.72, p = 0.2123). Collectively, these results suggest significant disruption in sensorimotor integration during vocal production in nfvPPA patients which occurs unrelated to patterns of atrophy. These findings highlight how multimodal structure-function imaging in PPA enhances our understanding of its pathophysiological sequelae.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Graph lesion-deficit mapping of fluid intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Fluid intelligence is arguably the defining feature of human cognition. Yet the nature of its relationship with the brain remains a contentious topic. Influential proposals drawing primarily on functional imaging data have implicated "multiple demand" frontoparietal and more widely distributed cortical networks, but extant lesion-deficit studies with greater causal power are almost all small, methodologically constrained, and inconclusive. The task demands large samples of patients, comprehensive investigation of performance, fine-grained anatomical mapping, and robust lesion-deficit inference, yet to be brought to bear on it. We assessed 165 healthy controls and 227 frontal or non-frontal patients with unilateral brain lesions on the best-established test of fluid intelligence, Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, employing an array of lesion-deficit inferential models responsive to the potentially distributed nature of fluid intelligence. Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block models were used to reveal the community structure of lesion deficit networks, disentangling functional from confounding pathological distributed effects. Impaired performance was confined to patients with frontal lesions (F(2,387) = 18.491; p < .001; frontal worse than non-frontal and healthy participants p < .01; p <.001), more marked on the right than left (F(4,385) = 12.237; p < .001; right worse than left and healthy participants p<.01; p<.001). Patients with non-frontal lesions were indistinguishable from controls and showed no modulation by laterality. Neither the presence nor the extent of multiple demand network involvement affected performance. Both conventional network-based statistics and non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling heavily implicated the right frontal lobe. Crucially, this localisation was confirmed on explicitly disentangling functional from pathology-driven effects within a layered stochastic block model, prominently highlighting a right frontal network involving middle and inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and post-central gyri, with a weak contribution from right superior parietal lobule. Similar results were obtained with standard lesion-deficit analyses. Our study represents the first large-scale investigation of the distributed neural substrates of fluid intelligence in the focally injured brain. Combining novel graph-based lesion-deficit mapping with detailed investigation of cognitive performance in a large sample of patients provides crucial information about the neural basis of intelligence. Our findings indicate that a set of predominantly right frontal regions, rather than a more widely distributed network, is critical to the high-level functions involved in fluid intelligence. Further they suggest that Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices is a useful clinical index of fluid intelligence and a sensitive marker of right frontal lobe dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The 3D Structural Architecture of the Human Hand Area is Non-Topographic</a></h4>

              
                The functional topography of the human primary somatosensory cortex (S1) hand area is a widely studied model system to understand sensory organization and plasticity. It is so far unclear whether or not the underlying 3D structural architecture also shows a topographic organization. We used 7T MRI data to quantify layer-specific myelin, iron and mineralization in relation to population receptive field maps of individual finger representations. This 3D description allowed us to identify a characteristic profile of layer-specific myelin and iron deposition in the S1 hand area, but revealed an absence of structural differences between individual finger representations, and an absence of low-myelin borders between individual fingers. Both, however, were detected between the hand and the face areas. Using markers of responsivity, precision and sensorimotor integration, we additionally phenotyped these microstructural features with respect to their relation to BOLD signal change and behavior. We conclude that the 3D structural architecture of the human hand area is non-topographic, other than in some monkey species, which suggests a high degree of flexibility for functional finger organization and plasticity in humans.

                The trigeminal blink response is a familiar and easily evoked brainstem reflex. Despite a long history of clinical and research investigation, there has been limited study of how parametric manipulation of the intensity of somatosensory stimulation modulates the evoked response. The goal of this study was to measure the psychometric trigeminal sensitivity function and to test the resulting model parameters for differences between the eyelids contralateral and ipsilateral to the side of stimulation, and to test for individual differences in sensitivity. We measured the ipsilateral and contralateral blink in 17 healthy, adult participants in response to airpuffs delivered to the cornea over a range of five, log-spaced intensities (3.5 - 60 PSI). The temporal lid position vector was decomposed into amplitude, velocity, and shape components. We found that variation in blink amplitude was well fit with a two-parameter Weibull cumulative density function of log stimulus intensity. There was a reliable decrease in threshold sensitivity of the contralateral as compared to ipsilateral eyelid. This decrease was consistent across participants despite substantial individual differences in the threshold and slope of the overall sensitivity function, suggesting that the laterality effect arises subsequent to individual differences in the neural circuit. We conclude that a parametric measure of trigeminal sensitivity is a promising tool for examining neural mechanisms that modulate this response, including in various disease states.

                We perform microelectrode array recordings of neonatal chick retina explants and report stimulus-dependent response properties of different retinal ganglion cell types to various luminance and contrast adaptation conditions. The isolated single units indicate wavelength-sensitive response properties of most of the putative retinal ganglion cells recorded. Responses to different luminance and contrast conditions were investigated as a function of wavelength indicating a combination of adaptation and sensitization features. We also demonstrate the presence of color opponency between blue (450 nm) and green (530 nm) light input. The analysis of their STA profiles to the full field random gaussian flicker stimulus reveals a green ON/blue OFF RGC type and a blue ON/green OFF RGC type.

                Pyramidal neurons, a mainstay of cortical regions, receive a plethora of inputs from various areas onto their morphologically distinct apical and basal trees. Both trees differentially contribute to the somatic response, defining distinct anatomical and possibly functional sub-units. To elucidate the contribution of each tree to the encoding of visual stimuli at the somatic level, we modeled the response pattern of a L2/3 V1 pyramidal neuron to orientation-tuned synaptic input. Towards this goal, we used a morphologically detailed computational model of a single cell, validated against electrophysiological and two-photon imaging data. Our simulations predict a synergistic effect of apical and basal trees on somatic action potential generation: basal tree activity, in the form of either depolarization or dendritic spiking, is necessary for producing somatic activity, despite the fact that most somatic spikes are heavily driven by apical dendritic spikes. This model provides evidence for synergistic computations taking place in the basal and apical trees of the L2/3 V1 neuron and emphasizes the potential role of predictive and attentional feedback input in these cells.

                Existing studies have identified that depression and depressive symptoms are associated with reduced sensitivity to feedback processing, which is a core ability that determine the success of human actions. However, a key individual difference which is the socioeconomic status (SES) has been largely ignored in this field because the recent trend of research has suggested how it relates to various cognitive domain specific neural systems. Because depression is a widespread mental health condition that is more prevalent among the poor, it can potentially play a role in the association between poverty and the feedback processing. With a sample of 80 adults recruited from low to high-income communities, the current study examined the role of depression on the relationship between poverty and feedback processing by using feedback negativity (FN) event-related potential (ERP), which is a well-known ERP component that is indexed by response feedback indicating losses versus gains. Consistent with previous studies, high depressive symptoms were associated with reduced FN amplitude across our sample. SES was negatively associated with FN and depressive symptoms which indicates reduced reward sensitivity to feedback among the low-SES individuals who are also mostly depressed. However, no association between SES and reward sensitivity was observed when it was controlled for depression. Findings in this study suggests the importance of partial out the variance accounted for by depression when studying responses to reward sensitivity in poverty.

                Rationale: Evidence suggests that single housing in rats acts as a chronic stressor, raising the possibilities that it contributes to measures of heroin craving and that pair housing ameliorates such measures. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether pair housing after heroin self-administration reduces the incubation of craving, extinction, and reinstatement of heroin seeking. Methods: Single-housed female and male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent daily 6-h heroin self-administration, wherein active lever presses produced a heroin infusion paired with light/tone cues. One d after self-administration, rats underwent a baseline cued-seeking test wherein active lever presses only produced light/tone cues. Immediately following this cued-seeking test, rats were either pair-housed with a weight- and sex-matched naive rat or remained single-housed for the rest of the study. For 14 d, rats remained in their homecages, after which they underwent a cued-seeking test to assess the incubation of craving compared to their baseline test. Rats then underwent extinction sessions followed by cue-induced and heroin-primed reinstatements. Results: The findings reveal that pair-housed rats did not differ from single-housed rats in terms of the incubation of craving, extinction, or reinstatement of heroin seeking. Additionally, the results did not reveal any evidence of sex-based differences in the study. Conclusions: The present work indicates that pair housing during the forced abstinence period does not alter measures of heroin craving/seeking. These findings suggest that the chronic stress of single housing specifically during forced abstinence does not contribute to the degree of such measures.

                Characterizing large-scale dynamic organization of the brain relies on both descriptive and mechanistic modeling. The former often uses the language of statistical dependency, and the latter uses that of dynamical systems. The conceptual translation between the two is not straightforward. The present work aims to provide a conceptual bridge between descriptive and mechanistic modeling via a computational framework. In particular, we focus on fMRI-based and -targeted modeling of large-scale brain dynamics in humans. We conceptualize brain dynamics as a complex landscape continuously modulated by internal and external changes (e.g., arousal level, task conditions). The modulation can induce transitions between one stable brain state (attractor) to another. We provide a method to retrieve the network of transitions between relevant attractors from time-series data alone. For theoretical validation of our approach, we first use a biophysical network model to induce transitions in a controlled manner, which provides simulated time series equipped with a ground-truth attractor transition network. Building on existing works in the field of Topological Data Analysis, we develop a computational tool, named the Temporal Mapper, that reconstructs the ground-truth transition network from simulated time-series data better than existing time-varying approaches. For empirical relevance, we later apply our Temporal Mapper approach to human fMRI data gathered during a continuous multitask experiment. We found that occupancy of the high-degree nodes and cycles of the transition network was significantly associated with subjects' behavioral performance. Taken together, we provide an important first step towards integrating descriptive and mechanistic modeling of brain dynamics.

	<p>Tinnitus is the phantom perception of a sound, often accompanied by increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. Degenerative or inflammatory processes, as well as changes in monoaminergic systems, have been suggested as potential underlying mechanisms. Herein, we conducted the first post-mortem histopathological assessment to reveal detailed structural changes in tinnitus patients&amp;amp;rsquo; auditory and non-auditory brain regions. Tissue blocks containing the medial geniculate body (MGB), thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), central part of the inferior colliculus (CIC), and dorsal and obscurus raphe nuclei (DRN and ROb) were obtained from tinnitus patients and matched controls. Cell density and size were assessed in Nissl-stained sections. Astrocytes and microglia were assessed using immunohistochemistry. The DRN was stained using antibodies raised against phenylalanine hydroxylase-8 (PH8) and tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) to visualize serotonergic and dopaminergic cells, respectively. Cell density in the MGB and CIC of tinnitus patients was reduced, accompanied by a reduction in the number of astrocytes in the CIC only. Quantification of cell surface size did not reveal any significant difference in any of the investigated brain regions between groups. The number of PH8-positive cells was reduced in the DRN and ROb of tinnitus patients compared to controls, while the number of TH-positive cells remained unchanged in the DRN. These findings suggest that both neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes in the MGB and CIC underlie the neuropathology of tinnitus. Moreover, the reduced number of serotonergic cell bodies in tinnitus cases points toward a potential role of the raphe serotonergic system in tinnitus.</p>

	<p> Multiple psychosocial interventions to treat ADHD symptoms have been developed and empirically tested. However, no clear recommendations exist regarding the utilization of these interventions for treating core ADHD symptoms across different populations. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis by the CADDRA Guidelines work Group was to generate such recommendations, using recent evidence. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses (MA) from 2010 to 13 February 020 were searched in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, EBM Reviews and CINAHL. Studies of populations with significant levels of comorbidities were excluded. Thirty-one studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (22 RCT, 9 MA) and 24 studies (19 RCT, 5 MA) were included in the quantitative synthesis. Using three-level meta-analyses to pool results of multiple observations from each RCT, as well as four-level meta-analyses to pool results from multiples outcomes and multiple studies of each MA, we generated recommendations using the GRADE approach for: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Physical Exercise and Mind&amp;amp;ndash;Body intervention; Caregiver intervention; School-based and Executive intervention; and other interventions for core ADHD symptoms across Preschooler, Child, Adolescent and Adult populations. The evidence supports a recommendation for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for adults and Caregiver intervention for Children, but not for preschoolers. There were not enough data to provide recommendations for the other types of psychosocial interventions. Our results are in line with previous meta-analytic assessments; however, they provide a more in-depth assessment of the effect of psychosocial intervention on core ADHD symptoms.</p>

	<p>Blood-based proteomic analysis is a routine practice for detecting the biomarkers of human disease. The results obtained from blood alone cannot fully reflect the alterations of nerve cells, including neurons and glia cells, in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) brains. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate novel potential AD biomarker candidates, through an integrated multi-omics approach in AD. We propose a comprehensive strategy to identify high-confidence candidate biomarkers by integrating multi-omics data from AD, including single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets of the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices, as wells as serum proteomic datasets. We first quantified a total of 124,658 nuclei, 8 cell types, and 3701 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from snRNA-seq dataset of 30 human cortices, as well as 1291 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from serum proteomic dataset of 11 individuals. Then, ten DEGs/DEPs (NEBL, CHSY3, STMN2, MARCKS, VIM, FGD4, EPB41L2, PLEKHG1, PTPRZ1, and PPP1R14A) were identified by integration analysis of snRNA-seq and proteomics data. Finally, four novel candidate biomarkers (NEBL, EPB41L2, FGD4, and MARCKS) for AD further stood out, according to bioinformatics analysis, and they were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) verification. These candidate biomarkers are related to the regulation process of the actin cytoskeleton, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic loss in the AD brain tissue. Collectively, this study identified novel cell type-related biomarkers for AD by integrating multi-omics datasets from brains and serum. Our findings provided new targets for the clinical treatment and prognosis of AD.</p>

                The worlds languages differ substantially in their sounds, grammatical rules, and expression of semantic relations. While starting from a shared neural substrate, the developing brain must therefore have the plasticity to accommodate to the specific processing needs of each language. However, there is little research on how language-specific differences impacts brain function and structure. Here, we show that speaking typologically different languages leaves unique traces in the brains white matter connections of monolingual speakers of English (fixed word order language), German (with grammatical marking), and Chinese (tonal language). Using machine learning, we classified with high accuracy the mother tongue based on the participants patterns of structural connectivity obtained with probabilistic tractography. More importantly, connectivity differences between groups could be traced back to relevant processing characteristics of each native tongue. Our results show that the life-long use of a certain language leaves distinct traces in a speakers neural network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expansion Sequencing of RNA Barcoded Neurons in the Mammalian Brain: Progress and Implications for Molecularly Annotated Connectomics</a></h4>

              
                Mapping and molecularly annotating mammalian neural circuits is challenging due to the inability to uniquely label cells while also resolving subcellular features such as synaptic proteins or fine cellular processes. We argue that an ideal technology for connectomics would have the following characteristics: the capacity for robust distance-independent labeling, synaptic resolution, molecular interrogation, and scalable computational methods. The recent development of high-diversity cellular barcoding with RNA has provided a way to overcome the labeling limitations associated with spectral dyes, however performing all-optical circuit mapping has not been demonstrated because no method exists to image barcodes throughout cells at synaptic-resolution. Here we show ExBarSeq, an integrated method combining in situ sequencing of RNA barcodes, immunostaining, and Expansion Microscopy coupled with an end-to-end software pipeline that automatically extracts barcode identities from large imaging datasets without data processing bottlenecks. As a proof of concept, we applied ExBarSeq to thick tissue sections from mice virally infected with MAPseq viral vectors and demonstrated the extraction of 50 barcoded cells in the visual cortex as well as cell morphologies uncovered via immunostaining. The current work demonstrates high resolution multiplexing of exogenous barcodes and endogenous synaptic proteins and outlines a roadmap for molecularly annotated connectomics at a brain-wide scale.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heterogeneous patterns of ventral tegmental area neuronal activity coordinate nucleus accumbens dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine release in the ventral striatum is fundamental to adaptive appetitive behavior. Frustratingly, technological, and methodological hurdles have limited the investigation of the mechanisms effecting phasic dopamine release. Although dopamine neuron activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) surely results in dopamine release, how populations of these neurons coordinate their activities in time to modulate the temporal pattern of release remains unclear. Additionally, burgeoning evidence suggests that control over striatal dopamine release is not solely regulated by the burst firing of VTA neurons or even cell-body activation of these neurons. Here, we recorded VTA neurons while monitoring pharmacologically induced phasic dopamine release events in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core) of anesthetized rats. Although changes in putative dopamine neuron firing were, on average, concomitant with the onset of NAc dopamine release events and to the rate of increase of release (first derivative of dopamine concentration), the tuning of individual VTA neurons to dopamine release was notably heterogenous, with subsets of neurons responding prior to release, during release, or at the time of peak release. Others were notably silent during release but active otherwise. Interestingly, both putative dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons expressed this temporally heterogeneous response pattern, and individual cells did not strongly predict the magnitude of dopamine release events. These data suggest that populations of VTA neurons become active at distinct times of a dopamine release event to sculpt the temporal pattern of release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic Targeting of AII Amacrine Cells restores Retinal Computations performed by the Inner Retina</a></h4>

              
                Most inherited retinal dystrophies display progressive photoreceptor cell degeneration leading to severe visual impairment. Optogenetic reactivation of inner retinal neurons is a promising avenue to restore vision in retinas having lost their photoreceptors. Expression of optogenetic proteins in surviving ganglion cells, the retinal output, allows them to take on the lost photoreceptive function. Nonetheless, this creates an exclusively ON retina by expression of depolarizing optogenetic proteins in all classes of ganglion cells, whereas a normal retina extracts several features from the visual scene, with different ganglion cells detecting light increase (ON) and light decrease (OFF). Refinement of this therapeutic strategy should thus aim at restoring these computations. In an attempt to do so, we used a promoter that targets gene expression to a specific interneuron of the retina called the AII amacrine cell. The AII amacrine cell simultaneously activates the ON pathway and inhibits the OFF pathway. We show that the optogenetic stimulation of AII amacrine cells allows restoration of both ON and OFF responses in the retina, but also mediates other types of retinal processing such as sustained and transient responses. Targeting amacrine cells with optogenetics is thus a promising avenue to restore better retinal function and visual perception in patients suffering from retinal degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrated transcriptome analysis of Huntingtons disease iPSC-derived and mouse astrocytes implicates dysregulated synaptogenesis, actin, and astrocyte maturation</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat within the Huntingtin (HTT) gene having dysregulated cellular homeostasis in the central nervous system, particularly in the striatum and cortex. Astrocytes establish and maintain neuronal functions through the secretion of soluble factors and physical interactions with other neurovascular unit cell types. Under pathological conditions, astrocytes can become reactive, causing cell state transitions that affect brain function. To investigate transitions between cellular states in unaffected and HD astrocytes at high resolution, single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on human HD patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and on striatal and cortical tissue from a rapidly progressing HD mouse model (R6/2). Analysis of HD human and mouse astrocytes revealed both models have alterations in morphology, glutamate uptake, and dysregulation of astrocyte identity and maturation, whereas dysregulated actin-mediated signaling was unique to human iPSC-derived astrocytes. Representative proteins showed altered levels by Western. In both species, HD transcriptional changes reveal potential astrocyte maturation deficits that were potentially driven by astrogliogenesis transcription factors, including ATF3 and NFIA. When perturbed in a drosophila model of HD, knockdown of NFIA in glia rescued the climbing deficit. These data further support the hypothesis that mutant HTT induces dysregulated astrocyte cell states resulting in dysfunctional astrocytic properties, suggests that some of these states are cell autonomous and maybe unique to human HD, and implicate ATF3 and maturation deficits in HD pathogenesis.

                Hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) within C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Thalamic atrophy occurs in both sporadic and familial FTD but is thought to distinctly affect HRE carriers. Separately, emerging evidence suggests widespread de-repression of transposable elements (TEs) in the brain in several neurodegenerative diseases, including C9orf72 HRE-mediated FTD (C9-FTD). Whether TE activation can be measured in peripheral blood and how the reduction in peripheral C9orf72 expression observed in HRE carriers relates to atrophy and clinical impairment remain unknown. We used the FreeSurfer pipeline and its extensions to assess the effects of C9orf72 HRE and clinical diagnosis (n = 78) on atrophy of thalamic nuclei. We also generated a novel, whole-blood RNA-seq dataset to determine the relationships between peripheral C9orf72 expression, TE activation, thalamic atrophy, and clinical severity (n = 114). We confirmed global thalamic atrophy and reduced C9orf72 expression in HRE carriers. Moreover, we identified disproportionate atrophy of the right mediodorsal lateral nucleus in HRE carriers and showed that C9orf72 expression associated with clinical severity, independent of thalamic atrophy. Strikingly, we found global peripheral activation of TEs, including the human endogenous LINE-1 element, L1HS. L1HS levels were associated with atrophy of multiple pulvinar nuclei, a thalamic region implicated in C9-FTD. Integration of peripheral transcriptomic and neuroimaging data from HRE carriers revealed atrophy of specific thalamic nuclei; demonstrated that C9orf72 levels relate to clinical severity; and identified marked de-repression of TEs, including L1HS, which predicted atrophy of FTD-relevant thalamic nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular and anatomical roadmap of stroke pathology in immunodeficient mice</a></h4>

              
                Background Stroke remains a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. It has become apparent that inflammation and immune mediators have a pre-dominant role in initial tissue damage and long-term recovery following the injury. Still, different immunosuppressed mouse models are necessary in stroke research e.g., to evaluate therapies using human cell grafts. Despite mounting evidence delineating the importance of inflammation in the stroke pathology, it is poorly described to what extent partial immune deficiency influences the overall stroke outcome. Methods Here, we assessed the stroke pathology of popular genetic immunodeficient mouse models, i.e., NOD scid gamma (NSG) and recombination activating gene 2 (Rag2-/-) mice as well as pharmacologically immunosuppressed mice and compared them to immune competent, wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J mice up to three weeks after injury. We performed histology, gene expression profiling, serum analysis and functional behavioural tests to identify the impact of immunosuppression on the stroke progression. Results We detected distinct changes in microglia infiltration, scar-forming and vascular repair in immune-suppressed mice three weeks after injury. Gene expression analysis of stroked tissue revealed the strongest deviation from immune competent mice was observed in NSG mice, for instance, affecting immunological and angiogenic pathways. Pharmacological immunosuppression resulted in the least variation in gene expression compared with the WT. Major differences have been further identified in the systemic inflammatory response following stroke acutely and three weeks following injury. These anatomical, genetic, and systemic changes did not affect functional deficits and recovery in a time course of three weeks. To determine whether the timing of immunosuppression after stroke is critical, we compared mice with acute and delayed pharmacological immunosuppression after stroke. Mice with a delayed immunosuppression (7d) after stroke showed increased inflammatory and scarring responses compared to animals acutely treated with tacrolimus, thus more closely resembling WT pathology. Transplantation of human cells in the brains of immunosuppressed mouse models led to prolonged cell survival in all immunosuppressed mouse models, which was most consistent in NSG and Rag2-/- mice. Conclusions In sum, we detected distinct anatomical and molecular changes in the stroke pathology between the individual immunosuppressed mouse models that should be carefully considered when selecting an appropriate mouse model for stroke research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">KAP is the neuronal organelle adaptor for Kinesin-2 KIF3AB and KIF3AC</a></h4>

              
                Kinesin-driven organelle transport is crucial for neuron development and maintenance, yet the mechanisms by which kinesins specifically bind their organelle cargoes remain undefined. In contrast to other transport kinesins, the neuronal function and specific organelle adaptors of heterodimeric Kinesin-2 family members KIF3AB and KIF3AC remain unknown. We developed a novel microscopy-based assay to define protein-protein interactions in intact neurons. The experiments found that KIF3AB and KIF3AC both bind KAP. These interactions are mediated by the distal C-terminal tail regions and not the coiled-coil domain. We used live-cell imaging in cultured hippocampal neurons to define the localization and trafficking parameters of KIF3AB and KIF3AC organelle populations. We discovered that KIF3AB/KAP and KIF3AC/KAP bind the same organelle populations and defined their transport parameters in axons and dendrites. The results also show that ~12% of KIF3 organelles contain the RNA binding protein, adenomatous polyposis coli. These data point towards a model in which KIF3AB and KIF3AC use KAP as their neuronal organelle adaptor and that these kinesins mediate transport of a range of organelles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex and BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism matter for exercise-induced increase in neurogenesis and cognition in middle-aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Females show greater benefits of exercise on cognition in both humans and rodents, which may be related to brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the Val66Met polymorphism, within the human BDNF gene, causes impaired activity-dependent secretion of neuronal BDNF and impairments to some forms of memory. We evaluated whether sex and BDNF genotype (Val66Met polymorphism (Met/Met) versus Wild Type (Val/Val)) influenced the ability of voluntary running to increase neurogenesis and cognition in mice. C57BL/6J (13 months) mice were randomly assigned to either a control or an aerobic training (AT) group (running disk access). Mice were trained on the visual discrimination and reversal paradigm in a touch screen-based technology to evaluate cognitive flexibility. BDNF Val/Val mice outperformed BDNF Met/Met mice on both cognitive tasks. Female BDNF Val/Val mice showed greater cognitive flexibility compared to male mice regardless of AT. Despite running less than BDNF Val/Val mice, AT improved both cognitive tasks in BDNF Met/Met mice. AT increased neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus of BDNF Val/Val mice of both sexes and increased the proportion of mature type 3 doublecortin-expressing cells in the dorsal hippocampus of female mice only. Our results indicate AT results in improved cognitive performance in BDNF Met/Met mice and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in BDNF Val/Val mice in middle age. Furthermore, middle-aged female mice may benefit more from AT than males in terms of neuroplasticity, an effect that was influenced by the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism.

	<p>Maternal stress can afflict fetal brain development, putting the offspring at risk of cognitive deficits, including anxiety. The prefrontal cortex (PFC), a protracted maturing region, is notably affected by prenatal stress (PS). However, it remains unclear how PS interferes with the maturation of the GABAergic system, considering its functional adjustment in the PFC during adolescence. The present study thus investigated the long-lasting consequences of PS on the prefrontal GABAergic functions of adolescent offspring. Pregnant Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley rats were divided into controls and the PS group, which underwent restraint stress during the last week of gestation. Male pups from postnatal days (PND) 40&amp;amp;ndash;42 were submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Proteins essentially involved in GABAergic signaling were then examined in PFC tissues, including the K+-Cl&amp;amp;minus; cotransporter (KCC2), Na+-K+-Cl&amp;amp;minus; cotransporter (NKCC1), &amp;amp;alpha;1 and &amp;amp;alpha;5 subunits of GABA type A receptors (GABAA receptors), and parvalbumin (PV), along with cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation (pCREB), which reacts in the plasticity regulation of PV-positive interneurons. The results revealed that the higher anxiety-like behavior of PS adolescent rats concurred with the significant decreases of the KCC2 and &amp;amp;alpha;1 subunits, with PV- and pCREB-lowered levels. The findings suggested that PS disrupts the continuance of PFC maturity by reducing the essential elements of GABAergic functions. These changes likely underlie the anxiety emerging in adolescence, possibly progressing to mental disorders.</p>

	<p>Although functional impairment is required for a diagnosis in the DSM 5, the time frame and definition of functional impairment is ambiguous. We present a conceptual review clarifying the difference between functional impairment as a stable trait representing strength or disability in various domains, and functional impairment as secondary to emotional or behavior problems, which is a state sensitive to change with treatment intervention. Functional impairment as a measure of treatment outcome includes both change from baseline and status at the endpoint of treatment. When using a validated measure of function, functional improvement can be defined as the percentage of patients who achieve the Minimal Important Clinical Difference (MCID) and functional remission as the percentage of patients who normalize at treatment endpoint. True treatment remission should be defined as both symptomatic and functional remission.</p>

	<p>Background and purpose: Cognitive and motor impairments are risk factors of major neurocognitive disorders (MNCD). Inability to name the date and use of a walking aid and/or history of falls are two items which are surrogate measures of cognitive and motor impairments. This study aims to examine the association of inability to name the date (i.e., cognitive impairment), use of a walking aid and/or history of falls (i.e., motor impairment) and their combination with incident MNCD in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: A total of 709 participants (mean age 79.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.7; 100% female) of the EPID&amp;amp;eacute;miologie de l&amp;amp;rsquo;OSt&amp;amp;eacute;oporose (EPIDOS) study recruited in Toulouse (France) were selected for this study. EPIDOS is an observational population-based cohort study with a 7-year follow-up period for Toulouse participants. Inability to name the date and use of a walking aid and/or history of falls were collected at baseline. Incident MNCD and their type (i.e., Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and non-AD) were diagnosed at the end of the 7-year follow-up. Results: Overall incidence of MNCD was 29.1%. Cox regressions revealed that inability to name the date and its combination with use of a walking aid and/or history of falls was associated with a significant increased incidence of MNCD (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.10 with p = 0.003 and HR = 1.81 with p = 0.011, respectively) and AD (HR =1.13 with p = 0.003 and HR = 2.80 with p = 0.016, respectively). Conclusions: Increased incident MNCD was reported when inability to name the date and use of a walking aid and/or history of falls were combined, suggesting that this combination of items may be used for risk screening of MNCD in the older population, especially for incident AD.</p>

	<p>The California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II) and the Virtual Environment Grocery Store (VEGS) use list learning and recognition tasks to assess episodic memory. This study aims to: (1) Replicate prior construct validity results among a new sample of young adults and healthy older adults; (2) Extend this work to a clinical sample of older adults with a neurocognitive diagnosis; (3) Compare CVLT-II and VEGS performance among these groups; and (4) Validate the independence of CVLT and VEGS episodic memory performance measures from executive functioning performance measures. Typically developing young adults (n = 53) and older adults (n = 85), as well as older adults with a neurocognitive diagnosis (n = 18), were administered the CVLT-II, VEGS, and D-KEFS CWIT. Results found that (1) the relationship of the VEGS and CVLT-II measures was highly correlated on all variables, (2) compared to the CVLT-II, participants (particularly older adults) recalled fewer items on the VEGS, and (3) the CVLT-II and VEGS were generally independent of D-KEFS CWIT. It appeared that the VEGS may be more difficult than the CVLT-II, possibly reflecting the word length effect. Performance may have also been impacted by the presence of everyday distractors in the virtual environment.</p>

	<p>The chronic form of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is understudied and seems to be linked exclusively to Siberian and Far Eastern TBE virus (TBEV) subtypes. There are limited clinical descriptions demonstrating that chronic TBE can resemble an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like disease. Here, we present a description of a clinical case of progressive chronic TBEV infection with a relapse 35 years after the initial acute infection following a tick bite. The disease manifested as an ALS-like syndrome with bulbar signs, progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, decreased reflexes, and eventual respiratory failure and death. There is no clear differentiation between chronic TBE and postencephalitic syndrome described in European sources. The reactivation of TBEV infection was supported by the presence of anti-TBEV antibodies in serum and antibodies to E protein and to the nonstructural protein NS1 in the CSF. These findings support the diagnosis of a relapse of chronic TBE in this patient.</p>

	<p>The interaction between oral and/or mental cognitive tasks and postural control and mobility remains unclear. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of speech production and cognitive load levels on static balance and timed up and go (TUG) during dual-task activities. Thirty healthy young subjects (25 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4 years old, 17 women) participated in this study. A control situation and two different cognitive arithmetic tasks were tested: counting backward in increments of 3 and 7 under oral (O) and mental (M) conditions during static balance and the TUG. We evaluated the dual-task cost (DTC) and the effect of speech production (SP) and the level of cognitive load (CL) on these variables. There was a significant increase in the centre of pressure oscillation velocity in static balance when the dual task was performed orally compared to the control situation The DTC was more pronounced for the O than for the M. The SP, but not the CL, had a significant effect on oscillation velocity. There was an increase in TUG associated with the cognitive load, but the mental or oral aspect did not seem to have an influence. Mobility is more affected by SP when the cognitive task is complex. This may be particularly important for the choice of the test and understanding postural control disorders.</p>

	<p>The Windkessel model, which is known as a successful model for explaining the hemodynamic circulation, is a mathematical model with a direct correspondence with the electric circuit. We propose a theoretical model for the intracranial aneurysm based on the Windkessel-type steady blood flow. Intracranial aneurysms are well known vascular lesions, which cause subarachnoid hemorrhages. Since an aneurysm is an end-sack formed on the blood vessel, it functions as an unusual blood path that has characteristic features such as a reservoir and bottle neck orifice. We simulate an aneurysm by an electric circuit consisting of three different impedances, resistance, capacitance and inductance. A dumbbell-shaped aneurysm is the most dangerous aneurysm to easily rupture. Our aneurysmal model is created as a two-story aneurysm model for this point, thus namely the five-element Windkessel. Then, the mathematical formula was solved in numerical simulations by changing the size of the aneurysm and the elasticity of the aneurysm wall. An analysis of this model provided that the presence of the daughter aneurysm and the thinning of the aneurysm wall are positively correlated with a sharp increase in blood pressure in the aneurysm dome. Our mathematic aneurysm model proposes a good analogue to the real aneurysm and proved that this model includes soliton that is a non-decreasing wave propagation.</p>

	<p>The electroencephalograph (EEG) microstate is a method used to describe the characteristics of the EEG signal through the brain scalp electrode potential&amp;amp;rsquo;s spatial distribution; as such, it reflects the changes in the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional state. The EEGs of 13 elite archers from China&amp;amp;rsquo;s national archery team and 13 expert archers from China&amp;amp;rsquo;s provincial archery team were recorded under the alpha rhythm during the resting state (with closed eyes) and during archery aiming. By analyzing the differences between the EEG microstate parameters and the correlation between these parameters with archery performance, as well as by combining our findings through standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography source analysis (sLORETA), we explored the changes in the neural activity of professional archers of different levels, under different states. The results of the resting state study demonstrated that the duration, occurrence, and coverage in microstate D of elite archers were significantly higher than those of expert archers and that their other microstates had the greatest probability of transferring to microstate D. During the archery aiming state, the average transition probability of the other microstates transferring to microstate in the left temporal region was the highest observed in the two groups of archers. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between the duration and coverage of microstates in the frontal region of elite archers and their archery performance. Our findings indicate that elite archers are more active in the dorsal attention system and demonstrate a higher neural efficiency during the resting state. When aiming, professional archers experience an activation of brain regions associated with archery by suppressing brain regions unrelated to archery tasks. These findings provide a novel theoretical basis for the study of EEG microstate dynamics in archery and related cognitive motor tasks, particularly from the perspective of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s mental state.</p>

<p>Neuronal connectomes play a critical role in information storage during learning and memory. We report that dopamine neurons are essential for adaptive olfactory learning in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Dopamine neurodegeneration results in significant learning impairment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Encoding and consolidating information through learning and memory is vital in adaptation and survival. Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter that modulates behavior. However, the role of DA in learning and memory processes is not well defined. Herein, we used the olfactory adaptive learning paradigm in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to elucidate the role of DA in the memory pathway. <i>Cat-2</i> mutant worms with low DA synthesis showed a significant reduction in chemotaxis index (CI) compared to the wild type (WT) after short-term conditioning. In dat-1::ICE worms, having degeneration of DA neurons, there was a significant reduction in adaptive learning and memory. When the worms were trained in the presence of exogenous DA (10 mM) instead of food, a substantial increase in CI value was observed. Furthermore, our results suggest that both dop-1 and dop-3 DA receptors are involved in memory retention. The release of DA during conditioning is essential to initiate the learning pathway. We also noted an enhanced cholinergic receptor activity in the absence of dopaminergic neurons. The strains expressing GCaMP6 in DA neurons (pdat-1::GCaMP-6::<i>mCherry)</i> showed a rise in intracellular calcium influx in the presence of the conditional stimulus after training, suggesting DA neurons are activated during memory recall. These results reveal the critical role of DA in adaptive learning and memory, indicating that DA neurons play a crucial role in the effective processing of cognitive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A characterization of the neural representation of confidence during probabilistic learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning in a stochastic and changing environment is a difficult task. Models of learning typically postulate that observations that deviate from the learned predictions are surprising and used to update those predictions. Bayesian accounts further posit the existence of a confidence-weighting mechanism: learning should be modulated by the confidence level that accompanies those predictions. However, the neural bases of this confidence are much less known than the ones of surprise. Here, we used a dynamic probability learning task and high-field MRI to identify putative cortical regions involved in the representation of confidence about predictions during human learning. We devised a stringent test based on the conjunction of four criteria. We localized several regions in parietal and frontal cortices whose activity is sensitive to the confidence of an ideal observer, specifically so with respect to potential confounds (surprise and predictability), and in a way that is invariant to which item is predicted. We also tested for functionality in two ways. First, we localized regions whose activity patterns at the subject level showed an effect of both confidence and surprise in qualitative agreement with the confidence-weighting principle. Second, we found neural representations of ideal confidence that also accounted for subjective confidence. Taken together, those results identify a set of cortical regions potentially implicated in the confidence-weighting of learning.

	<p>Hypothermia therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, some trials have shown that hypothermia therapy has a negative effect on patients with TBI. The treatment of hypothermia in children with TBI remains controversial. We conducted a search of six online databases to validate the literature on comparing hypothermia with normal therapy for children with TBI. Eight randomized controlled trials (514 patients) were included. The meta-analysis indicated that hypothermia therapy may increase the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores. However, in terms of improving the rate of complications, intracranial pressure (ICP), mortality, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and length of stay both in hospital as well as pediatric ICU, the difference was not statistically significant. Hypothermia therapy may have clinical advantages in improving the GOS scores in children with TBI compared with normothermic therapy, but hypothermia therapy may have no benefit in improving the incidence of complications, ICP, mortality, CPP, and length of stay both in pediatric ICU as well as hospital. The decision to implement hypothermia therapy for children with TBI depends on the advantages and disadvantages from many aspects and these must be considered comprehensively.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Cocaine use disorder is a chronic disease with severe consequences and a high relapse rate. There is a critical need to explore the factors influencing relapse in order to achieve more efficient treatment outcomes. Furthermore, there is a great need for easy-to-measure, repeatable, and valid biomarkers that can predict treatment response or relapse. Methods: We reviewed the available literature on the Pubmed database concerning the biomarkers associated with relapse in CUD, including central nervous system-derived, genetic, immune, oxidative stress, and &amp;amp;ldquo;other&amp;amp;rdquo; biomarkers. Results: Fifty-one articles were included in our analysis. Twenty-five imaging brain anatomic and function assessment studies, mostly using fMRI, examined the role of several structures such as the striatum activity in abstinence prediction. There were fewer studies assessing the use of neuropsychological factors, neurotrophins, or genetic/genomic factors, immune system, or oxidative stress measures to predict abstinence. Conclusion: Several biomarkers have been shown to have predictive value. Prospective studies using combined multimodal assessments are now warranted.</p>

	<p>Objective Glioblastoma (GBM), a type of malignant glioma, is the most aggressive type of brain tumor and is associated with high mortality. Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) has been detected in multiple tumors and is involved in tumor initiation and progression. However, the specific role and mechanism of H6PD in GBM remain unclear. Methods We performed pan-cancer analysis of expression and prognosis of H6PD in GBM using the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Subsequently, noncoding RNAs regulating H6PD expression were obtained by comprehensive analysis, including gene expression, prognosis, correlation, and immune infiltration. Finally, tumor immune infiltrates related to H6PD and survival were performed. Results Higher expression of H6PD was statistically significantly associated with an unfavorable outcome in GBM. Downregulation of hsa-miR-124-3p and hsa-miR-516b-5p in GBM was detected from GSE90603. Subsequently, OSMR-AS1 was observed in the regulation of H6PD via hsa-miR-516b-5p. Moreover, higher H6PD expression significantly correlated with immune infiltration of dendritic cells, immune checkpoint expression, and biomarkers of dendritic cells. Conclusions The OSMR-AS1/ miR-516b-5p axis was identified as the highest-potential upstream ncRNA-related pathway of H6PD in GBM. Furthermore, the present findings demonstrated that H6PD blockading might possess antitumor roles via regulating dendritic cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression.</p>

	<p>This study examined the reliability and validity of speech-language pathologists&amp;amp;rsquo; (SLP) estimations of speech intelligibility in dysarthria, including a visual analog scale (VAS) method and a percent estimation method commonly used in clinical settings. Speech samples from 20 speakers with dysarthria of varying etiologies were used to collect orthographic transcriptions from na&amp;amp;iuml;ve listeners n=70 and VAS ratings and percent estimations of intelligibility from SLPs n=21. Intra- and interrater reliability for the two SLP intelligibility measures were evaluated, and the relationship between these measures was assessed. Finally, linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between the na&amp;amp;iuml;ve listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; orthographic transcription scores and the two SLP intelligibility measures. The results indicated that the intrarater reliability for both SLP intelligibility measures was strong, and the interrater reliability between the SLP ratings was moderate to excellent. A moderate positive relationship between SLPs&amp;amp;rsquo; VAS ratings and percent estimations was also observed. Finally, both SLPs&amp;amp;rsquo; percent estimations and VAS ratings were predictive of na&amp;amp;iuml;ve listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; orthographic transcription scores, with SLPs&amp;amp;rsquo; percent estimations being the strongest predictor. In conclusion, the average SLP percent estimations and VAS ratings are valid and reliable intelligibility measures. However, the validity and reliability of these measures vary between SLPs.</p>

	<p>Human herpesviruses (HHVs) have been implicated as possible risk factors in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Persistent lifelong HHVs infections may directly or indirectly contribute to the generation of AD hallmarks: amyloid beta (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and synaptic loss. The present review focuses on summarizing current knowledge on the molecular mechanistic links between HHVs and AD that include processes involved in A&amp;amp;beta; accumulation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, autophagy, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. A PubMed search was performed to collect all the available research data regarding the above mentioned mechanistic links between HHVs and AD pathology. The vast majority of research articles referred to the different pathways exploited by Herpes Simplex Virus 1 that could lead to AD pathology, while a few studies highlighted the emerging role of HHV 6, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein&amp;amp;ndash;Barr Virus. The elucidation of such potential links may guide the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics to counter this devastating neurological disorder that until now remains incurable.</p>
