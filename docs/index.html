              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01656">Abstraction requires breadth: a renormalisation group approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.01656v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstraction is the process of extracting the essential features from raw data while ignoring irrelevant details. This is similar to the process of focusing on large-scale properties, systematically removing irrelevant small-scale details, implemented in the renormalisation group of statistical physics. This analogy is suggestive because the fixed points of the renormalisation group offer an ideal candidate of a truly abstract -- i.e. data independent -- representation. It has been observed that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks. Deep layers of neural network capture abstract characteristics of data, such as "cat-ness" or "dog-ness" in images, by combining the lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for an abstract representation. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in deep layers of neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data gets broader, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09349">Performance Modeling for Correlation-based Neural Decoding of Auditory Attention to Speech</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit neural tracking mechanisms to determine listener attention among competing speech sources via, e.g., electroencephalography signals. The correlation coefficients between the decoded neural responses and encoded speech stimuli of the different speakers then serve as AAD decision variables. A critical trade-off exists between the temporal resolution (the decision window length used to compute these correlations) and the AAD accuracy. This trade-off is typically characterized by evaluating AAD accuracy across multiple window lengths, leading to the performance curve. We propose a novel method to model this trade-off curve using labeled correlations from only a single decision window length. Our approach models the (un)attended correlations with a normal distribution after applying the Fisher transformation, enabling accurate AAD accuracy prediction across different window lengths. We validate the method on two distinct AAD implementations: a linear decoder and the non-linear VLAAI deep neural network, evaluated on separate datasets. Results show consistently low modeling errors of approximately 2 percent points, with 94% of true accuracies falling within estimated 95%-confidence intervals. The proposed method enables efficient performance curve modeling without extensive multi-window length evaluation, facilitating practical applications in, e.g., performance tracking in neuro-steered hearing devices to continuously adapt the system parameters over time.

                arXiv:2409.16414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how external stimuli propagate in neural systems is an important challenge in the fields of neuroscience and nonlinear dynamics. Despite extensive studies over several decades, this problem remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine a simple ``toy model'' of an excitable medium, a linear chain of diffusely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons, and analyze the transmission of a sinusoidal signal injected into one of the neurons at the ends of the chain. We measure to what extent the propagation of the wave reaching the opposite end is affected by the frequency and amplitude of the signal, the number of neurons in the chain and the strength of their mutual diffusive coupling. To quantify these effects, we measure the cross-correlation between the time-series of the membrane potentials of the end neurons. This measure allows us to detect the values of the parameters that delimit different propagation regimes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16136">Modeling Dynamic Neural Activity by combining Naturalistic Video Stimuli and Stimulus-independent Latent Factors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.16136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how visual processing of natural stimuli and internal brain states interact in populations of neurons remains an open question in neuroscience. Currently there are no dynamic encoding models that explicitly model a latent state and the entire neuronal response distribution. We address this gap by proposing a probabilistic model that predicts the joint distribution of the neuronal responses from video stimuli and stimulus-independent latent factors. After training and testing our model on mouse V1 neuronal responses, we find that it outperforms video-only models in terms of log-likelihood and achieves improvements in likelihood and correlation when conditioned on responses from other neurons. Furthermore, we find that the learned latent factors strongly correlate with mouse behavior and that they exhibits patterns related to the neurons position on visual cortex, although the model was trained without behavior and cortical coordinates. Our findings demonstrate that unsupervised learning of latent factors from population responses can reveal biologically meaningful structure that bridges sensory processing and behavior, without requiring explicit behavioral annotations during training. Code will be available upon publication.

                arXiv:2503.06374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the central aims of neuroscience is to reliably predict the behavioral response of an organism using its neural activity. If possible, this implies we can causally manipulate the neural response and design brain-computer-interface systems to alter behavior, and vice-versa. Hence, predictions play an important role in both fundamental neuroscience and its applications. Can we predict the neural and behavioral states of an organism at any given time? Can we predict behavioral states using neural states, and vice-versa, and is there a memory-component required to reliably predict such states? Are the predictions computable within a given timescale to meaningfully stimulate and make the system reach the desired states? Through a series of mathematical treatments, such conjectures and questions are discussed. Answering them might be key for future developments in understanding intelligence and designing brain-computer-interfaces.

                arXiv:2412.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image quality databases are used to train models for predicting subjective human perception. However, most existing databases focus on distortions commonly found in digital media and not in natural conditions. Affine transformations are particularly relevant to study, as they are among the most commonly encountered by human observers in everyday life. This Data Descriptor presents a set of human responses to suprathreshold affine image transforms (rotation, translation, scaling) and Gaussian noise as convenient reference to compare with previously existing image quality databases. The responses were measured using well established psychophysics: the Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling method. The set contains responses to 864 distorted images. The experiments involved 105 observers and more than 20000 comparisons of quadruples of images. The quality of the dataset is ensured because (a) it reproduces the classical Pi\'eron's law, (b) it reproduces classical absolute detection thresholds, and (c) it is consistent with conventional image quality databases but improves them according to Group-MAD experiments.

                arXiv:2503.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras provide superior temporal resolution, dynamic range, power efficiency, and pixel bandwidth. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally complement event data through discrete spike signals, making them ideal for event-based tracking. However, current approaches that combine Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and SNNs, along with suboptimal architectures, compromise energy efficiency and limit tracking performance. To address these limitations, we propose the first Transformer-based spike-driven tracking pipeline. Our Global Trajectory Prompt (GTP) method effectively captures global trajectory information and aggregates it with event streams into event images to enhance spatiotemporal representation. We then introduce SDTrack, a Transformer-based spike-driven tracker comprising a Spiking MetaFormer backbone and a simple tracking head that directly predicts normalized coordinates using spike signals. The framework is end-to-end, does not require data augmentation or post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the lowest parameter count and energy consumption across multiple event-based tracking benchmarks, establishing a solid baseline for future research in the field of neuromorphic vision.

                arXiv:2503.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature inspired algorithms are becoming popular due to their simplicity and wider applicability. In the recent past several such algorithms have been developed. They are mainly bio-inspired, swarm based, physics based and socio-inspired; however, the domain based on symbiotic relation between creatures is still to be explored. A novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm referred to as Fig Tree-Wasp Symbiotic Coevolutionary (FWSC) algorithm is proposed. It models the symbiotic coevolutionary relationship between fig trees and wasps. More specifically, the mating of wasps, pollinating the figs, searching for new trees for pollination and wind effect drifting of wasps are modeled in the algorithm. These phenomena help in balancing the two important aspects of exploring the search space efficiently as well as exploit the promising regions. The algorithm is successfully tested on a variety of test problems. The results are compared with existing methods and algorithms. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and Friedman Test are applied for the statistical validation of the algorithm performance. The algorithm is also further applied to solve the real-world engineering problems. The performance of the FWSC underscored that the algorithm can be applied to wider variety of real-world problems.

Abstract: A long-standing engineering problem, the control of soft robots is difficult because of their highly non-linear, heterogeneous, anisotropic, and distributed nature. Here, bridging engineering and biology, a neural reservoir is employed for the dynamic control of a bio-hybrid model arm made of multiple muscle-tendon groups enveloping an elastic spine. We show how the use of reservoirs facilitates simultaneous control and self-modeling across a set of challenging tasks, outperforming classic neural network approaches. Further, by implementing a spiking reservoir on neuromorphic hardware, energy efficiency is achieved, with nearly two-orders of magnitude improvement relative to standard CPUs, with implications for the on-board control of untethered, small-scale soft robots.

                arXiv:2407.12261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic diffusion processes are pervasive in nature, from the seemingly erratic Brownian motion to the complex interactions of synaptically-coupled spiking neurons. Recently, drawing inspiration from Langevin dynamics, neuromorphic diffusion models were proposed and have become one of the major breakthroughs in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Unlike discriminative models that have been well developed to tackle classification or regression tasks, diffusion models as well as other generative models such as ChatGPT aim at creating content based upon contexts learned. However, the more complex algorithms of these models result in high computational costs using today's technologies, creating a bottleneck in their efficiency, and impeding further development. Here, we develop a spintronic voltage-controlled magnetoelectric memory hardware for the neuromorphic diffusion process. The in-memory computing capability of our spintronic devices goes beyond current Von Neumann architecture, where memory and computing units are separated. Together with the non-volatility of magnetic memory, we can achieve high-speed and low-cost computing, which is desirable for the increasing scale of generative models in the current era. We experimentally demonstrate that the hardware-based true random diffusion process can be implemented for image generation and achieve comparable image quality to software-based training as measured by the Frechet inception distance (FID) score, achieving ~10^3 better energy-per-bit-per-area over traditional hardware.

                arXiv:2409.14245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with discrete topology optimization and describes the modification of a single-objective algorithm into its multi-objective counterpart. The result is a significant increase in the optimization speed and quality of the resulting Pareto front as compared to conventional state-of-the-art automated inverse design techniques. This advancement is possible thanks to a memetic algorithm combining a gradient-based search for local minima with heuristic optimization to maintain sufficient diversity. The local algorithm is based on rank-1 perturbations; the global algorithm is NSGA-II. An important advancement is the adaptive weighting of objective functions during optimization. The procedure is tested on four challenging examples dealing with both physical and topological metrics and multi-objective settings. The results are compared with standard techniques, and the superb performance of the proposed technique is reported. The implemented algorithm applies to antenna inverse design problems and is an efficient data miner for machine learning tools.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach aimed at overcoming existing challenges in the realm of local search algorithms. Our aim is to improve the decision process that takes place within a local search algorithm so as to make the best possible transitions in the neighborhood at each iteration. To improve this process, we propose to use a neural network that has the same input information as conventional local search algorithms. In this paper, which is an extension of the work presented at EvoCOP2024, we investigate different ways of representing this information so as to make the algorithm as efficient as possible but also robust to monotonic transformations of the problem objective function. To assess the efficiency of this approach, we develop an experimental setup centered around NK landscape problems, offering the flexibility to adjust problem size and ruggedness. This approach offers a promising avenue for the emergence of new local search algorithms and the improvement of their problem-solving capabilities for black-box problems. The last version of this article is published in the journal SN Computer Science (Springer).

                arXiv:2405.04620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.

                arXiv:2503.08301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many-task optimization scenarios, surrogate models are valuable for mitigating the computational burden of repeated fitness evaluations across tasks. This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We must reconcile the needs of the internal world and the demands of the external world to make decisions relevant to homeostasis, well-being, and flexible behavior. Engagement with the internal (eg interoceptive) world is linked to medial brain systems, whereas the extrapersonal space (eg exteroceptive) is associated with lateral brain systems. Using Human Connectome Project data, we found three association tracts connecting the action-related frontal lobe with perception-related posterior lobes. A lateral dorsal tract and a medial dorsal tract interact independently with a ventral tract at frontal and posterior hubs. The two frontal and the two posterior hubs are interconnected, forming a meta-loop that integrates lateral and medial brain systems. The four anatomical hubs correspond to the common nodes of the intrinsic cognitive brain networks such as the default mode network. These functional networks depend on the integration of both realms. Thus, the positioning of functional cognitive networks can be understood as the intersection of long anatomical association tracts. The strength of structural connectivity within lateral and medial brain systems correlates with performance on behavioral tests assessing theory of mind. The meta-loop provides an anatomical framework to associate neurological and psychiatric symptoms with functional and structural changes.</span>

                Background Pregnancy loss, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and early losses, affects millions globally. Approximately 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affecting 1-2% of couples. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological, psychological, and assisted reproductive technology (ART) interventions in improving clinical and psychological outcomes for women experiencing pregnancy loss. Objective To assess the impact of pharmacological, psychological, and ART interventions on clinical and psychological outcomes in women experiencing pregnancy loss and identify gaps in healthcare delivery. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, 18 studies published between 2020 and 2024 were analyzed using data from PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Studies were included if they assessed interventions for pregnancy loss, focusing on pharmacological therapies, psychological approaches, and ART. Statistical heterogeneity (I2 statistic) and publication bias (Egger’s regression test) were evaluated. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses explored variations across geographic, demographic, and methodological factors. Results Pharmacological therapies, including mifepristone and misoprostol, significantly improved tissue expulsion (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.8–4.3) and patient satisfaction. Low-dose aspirin increased live birth rates by 22% (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10–1.35). Psychological interventions such as mindfulness and art therapy reduced stress (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.30) and enhanced quality of life. ART interventions, especially immediate frozen embryo transfer (FET), improved clinical pregnancy rates (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07–1.23). Subgroup analyses identified lower intervention efficacy in low-resource settings, while home-based misoprostol showed safety but limited efficacy in reducing postpartum hemorrhage. Conclusion Integrated care approaches addressing both physical and psychological needs are effective for managing pregnancy loss. Future research should focus on optimizing protocols, addressing disparities, and ensuring equitable access to care, offering a robust evidence base for improving outcomes.

                This review examines the role of agroforestry systems in Ethiopia, focusing on their contributions to soil health improvement and carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. The study utilized a meta-analysis approach, gathering data from prominent databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and AGRICOLA. Keywords related to agroforestry and climate change mitigation were used to screen relevant studies. A total of 54 studies were included after systematic screening and full-text review based on eligibility criteria. The analysis employed both descriptive and quantitative synthesis to evaluate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving soil fertility, carbon sequestration, and resilience to climate change. The results showed that agroforestry systems, including parkland and coffee-based systems enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) and increase soil fertility. Coffee-based agroforestry systems, for instance, sequester up to 7.2 tons of CO₂ per hectare annually, while home-gardens in southern Ethiopia store up to 150 tons of carbon per hectare. The integration of drought-resistant species further improves soil moisture retention and boosts productivity in arid areas. In addition to environmental benefits, agroforestry systems also support food security and economic resilience by diversifying income sources and stabilizing yields in the face of climate variability. The findings underscore the significant potential of agroforestry systems in enhancing soil health, sequestering carbon, and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation in Ethiopia.

                <p>Motivated behaviors, such as social interactions, are governed by the interplay between mesocorticolimbic structures, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Adverse childhood experiences and early life stress (ELS) can impact these networks and behaviors, which is associated with increased risk for psychiatric illnesses. While it is known that the VTA projects to both the BLA and mPFC, the influence of these inputs on local network activity which govern behavioral states&mdash;and whether ELS impacts VTA-mediated network communication&mdash;remains unknown. Our study demonstrates that VTA inputs influence BLA oscillations and entrainment of mPFC activity in mice and that ELS weakens the ability of the VTA to coordinate BLA network states, while also impairing dopaminergic signaling between VTA and BLA. Optogenetic stimulation of VTA<SUB>BLA</SUB> terminals decreased social interaction in ELS mice, which can be recapitulated in control mice by inhibiting VTA-&gt;BLA communication. These data suggest that ELS impacts social reward via the VTA-&gt;BLA dopamine network.</p>

First, ambiguous motion information from otolith organs must be combined with spatially transformed rotational signals (e.g., from the canals) to distinguish head translation from tilt. Second, tilt and translation estimates must be transformed from a head- to a body-centered reference frame to correctly interpret the body's motion. Studies have shown that cells in the caudal cerebellar vermis (nodulus and ventral uvula, NU) reflect the output of the first set of computations to estimate translation and tilt. However, it remains unknown whether these estimates are encoded exclusively in head-centered coordinates or whether they reflect further transformation toward body-centered coordinates. Here, we addressed this question by examining how the 3D spatial tuning of otolith and canal signals on translation- and tilt-selective NU Purkinje cells in male rhesus monkeys varies with changes in head-re-body and body-re-gravity orientation. We show that NU cell tuning properties are consistent with head-centered otolith signal coding during translation. Furthermore, while canal signals in the NU have been transformed into a specific world-referenced rotation signal indicating reorientation relative to gravity (tilt), as needed to resolve the tilt/translation ambiguity, the resulting tilt estimates are encoded in head-centered coordinates. Our results thus suggest that body-centered motion and orientation estimates required for postural control, navigation, and reaching are computed elsewhere, either by further transforming NU outputs or via computations in other parallel pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/11/e0238242024?rss=1">Does Amplitude Compression Help or Hinder Attentional Neural Speech Tracking?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amplitude compression is an indispensable feature of contemporary audio production and especially relevant in modern hearing aids. The cortical fate of amplitude-compressed speech signals is not well studied, however, and may yield undesired side effects: We hypothesize that compressing the amplitude envelope of continuous speech reduces neural tracking. Yet, leveraging such a "compression side effect" on unwanted, distracting sounds could potentially support attentive listening if effectively reducing their neural tracking. In this study, we examined 24 young normal hearing (NH) individuals, 19 older hearing-impaired (HI) individuals, and 12 older normal hearing individuals. Participants were instructed to focus on one of two competing talkers while ignoring the other. Envelope compression (1:8 ratio, loudness-matched) was applied to one or both streams containing short speech repeats. Electroencephalography allowed us to quantify the cortical response function and degree of speech tracking. With compression applied to the attended target stream, HI participants showed reduced behavioral accuracy, and compressed speech yielded generally lowered metrics of neural tracking. Importantly, we found that compressing the ignored stream resulted in a stronger neural representation of the uncompressed target speech. Our results imply that intelligent compression algorithms, with variable compression ratios applied to separated sources, could help individuals with hearing loss suppress distraction in complex multitalker environments.</p>

                <p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) effectively treats motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), with the globus pallidus interna (GPi) commonly targeted. However, its therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. We employed optogenetic stimulation in the entopeduncular nucleus (EP), the rat homolog of GPi, in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned female Sprague Dawley rat model of PD. We quantified behavioral effects of optogenetic EP DBS on motor symptoms and conducted single-unit recordings in EP and ventral lateral motor thalamus (VL) to examine changes in neural activity. High-frequency optogenetic EP DBS (75, 100, 130&nbsp;Hz) reduced ipsilateral turning and corrected forelimb stepping, while low-frequency stimulation (5 and 20&nbsp;Hz) had no effect. EP and VL neurons exhibited mixed response during stimulation, with both increased and decreased firing. The average firing rate of all recorded neurons in the EP and VL significantly increased at 130&nbsp;Hz but not at other frequencies. Beta-band oscillatory activity was reduced in most EP neurons across high frequencies (75, 100, 130&nbsp;Hz), while reductions in beta-band oscillations in VL occurred only at 130&nbsp;Hz. These findings suggest that the neural firing rates within EP and VL circuits were differentially modulated by EP DBS; they may not fully explain the frequency-dependent behavioral effect. Instead, high-frequency optogenetic EP DBS at 130&nbsp;Hz may ameliorate parkinsonian motor symptoms by reducing abnormal oscillatory activity in the EP&ndash;VL circuits. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of circuit-specific modulation in the pallidothalamic pathway using optogenetic EP DBS to alleviate motor deficits in a PD rat model.</p>

                <p>Birdsong is hierarchically organized in time, like speech and other communication behaviors. Syllables are produced in sequences to form song motifs and bouts. While syllables are copied from tutors, the factors that determine song temporal organization, including syllable sequencing (syntax), are unknown. Here, we tested the roles of learning and species genetics in song organization. We manipulated juvenile song experience and genetics in three species of estrildid finches (zebra finches, <I>Taeniopygia guttata castanotis</I>; long-tailed finches, <I>Poephila acuticauda</I>; Bengalese finches, <I>Lonchura striata</I> var. <I>domestica</I>). We analyzed the adult songs of male birds that were: (1) tutored by conspecifics; (2) untutored; (3) tutored by heterospecifics; and (4) genetic hybrids. Song macrostructure, syllable sequencing, and syllable timing were quantified and compared within and across species. Results showed that song organization was consistent within a species and differed across species, regardless of experience. Temporal features did not differ between tutored and untutored birds of the same species. The songs of birds tutored by other species were composed of heterospecific syllables produced in sequences typical of conspecific songs. The songs of genetic hybrids showed the organization of both parental species, despite the fact that only males sing. Results indicate that song organization is predicted by species rather than experience.</p>

                <p>When we listen to speech, our brain&rsquo;s neurophysiological responses "track" its acoustic features, but it is less well understood how these auditory responses are enhanced by linguistic content. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography responses while subjects of both sexes listened to four types of continuous speechlike passages: speech envelope&ndash;modulated noise, English-like nonwords, scrambled words, and a narrative passage. Temporal response function (TRF) analysis provides strong neural evidence for the emergent features of speech processing in the cortex, from acoustics to higher-level linguistics, as incremental steps in neural speech processing. Critically, we show a stepwise hierarchical progression of progressively higher-order features over time, reflected in both bottom-up (early) and top-down (late) processing stages. Linguistically driven top-down mechanisms take the form of late N400-like responses, suggesting a central role of predictive coding mechanisms at multiple levels. As expected, the neural processing of lower-level acoustic feature responses is bilateral or right lateralized, with left lateralization emerging only for lexicosemantic features. Finally, our results identify potential neural markers, linguistic-level late responses, derived from TRF components modulated by linguistic content, suggesting that these markers are indicative of speech comprehension rather than mere speech perception.</p>

                <p>The conventional understanding of the cerebellum as a sole movement control center has become obsolete, given its role in various higher-order functions, including cognition, emotion, and social processing. As these functions emerge during infancy, it is logical to assume that the cerebellum's functional organization evolve in tandem or preemptively to underpin these functions. However, the longitudinal development of the cerebellum's functional architecture during the crucial early years of infant life remains largely unexplored, highlighting a significant research gap. In this study, leveraging a large cohort of both male and female full-term (FT; <I>n</I> = 155) and preterm (PT; <I>n</I> = 67) infants, we aimed to delineate the development of within-cerebellum and cerebello-cortical functional connections during the first 2&nbsp;years of life. Our findings highlight comprehensive functional synchronization within the neonatal cerebellum with a striking cortical projection focus on primary sensorimotor and visual cortices. While the within-cerebellum synchronization demonstrated early emergence in neonates and developmental stability during the initial 2&nbsp;years, the cerebello-cortical projection patterns evolved dramatically, marked by specialization, shifting, and higher-order cortex integration, providing exciting evidence of the cerebellum's potential involvement in higher-order functions from infancy. Furthermore, PT infants exhibited decreased cerebello-cortical connectivity compared with their FT counterparts, suggesting potential developmental alterations. These findings collectively illustrate a dynamic growth pattern of cerebellar functional organization marked by both within-cerebellum stability and cerebello-cortical projection plasticity with significant implications for long-term cognitive and socioemotional development.</p>

                <p>The influence of neural activity on astrocytes and their reciprocal interactions with neurons has emerged as an important modulator of synapse function. Astrocytes exhibit activity-dependent changes in gene expression, yet the molecular mechanisms by which neural activity is coupled to gene expression are not well understood. The molecular signaling pathway, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), mediates neuron&ndash;astrocyte communication and regulates the organization of cortical synapses. Here, we demonstrate that neural activity stimulates Shh signaling in cortical astrocytes and upregulates expression of Hevin and SPARC, astrocyte-derived molecules that modify synapses. Whisker stimulation in both male and female mice promotes activity-dependent Shh signaling selectively in the somatosensory, but not in the visual cortex, whereas sensory deprivation reduces Shh activity, demonstrating bidirectional regulation of the pathway by sensory experience. Selective loss of Shh signaling in astrocytes reduces expression of Hevin and SPARC and occludes activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Taken together, these data identify Shh signaling as an activity-dependent, molecular signaling pathway that regulates astrocyte gene expression and promotes astrocyte modulation of synaptic plasticity.</p>

                <p>Microglia respond to cytotoxic protein aggregates associated with the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Pathological protein aggregates activate the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in proinflammatory signaling, secretion, and potentially pyroptotic cell death. We characterized mixed sex primary mouse microglia exposed to microbial stressors and alpha synuclein preformed fibrils (&alpha;syn PFFs) to identify cellular mechanisms related to Parkinson's disease. Microglia package and release the endosome fate regulator Coronin1A (Coro1A) in EVs in an <I>Nlrp3</I>-dependent manner in widely used experimental activation conditions. We were surprised to find that Coro1A packaging and release was not <I>Nlrp3</I>-dependent in &alpha;syn PFF exposure conditions. <I>Coro1A<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> microglia exposed to &alpha;syn PFFs trafficked more &alpha;syn to the lysosomal compartment increasing lysosomal membrane permeabilization. This corresponds to a decrease in &alpha;syn released in EVs suggesting that Coro1A functions to shunt pathological proteins to a secretory pathway to attenuate lysosomal stress. &alpha;syn PFF-driven lysosomal stress resulting from <I>Coro1a</I> loss was associated with enhanced cytotoxicity. Intrinsic apoptosis signaling was unaffected, but we observed elevated cytosolic cathepsin B and the presence of a cathepsin-associated 55&nbsp;kD PARP cleavage product. Postmortem analysis of the PD mesencephalon supported a role for Coro1A in microglia, revealing elevated levels of Coro1A protein in human PD brains compared with those of healthy donors. Findings are relevant to the distribution of pathological &alpha;syn and indicate that <I>Coro1a</I> protects microglia from lysosomal overload, inflammasome activation, and pyroptotic demise.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/11/e1385242025?rss=1">Local Differences in Network Organization in the Auditory and Parietal Cortex, Revealed with Single Neuron Activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The structure of local circuits is highly conserved across the cortex, yet the spatial and temporal properties of population activity differ fundamentally in sensory-level and association-level areas. In the sensory cortex, population activity has a shorter timescale and decays sharply over distance, supporting a population code for the fine-scale features of sensory stimuli. In the association cortex, population activity has a longer timescale and spreads over wider distances, a code that is suited to holding information in memory and driving behavior. We tested whether these differences in activity dynamics could be explained by differences in network structure. We targeted photostimulations to single excitatory neurons of layer 2/3, while monitoring surrounding population activity using two-photon calcium imaging. Experiments were performed in the auditory (AC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) within the same mice of both sexes, which also expressed a red fluorophore in somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM). In both cortical regions, photostimulations resulted in a spatially restricted zone of positive influence on neurons closely neighboring the targeted neuron and a more spatially diffuse zone of negative influence affecting more distant neurons (akin to a network-level "suppressive surround"). However, the relative spatial extents of positive and negative influence were different in AC and PPC. In PPC, the central zone of positive influence was wider, but the negative suppressive surround was more narrow than in AC, which could account for the larger-scale network dynamics in PPC. The more narrow central positive influence zone and wider suppressive surround in AC could serve to sharpen sensory representations.</p>

                <p>For a proper representation of the causal structure of the world, it is adaptive to consider both evidence for and evidence against causality. To take punishment as an example, the causality of a stimulus is unlikely if there is a temporal gap before punishment is received, but causality is credible if the stimulus immediately precedes punishment. In contrast, causality can be ruled out if the punishment occurred first. At the behavioral level, this is reflected in the associative principle of timing-dependent valence reversal: aversive memories are formed when a stimulus occurs before the punishment, whereas memories of appetitive valence are formed when a stimulus is presented upon the relieving termination of punishment. We map the temporal profile of memories induced by optogenetic activation of the PPL1-01 neuron in the fly <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> (of either sex) and find that compromising tyrosine hydroxylase function, either acutely by pharmacological methods or by cell-specific RNAi, extends and blunts this profile. Specifically, it (1) enhances learning with a time gap between the stimulus and PPL1-01 punishment (better trace conditioning), (2) impairs learning when the stimulus immediately precedes PPL1-01 punishment (worse delay conditioning), and (3) prevents learning about a stimulus presented after PPL1-01 punishment has ceased (worse relief conditioning). Under conditions of low dopamine, we furthermore observe a role for serotonin that is pronounced in trace conditioning, weaker in delay conditioning, and absent in relief conditioning. We discuss the psychiatric implications if related alterations in the temporal profile of reinforcement were to occur in humans.</p>

                <p>How the prefrontal cortex contributes to working memory remains controversial, as theories differ in their emphasis on its role in storing memories versus controlling their content. To adjudicate between these competing ideas, we tested how perturbations to the human (both sexes) lateral prefrontal cortex impact the storage and control aspects of working memory during a task that requires human subjects to allocate resources to memory items based on their behavioral priority. Our computational model made a strong prediction that disruption of this control process would counterintuitively improve memory for low-priority items. Remarkably, transcranial magnetic stimulation of retinotopically-defined superior precentral sulcus, but not intraparietal sulcus, unbalanced the prioritization of resources, improving memory for low-priority items as predicted by the model. Therefore, these results provide direct causal support for models in which the prefrontal cortex controls the allocation of resources that support working memory, rather than simply storing the features of memoranda.</p>

                <p>Early age at menarche (early AAM) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are reproductive and metabolic disorders with overlapping pathophysiological and genetic features. Epidemiological studies suggest a link between these two conditions, both of which are characterized by dysregulation of the neuroendocrine pathways that control pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, thus affecting gonadotropin release, particularly luteinizing hormone secretion. A common pathophysiology involving positive energy balance and abnormal metabolic status is evident in both disorders. Genetic and epigenetic factors influence the onset of puberty and reproductive outcomes. Genome-wide association studies have identified common genetic variants associated with AAM and PCOS, particularly in genes related to the neuroendocrine axis (e.g., <I>FSHB</I>) and obesity (e.g., <I>FTO</I>). In addition, high-throughput sequencing has revealed rare loss-of-function variants in the <I>DLK1</I> gene in women with central precocious puberty (CPP), early menarche, and PCOS, who experienced adverse metabolic outcomes in adulthood. This review explores the shared pathophysiological mechanisms between CPP/early AAM and PCOS, examines potential genetic and epigenetic factors that may link these neuroendocrine reproductive conditions, and offers insights into future research and treatment strategies. Understanding these connections may provide new targets for therapeutic interventions and improve outcomes for individuals with these reproductive disorders.</p>

                <p>Dopamine critically regulates neuronal excitability and promotes synaptic plasticity in the striatum, thereby shaping network connectivity and influencing behavior. These functions establish dopamine as a key neuromodulator, whose release properties have been well studied in rodents but remain understudied in nonhuman primates. This study aims to close this gap by investigating the properties of dopamine release in macaque striatum and comparing/contrasting them to better-characterized mouse striatum, using ex vivo brain slices from male and female animals. Using combined electrochemical techniques and photometry with fluorescent dopamine sensors, we found that evoked dopamine signals have smaller amplitudes in macaques compared with those in mice. Interestingly, cholinergic-dependent dopamine release, which accounts for two-thirds of evoked dopamine release in mouse slices, is significantly reduced in macaques, providing a potential mechanistic underpinning for the observed species difference. In macaques, only nicotinic receptors with alpha-6 subunits contribute to evoked dopamine release, whereas in mice, both alpha-6 and non-alpha6-containing receptors are involved. We also identified robust potentiation of dopamine release in both species when GABA<SUB>A</SUB> and GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors were blocked. This potentiation was stronger in macaques, with an average increase of 50%, compared with 15% in mice. Together, these results suggest that dopamine release in macaque is under stronger GABA-mediated inhibition and that weaker cholinergic-mediated dopamine release may account for the smaller amplitude of evoked dopamine signals in macaque slices.</p>

                <p>Odor perception plays a critical role in early human development, but the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood. To investigate these, we presented appetitive and aversive odors to infants of both sexes at 1&nbsp;month of age while recording functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and nasal airflow data. Infants slept during odor presentation to allow MRI scanning. We found that odors evoke robust fMRI activity in the bilateral olfactory cortex and thalamus and that fMRI response magnitudes in the olfactory cortex differ across odors. However, in contrast to prior work in adults, we did not find compelling evidence that odor stimuli evoke discriminable fMRI activity patterns in the olfactory cortex or thalamus using two different multivariate pattern analysis techniques. Finally, the average inhale airflow rate was higher for appetitive odors than aversive odors, which tentatively suggests that infants could modulate their respiration to reflect odor valence. Overall, these results show strong neural responses to odors at this early developmental stage and highlight nasal airflow as a behavioral metric for assessing odor preference in infants.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease is characterized by the presence of alpha-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) primarily containing Lewy bodies in neurons. Despite decades of extensive research on &alpha;-syn accumulation, its molecular mechanisms have remained largely unexplored. Recent studies by us and others have suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosomes, can mediate the release of &alpha;-syn from cells and inhibiting this pathway could result in increased intracellular &alpha;-syn levels. In this study, we have discovered that elevated levels of &alpha;-syn themselves lead to reduced &alpha;-syn -containing EVs in &alpha;-syn&ndash;inducible H4 cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons from both sexes. Our investigations have revealed that the impairment in EV secretion is not due to their generation but rather a consequence of changes in a soluble <I>N</I>-ethylmaleimide&ndash;sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein, YKT6. Specifically, as &alpha;-syn levels increase, membrane-associated YKT6 is reduced. Pharmacological inhibition of farnesylation using FTI has led to decreased EV secretion and subsequent elevated levels of &alpha;-syn. In summary, our findings suggest that increased levels of &alpha;-syn impair YKT6-mediated EV secretion, establishing a detrimental cycle of intracellular &alpha;-syn accumulation in human DA neurons.</p>

                <p>Recent findings have shifted the view of cholecystokinin (CCK) from being a cellular neuronal marker to being recognized as a crucial neuropeptide pivotal in synaptic plasticity and memory processes. Despite its now appreciated importance in various brain regions and abundance in the basal ganglia, its role in the striatum, which is vital for motor control, remains unclear. This study sought to fill this gap by performing a comprehensive investigation of the role of CCK in modulating striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) membrane properties, as well as the secondary somatosensory cortex S2 to MSN synaptic transmission and plasticity in rodents. Using in vivo optopatch-clamp recording in mice on identified MSNs, we showed that the application of CCK receptor Type 2 (CCK2R) antagonists decreases corticostriatal transmission in both direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moving to an ex vivo rat preparation to maximize experimental access, we showed that CCK2R inhibition impacts MSN membrane properties by reducing spike threshold and rheobase, suggesting an excitability increase. Moreover, CCK modulates corticostriatal transmission mainly via CCK2R, and CCK2R blockage shifted spike-timing&ndash;dependent plasticity from long-term potentiation to long-term depression. Our study advances the understanding of CCK's importance in modulating corticostriatal transmission. By showing how CCK2R blockade influences synaptic function and plasticity, we provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying striatal functions, opening new paths for exploring its potential relevance to neurological disorders involving basal ganglia-related behaviors.</p>

                <p>Electrophysiology recordings from the brain using laminar multielectrode arrays allow researchers to measure the activity of many neurons simultaneously. However, laminar microelectrode arrays move relative to their surrounding neural tissue for a variety of reasons, such as pulsation, changes in intracranial pressure, and decompression of neural tissue after insertion. Inferring and correcting for this motion stabilizes the recording and is critical to identify and track single neurons across time. Such motion correction is a preprocessing step of standard spike-sorting methods. However, estimating motion robustly and accurately in electrophysiology recordings is challenging due to the stochasticity of the neural data. To tackle this problem, we introduce <b>MEDiCINe</b> (<b>M</b>otion <b>E</b>stimation by <b>Di</b>stributional <b>C</b>ontrastive <b>I</b>nference for <b>Ne</b>urophysiology), a novel motion estimation method. We show that MEDiCINe outperforms existing motion estimation methods on an extensive suite of simulated neurophysiology recordings and leads to more accurate spike sorting. We also show that MEDiCINe accurately estimates the motion in primate and rodent electrophysiology recordings with a variety of motion and stability statistics. We open-source MEDiCINe, usage instructions, examples integrating MEDiCINe with common tools for spike sorting, and data and code for reproducing our results. This open software will enable other researchers to use MEDiCINe to improve spike sorting results and get the most out of their electrophysiology datasets.</p>

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring.

Advancements with cost-effective, high-throughput omics technologies have had a transformative effect on both fundamental and translational research in the medical sciences. These advancements have facilitated a departure from the traditional view of human red blood cells (RBCs) as mere carriers of hemoglobin, devoid of significant biological complexity. Over the past decade, proteomic analyses have identified a growing number of different proteins present within RBCs, enabling systems biology analysis of their physiological functions. Here, we introduce RBC-GEM, one of the most comprehensive, curated genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of a specific human cell type to-date. It was developed through meta-analysis of proteomic data from 29 studies published over the past two decades resulting in an RBC proteome composed of more than 4,600 distinct proteins. Through workflow-guided manual curation, we have compiled the metabolic reactions carried out by this proteome to form a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of the RBC. RBC-GEM is hosted on a version-controlled GitHub repository, ensuring adherence to the standardized protocols for metabolic reconstruction quality control and data stewardship principles. RBC-GEM represents a metabolic network is a consisting of 820 genes encoding proteins acting on 1,685 unique metabolites through 2,723 biochemical reactions: a 740% size expansion over its predecessor. We demonstrated the utility of RBC-GEM by creating context-specific proteome-constrained models derived from proteomic data of stored RBCs for 616 blood donors, and classified reactions based on their simulated abundance dependence. This reconstruction as an up-to-date curated GEM can be used for contextualization of data and for the construction of a computational whole-cell models of the human RBC.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70008?af=R">Phase Precession Relative to Turning Angle in Theta‐Modulated Head Direction Cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Grid and place cells typically fire at progressively earlier phases within each cycle of the theta rhythm as rodents run across their firing fields, a phenomenon known as theta phase precession. Here, we report theta phase precession relative to turning angle in theta-modulated head direction cells within the anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AVN). As rodents turn their heads, these cells fire at progressively earlier phases as head direction sweeps over their preferred tuning direction. The degree of phase precession increases with angular head velocity. Moreover, phase precession is more pronounced in those theta-modulated head direction cells that exhibit theta skipping, with a stronger theta-skipping effect correlating with a higher degree of phase precession. These findings are consistent with a ring attractor model that integrates external theta input with internal firing rate adaptation—a phenomenon we identified in head direction cells within AVN. Our results broaden the range of information known to be subject to neural phase coding and enrich our understanding of the neural dynamics supporting spatial orientation and navigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70006?af=R">Effects of Blocking Multiple Sources of Calcium in Hippocampus During Spatial Learning and Memory Using a Rapid Acquisition Variant of the Morris Water Task</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) is proposed to be the molecular mechanism underlying learning and memory in the brain. A key event for LTP is the influx of calcium into post-synaptic neurons via multiple ion channel control systems. One such system involves <i>N</i>-methyl-<i>D</i>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which were originally believed to be essential for LTP and new learning. Recent studies have demonstrated that hippocampal NMDARs are critical for learning new spatial information in a novel environment; however, when pre-training occurs prior to new spatial learning, these receptors are not needed. Additionally, researchers have shown that activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and their associated calcium influx can induce LTP independent of NMDARs. These findings led to the idea that the amount of calcium required for learning in hippocampus depends on whether the new learning takes place in a novel or familiar environment, with a novel environment demanding greater calcium influx. It was hypothesized that to impair new learning in a familiar environment both NMDARs and VGCCs would need to be blocked. Long-Evans rats were trained in a three-phase version of the Morris water task, which included pre-training, new learning mass-training, and a probe test. Prior to mass-training, intrahippocampal VGCCs were blocked individually or in combination with NMDARs blockade to evaluate their effects on the rats learning and memory. The results showed that blocking both NMDARs and VGCCs simultaneously impaired new spatial learning with familiar information, whereas VGCC blockade alone did not.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-284/v1?src=rss">Assessing toxicological risk of nanoplastics contaminants in food and feed from ingestion pathway to human diseases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The extensive use of plastic without an effective management system is linked to significant environmental pollution issues. The fragmentation of various types of plastic waste leads to the formation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). NPs, measuring less than 0.1 μm pose a latent danger to the human food chain caused by the ability to traverse biological membranes than MPs, potentially leading to various chronic diseases. The widespread distribution of NPs across diverse environmental matrices and their subsequent infiltration into food and feed chains precipitates various emerging health concerns. NPs contaminate food production systems and leach from plastic packaging, infiltrating organisms at various trophic levels. Seafood, processed foods, and drinking water serve as vectors for absorption and accumulation in human tissues. The pervasive contamination pathway poses substantial risks to human health through multiple exposure routes, primarily ingestion. It can lead to cytotoxicity, inflammation, genotoxicity, and apoptosis. This review summarizes the implications of NPs exposure that triggers various diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), kidney dysfunction, liver disease, heart problems, brain disorders, reproductive issues, and cancer. Currently, no established method exists to treat NPs that humans may have already ingested. Hence, it is urgent to mitigate the harmful effects of NPs through the development and implementation of innovative, efficient, and sustainable environmental decontamination strategies. This discussion highlights several advanced remediation techniques that can effectively reduce the toxicity of NPs in environmental systems, thus mitigating their associated risks.

                Jiang et al. discover that macrophage-specific deletion of phosphatase PHLPP1 aggravates pulmonary fibrosis and tissue injury. Nuclear PHLPP1 dephosphorylates HDAC8 at Ser39 and increases its deacetylase activity, which inhibits KLF4 expression via the decreased histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility, leading to the restricted profibrotic responses of AMs mediated by KLF4.

                Valdearcos et al. show that microglia shape the hypothalamic perineuronal network during early postnatal life, ensuring that hypothalamic neurons projecting to the pancreatic β cell compartment during this time are maintained into adulthood. Depleting microglia in this critical period leaves mice incapable of secreting sufficient insulin when glucose challenged as adults.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95802">A statistical framework for analysis of trial-level temporal dynamics in fiber photometry experiments</a></h4>

              
                Fiber photometry has become a popular technique to measure neural activity in vivo, but common analysis strategies can reduce the detection of effects because they condense <i>within-trial</i> signals into summary measures, and discard trial-level information by averaging <i>across-trials</i>. We propose a novel photometry statistical framework based on functional linear mixed modeling, which enables hypothesis testing of variable effects at <i>every trial time-point</i>, and uses trial-level signals without averaging. This makes it possible to compare the timing and magnitude of signals across conditions while accounting for between-animal differences. Our framework produces a series of plots that illustrate covariate effect estimates and statistical significance at each trial time-point. By exploiting signal autocorrelation, our methodology yields <i>joint</i> 95% confidence intervals that account for inspecting effects across the entire trial and improve the detection of event-related signal changes over common multiple comparisons correction strategies. We reanalyze data from a recent study proposing a theory for the role of mesolimbic dopamine in reward learning, and show the capability of our framework to reveal significant effects obscured by standard analysis approaches. For example, our method identifies two dopamine components with distinct temporal dynamics in response to reward delivery. In simulation experiments, our methodology yields improved statistical power over common analysis approaches. Finally, we provide an open-source package and analysis guide for applying our framework.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99785">Proteostasis modulates gene dosage evolution in antibiotic-resistant bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Evolution of gene expression frequently drives antibiotic resistance in bacteria. We had previously (Patel and Matange, <i>eLife</i>, 2021) shown that, in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, mutations at the <i>mgrB</i> locus were beneficial under trimethoprim exposure and led to overexpression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), encoded by the <i>folA</i> gene. Here, we show that DHFR levels are further enhanced by spontaneous duplication of a genomic segment encompassing <i>folA</i> and spanning hundreds of kilobases. This duplication was rare in wild-type <i>E. coli</i>. However, its frequency was elevated in a <i>lon</i>-knockout strain, altering the mutational landscape early during trimethoprim adaptation. We then exploit this system to investigate the relationship between trimethoprim pressure and <i>folA</i> copy number. During long-term evolution, <i>folA</i> duplications were frequently reversed. Reversal was slower under antibiotic pressure, first requiring the acquisition of point mutations in DHFR or its promoter. Unexpectedly, despite resistance-conferring point mutations, some populations under high trimethoprim pressure maintained <i>folA</i> duplication to compensate for low abundance DHFR mutants. We find that evolution of gene dosage depends on expression demand, which is generated by antibiotic and exacerbated by proteolysis of drug-resistant mutants of DHFR. We propose a novel role for proteostasis as a determinant of copy number evolution in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95823">Using normative models pre-trained on cross-sectional data to evaluate intra-individual longitudinal changes in neuroimaging data</a></h4>

              
                Longitudinal neuroimaging studies offer valuable insight into brain development, ageing, and disease progression over time. However, prevailing analytical approaches rooted in our understanding of population variation are primarily tailored for cross-sectional studies. To fully leverage the potential of longitudinal neuroimaging, we need methodologies that account for the complex interplay between population variation and individual dynamics. We extend the normative modelling framework, which evaluates an individual’s position relative to population standards, to assess an individual’s longitudinal <i>change</i> compared to the population’s standard dynamics. Using normative models pre-trained on over 58,000 individuals, we introduce a quantitative metric termed ‘<i>z-diff</i>’ score, which quantifies a temporal change in individuals compared to a population standard. This approach offers advantages in flexibility in dataset size and ease of implementation. We applied this framework to a longitudinal dataset of 98 patients with early-stage schizophrenia who underwent MRI examinations shortly after diagnosis and 1 year later. Compared to cross-sectional analyses, showing global thinning of grey matter at the first visit, our method revealed a significant normalisation of grey matter thickness in the frontal lobe over time—an effect undetected by traditional longitudinal methods. Overall, our framework presents a flexible and effective methodology for analysing longitudinal neuroimaging data, providing insights into the progression of a disease that would otherwise be missed when using more traditional approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95566">Single-cell eQTL mapping in yeast reveals a tradeoff between growth and reproduction</a></h4>

              
                Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) provide a key bridge between noncoding DNA sequence variants and organismal traits. The effects of eQTLs can differ among tissues, cell types, and cellular states, but these differences are obscured by gene expression measurements in bulk populations. We developed a one-pot approach to map eQTLs in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and applied it to over 100,000 single cells from three crosses. We used scRNA-seq data to genotype each cell, measure gene expression, and classify the cells by cell-cycle stage. We mapped thousands of local and distant eQTLs and identified interactions between eQTL effects and cell-cycle stages. We took advantage of single-cell expression information to identify hundreds of genes with allele-specific effects on expression noise. We used cell-cycle stage classification to map 20 loci that influence cell-cycle progression. One of these loci influenced the expression of genes involved in the mating response. We showed that the effects of this locus arise from a common variant (W82R) in the gene <i>GPA1</i>, which encodes a signaling protein that negatively regulates the mating pathway. The 82R allele increases mating efficiency at the cost of slower cell-cycle progression and is associated with a higher rate of outcrossing in nature. Our results provide a more granular picture of the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and downstream traits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96944">Unraveling the impact of congenital deafness on individual brain organization</a></h4>

              
                Research on brain plasticity, particularly in the context of deafness, consistently emphasizes the reorganization of the auditory cortex. But to what extent do all individuals with deafness show the same level of reorganization? To address this question, we examined the individual differences in functional connectivity (FC) from the deprived auditory cortex. Our findings demonstrate remarkable differentiation between individuals deriving from the absence of shared auditory experiences, resulting in heightened FC variability among deaf individuals, compared to more consistent FC in the hearing group. Notably, connectivity to language regions becomes more diverse across individuals with deafness. This does not stem from delayed language acquisition; it is found in deaf native signers, who are exposed to natural language since birth. However, comparing FC diversity between deaf native signers and deaf delayed signers, who were deprived of language in early development, we show that language experience also impacts individual differences, although to a more moderate extent. Overall, our research points out the intricate interplay between brain plasticity and individual differences, shedding light on the diverse ways reorganization manifests among individuals. It joins findings of increased connectivity diversity in blindness and highlights the importance of considering individual differences in personalized rehabilitation for sensory loss.

                Human autonomic neuronal cell models are emerging as tools for modelling diseases such as cardiac arrhythmias. In this systematic review, we compared thirty-three articles applying fourteen different protocols to generate sympathetic neurons and three different procedures to produce parasympathetic neurons. All methods involved the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, and none employed permanent or reversible cell immortalization. Almost all protocols were reproduced in multiple pluripotent stem cell lines, and over half show evidence of neural firing capacity. Common limitations in the field are a lack of three-dimensional models and models including multiple cell types. Sympathetic neuron differentiation protocols largely mirrored embryonic development, with the notable absence of migration, axon extension, and target-specificity cues. Parasympathetic neuron differentiation protocols may be improved by including several embryonic cues promoting cell survival, cell maturation, or ion channel expression. Moreover, additional markers to define parasympathetic neurons <i>in vitro</i> may support the validity of these protocols. Nonetheless, four sympathetic neuron differentiation protocols and one parasympathetic neuron differentiation protocol reported more than two thirds of cells expressing autonomic neuron markers. Altogether, these protocols promise to open new research avenues of human autonomic neuron development and disease modelling.

">Dual agonist and antagonist muscle vibration produces a bias in end point with no change in variability</a></h4>

              
                Muscle spindles provide critical proprioceptive feedback about muscle length to the central nervous system (CNS). Single muscle tendon vibration can stimulate muscle spindles, causing participants to misjudge limb position, while dual muscle tendon vibration is thought to produce a noisy proprioceptive system. It is currently unclear exactly how the CNS uses kinesthetic feedback from the agonist and antagonist muscles during target-directed reaches. The purpose of the current project was to investigate the effects of agonist, antagonist, and dual agonist/antagonist during target-directed reaching. Using an elbow extension task, we found that antagonist muscle vibration produced an undershooting effect relative to the no-vibration control, while agonist muscle vibration produced an overshooting effect relative to the no-vibration control. Neither of the single muscle vibrations produced any change in the variable error of the movements. While it was originally hypothesized that dual agonist/antagonist vibration would increase participants variable error with no change in bias, the opposite was found. Participants undershot relative to the no-vibration control with no change in variable error. Overall, the results from this study suggest that dual vibration does not necessarily create a noisy proprioceptive system but can produce a bias in end point.

">Pathological α-Synuclein Perturbs Nuclear Integrity</a></h4>

              
                Pathological aggregates of -synuclein are a hallmark of a group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively termed synucleinopathies. The physiological function of -synuclein and the detrimental effects of the pathological variants of -synuclein have been widely debated, but recent evidence has suggested an emerging consensus on a critical role for -synuclein in regulating synaptic function. However, a controversial role for -synuclein in nuclear function in both normal and pathogenic states has been proposed, and the degree to which -synuclein localizes within the nucleus and subsequent impact on the nucleus are poorly understood. To begin to address this controversy, we employed synucleinopathy murine and cell culture models, as well as postmortem human Lewy Body Dementia tissue to elucidate the extent to which pathological -synuclein localizes within the nuclear compartments, and the downstream consequences of this localization. We observed pathological aggregation of -synuclein within the nucleus in both murine models and human postmortem Lewy Body Dementia cortex via quantitative super resolution microscopy. In both mouse and human brain tissue the presence of -synuclein in the nucleus correlated with abnormal morphology of nuclei. This pathological accumulation of -synuclein in the nucleus was not observed in control mice, human tissue without pathology, or control cells. We subsequently examined the mechanistic consequences of pathological accumulation of -synuclein in the nucleus. Synucleinopathy models displayed increased levels of the DNA damage marker 53BP1. Furthermore, cells with pathological -synuclein exhibited elevated markers of nuclear envelope damage and abnormal expression of nuclear envelope repair markers. Our cell culture data also suggests altered RNA localization in response to pathological -synuclein accumulation within the nucleus. Lastly, we show that nuclear Lewy-like pathology leads to increased sensitivity to nuclear targeted toxins. Taken together, these results rigorously illustrate nuclear localization of pathological -synuclein with super resolution methodology and provide novel insight into the ensuing impact on nuclear integrity and function.

">Prenatal DEHP plastic chemical exposure increases the likelihood of child autism and ADHD symptoms through epigenetic programming</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence implicates prenatal exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a common endocrine-disrupting plastic chemical, in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we examined whether cord blood DNA methylation, a key epigenetic marker, mediates the association between prenatal DEHP exposure and ASD/ADHD symptoms in 847 children enrolled in the Barwon Infant Study. ASD and ADHD are complex phenotypes characterised by differences at the gene regulatory network and neuronal circuit level, where heterogeneous genetic and environmental risk factors converge. Accordingly, we employed a data-driven computational strategy that helped elucidate broader functional epigenetic signatures of ASD and ADHD elicited by DEHP exposure. This included (1) a methylation profile score for DEHP exposure (MPSDEHP), and (2) an analysis of co-methylated gene networks. Causal mediation analysis demonstrated that both MPSDEHP and a DEHP-associated network of co-methylated genes mediated the effect of DEHP exposure on increased ASD and ADHD symptoms at ages 2 and 4 years (proportion of effect mediated ranged from 0.21 to 0.80). The co-methylation network was enriched for neural cell-type markers, ASD risk genes (including FOXP1, SHANK2, and PLXNB1), and targets of endocrine receptors previously linked to DEHP (including targets of the estrogen receptor ER and the glucocorticoid receptor GR), providing biological plausibility. We validated key results in independent blood (n=66) and postmortem brain (n=40) DNA methylation datasets. These findings provide mechanistic evidence linking DEHP to ASD and ADHD symptoms and reinforce growing concerns regarding the risks of prenatal exposure.nnSignificanceExposure to endocrine-disrupting plastic chemicals has been linked to adverse neurodevelopment, but the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate that prenatal exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a common plasticizer, increases autism and ADHD symptoms through alterations in DNA methylation, a key epigenetic regulator of gene activity. Using birth cohort data, we identify epigenetic signatures of prenatal DEHP exposure, including alterations in an endocrine-related co-methylation network enriched for neural cell-type markers and known autism-associated genes. These signatures mediate the effects of DEHP on autism and ADHD symptoms and are also associated with autism in external blood and postmortem-brain datasets, providing independent validation. This causal evidence further underscores concerns regarding the consequences of prenatal plastic-chemical exposure on the developing brain.

">Visualization of stochastic expression of clustered protocadherin β isoforms in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The stochastic expression of clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) establishes a single-cell identity fundamental to cellular self/non-self-discrimination. However, it has been challenging to reveal the spatiotemporal patterning of the stochastic cPcdh expression in vivo. We developed XFP (tdTomato or GFP) knock-in mice using a new strategy to enhance XFP expression, which allows us to visualize cPcdh{beta}3 or 19-positive cells throughout the brain.

">Chronic stress impairs autoinhibition in neurons of the locus coeruleus to increase asparagine endopeptidase activity</a></h4>

              
                Impairments of locus coeruleus (LC) are implicated in anxiety/depression and Alzheimers disease (AD). Increases in cytosolic noradrenaline (NA) concentration and MAO-A activity initiate the LC impairment through production of NA metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), by MAO-A. However, how NA accumulates in soma/dendritic cytosol of LC neurons has never been addressed despite the fact that NA is virtually absent in cytosol while NA is produced exclusively in cytoplasmic vesicles from dopamine by dopamine-{beta}-hydroxylase. Since re-uptake of autocrine-released NA following spike activity is the major source of NA accumulation, we investigated whether and how chronic stress can increase the spike activity accompanied by NA autocrine. Overexcitation of LC neurons is normally prevented by the autoinhibition mediated by activation of 2A-adrenergic receptor (AR)-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium-current (GIRK-I) with autocrine-released NA. Patch-clamp study revealed that NA-induced GIRK-I in LC neurons was decreased in chronic restraint stress (RS) mice while a similar decrease was gradually caused by repeated excitation. Chronic RS caused internalization of 2A-ARs expressed in cell membrane in LC neurons and decreased protein/mRNA levels of 2A-ARs/GIRKs in membrane fraction. Subsequently, chronic RS increased the protein levels of MAO-A, DOPEGAL-induced asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) and tau N368. These results suggest that chronic RS-induced overexcitation due to the internalization of 2A-ARs/GIRK is accompanied by [Ca2+]i increases, subsequently increasing Ca2+-dependent MAO-A activity and NA-autocrine. Thus, it is likely that internalization of 2A-AR increased cytosolic NA, as reflected in AEP increases, by facilitating re-uptake of autocrine-released NA. The suppression of 2A-AR internalization has a strong translational potential for AD.

">Multimodal brain cell atlas across the adult macaque lifespan</a></h4>

              
                High-throughput single-cell omics of non-human primate tissues present a remarkable opportunity to study primate brain aging. Here, we introduce a transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility landscape of 1,985,317 cells from eight brain regions of 13 cynomolgus female monkeys spanning adult lifespan including exceptionally old individuals up to 29-years old. This dataset uncovers dynamic molecular changes in critical brain functions such as synaptic communication and axon myelination, exhibiting a high degree of cell type and brain region specificity. We identify the multicellular networks of the pons and medulla as a previously unrecognized hotspot for aging. Furthermore, comparative analyses with human neurodegeneration datasets highlight both shared and distinct mechanisms contributing to aging and disease. In addition, we uncover transcription factors implicated in monkey brain aging and pinpoint aging-regulated loci linked to longevity and neurodegeneration. This spatiotemporal atlas will advance our understanding of primate brain aging and its broader implications for health and disease.

">Alpha and Beta Oscillations Mediate the Effect of Motivation on Neural Coding of Cognitive Flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility is crucial for adaptive human behaviour. Prior studies have analysed the effect of reward on cognitive flexibility; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. This study explores how reward influences neural oscillations and how these changes impact behavioural performance. Using time-frequency decomposition, we examined electroencephalographic data from participants engaged in rule-guided task-switching with varying reward prospects. Higher anticipated rewards lead to greater desynchronisation of alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (20-30Hz) oscillations, which in turn correlated with improved task performance. Both alpha power and event-related potential (ERP) coding of reward independently predicted reward-based performance improvements, suggesting distinct mechanisms supporting proactive control. These findings underscore the unique contributions of neural oscillations in mediating motivational effects on cognitive flexibility.

">Distributed burst activity in the thalamocortical system encodes reward contingencies during learning</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal bursts are distinct high-frequency firing patterns that are present ubiquitously throughout mammalian brain circuits. Although bursts are considered part of a universal neural code, the information they convey has long been a subject of debate. In this study, we investigated neuronal activity in simultaneously recorded regions of the thalamocortical system in freely moving mice as they learned stimulus-outcome associations in a go/no-go task. We discovered that, in parallel with learning, populations of neurons emerge in cortical, thalamic, and extrathalamic regions of the somatosensory system that encode task-relevant stimulus features via the presence or absence of bursts. These burst-coder neurons (BCNs) increase in number with task proficiency and exhibit burstiness that scales with stimulus valence rather than physical stimulus identity. Notably, BCNs consistently track stimulus-outcome associations - even after multiple rule switches - by inverting their burst encoding of the physical stimuli, indicating that burst coding is driven by outcome associations rather than by inherent stimulus properties. Although burst coding emerges throughout the thalamocortical system, only cortical units retain significant burst coding after devaluation, while other regions lose their discriminative burst patterns. Furthermore, decoding of stimulus properties and behavior achieves maximal accuracy when bursts or BCNs are used as input. Overall, these results provide direct experimental evidence linking neuronal bursting to learning, supporting a novel perspective of bursts as context encoders and teaching signals.

">Identification of a neural basis for energy expenditure in the arcuate hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Given the evolutionary instinct for caloric intake and the tendency for weight rebound after discontinuing dietary interventions or medications, increasing energy expenditure emerges as an alternative obesity treatment. However, neural regulation of energy expenditure remains poorly understood. Here, we report that a hypothalamic neuronal subtype, characterized by Crabp1 expression, establishes connections with multiple hypothalamic nuclei to regulate energy expenditure in mice. Inactivation of Crabp1 neurons reduces physical activity, body temperature, and adaptive thermogenesis, leading to an obese phenotype. Conversely, activation of these neurons increases energy expenditure and mitigates diet-induced obesity. Structural and functional analyses reveal that Crabp1 neurons promote energy metabolism through a "one-to- many" projection pattern. While Crabp1 neurons are rapidly activated by cold exposure and physical activity, prolonged light exposure abrogates their firing and may mediate light-induced metabolic disorder. Together, we reveal a neural basis that integrate various physiological and environmental stimuli to control energy expenditure and body weight.

">Hippocampal Ripple Diversity organises Neuronal Reactivation Dynamics in the Offline Brain</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal ripples are highly synchronized neuronal population patterns reactivating past waking experiences in the offline brain. Whether the level, structure, and content of ripple-nested activity are consistent across consecutive events or are tuned in each event remains unclear. By profiling individual ripples using laminar currents in the mouse hippocampus during sleep/rest, we identified Radsink and LMsink ripples featuring current sinks in stratum radiatum versus stratum lacunosum-moleculare, respectively. These two ripple profiles recruit neurons differently. Radsink ripples integrate recent motifs of waking coactivity, combining superficial and deep CA1 principal cells into denser, higher-dimensional patterns that undergo hour-long stable reactivation. In contrast, LMsink ripples contain core motifs of prior coactivity, engaging deep cells into sparser, lower-dimensional patterns that undergo a reactivation drift, gradually updating their pre-structured content for recent wakefulness. We propose that ripple-by-ripple diversity instantiates parallel reactivation channels for stable integration of recent wakefulness and flexible updating of prior internal representations.

">EEG-derived Brain Connectivity in Theta/Alpha Frequency Bands Increases During Reading of Individual Words</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Although extensive insights about the neural mechanisms of reading have been gained via magnetic and electrographic imaging, the temporal evolution of the brain network during sight reading remains unclear. We tested whether the temporal dynamics of the brain functional connectivity involved in sight reading can be tracked using high-density scalp EEG recordings. Approach: Twenty-eight healthy subjects were asked to read words in a rapid serial visual presentation task while recording scalp EEG, and phase locking value was used to estimate the functional connectivity between EEG channels in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. The resultant networks were then tracked through time. Main results. The network's graph density gradually increases as the task unfolds, peaks 150-250-ms after the appearance of each word, and returns to resting-state values, while the shortest path length between non-adjacent functional areas decreases as the density increases, thus indicating that a progressive integration between regions can be de-tected at the scalp level. This pattern was independent of the word's type or position in the sentence, occurred in the theta/alpha band but not in beta/gamma range, and peaked earlier in the alpha band compared to the theta band (alpha: 184 {+/-} 61.48-ms; theta: 237 {+/-} 65.32-ms, P-value P<0.01). Nodes in occipital and frontal regions had the highest eigenvector centrality throughout the word's presentation, and no significant lead-lag relationship between frontal/occipital regions and parietal/temporal regions was found, which indicates a consistent pattern in information flow. In the source space, this pattern was driven by a cluster of nodes linked to sensorimotor processing, memory, and semantic integration, with the most central regions being similar across subjects. Significance. These findings indicate that the brain network connectivity can be tracked via scalp EEG as reading unfolds, and EEG-retrieved networks follow highly repetitive patterns lateralized to frontal/occipital areas during reading.

">Activity in serotonergic axons in visuomotor areas of cortex is modulated by the recent history of visuomotor coupling</a></h4>

              
                Visuomotor experience is necessary for the development of normal function of visual cortex (Attinger et al., 2017) and likely establishes a balance between movement-related predictions and sensory signals (Jordan and Keller, 2020). This process depends at least in part on plasticity in visual cortex (Widmer et al., 2022). Key signals involved in driving this plasticity are visuomotor prediction errors (Keller et al., 2012; Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). Ideally however, the amount of plasticity induced by an error signal should be a function of several variables - including overall cortical prediction error, the animal's experience in the current environment or task, stability of the current environment, and task engagement - for optimal computational performance. Candidates for regulators of visuomotor prediction error driven plasticity are the three major neuromodulatory systems that innervate visual cortex in the mouse: acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. While visuomotor mismatch acutely triggers activity in noradrenaline (Jordan and Keller, 2023) but not acetylcholine (Yogesh and Keller, 2023) axons in visual cortex, how serotonergic axons in cortex respond to visuomotor mismatch is unknown. The serotonergic system in particular, is an interesting candidate for regulating visuomotor plasticity, as its activity is correlated with action-outcome uncertainty in mice (Grossman et al., 2020), and is increased under conditions of higher visuomotor gain in larval zebra fish (Kawashima et al., 2016). Here, we characterized the activity of serotonergic axons in visual cortex (V1) and in area A24b, a motor cortical area in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), of awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Our results reveal cortical region-specific responses to visuomotor stimuli in serotonergic axons, but no evidence of a response to visuomotor mismatch. However, average activity in serotonergic axons was increased under conditions of greater visuomotor uncertainty. Thus, serotonin could function to regulate visuomotor plasticity as a function of the predictability of the environment on longer time scales.

">Monkey See, Model Knew: Large Language Models Accurately Predict Visual Brain Responses in Humans and Non-Human Primates</a></h4>

              
                Recent progress in multimodal AI and  language-aligned visual representation learning has rekindled debates about the role of language in shaping the human visual system. In particular, the emergent ability of  language-aligned vision models (e.g. CLIP) - and even pure language models (e.g. BERT) - to predict image-evoked brain activity has led some to suggest that human visual cortex itself may be  language-aligned in comparable ways. But what would we make of this claim if the same procedures could model visual activity in a species that does not have language? Here, we conducted controlled comparisons of pure-vision, pure-language, and multimodal vision-language models in their prediction of human (N=4) and rhesus macaque (N=6, 5:IT, 1:V1) ventral visual activity to the same set of 1000 captioned natural images (the  NSD1000). The results revealed markedly similar patterns in model predictivity of early and late ventral visual cortex across both species. This suggests that language model predictivity of the human visual system is not necessarily due to the evolution or learning of language per se, but rather to the statistical structure of the visual world that is reflected in natural language.

">Adherence to Lifes Essential 8 Enhances Gut Microbiota Diversity and Cognitive Performance</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay among cardiovascular health, gut microbiome composition, and cognitive function. Lifes Essential 8 (LE8), developed by the American Heart Association, includes vital metrics of cardiovascular health, such as diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep health, body mass index (BMI), blood glucose, blood lipids, and blood pressure. In this study, we analyzed data from 781 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to explore the relationship between LE8 adherence, gut microbiota, and cognitive performance. Participants with greater adherence to LE8 demonstrated significantly increased gut microbial diversity (-diversity: Chao1, p = 0.0014; Shannon, p = 0.0071) and distinct microbial compositions ({beta}-diversity: PERMANOVA p = 1e-4). Higher adherence to LE8 was related to an increased abundance of genera Barnesiella and Ruminococcus, while a reduced abundance of Clostridium was associated with higher LE8 adherence. Greater gut microbial diversity (-diversity: Chao1, p = 0.0012; Shannon, p = 0.0066), and beneficial genera like Oscillospira correlated with better global cognitive scores (GCS). Taxonomic overlap analyses revealed microbial taxa that simultaneously influence both LE8 adherence and cognitive outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated that specific taxa, including Barnesiella and Lentisphaerae, mediated the link between LE8 adherence and cognitive performance. These taxa may serve as key modulators in the gut-brain axis, connecting cardiovascular and brain health. Conversely, higher Clostridium abundance was associated with poorer cognitive performance. This study highlights the significance of comprehensive cardiovascular health metrics in shaping gut microbiota and enhancing cognitive resilience. Our findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting gut microbiota to mitigate cognitive decline, warranting further exploration through longitudinal and metagenomic studies.

">Noradrenergic efferent subsystems that gate traumatic social learning</a></h4>

              
                Individuals experience varying magnitudes of stress in their daily lives. Although stress responses facilitate adaptive processes to cope with changing environments, severe stress can lead to traumatic learning and anxiety disorders. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the influence of stress severity on these processes remain unclear. Here, we show that traumatic social stress engages anatomically distinct locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LCNA) subpopulations that exhibit dynamic responses scaled to aversive salience. Using whole-brain activity and axonal projection mappings, we identified projectome subtypes of LCNA neurons, which are differentially recruited by single versus consecutive aversive social experiences. While hippocampus-projecting LCNA neurons responded to general social contacts, thalamus-projecting LCNA neurons tracked the aversive salience of social stimuli. Functional manipulations revealed a bidirectional role of thalamus-projecting LCNA neurons in social avoidance learning. These findings reveal the functional architecture of LCNA subsystems that regulate traumatic social learning via dynamic scaling to aversive salience.

">Local modulation of sleep slow waves depends on timing between auditory stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Conflicting evidence exists regarding the role of the targeted slow-wave phase in determining the direction and spatial specificity of slow-wave activity (SWA) modulation via phase-targeted auditory stimulation (PTAS) during sleep. To reconcile these discrepancies, we re-analyzed high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) data from previous studies, focusing on SWA responses to auditory stimuli presented with varying inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs). Our analysis reveals that ISI is a primary determinant of PTAS-induced SWA modulation, exceeding the influence of targeted phase alone. Specifically, auditory stimulation with longer ISIs evoked a global increase in SWA, consistent with a stereotypical auditory-evoked K-complex (KC), independent of targeted phase. Conversely, longer stimulus trains with rapid successive stimulus presentation resulted in spatially localized, phase-dependent SWA modulation, with up-PTAS enhancing and down-PTAS reducing SWA locally around the targeted area. This distinction resolves inconsistencies in prior PTAS studies by demonstrating that phase alone in insufficient in predicting slow-wave responses. Rather, it was the ISI which determined whether PTAS resulted in a global, KC-mediated response or a local, phase-specific modulation of SWA. Consequently, our findings refine the mechanistic understanding of PTAS, suggesting that ISI regulates the engagement of distinct neural circuits and thereby potentially enables the targeted manipulation of specific slow-wave subtypes and their associated functions.

">Lifespan Trajectories of the Brains Functional Complexity Characterized by Multiscale Sample Entropy</a></h4>

              
                Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used imaging modality that can capture spontaneous neural activity of the brain. The human brain is a complex system, and emerging evidence suggests that the complexity of neural activity may serve as an index of the brains capacity of information processing. In this study we used multiscale sample entropy (MSE) to analyze the complexity of rs-fMRI timeseries of 504 healthy subjects between the age of 6 to 85 years. We constructed the global and regional trajectories of brains functional complexity over the lifespan and analyzed its correlation with executive function. We observed a nonlinear trajectory of fMRI-complexity over the lifespan with a peak age occurring at 23 (95% CI 21.27, 26.38 years) years of age. Males reach the peak age of complexity at 26 years (95% CI 19.95, 33.14 years) whereas females at 23 (95% CI 20.16, 29.18 years). We found significant correlations between complexity and Number-Letter Switching of Trail Making Test in parietal and medial temporal lobes while Inhibition and Inhibition/Switching of Color Word Interference Test also revealed a significant negative correlation with rs-fMRI complexity in lateral and medial frontal cortex. These results help to understand behavior of fMRI-complexity with aging and reveals association with executive function of the brain. As a non-invasive biomarker, fMRI-complexity could provide novel approach to understand information processing capacity in the brain and deficits thereof in illness.

">Sparse innervation and local heterogeneity in the vibrissal corticostriatal projection</a></h4>

              
                The density and overlap of cortical axons in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) have suggested that striatal neurons integrate widespread information from cortical regions that are functionally related. However, in vivo, DLS neuronal responses to sensory stimuli have shown unexpectedly high selectivity, raising questions about the actual degree of input convergence of functional corticostriatal projection on individual striatal cells. Here, we investigated this question by focusing on the projections from different whisker cortical columns, as they overlap in the striatum and are co-active during behavior. Using ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DLS and glutamate uncaging for focal stimulations in the barrel cortex, we were able to map the location of presynaptic neurons to individual striatal projection neurons (SPNs). We found that each SPN was innervated by cells located in a small number of whisker cortical columns scattered across the barrel field in the slice. Connectivity of single SPNs with cortical neurons was thus highly discontinuous horizontally, despite the presence of more potential connections. Moreover, connectivity patterns were specific to each cell, with neighboring SPNs sharing few common clusters of presynaptic cells in the cortex. Despite this sparse and distinct innervation of individual SPNs, the projection was topographically organized at the population level. Finally, we found similar innervation patterns for D1 and D2-type SPNs, but observed distinct differences in synaptic strength at connections with specific cortical layers, notably with the associative layer 2/3. Our results suggest that the high convergence of somatosensory inputs to the striatum, enabled by diffuse and overlapping cortical innervation, is accomplished through sparse yet complementary connectivity to individual SPNs.

                The research aims to systematize the current scientific evidence on methodologies used to investigate the impact of indoor built environment on well-being, focusing on Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) variables such as thermal comfort, air quality, noise, and lighting. This systematic review adheres to the Joanna Briggs Institute framework and PRISMA guidelines to assess empirical studies that incorporate physiological measurements like heart rate, skin temperature, and brain activity, captured through various techniques in real-life contexts. The principal results reveal a significant relationship between the built environment and physiological as well as psychological states. For instance, thermal comfort was found to be the most commonly studied IEQ variable, affecting heart activity and skin temperature. The research also identifies the need for a shift towards using advanced technologies like Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) for capturing real-time physiological data in natural settings. Major conclusions include the need for a multi-level, evidence-based approach that considers the dynamic interaction between the brain, body, and environment. The study advocates for the incorporation of multiple physiological signals to gain a comprehensive understanding of well-being in relation to the built environment. It also highlights gaps in current research, such as the absence of noise as a studied variable of IEQ and the need for standardized well-being assessment tools. By synthesizing these insights, the research aims to pave the way for future studies that can inform better design and policy decisions for indoor environments.

">Revisiting face-to-hand area remapping in the human primary somatosensory cortex after a cervical spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to profound disruptions in sensorimotor processing. Seminal research in non-human primates suggests that this deprivation of sensory input causes functional remapping within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Crucially, cortical somatotopic representations of deprived body parts, such as the hand in cervical SCI, become responsive to touch on intact body parts, such as the face. However, in humans, the evidence for cortical remapping following SCI remains inconclusive. Here, sixteen chronic cervical SCI patients (mean age {+/-} s.e.m. = 52.4 {+/-} 3.5 years; 1 female) and 21 able-bodied controls (age: 49.9 {+/-} 3.4; 2 females) participated in two experiments in which we used a systematic and sensitive approach to determine the full extent of face-to-hand area remapping. In Experiment 1, we employed a lip movement fMRI paradigm, as previously used in human remapping studies. In Experiment 2, we investigated the full architecture of S1 face reorganisation through vibrotactile stimulation of the forehead, lips and chin. Firstly, we assessed whether the level of face activity in the anatomical S1 hand area was increased in SCI patients compared to controls. Secondly, we evaluated potential cortical shifts in peak face activity using geodesic distances. Thirdly, we used representational similarity analysis, where, in the instance of S1 face-to-hand remapping, we anticipated larger representational distances (i.e., more somatotopic information) between the different face sites in the S1 hand area. Finally, we explored what clinical characteristics may be driving face-to-hand area remapping. Our results revealed no significant differences between control participants and tetraplegic patients in any of our three markers for reorganisation during lip movement (Experiment 1) or vibrotactile stimulation (Experiment 2). Furthermore, we found no significant correlations between remapping and the clinical traits of the SCI patients. These findings suggest that cortical reorganisation is not apparent in human cervical SCI patients. As such, the extent of face-to-hand area reorganisation after a human SCI appears to differ fundamentally from what has been observed in experimental models of SCI. Beyond providing essential insights into the limitations of cortical reorganisation in humans, these findings call for a reassessment of rehabilitation strategies based on the assumption of face-to-hand reorganisation after an SCI.

">Spike inference from calcium imaging data acquired with GCaMP8 indicators</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience can only be reproducible when its key methods are quantitative and interpretable. Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity. Together, our study provides demonstrations, tools, and guidelines to optimally process and quantitatively interpret calcium signals obtained with GCaMP8.

">Neural Mechanisms Linking Global Maps to First-Person Perspectives</a></h4>

              
                Humans and many animals possess the remarkable ability to navigate environments by seamlessly switching between first-person perspectives (FPP) and global map perspectives (GMP). However, the neural mechanisms that underlie this transformation remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed a variational autoencoder (VAE) model, enhanced with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to investigate the computational principles behind perspective transformations. Our results reveal that temporal sequence modeling is crucial for maintaining spatial continuity and improving transformation accuracy when switching between FPPs and GMPs. The models latent variables capture many representational forms seen in the distributed cognitive maps of the mammalian brain, such as head direction cells, place cells, corner cells, and border cells, but notably not grid cells, suggesting that perspective transformation engages multiple brain regions beyond the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that landmark encoding, particularly proximal environmental cues such as boundaries and objects, play a critical role in enabling successful perspective shifts, whereas distal cues are less influential. These insights on perspective linking provide a new computational framework for understanding spatial cognition and offer valuable directions for future animal and human studies, highlighting the significance of temporal sequences, distributed representations, and proximal cues in navigating complex environments.

Significance StatementUnderstanding how the brain transforms between different spatial perspectives is crucial for advancing our knowledge of spatial cognition and navigation. This study presents a novel computational approach that bridges the gap between neural recordings and behavior, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms of perspective transformation. Our findings suggest how the brain integrates temporal sequences, distributed representations, and environmental cues to maintain a coherent sense of space. By demonstrating the importance of proximal cues and temporal context, our computational model provides testable predictions for future neurophysiological studies in humans and animals.

">Brain neuromarkers predict self- and other-related mentalizing across adult, clinical, and developmental samples</a></h4>

              
                Human social interactions rely on the ability to reflect on one's own and others' internal states and traits, a psychological process known as mentalizing. Impaired or altered self- and other-related mentalizing is a hallmark of multiple psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Yet, replicable and easily testable brain markers of mentalizing have so far been lacking. Here, we apply an interpretable machine learning approach to multiple datasets (total N=281) to train and validate fMRI brain signatures that predict 1) mentalizing about the self, 2) mentalizing about another person, and 3) both types of mentalizing. We test their generalizability across healthy adults, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The classifier trained across both types of mentalizing showed 98% predictive accuracy in independent validation datasets. Self-mentalizing and other-mentalizing classifiers had positive weights in anterior/medial and posterior/lateral brain areas respectively, with accuracy rates of 82% and 77% for out-of-sample prediction. Classifier patterns across cohorts revealed better self/other separation in 1) healthy adults compared to individuals with schizophrenia and 2) with increasing age in adolescence. Together, our findings reveal consistent and separable neural patterns subserving mentalizing about self and others, present at least from the age of adolescence and functionally altered in severe neuropsychiatric disorders. These mentalizing signatures hold promise as mechanistic neuromarkers to measure social-cognitive processes in different contexts and clinical conditions.

                Ibogaine is the main psychoactive alkaloid produced by the iboga tree (Tabernanthe iboga) that has a unique therapeutic potential across multiple indications, including opioid dependence, substance use disorders, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). We systematically examined the effects of ibogaine, its main metabolite noribogaine, and a series of iboga analogs at monoamine neurotransmitter transporters, some which have been linked to the oneiric and therapeutic effects of these substances. We report that ibogaine and noribogaine inhibit the transport function of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) with sub-micromolar potency in cell-based fluorimetry assays and at individual synaptic vesicle clusters in mouse brain as demonstrated via two-photon microscopy. The iboga compounds also inhibit the plasma membrane monoamine transporters (MATs), prominently including the serotonin transporter (SERT), and a novel iboga target, the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). SERT transport inhibition was demonstrated in serotonin axons and soma in the brain and in rat brain synaptosomes, where ibogaine and its analogs did not act as substrate-type serotonin releasers. Noribogaine showed dual inhibition of VMAT2 and SERT with comparable potency, providing an explanatory model for the known neurochemical effects of ibogaine in rodents. Together, the updated profile of the monoamine transporter modulation offers insight into the complexity of the iboga pharmacology, which we termed "matrix pharmacology". The matrix pharmacology concept is outlined and used to explain why ibogaine and noribogaine do not induce catalepsy, as demonstrated in our study, in contrast to other VMAT2 inhibitors.

">Bidirectional crusher gradient method for estimating the labeling efficiency of pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI in mice</a></h4>

              
                Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI is a widely used imaging technique for studying brain perfusion in health and disease due to its non-invasive and non-contrast nature. Accurate quantification of absolute perfusion values from pCASL signals requires the knowledge of labeling efficiency. However, to date, a reliable technique to measure pCASL labeling efficiency has not been available. In this study, we propose a method using bidirectional crusher gradients to modulate vascular signals in the azygos pericallosal artery (azPA) of the mouse brain, applied with and without pCASL labeling. The combination of corresponding signals allows the estimation of labeling efficiency. Upon systematic testing, optimal acquisition parameters included a labeling duration [&ge;] 1170 ms, a repetition time of 3 seconds, and an imaging slice thickness of 0.75 mm. In order to quantitatively estimate labeling efficiency, the bolus arrival time to azPA is required and found to be 218.7 +/- 13.3 ms. Typical labeling efficiencies in mouse pCASL scans were 0.780 +/- 0.048 (mean +/- standard deviation). Furthermore, faster arterial flow induced by hypercapnia was found to increase pCASL labeling efficiency. Our method can improve the accuracy of pCASL quantification in mice, offering great potential for advancing its applications in pathophysiological studies.

The rs-fMRI data were utilized to construct weighted networks for calculating four global topological metrics, including clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency, and small-worldness, and six nodal metrics, including nodal clustering coefficient, nodal characteristic path length, nodal degree, nodal strength, local efficiency, and betweenness centrality. The <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J PET provided standardized uptake value ratios as SD measures. LLD patients exhibited preserved global topological organization, with reduced nodal properties in regions associated with LLD, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and increased nodal properties in the basal ganglia and cerebellar regions. Notably, a negative correlation was observed between betweenness centrality in the mPFC and depressive symptom severity. No significant alterations in SD or associations between rs-fMRI topological properties and SD were found, challenging the hypothesis that SD alterations are the molecular basis for rs-fMRI topological changes in LLD. Our findings suggest other molecular mechanisms may underlie the observed functional connectivity alterations in these patients.</span>

	<p>Background: Insomnia is common in forensic psychiatric patients. Not only does insomnia severely impair general mental health, but it has specifically been associated with poor emotion regulation and self-control, potentially leading to problems in impulsivity, hostility, and even aggression. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) could therefore be beneficial in this patient group. Methods: We conducted a 14-week randomized controlled trial of the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on sleep, general psychopathology, hostility, impulsivity, and aggression in 31 male forensic psychiatric patients. Results: The CBT-I group (n = 11) showed a stronger reduction in self-reported insomnia symptoms and hostility than the waitlist group (n = 11). No differences were found in post-treatment self-reported general psychopathology, impulsivity, or aggression, nor on actigraphy-measured sleep efficiency. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of CBT-I in forensic psychiatric patients and indicates the importance of insomnia treatment in this population, especially considering the effect on hostility.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Aneurysms of brain vessels are life-threatening conditions with various adverse outcomes, some stemming from microsurgical intervention, particularly when major vessel perforators are inadequately protected. The use of endoscopes enhances the approach to aneurysms by providing closer visualization (180&amp;amp;ndash;360 degrees) of the local anatomy, potentially reducing accidental damage. To improve visualization and efficiency, a microscope-integrated 45-degree angled microinspection endoscopic tool (QEVO&amp;amp;reg;, Carl Zeiss, OberkochenTM) has been developed and employed in various neurosurgical procedures. Methods: Between 2021 and 2025, 27 brain aneurysms were treated with QEVO&amp;amp;reg; assistance at the Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Center of the University of Sarajevo. The choice of the videos corresponds to the best image quality in videos and on the microscopic determination of adjacent vessel perforators, which were not adequately seen purely by the surgical microscope in specific cases. Exclusion criteria included cases without a need for QEVO&amp;amp;reg; assistance in perforator visualization, severe brain edema, intraoperative aneurysm rupture, posterior circulation, or low video quality. Results: Case 1 demonstrates an anterior choroidal artery (AchA) aneurysm; Case 2 presents an anterior communicating artery (AcommA) aneurysm; and Case 3 features contralateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) microsurgical clipping with QEVO&amp;amp;reg; assistance. Conclusions: The QEVO&amp;amp;reg; tool significantly improves the visualization of aneurysm&amp;amp;ndash;perforator relationships, increasing the likelihood of preserving perforators during standard microsurgical clipping. This innovative approach may reduce surgical complications and enhance patient outcomes, highlighting the tool&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential as an adjunct in aneurysm microsurgery.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Emerging adults live in a time of rapid technological change, with social media playing a central role in their daily lives. While frequent use of social media is linked to reduced well-being, it also supports personal growth and the pursuit of individual goals. This study aims to identify the relationships between attitudes toward social media and psychological well-being in the context of the mediating roles of Facebook addiction and perceived stress in emerging adulthood. Methods: The study included 294 participants, with a mean age of 23.76 years (SD = 3.23). The following tools were used to measure the variables: the Social Media Mindsets Scale (translated by the authors), the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Psychological Well-Being Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted. Results: The findings confirmed most of the assumptions. Attitudes toward social media were positively correlated with psychological well-being. Furthermore, Facebook addiction and perceived stress serve as serial mediators between attitudes toward social media and well-being. Conclusions: Based on the results, practical interventions can be developed to prevent addictions and reinforce stress management, which will help young people maintain their well-being and mental health.</p>

	<p>Background: The Automated Test of Embodied Cognition (ATEC) is a new system for measuring cognition in action that uses cognitively demanding physical tasks and motion capture technology. Rhythm is one of the domains assessed by the ATEC across a number of tasks and is a domain for which there is no broadly accepted neurocognitive measure. Method: Rhythm was assessed in a sample of 104 participants that included those at risk of cognitive decline and community controls. At-risk participants were also administered standard measures of executive functioning (EF), verbal list-learning, story memory, visual memory, and pre-morbid IQ. Results: The ATEC Rhythm Domain was found in the factor analysis with Varimax rotation to be loaded distinctly on the EF factor. ATEC Rhythm was significantly correlated with EF neurocognitive measures, and, in a Chi-square analysis, significantly differentiated the community control participants from those at risk for cognitive decline. ATEC Rhythm was significantly correlated with story memory and visual memory but not verbal list-learning. Age was negatively correlated with ATEC Rhythm, and women performed slightly better than men. ATEC Rhythm was also significantly correlated with the years of education and an estimate of pre-morbid IQ. Discussion: ATEC Rhythm was found to have discriminant and concurrent validity with EF measures and was significantly correlated with measures of story memory and visual memory, but not verbal list-learning. We speculate on rhythm&amp;amp;rsquo;s relationship to story narrative and visual sequencing, and on rhythm&amp;amp;rsquo;s relationship to cognitive reserve, as represented by education and the pre-morbid IQ estimate. Conclusions: The ATEC is a promising new measure that provides a systematic assessment of rhythm as a domain of embodied cognition. It may be useful in studies of neurodevelopment and neurocognitive decline, it and may be especially useful in assessing the effects of interventions that use physical activities, including dance and music therapies.</p>

	<p>Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is considered as a rare disease. It is considered one of the most prevalent genetic disorders with multiple systemic and neuropsychological alterations. At present, there are few studies that define the linguistic profile in Spanish of children with this syndrome. Objectives: Therefore, the aim of the present study was to define the phonemic&amp;amp;ndash;phonological characteristics of people with 22q11.2 Syndrome. Method: Eight boys and girls between 5 and 16 years old participated in an evaluation using the following tests: Induced Phonological Register and Laura Bosh&amp;amp;rsquo;s Phonological Assessment and Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Speech. Results: After analyzing the results obtained, it was observed that more than half of the participants presented a delay in the acquisition of phonemes. Conclusions: The conclusion of this study points out the importance of working on language, especially the phonetic-phonological area, throughout the development of people with 22q11.2 Syndrome.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep disturbances are a core feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), affecting up to 90% of patients and often persisting after standard PTSD treatment. As all the current interventions have limitations, amygdala-targeted neuromodulation may offer a novel treatment pathway. Methods: Secondary analysis of a prospective, single-arm trial (n = 58) was carried out evaluating Prism&amp;amp;trade; amygdala-derived-EEG-fMRI-Pattern neurofeedback (Amyg-EFP-NF). Sleep outcomes were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) sleep item, PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) sleep item, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) sleep items at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Treatment consisted of 15 sessions over 8 weeks. Results: At 3-months&amp;amp;rsquo; follow-up, 63.79% of participants demonstrated clinically meaningful reduction in sleep disturbances (&amp;amp;ge;1 point reduction in CAPS-5 Item 20). Sleep improvement showed a moderate correlation with overall PTSD symptom reduction (r = 0.484, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and a balanced improvement pattern (&amp;amp;minus;15.1% early, &amp;amp;minus;9.1% late). Sleep responders sustained improvement across multiple measures and showed significant increases in cognitive reappraisal (mean change: +2.57 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.0, p = 0.006), while non-responders showed initial but un-sustained improvement in trauma-related dreams. Conclusions: Amyg-EFP-NF shows preliminary promise for treating PTSD-related sleep disturbances. Our exploratory analyses suggest distinct temporal patterns of sleep improvement and potential associations with enhanced cognitive reappraisal capacity that warrant rigorous investigation in future randomized controlled trials.</p>

	<p>Background and Objectives: End-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients are at an increased risk of various neurological complications, particularly after hemodialysis. The current case report describes a rare presentation of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) in a patient with ESRF caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: We present our case report. We also performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and Dimensions for the current literature review. Results: A total of 296 unique articles were identified, and their full text was retrieved. However, only one case report was relevant to our study and is summarized thereunder. The treatment approach involved high-dose intravenous steroids, surgical evacuation of the cranial subdural collections, and epidural blood patches to seal the presumed dural defect. Conclusions: This case report describes a rare presentation of SIH in a young patient with ESRF due to SLE. Diagnostic imaging revealed extensive subdural and epidural fluid collections in the brain and spinal cord, respectively, along with a few T2 FLAIR hyperintensities noted in the right thalamus, left cerebellar hemisphere, and right occipital gyrus that subsequently resolved. The treatment approach involved high-dose intravenous steroids, surgical evacuation of the cranial subdural collections, and epidural blood patches to seal the presumed dural defect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-467/v4?src=rss">Negative perceptions toward older adults and life satisfaction among community-dwelling older citizens in Japan [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.
