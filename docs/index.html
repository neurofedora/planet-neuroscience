                arXiv:2511.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by key neuroscience principles, deep learning has driven exponential breakthroughs in developing functional models of perception and other cognitive processes. A key to this success has been the implementation of crucial features found in biological neural networks: neurons as units of information transfer, non-linear activation functions that enable general function approximation, and complex architectures vital for attentional processes. However, standard deep learning models rely on biologically implausible error propagation algorithms and struggle to accumulate knowledge incrementally. While, the precise learning rule governing synaptic plasticity in biological systems remains unknown, recent discoveries in neuroscience could fuel further progress in AI. Here I examine successful implementations of brain-inspired principles in deep learning, current limitations, and promising avenues inspired by recent advances in neuroscience, including error computation, propagation, and integration via synaptic updates in biological neural networks.

                arXiv:2511.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional brain graphs are often characterized with separate graph-theoretic or spectral descriptors, overlooking how these properties covary and partially overlap across brains and conditions. We anticipate that dense, weighted functional connectivity graphs occupy a low-dimensional latent geometry along which both topological and spectral structures display graded variations. Here, we estimated this unified graph representation and enabled generation of dense functional brain graphs through a graph transformer autoencoder with latent diffusion, with spectral geometry providing an inductive bias to guide learning. This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised, meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics. From the diffusion modeled distribution, we were able to sample biologically plausible and structurally grounded synthetic dense graphs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988">Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.03988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet, the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly, 3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04174">Protein aggregation in Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04292">BTTDA: Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis for Brain-Computer Interfacing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.04292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a novel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme to iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature representation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant PARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and MI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework. Benchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the traditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art performance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and PARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52% > 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power. This offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI and broader neuroimaging applications.

                arXiv:2511.04454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex optimization.

                arXiv:2510.25998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's "consciousness-first" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness, temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.

                arXiv:2411.05712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When trained on large-scale object classification datasets, certain artificial neural network models begin to approximate core object recognition behaviors and neural response patterns in the primate brain. While recent machine learning advances suggest that scaling compute, model size, and dataset size improves task performance, the impact of scaling on brain alignment remains unclear. In this study, we explore scaling laws for modeling the primate visual ventral stream by systematically evaluating over 600 models trained under controlled conditions on benchmarks spanning V1, V2, V4, IT and behavior. We find that while behavioral alignment continues to scale with larger models, neural alignment saturates. This observation remains true across model architectures and training datasets, even though models with stronger inductive biases and datasets with higher-quality images are more compute-efficient. Increased scaling is especially beneficial for higher-level visual areas, where small models trained on few samples exhibit only poor alignment. Our results suggest that while scaling current architectures and datasets might suffice for alignment with human core object recognition behavior, it will not yield improved models of the brain's visual ventral stream, highlighting the need for novel strategies in building brain models.

                arXiv:2505.13567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks offer powerful models of brain computation. However, typical training paradigms rely on open-loop, supervised settings, whereas real-world learning unfolds in closed-loop environments. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained in closed-loop contexts. We first demonstrate that two otherwise identical RNNs, trained in either closed- or open-loop modes, follow markedly different learning trajectories. To probe this divergence, we analytically characterize the closed-loop case, revealing distinct stages aligned with the evolution of the training loss. Specifically, we show that the learning dynamics of closed-loop RNNs, in contrast to open-loop ones, are governed by an interplay between two competing objectives: short-term policy improvement and long-term stability of the agent-environment interaction. Finally, we apply our framework to a realistic motor control task, highlighting its broader applicability. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop dynamics in a biologically plausible setting.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04047">Why Consciousness Should Explain Physical Phenomena: Toward a Testable Theory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04593">Neural Computation Without Slots: Steps Towards Biologically Plausible Memory and Attention in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many models used in artificial intelligence and cognitive science rely on multi-element patterns stored in "slots" - dedicated storage locations - in a digital computer. As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they might achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the neurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which stores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose extensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model of memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in contemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that the weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated individual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN, extending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning regime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as measured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron) MHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary language models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs and their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error signals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the learned encodings of these past inputs. Inspired by these models' successes, we show how the MHN can be extended to capture both of these important functional outcomes. Collectively, our modeling approaches constitute steps towards understanding how biologically plausible mechanisms can support computations that have enabled AI systems to capture human-like abilities that no prior models have been able to achieve.

                arXiv:2511.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models, especially diffusion architectures, have transformed image generation; however, they are challenging to control and optimize for specific goals without expensive retraining. Embedding Space Exploration, especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models. Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts (P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning. This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space exploration of deep generative models and outlines future research directions.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforced genetic approach to a defined d-resource system optimization problem. The classical evolution schema was ineffective due to a very strict feasibility function in the studied problem.

                arXiv:2511.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid, context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells. Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to $\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

                arXiv:2511.04040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information, ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features. Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO, MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23717">Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.23717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.

                <p>Abrupt onsets reflexively shift covert spatial attention. Recent work demonstrated that trial-to-trial information about the probability of a peripheral onset modulated the magnitude of the attentional cueing effect (low probability &gt; high probability). Although onsets were physically identical, pupil responses could have been modulated by information about the probability of the onset's appearance. Specifically, anticipatory constrictions may have preceded high-probability onsets. Here, we tested this hypothesis using centrally presented, luminance-matched onset-probability signals. For half the participants, vertical signaled high probability (0.8) of onset appearance, while horizontal signaled low probability (0.2). Contingencies were reversed for the other half. Participants fixated the onset-probability signal for 2,000&nbsp;ms before the onset was briefly presented or omitted, in line with the signaled probability. To maintain engagement, participants completed a simple localization task. Preliminary evidence for an anticipatory reduction in the pupil area was obtained in Experiment 1. However, this effect disappeared in Experiment 2 with a larger replication sample. Exploratory analyses uncovered a violation of a fundamental methodological assumption: despite being task-irrelevant and perfectly luminance-matched, vertical onset-probability signals consistently generated smaller pupil areas, relative to horizontal signals in both Experiments 1 and 2. Interestingly, this "orientation effect" was stronger in the second half of the experimental session, and in a third experiment, we significantly reduced its magnitude by changing the locations of the task-relevant stimuli. In short, across three experiments (self-reported gender, 52 females, 26 males, 1 nonbinary), we show that even with perfect luminance matching, unforeseen changes in cognitive state can modulate pupillometric measurements.</p>

                <p>Hippocampal pyramidal cells are involved in spatial coding and memory formation. Recent evidence shows that they can be classified according to the origin of their axon, either emerging from the soma (non-AcD for "nonaxon-carrying dendrite") or from a proximal basal dendrite (AcD). We have shown that AcD neurons account for ~50% of CA1 pyramidal neurons and that they integrate excitatory inputs differently. They are less susceptible to perisomatic inhibition and more strongly recruited during memory-related network oscillations with strong inhibitory activity. Here, we tested whether AcD and non-AcD neurons are differentially engaged during distinct stages of spatial learning. We trained mice of either sex on a spatial memory task (m-maze) and quantified c-Fos expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons at different training stages. AcD and non-AcD cells were distinguished by staining the axon initial segment. Across learning stages, dorsal and medioventral hippocampus showed distinct activation patterns. In dorsal CA1, c-Fos expression shifted from a predominant presence in non-AcD cells at early stages to the increased presence in AcD cells at later stages. In medioventral CA1, AcD neurons showed a transient c-Fos expression peak at intermediate stages of the training, accompanied by a progressive reduction of the percentage of AcD cells over time. This reduction was not observable in the dorsal hippocampus. This suggests region- and cell type-dependent recruitment patterns of CA1 pyramidal cells during learning and indicates that the site of axon origin may undergo structural plasticity. In addition, the findings support functional and structural differentiation along the dorsoventral axis of CA1.</p>

                Background The increasing integration of mobile technology into everyday life has transformed interpersonal relationships, particularly within families. Phubbing—the act of ignoring one’s immediate social environment by focusing on a mobile device—has emerged as a pervasive and disruptive behavior, yet its effects on family coexistence remain understudied. This study addresses a critical gap by examining how phubbing manifests within family dynamics and how it influences emotional connection, communication patterns, and coexistence strategies among Colombian families with school-aged children. Method A qualitative, descriptive research design was employed to capture parental and adolescent perceptions of phubbing. Data were collected from 25 Colombian families through semi-structured interviews and surveys. Participants were selected via non-probabilistic convenience sampling. A categorical matrix guided thematic analysis, focusing on technology use in daily life, its impact on family relationships, usage regulation, and strategies to counteract phubbing. Results Findings revealed that families experience tension between the necessity and overuse of digital devices. Parents and children alike reported both reliance on and frustration with mobile technology. The ubiquity of screen time contributed to decreased face-to-face communication, emotional disconnection, and psychosocial concerns. Nevertheless, families also reported adaptive behaviors—such as rule-based regulation, digital detox practices, and collaborative agreements—to mitigate negative impacts. The study identified a need for structured tools and shared routines to balance connectivity and relational presence. Conclusions Phubbing poses significant challenges to modern family life by weakening relational quality and coexistence. However, families are actively developing preventive and pedagogical strategies to foster digital awareness and restore interpersonal engagement. These findings underscore the necessity of educational interventions and technological literacy programs that promote balanced device use and reinforce human connection within familial settings.

                Background Unintentional home injuries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children under five. Mothers, as primary caregivers, often lack the necessary knowledge, practical skills, and confidence to respond effectively to emergencies. Simulation-based training (SBT) is an evidence-based method that enhances learning, skill acquisition, and self-efficacy. Aim This study evaluated the effect of simulation-based first aid training on mothers’ preparedness for home safety and emergency response in households with children. Methods A quasi-experimental one-group pre- and post-test design was conducted with 144 mothers attending three Primary Health Care Centers. Data were collected using validated and reliable structured questionnaires on socio-demographics, first aid knowledge, and home safety practices, along with a post-simulation self-confidence scale. The intervention consisted of six scenario-based simulation sessions covering common home accidents. Paired comparisons, effect sizes (η2), and correlation analyses were performed. Results Post-training mothers’ first aid knowledge and home safety practices significantly improved (knowledge: pre 36.9 ± 24.0, post 86.4 ± 18.2, η2 ≈ 0.789; safety practices: pre 29.9 ± 12.9, post 91.6 ± 16.4, η2 ≈ 0.902). Most participants reported high satisfaction, found the content relevant, and expressed strong confidence in their ability to master the skills. Significant positive correlations were found between knowledge, home safety practices, and emergency response confidence (r = 0.698–0.791; p < 0.001). Conclusion Simulation-based first aid training effectively enhances mothers’ knowledge, safety practices, and confidence in managing home emergencies. Incorporating such training into maternal and child health programs can strengthen household preparedness and promote child safety.

                Background Sensory recovery following digital nerve neurorrhaphy is often incomplete, and strategies to enhance regeneration remain under investigation. Low-frequency transcutaneous electrical stimulation has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy, but its efficacy in clinical settings is uncertain. Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 32 patients with isolated traumatic digital nerve injuries underwent surgical neurorrhaphy at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 16) or sham group (n = 16). The intervention consisted of a single postoperative session of square-pulsed, biphasic transcutaneous electrical stimulation at 20 Hz for 1 hour. The sham group received identical conditions without active stimulation. After stimulation, patients underwent physiotherapy sessions for three months. Sensory recovery was assessed using Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing and two-point discrimination at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. Results Both groups showed progressive sensory improvement throughout follow-up, approaching normal values at 3 months. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups in any outcome measure. Confidence intervals for group comparisons overlapped, and no clinically meaningful differences were detected. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusions A single postoperative session of low-frequency transcutaneous electrical stimulation did not significantly enhance sensory recovery after digital nerve repair. Further research with varied stimulation protocols, repeated sessions, or extended follow-up may be warranted to clarify its potential role in peripheral nerve regeneration. Level of Evidence Therapeutic Level I.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1221/v1?src=rss">Factors influencing the purchase of regrooved tyres: An exploratory study on consumer behaviour in South Africa [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The influx of re-grooved tyres, often of poor quality, has increased in South Africa, driven by affordability and lack of regulation. Despite their popularity among cost-conscious consumers, these tyres raise serious safety concerns. This study aims to investigate the behavioural factors influencing consumers’ decisions to purchase re-grooved tyres, particularly within low-income communities. A qualitative, exploratory design was employed, utilising semi-structured interviews with 21 consumers from three townships in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Participants were selected based on their experience of purchasing re-grooved passenger tyres. The data were thematically analysed using NVivo 12 software to identify recurring patterns and themes in consumer behaviour. The findings indicate that unplanned purchases driven by financial constraints are the primary motivators behind the acquisition of re-grooved tyres. Convenience, proximity to vendors, and word-of-mouth referrals significantly influence decision-making. Most consumers exhibited limited awareness of safety risks and were often misled by persuasive vendor strategies that highlighted low prices and a visible tread life. Quality, lifespan, and warranty considerations were secondary to affordability, and consumers often perceived value solely in terms of low costs. Consumer decisions to purchase re-grooved tyres are influenced by a combination of financial, social, and contextual factors, often at the expense of safety. There is a critical need for targeted educational campaigns and regulatory interventions to raise awareness of the hazards associated with re-grooved tyres. Simultaneously, marketers and policymakers must promote tyre options that balance affordability and safety to ensure informed consumer choices and improve road safety outcomes.

                <p>by Jing Li, Qing Liu, Quan Zou, Chao Zhan</p>

Secretory effectors from pathogenic microorganisms significantly influence pathogen survival and pathogenicity by manipulating host signalling, immune responses, and metabolic processes. However, because of sequence and structural heterogeneity among bacterial effectors, accurately classifying multiple types simultaneously remains challenging. Therefore, we developed TXSelect, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously classifies TXSE (types I, II, III, IV and VI secretory effectors) using a shared backbone network with task-specific heads. TXSelect integrates the protein embedding features of evolutionary scale modelling (ESM), particularly the N-terminal mean, with classical descriptors to effectively capture complementary information. These descriptors include distance-based residue (DR) and split amino acid composition general (SC-PseAAC-General). Rigorous evaluation identified ESM N-terminal mean + DR + SC-PseAAC as the optimal feature combination, achieving high accuracy (validation F1 = 0.867, test F1 = 0.8645) and robust generalization. Comprehensive assessments and visualization with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection further validated the discriminative capability and interpretability of the model. TXSelect provides an efficient computational tool for accurately classifying bacterial effectors, supporting deeper biological understanding and potential therapeutic development.

                <p>by Yangsong He, Zheng-Jian Bai, Wai-Ki Ching, Quan Zou, Yushan Qiu</p>

Motivation: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in cancer metastasis by promoting changes in adhesion and motility. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate alternative splicing (AS) during EMT, enabling a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms that affect tumor progression. Disruption of RBP-AS interactions may disrupt the progress of diseases like cancer. Despite the importance of RBP-AS relationships in EMT, few computational methods predict these associations. Existing models struggle in sparse settings with limited known associations. To improve performance, we incorporate both sparsity constraints and heterogeneous biological data to infer RBP–AS associations.
Result: We propose a new method based on Accelerated Proximal DC Algorithm (APDCA) for predicting RBP–AS associations. In particular, APDCA combines sparse low-rank matrix factorization with a Difference-of-Convex (DC) optimization framework and uses extrapolation to improve convergence. A key feature of APDCA is the use of a sparsity constraint, which filters out noise and highlights key associations. In addition, integrating multiple related data sources with direct or indirect relationships can help in reaching a more comprehensive view of RBPs and AS events and to reduce the impact of false positives associated with individual data sources. we prove that our proposed algorithm is convergent under some conditions and the experimental results have illustrated that APDCA outperforms six baseline methods in both AUC and AUPR. A case study on the RBP QKI shows that the top predictions are verified by the OncoSplicing database. Thus, APDCA provides a fast, interpretable, and scalable tool for discovering post-transcriptional regulatory interactions.

                <p>by Jinani Sooriyaarachchi, Chang’an A. Zhan, Curtis L. Baker Jr</p>

Neurons in the early visual cortex respond selectively to multiple features of visual stimuli, but they respond inconsistently to repeated presentation of the same visual stimulus. Such trial-to-trial response variabilities are often treated as random noise and addressed by simple trial-averaging to obtain the stimulus-driven response. However, response variability may primarily be caused by non-sensory factors, particularly by variations in cortical state. Here we recorded and analyzed neuronal spiking activity in response to natural images from areas 17 and 18 of cats, along with local population neuronal signals, i.e., local field potentials (LFPs) and multi-unit activity (MUA). Single neurons showed highly varying degrees of trial-to-trial response variability, even when recorded simultaneously. We used a variability ratio (VR) measure to quantify the trial-wise differences in neural responses, and two cortical state indicative measures, a global fluctuation index (GFI) calculated using MUA, and a synchrony index (SI) calculated from LFP signals. We propose a compact convolutional neural network model with parallel pathways, to capture the stimulus-driven activity and the cortical state-driven response variabilities. The stimulus-driven pathway is comprised of a spatiotemporal filter, a parametric rectifier and a Gaussian map, and the cortical state-driven pathway contains temporal filters for MUA and LFPs. The model parameters are fit to best predict each neuron’s spiking activity. We further evaluated the improvements in estimated receptive fields of neurons when incorporating cortical state related information in our system identification model. The fitted model performed with a significantly higher accuracy in predicting neural responses as well as qualitative improvements in the estimated receptive fields compared to a basic model with a stimulus-driven pathway alone. The neurons with higher response variability benefited more from the cortical state-driven pathway compared to less variable neurons. These results show that different neurons may differ greatly in their variability and in the degree of their relationship to indicators of cortical state fluctuations.

                <p>by Ismaila Muhammed, Dimitris M. Manias, Dimitris A. Goussis, Haralampos Hatzikirou</p>

Biological systems inherently exhibit multi-scale dynamics, making accurate system identification particularly challenging due to the complexity of capturing a wide time scale spectrum. Traditional methods capable of addressing this issue rely on explicit equations, limiting their applicability in cases where only observational data are available. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method, the multi scale analysis algorithm Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). This framework allows the partition of the available dataset in subsets characterized by similar dynamics, so that system identification can proceed within these subsets without facing a wide time scale spectrum. Accordingly, when the full dataset does not allow SINDy to identify the proper model, CSP is employed for the generation of subsets of similar dynamics, which are then fed into SINDy. CSP requires the availability of the gradient of the vector field, which is estimated by the NNs. The framework is tested on the Michaelis-Menten model, for which various reduced models in analytic form exist at different parts of the phase space. It is demonstrated that the CSP-based data subsets allow SINDy to identify the proper reduced model in cases where the full dataset does not. In addition, it is demonstrated that the framework succeeds even in the cases where the available data set originates from stochastic versions of the Michaelis-Menten model. This framework is algorithmic, so system identification is not hindered by the dimensions of the dataset.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012727">Role of connectivity anisotropies in the dynamics of cultured neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Akke Mats Houben, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi Soriano</p>

An inherent challenge in designing laboratory-grown, engineered living neuronal networks lies in predicting the dynamic repertoire of the resulting network and its sensitivity to experimental variables. To fill this gap, and inspired by recent experimental studies, we present a numerical model designed to replicate the anisotropies in connectivity introduced through engineering, characterize the emergent collective behavior of the neuronal network, and make predictions. The numerical model is developed to replicate experimental data, and subsequently used to quantify network dynamics in relation to tunable structural and dynamical parameters. These include the strength of imprinted anisotropies, synaptic noise, and average axon lengths. We show that the model successfully captures the behavior of engineered neuronal cultures, revealing a rich repertoire of activity patterns that are highly sensitive to connectivity architecture and noise levels. Specifically, the imprinted anisotropies promote modularity and high clustering coefficients, substantially reducing the pathological-like bursting of standard neuronal cultures, whereas noise and axonal length influence the variability in dynamical states and activity propagation velocities. Moreover, connectivity anisotropies significantly enhance the ability to reconstruct structural connectivity from activity data, an aspect that is important to understand the structure-function relationship in neuronal networks. Our work provides a robust in silico framework to assist experimentalists in the design of in vitro neuronal systems and in anticipating their outcomes. This predictive capability is particularly valuable in developing reliable brain-on-a-chip platforms and in exploring fundamental aspects of neural computation, including input-output relationships and information coding.

                Background Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is an under-recognized clinical condition, particularly in low-resource settings, with significant implications for antimicrobial resistance and public health. This study investigated the prevalence, microbial profile, and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of ASB among individuals residing in public housing in Obinze, Imo State, Nigeria. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 150 randomly selected asymptomatic individuals. Structured questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic data, assess hygiene practices, and evaluate ASB awareness. Midstream urine samples were collected and subjected to standard microbiological analyses, including culture, gram staining, and biochemical tests. The isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 28. Results A total of 75 bacterial isolates were recovered. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism (56%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (28%), Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.7% each), and Klebsiella spp. (2.6%). Most participants exhibited poor awareness of ASB, with only 2% accurately identifying its diagnostic threshold. Hygiene practices varied, with a high proportion reporting inappropriate genital cleaning methods and urination in public spaces due to a lack of sanitation facilities. Antibiotic resistance was observed among the isolates, highlighting the potential threat of community-based reservoirs for resistant strains. Conclusion This study revealed a high burden of ASB and identified critical gaps in public awareness, hygiene practices, and sanitation infrastructure. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted health education, routine ASB screening, improved sanitation, and antibiotic stewardship programs to mitigate public health risks in similar settings.

                Background Sorghum has potential as a source of material for food, bioenergy, and animal feed, making it a worthy candidate for promotion. This cereal thrives in regions characterized by low moisture and dry conditions. To address the diminishing availability of arable dry land, it may be necessary to explore the cultivation of sorghum in tidal swamplands and sandy soils. Methods Twelve sorghum varieties were evaluated in tidal swamplands during the rainy and dry seasons, as well as in sandy soil during the dry season, using two levels of organic fertilizers to create six test environments. The experiments were arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replications. To choose sorghum varieties with features that closely resemble an idealized sorghum variety, the Multi-trait Genotype-Ideotype Distance Index (MGIDI) was utilized. Simultaneously, genotype plus genotype-environment interaction (GGE) biplots were employed to determine the best circumstances for choosing broadly adaptable varieties that exhibit desirable features, as well as to find varieties that thrive environmental contexts. Results Based on the MGIDI ranking on the average across environment, two varieties, i.e., Numbu and Kawali were selected. However selected varieties in each environment were differed due to significant variety-environment interaction. In terms of grain weight, the Soper 7 Agritan variety exhibits adaptability across diverse environments, while the Numbu variety likewise demonstrates versatility in various environmental conditions. When evaluating forage yield, several adaptable varieties have emerged. Tidal swamplands treated with a high application of organic fertilizer, as well as sandy soils, provide optimal environments for selecting broadly adaptable varieties that focus on both grain and forage yields. Conclusion Adaptable varieties differ for various groups of environments and different traits under consideration. Optimal environments for identifying broadly adaptable varieties varied by trait. The MGIDI proves to be a valuable tool for selecting varieties based on multiple traits. In parallel, the GGE biplots effectively identifies adaptable varieties based on individual traits.

                Background Cerebral computed tomography angiography (CTA) is widely used to assess neurovascular disorders, but venous contamination often obscures arteries. Optimizing bolus-tracking thresholds is crucial, yet patient factors influencing contrast dynamics and the value of radiation dose indices in head CTA remain unclear. Objectives To optimize bolus-tracking thresholds in cerebral CTA by examining patient-related influences on enhancement and radiation metrics. Methods 126 adults undergoing cerebral CTA were evaluated in this prospective study. Demographics, physiologic parameters, peak enhancement time (PET), peak enhancement attenuation (PEA), and dose indices (CTDIvol, SSDE) were recorded. Linear regression identified predictors of enhancement. Two blinded radiologists graded venous contamination. ROC analysis, including age subgroups, determined the optimal HU threshold. Results Median age was 55.5 years; 70% were male. PET rose with age (+0.086 s/year, p < 0.001) and was shorter in females (–2.39 s, p = 0.003). PEA increased with threshold (+1.03 HU/unit, p < 0.001). Arterial enhancement was higher in females (+40.7 HU, p < 0.001) and patients ≥60 years (+70 HU, p < 0.001). Venous enhancement correlated with PET (p = 0.023) and systolic pressure (p = 0.002). ROC analysis showed an optimal threshold of 105 ± 5 HU (AUC = 0.634; sensitivity 88.4%, specificity 77.1%). CTDIvol, but not SSDE, correlated with weight (p = 0.015). Conclusion Intrinsic (age, gender) and extrinsic (threshold) factors shape CTA enhancement. A 105 ± 5 HU threshold reduces venous contamination, especially in younger patients. CTDIvol remains the preferred dose index. Findings support individualized, resource-efficient CTA protocols aligned with UN SDGs 3, 9, and 12.

                Aims and background Insertion of a nasogastric tube (NGT) is crucial during surgery for decompressing the stomach and improve abdominal organ visibility. Traditional method of inserting NGT in the intubated, anesthetized patients is challenging and can cause complications like coiling or mucosal bleeding after several attempts. Thus, various modifications to the conventional method have been developed. The aim of this study was to observe and compare the various modified NGT insertion techniques to the standard approach in terms of first attempt success rate, number of attempts, procedure time, and adverse events. Materials and Methods A total of 239 patients scheduled for surgeries under general anaesthesia requiring NGT insertion were enrolled in the study to observe and compare the various modified techniques of NGT insertion in a tertiary care hospital. The total number of attempts for inserting successful NGT, total time taken and adverse events were observed. Results We observed five different modified techniques of NGT insertion which showed greater success rate, decreased complications and the time taken was also less in comparison to the conventional method. Conclusion NGT insertion technique varies from person to person, but has to be tailored as per the individual’s requirement. Patients who are obese with BMI >30 and Mallampati classification 3 and 4 may require more than one attempt or a different technique while inserting the Nasogastric tube. Studying various NGT insertion methods in intubated and anesthetized patients enhances clinical practice and literature. Knowledge of techniques with high success rates and fewer complications can help clinicians perform them more routinely.

                Background The aging population worldwide has led to increased attention toward ensuring a good quality of life (QoL) among the elderly, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities. This study aims to identify the determinants of quality of life among elderly residents in a social care center in West Jakarta. Method This quantitative study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design involving 288 elderly residents from a social care center. Data were collected using structured questionnaires measuring sleep behavior, medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, physical activity, and QoL. Results The results indicated that sleep behavior was significantly associated with QoL (p = 0.002), whereas no statistically significant associations were found between QoL and other variables, including medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, and physical activity. Conclusion Sleep quality is a significant determinant of QoL among institutionalized elderly individuals. These findings suggest that sleep behavior should be prioritized in care strategies to improve the quality of life of elderly residents in long-term care.

                Background Placental syndromes—encompassing pregnancy loss, preterm birth, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preeclampsia—have been strongly linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses at the maternal–fetal interface. This study aims to explore the potential of peptides derived from the coelomic fluid of Echinometra lucunter targeting the inflammatory cytokines involved in placental syndromes using in silico approaches. Methods The 3D molecular structure of peptides was modeled using the UCSF Chimera application. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADMET) properties were analysed using SwissADME and the ProTox web server. The PerMM web server was used to estimate membrane permeability. Crystal structures of target proteins—including c-Met, Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), and TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL)—were obtained from the Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj). Molecular docking and structural visualization were conducted using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software, while molecular dynamics simulations were subsequently performed using the YASARA Dynamics software to assess the stability and conformational behavior of the ligand-receptor complexes. Results Peptide A was selected based on favorable ADMET properties. Molecular docking results revealed that Peptide A exhibits low binding affinities toward pro-inflammatory mediators, including TRAIL (–10.02 kcal/mol), MIF (–9.32 kcal/mol), IL-1β (–8.29 kcal/mol), and PDGF (–10.44 kcal/mol). Furthermore, Peptide A showed potential agonistic interactions with IL-10 (–10.26 kcal/mol) and c-Met (–9.27 kcal/mol), indicating a possible role in restoring anti-inflammatory and angiogenic signaling. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the stability of the peptide–receptor complexes. Conclusions Peptide A holds promise as a dual-function therapeutic agent in placental syndromes. However, experimental validation is necessary to confirm its biological efficacy and safety.

<p>The biodistribution of DiR-PgP and the therapeutic efficacy of Rm-PgP after intrathecal administration was investigated in a rat moderate thoracic contusion SCI model. Intrathecal administration of DiR-PgP showed CNS-specific retention without peripheral distribution. Intrathecal administration of Rm-PgP enhanced tissue sparing, increased pCREB/CREB ratio, and reduced inflammation and apoptosis, demonstrating PgP's potential for sustained CNS drug delivery and neuroprotection after SCI.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers complex secondary injury mechanisms, resulting in long-term impacts on sensory and motor function. Rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has shown promise in preserving/restoring cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to reduce secondary injury responses, but its clinical application is hindered by poor solubility and systemic side effects. To overcome these challenges, we developed rolipram-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-graft-polyethylenimine (PgP) nanoparticles (Rm-PgP) to enable localized and sustained drug delivery. In our previous findings, Rm-PgP administered via intraspinal injection restored cAMP levels at the lesion site, and reduced secondary injury after moderate, contusive SCI. In this study, we investigated the effect of single and repeat administration of Rm-PgP by the clinically relevant intrathecal route immediately after injury. We observed that the hydrophobic dye, DiR-loaded PgP (DiR-PgP) was retained in the CNS over 7 days post-injury (DPI). In addition, we observed that both single and repeat Rm-PgP treatment groups showed higher cAMP levels compared to those in the untreated SCI group and only the single treatment group showed a significant difference compared to the untreated SCI group. Lastly, we observed that cAMP restoration in both single and repeat Rm-PgP treatment groups showed higher levels of activated cAMP-response element-binding protein (pCREB) relative to the untreated control. We also observed that both Rm-PgP treatment groups showed reduced inflammatory response, reduced astrogliosis and apoptosis, and increased neuronal survival and spared tissue volume. These findings highlight the neuroprotective efficacy of Rm-PgP by intrathecal administration in mitigating secondary injury during the critical early phase of recovery after SCI.</p>

                Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a unique state classically defined by brain activation and muscle paralysis. It is now recognized as a dynamic process involving coordinated oscillations and phasic behaviors, with substantial variations across development and species. Neural circuit studies have identified ever-expanding brain networks that regulate state generation and individual components of REM sleep. To account for this structured yet flexible nature, we propose a hierarchical circuit framework in which core REM sleep features are generated by brainstem nuclei, and adaptively tuned by hypothalamic, cortical, and neuromodulatory systems. From this component- and circuit-based perspective, we synthesize recent advances showing how theta oscillations and distributed forebrain circuits mediate REM sleep functions in memory, emotion, and cognition. We finally outline future research paths towards a more refined and integrative understanding of REM sleep.

                Sex-specific chemosensory behaviors arise from differences in how males and females detect and process environmental chemical cues, including pheromones, which drive sex-appropriate behaviors essential for reproduction across many species. This review compares neural circuits in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and rodents that generate sexually dimorphic pheromone responses, spanning peripheral detection, relay centers, and central integration. Recent connectomic and circuit-level analyses reveal how internal states modulate these pathways, adding an additional layer of context-dependent, sex-specific modulation. By synthesizing mechanisms across species, we highlight conserved principles and lineage-specific adaptations, offering an integrative framework for understanding how sex differences are embedded in chemosensory neural systems and setting the stage for future work on sexually dimorphic behaviors.

                Neurodegenerative diseases have long been considered distinct proteinopathies: amyloid-β and tau in Alzheimer’s disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, and TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This single-protein paradigm has guided therapeutic development for decades; yet clinical outcomes remain modest. Mounting evidence, however, reveals that protein aggregates rarely occur in isolation; instead, they coexist, colocalise, and modulate each other’s pathogenicity. Here, we propose a co-proteinopathy framework that views neurodegeneration as an interactive network of misfolded proteins rather than as isolated disorders. Adopting this framework demands multiplexed quantification of protein aggregates and disease models that better reflect the biological complexity of human neurodegeneration. The co-proteinopathy perspective offers a more realistic foundation for next-generation approaches to neurodegeneration research and treatment.

                Viral infections cause a wide range of neurocognitive disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms that give rise to acute and chronic cognitive deficits remain poorly understood. In this opinion article we review current knowledge on the close interactions between viruses and synapses from animal and human-based models, including how viral infections restructure synapses, disrupt synaptic transmission and neuromodulation, and interfere with synaptic plasticity, as well as how synapses contribute to viral dissemination. We further discuss how neuroimmune responses can both contribute to host defense and cause pathological damage to the nervous system that can lead to cognitive deficits. The emerging field of cognitive virology aims for expanded interdisciplinary studies to understand the molecular mechanisms by which viral infections lead to cognitive dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01277-X?rss=yes">REM sleep reduces subthreshold depolarization in cortical pyramidal neurons in a region-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Campelo et al. show that REM sleep induces region-specific changes in cortical excitability, with NMDARs playing a crucial role. Diazepam-induced sleep differs from natural sleep by disrupting normal inhibitory circuits, suggesting that hypnotic drugs may compromise sleep-dependent brain functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105864">High cognitive violation of expectations is compromised in cerebellar ataxia</a></h4>

              
                While traditionally considered a motor structure, the cerebellum is also involved in cognition. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms through which the cerebellum contributes to evolutionarily novel cognitive abilities remain poorly understood. Another open question is how this structure contributes to a core unifying mechanism across domains. Motivated by the evolutionary principle of neural reuse, we suggest that a successful account of cerebellar contributions to higher cognitive domains will build on the structure’s established role in motor behaviors. We conducted a series of neuropsychological experiments, assessing selective impairments in participants with cerebellar ataxia (CA) compared to neurotypicals in solving sequential discrete problems. In three experiments, participants were asked to solve symbolic subtraction, alphabet letter transformation, and novel artificial grammar problems, which were expected or unexpected. The CA group exhibited a disproportionate cost when comparing unexpected problems to expected problems, suggesting that the cerebellum is critical for violation of expectations (VE) across tasks. The CA group impairment was not found either when the complexity of the problem increased or in conditions of uncertainty. Together, these results demonstrate a possible causal role for the human cerebellum in higher cognitive abilities. VE might be a unifying cerebellar-dependent mechanism across motor and cognitive domains.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95168">Longitudinal awake imaging of mouse deep brain microvasculature with super-resolution ultrasound localization microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging imaging modality that resolves microvasculature in deep tissues with high spatial resolution. However, existing preclinical ULM applications are largely constrained to anesthetized animals, introducing confounding vascular effects such as vasodilation and altered hemodynamics. As such, ULM quantifications (e.g., vessel diameter, density, and flow velocity) may be confounded by the use of anesthesia, undermining the usefulness of ULM in practice. Here, we introduce a method to address this limitation and achieve ULM imaging in awake mouse brain. Pupillary monitoring was used to support the presence of the awake state during ULM imaging. Vasodilation induced by isoflurane was observed by ULM. Upon recovery to the awake state, reductions in vessel density and flow velocity were observed across different brain regions. In the cortex, the effects induced by isoflurane are more pronounced on venous flow than on arterial flow. In addition, serial in vivo imaging of the same animal brain at weekly intervals demonstrated the highly robust longitudinal imaging capability of the proposed technique. The consistency was further verified through quantitative analysis on individual vessels, cortical regions of arteries and veins, and subcortical regions. This study demonstrates longitudinal ULM imaging in the awake mouse brain, which is crucial for many ULM brain applications that require awake and behaving animals.

">War Trauma Impairs Prenatal Brain Development: Evidence from Genetically-Informed Brain Imaging</a></h4>

              
                The global rise in armed conflicts has raised concerns about their long-term consequences. While the immediate mental and physical impacts of war are well documented, the effects on unborn children of expecting mothers remain poorly understood. Using a large dataset (N = 37,856), we examine how in-utero exposure to World War II bombings influenced brain development and life outcomes decades later. Controlling for genetic and environmental factors, we find that exposure during the last trimester is associated with reduced grey matter volume, which mediates adverse effects on intelligence and obesity in adulthood. These findings reveal a potential causal pathway that links prenatal trauma to long-term neurodevelopmental and functional impairments, highlighting fetal vulnerability to war stressors and the importance of protecting expectant mothers during armed conflicts.

">Mini-Pcdh15b Gene Therapy Rescues Visual Deficits in a Zebrafish Model of Usher Syndrome Type 1F</a></h4>

              
                Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F) is a severe inherited disorder caused by mutations in PCDH15, resulting in congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and progressive retinal degeneration leading to blindness. While cochlear implantation can restore hearing, no therapeutic interventions currently exist for vision loss. Gene augmentation therapy represents a promising approach; however, the PCDH15 coding sequence (~5.3 kb) exceeds the packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. To overcome this limitation, we previously engineered shortened "mini-PCDH15" constructs that retain key structural and functional domains while fitting within a single AAV. Among these, the mini-PCDH15-V4 variant successfully restored hearing in Pcdh15-deficient mice. Here, we investigated the ability of a cone-targeted mini-pcdh15b-V4 transgene to rescue vision in a zebrafish model of USH1F. Untreated pcdh15b-deficient zebrafish exhibited severe structural and functional defects of the retina, including disorganized and shortened photoreceptor outer segments, disrupted calyceal processes, and markedly reduced electroretinogram (ERG) and optokinetic response (OKR) performance. Targeted expression of mini-pcdh15b-V4 recapitulated typical localization of Pcdh15b to calyceal processes and outer segment membranes, rescued photoreceptor architecture, and re-established both structural organization and functional output. Treated mutants exhibited improved visual tracking behavior and full recovery of ERG a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, indicating restoration of photoreceptor and synaptic function. Importantly, mini-pcdh15b-V4 expression produced no adverse effects in wild-type or heterozygous fish, supporting the safety of cone-specific expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that mini-pcdh15b-V4 can restore both photoreceptor structure and visual function in pcdh15b-deficient zebrafish. This work establishes the pcdh15b mutant zebrafish as a powerful preclinical model for studying USH1F retinopathy and supports the translational potential of rationally engineered mini-PCDH15 constructs as a feasible gene therapy approach for preventing or reversing vision loss in individuals with USH1F.

">S-Equol: A Novel Therapeutic For HIV-1-Associated Gastrointestinal Dysbiosis</a></h4>

              
                HIV-1 infection affects approximately 38.4 million people around the world. The advent of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly improved the quality of life of infected individuals; however, roughly 50% of these individuals will still experience HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Additionally, the gastrointestinal microbiome has been reported to be dysbiotic in HIV-1 infected individuals, regardless of adherence to cART. Current research has pointed to the gut-brain-microbiota axis as a potential target to treat both cognitive deficits and microbial changes. The present study investigated S-Equol (SE) as a potential therapeutic for HAND by modulating the gastrointestinal microbiome. The study included 21 HIV-1 Tg rats and 21 F344 control animals to test the effect 0.2mg SE has on cocaine-maintained responding on a PR schedule of reinforcement. Gastrointestinal microbiome alterations between genotypes were found at the phylum and genus level, regardless of treatment group, and SE treatment had both main effects and interactions with genotype. Prevotella_UCG_001 was significantly associated with lever presses for drug, suggesting an effect on motivation for cocaine. Alloprevotella was found to significantly differentiate between genotype by treatment effects, indicating that SE differently affects genotypes.

">A Reference Atlas of the Human Dorsal Root Ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory perception largely emerges from diverse peripheral sensory neurons whose cell bodies reside in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Damage or dysfunction of DRG neurons is a major cause of chronic pain and sensory loss. In mice, deep single-cell transcriptomic profiling and genetically defined models have offered important clues into DRG function, but in humans, the cellular and molecular landscape of DRG neurons remains less understood. Here, we constructed a reference cell atlas of the human DRG by profiling transcriptomes of cells and nuclei from 126 donors sampled across cervical, thoracic, and lumbar DRGs. This atlas resolves 22 neuronal subtypes, including known and previously unrecognized subtypes linked to nociception, mechanosensation, thermosensation, and proprioception, as well as 10 types of non-neuronal cells. Cross-species integration, spatial transcriptomics, and microneurography enabled cell-type-specific comparisons of soma size and conduction velocity between species. Human DRG somata are larger across all cell types than their mouse counterparts, and the conduction velocities of human hair follicle innervating A-fibers are faster than in mice, suggesting a functional shift in rapid mechanical detection in humans. This integrated human DRG reference cell atlas provides a resource for exploring new molecular and physiological features of human DRG, which could help identify new strategies for treating chronic pain and other diseases of the peripheral nervous system.

">Two cortical mechanisms of audiovisual processing in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the human brain processes naturalistic audiovisual information remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. Progress has been limited, however, by the difficulty of modeling complex audiovisual feature spaces - most prior work has therefore relied on short, controlled stimuli, or on stimuli from one modality at a time, leaving cortical mechanisms that support real-world comprehension poorly characterized. Further, while recent advances in artificial intelligence now enable the extraction of high-dimensional, time-resolved features from naturalistic stimuli, how cortical regions dynamically process auditory and visual information as time unfolds remains largely unexplored. Using large-scale fMRI data collected while participants watched movies, we developed two complementary computational approaches relying on prediction performance to map the moment-by-moment dynamics of sensory processing across cortical regions: one tracks when one modality predicts a region's activity substantially better than the other, capturing temporal transitions in modality dominance, while the other identifies periods when both modalities predict the region well, indicating balanced representation of auditory and visual information. Together, these analyses reveal two complementary patterns of audiovisual organization across cortex: a pair of "bows" of modality switching - one posterior bow encircling category-selective visual cortex and another anterior bow spanning dorso-lateral frontal areas, and an arrow-like axis of bimodally predicted regions extending from lateral occipital cortex into the temporal cortex. The coexistence of these systems points to a cortical architecture that flexibly reweights sensory inputs while maintaining balanced multimodal representations, supporting robust comprehension of complex natural events. More broadly, this work illustrates how naturalistic neuroimaging experiments informed by modern machine learning approaches can reveal new principles of dynamic audiovisual processing in the human brain.

">Maternal care modulates chloride cotransporter development during inhibitory circuit maturation in the piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                Early postnatal development is a sensitive period for inhibitory circuit maturation, marked by a shift in GABAergic signaling from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing actions. This transition depends on chloride homeostasis, which is regulated by the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1). While these cotransporters are known to drive inhibitory development, little is understood about how early caregiving experience influences their trajectories in brain regions critical for attachment learning. Here, we examined the developmental profiles of KCC2 and NKCC1 in the piriform cortex of male and female rats from postnatal (P) day 5 to 22 and assessed their sensitivity to altered maternal care using the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm from P2 to P9. Both transporters progressively increased protein levels toward adult-like levels, with sex-specific regulation observed at the mRNA level. At P15, LBN reduced KCC2 and NKCC1 protein levels in a region- and sex- dependent manner. To evaluate the functional consequences of these changes at the neural level, we implemented a Hodgkin-Huxley computational model with dynamic ion concentration parameters, which were parameterized using our experimental data. Simulation revealed that cotransporter profiles induced by LBN altered the chloride equilibrium, changing the impact of GABAergic input on neuronal excitability. This integrative approach offers a mechanistic insight into how early caregiving experiences affect chloride transporter regulation, with consequences for synaptic signaling and neuronal activity, ultimately contributing to the development of inhibitory circuits.

">A spatial transcriptomic atlas of autism-associated genes identifies convergence in the developing human thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition that manifests across a wide phenotypic spectrum. Rare and de novo loss-of-function mutations strongly predispose to autism and co-occurring developmental and intellectual disabilities in over 10% of autistic individuals. Understanding whether these variants converge on specific regional brain circuits or widely alter human brain development is crucial to understanding the etiology of profound autism. To date, transcriptomic atlases have mainly implicated the developing cerebral cortex, yet other brain areas have received relatively little attention. Here, we present a single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of 250 autism susceptibility genes during human brain development. Profiling over 10 million cells across the midgestation forebrain, we found convergence of these genes across a small number of regional programs. The developing thalamus showed the most prevalent expression of autism susceptibility genes, followed by germinal zones throughout the brain. Within the thalamus, excitatory neurons showed the most enriched expression, which varied across thalamic nuclei harboring distinct circuits. Across the germinal zones, neural progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminences that generate parvalbumin- and somatostanin-positive interneurons showed highest expression. Our findings reveal the prevalent expression of autism associated genes beyond the developing cerebral cortex and implicate the developing human thalamus as a major hub of autism susceptibility.

">The Icelandic mutation APPA673T on amyloid-β plaque burden in the 5xFAD Alzheimer model</a></h4>

              
                The protective Icelandic mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, APPA673T, identified in Icelandic and other Nordic populations is associated with a significantly lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conflicting results have been reported for the APPA673T mutation in various knock-in models of AD, but its effect in 5x familial AD (5xFAD) mice has never been investigated. We have crossed C57Bl6/J mice expressing a single point mutation edited into the murine APP gene via CRISPR-Cas gene editing, termed APPA673T, with 5xFAD mice that overexpress human APP carrying the Swedish (K670N/M671L), Florida (I716V), and London (V717I) mutations as well as human presenilin-1 (PS1) with two mutations (M146L and L286V); the resulting mice were termed 5xFADxAPPA673T. We have investigated amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) pathology in 5xFADxAPPA673T, 5xFAD and their respective controls, APPA673T and C57Bl6/J wild types at 6-months of age using immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and ELISAs. We found a moderate yet significant reduction for A{beta} plaque size in male 5xFADxAPPA673T compared to 5xFAD. No differences were observed for soluble/insoluble A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 levels per se, but lower plaque count/area was found in 5xFADxAPPA673T when A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratios were low, suggesting a genotype-dependent sensitivity to A{beta} aggregation and accumulation. Therefore, the APPA673T mutation has the potential to modify A{beta} pathology in 5xFAD mice at the age of 6 months.

">Continuous Flash Suppression responses in mouse visual cortex: stimulus laterality and anesthesia effects</a></h4>

              
                We investigated whether binocularly conflicting stimuli adapted from primate binocular rivalry studies could induce binocular response suppression in mouse visual cortex. We presented binocularly conflicting stimuli adapted from the paradigm of continuous flash suppression to awake and anesthetized mice and examined neuronal responses in visual areas V1 and LM. Neurons often showed a preference for the left or right eye where a monocular grating was presented, and their responses were modulated by presenting a conflicting flashing Mondrian stimulus to the other eye. The direction of this modulation depended on whether neurons preferentially responded to contralateral or ipsilateral gratings. Responses of cells with a preference for ipsilateral gratings were suppressed during binocular conflict, while contralateral-preferring cells were less suppressed or even enhanced by binocular conflict. Binocular conflict modulation continued to occur under anesthesia, but response recovery after intermittent binocular conflict only occurred in awake mice. Responses to Mondrians were modulated by binocular conflict in a similar fashion as those to grating stimuli, which suggests that mouse binocular conflict processing exhibits a distinctive dependency on stimulus laterality over other stimulus features. Finally, a canonical binocular rivalry model could be successfully fitted to our data but lacked sufficient competitive inhibition and adaptation strength to create oscillatory activity under binocular conflict.

">Resolving Heterogeneity in Major Depression: Overcoupling and Undercoupling Subtypes Exhibit Differential Treatment Response and Molecular Pathways</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibits significant heterogeneity whose neurobiological mechanisms remain elusive. Alterations in morphological-functional coupling (MFC) have been observed in MDD. This study aims to investigate MDD subtypes based on MFC alterations and their associations with clinical symptoms and molecular basis. We identified two clinically distinct MDD subtypes in multi-center neuroimaging data (Discovery: 828 MDD/776 healthy controls; Validation: 236 MDD/86 healthy controls) by using a semi-supervised machine learning approach based on MFC changes, which were validated and robustly repeated in the validation dataset. Differences among subtypes were then examined in relation to clinical assessments, gene expression patterns, neurotransmitter and cell density, and treatment response. Subtype I (overcoupling) showed elevated MFC in high-order association cortices, linking to synaptic transmission activity and severe symptoms. Subtype II (undercoupling) demonstrated reduced MFC in primary cortices, associated with cell cycle regulation and treatment resistance. Both subtypes shared molecular signatures (cell types: astrocytes and oligodendrocytes; neurotransmitter systems: serotonergic and GABAergic receptors). Crucially, longitudinal data (33 MDD undergoing Escitalopram monotherapy) revealed that undercoupling subtype exhibited better response, implying a potential mechanism of the drug via increasing the MFC. Our work deciphers MFC-driven MDD phenotypes with distinct molecular profiles and differential treatment outcomes, suggesting potential pathways for personalized diagnosis and treatment strategies in MDD, advancing precision psychiatry.

">Estrogen Dependent Variation in the Contributions of TRPM4 and TRPM5 to Fat Taste</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in physiology have garnered significant interest of late; however, comparatively little is known about the effects of sex on the function of the peripheral taste system. Previously, we have shown that fat taste functions in a sexually dimorphic manner using molecular, cellular, and behavioral assays, and that a subtype of estrogen receptor (ER) proteins are highly expressed in Type II (receptor) cells. The underlying mechanisms of estrogen's action, though, remain unknown. Here, we sought to better understand estrogen's role in fat taste transduction at the molecular level by initially focusing on the transient receptor potential channels types M4 (Trpm4) and M5 (Trpm5), which we have shown to play roles in estrogen-sensitive fatty acid signaling in taste cells. That is, using Trpm5-deficient mice, both males and females in the estrus phase showed significantly reduced FA responses, whereas females in the proestrus phase did not, suggesting that there may be E2-dependent TRPM5-independent FA signaling in Type II cells. During periods of high levels of circulating estrogen, there was no significant difference in cellular responses to fatty acid (FA) stimuli between Trpm5-/- mice and their wild-type counterparts. Moreover, supplemental estradiol enhanced linoleic acid (LA)-induced TRPM5-mediated taste cell activation. Finally, while Type II cells depend on TRPM4 and TRPM5 for FA taste cell activation, proestrus (high estrogen) females showed a greater dependence on a TRPM5-independent pathway for fatty acid responsiveness. Together, these results underscore the substantial regulatory role of estrogen in the taste system, particularly for fatty acid signaling. Given that the taste system guides food preferences and intake, these findings may have important implications for understanding sex-specific differences in diet and, ultimately, metabolic health.

">The individual brain: mapping variability in hemispheric functional organization across cognitive domains in a representative sample</a></h4>

              
                Several core cognitive networks in the human brain show marked left-right differences in their functional organization. While these asymmetries are well described at the level of individual functions, overarching patterns of variability in hemispheric functional organization across multiple domains have not been mapped in a representative sample. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale neuroimaging study with 200 participants (100 left-handers and 100 right-handers) to map hemispheric phenotypes across four distinct cognitive domains: language, tool use, spatial attention, and face perception. We challenge the traditional one-size-fits-all view of hemispheric organization by showing that deviations from the typical pattern of functional segregation are more prevalent than generally assumed, in both left- and right-handers. As predicted, variation in asymmetry was more pronounced in the left-handed sample. Critically, we found no evidence that the prototypical, textbook, pattern of brain organization confers any advantage in general cognitive ability or IQ. These results challenge the assumption of a single optimal brain organization and demonstrate that hemispheric functional segregation in humans is much more variable than anticipated.

">Eye Movement-Related Eardrum Oscillations (EMREOs) Do Not Have a Direct Impact on Auditory Spatial Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                Eye-movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs) are acoustic signals recorded in the ear that are thought to reflect displacements of the tympanic membrane induced by saccadic eye movements. Speculations hold that their underlying mechanisms play a role in aligning visual and acoustic signals. Yet whether and how the eardrum moves during an EMREO remains unclear. Starting from the assumption that the EMREO signal directly reflects eardrum movements, we probed human sound lateralization performance for sounds presented at different times during a saccade, hence the EMREO. Since the EMREO generation involves the two middle ear muscles, whose tension can alter sound transmission, we expected spatial sound discrimination performance to vary with the state of the ERMEO at the time of sound presentation. We contrasted perceptual sensitivity, bias, and reaction times for targets presented during either positive/negative or during small/large EMREO deflections in two tasks, one relying on free-field sounds and one presenting sounds in-ear. However, no analysis revealed any significant effect. Still, and in line with previous studies, we found that sound localization performance was dependent on the congruency of saccade and acoustic target directions. We conclude that either the eardrum does not move as directly reflected by the EMREO signal, or it does so, but the underlying changes at the tympanic membrane only have minimal perceptual impact. These results call for more refined studies to understand how the eardrum moves during a saccade and whether or how the EMREO impacts auditory or multisensory perception.

">A system for 3D reconstruction of mouse behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Recent development in machine vision has enabled researchers unprecedented resolution in measuring behaviour in freely moving animals. However, the hardware implementation of a behavioural arena for capturing 3D behaviours remains time consuming and unstandardised. Here we first provide detailed instructions on how to build and calibrate such a system. Secondly, we provide instructions on how to process video data to obtain a 3D reconstruction of mouse behaviour. Finally, we provide results from behavioural tests in which 3D reconstruction enables clear-cut separation of behavioural responses to distinct sensory stimuli.

">Fibrin-containing Hydrogels Regulate Human Astrocyte State and Neuronal Reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are key components in reactive gliosis after brain injury, yet defined in vitro models dissecting the influence of extracellular matrix (ECM) components enriched after injury, such as fibrin, on human astrocyte behaviour and function are still missing. Here, we use fibrinogen-derived fibrin and fibrin-alginate-RGD (FAR) 3D hydrogel substrates to examine the influence on human iPSC-derived astrocyte behaviour and their direct conversion into neurons. Astrocytes develop complex morphologies in 3D-FAR hydrogels while are more proliferative and migratory in 3D-Fibrin. Interestingly, gene expression profile analysis revealed different reactive states of astrocytes in 3D-Fibrin and 3D-FAR, which persist over time. The highly inflammatory state in 3D-FAR is largely incompatible with direct neuronal reprogramming hampering the direct conversion even at early stages. Conversely, astrocytes in 3D-Fibrin hydrogels can readily convert into neurons, demonstrating a potent influence of how fibrin is presented on eliciting distinct astrocyte states with great relevance for fate conversion.

">Immature olfactory sensory neurons provide complementary input in the healthy olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                Adult neurogenesis of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the rodent olfactory system provides the unique opportunity to understand how new neurons functionally integrate into existing circuitry and contribute to behaviors. Immature OSNs express odorant receptors (ORs), form dendritic knobs with short cilia, and project their axons into the olfactory bulb (OB) where they form functional synapses. Furthermore, immature OSNs respond selectively to odorants and exhibit graded responses in a higher concentration range than mature OSNs, suggesting that they provide a distinct odor input stream. Finally, in mice that lack mature OSNs, sensory input from immature OSNs is sufficient to mediate odor detection and discrimination behavior. What remains unknown, however, is how these immature OSNs contribute to odor-guided behavior in the healthy, intact olfactory system. Here we show, using male and female mice, that chemogenetically silencing immature OSNs impairs odor detection ability without affecting their odor discrimination ability. Furthermore, immature OSN silencing reduces the amplitude of odor-evoked dendritic calcium responses of OB neurons in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that immature OSNs provide distinct odor input that complements mature OSN input to contribute to odor-guided behaviors in the healthy, intact olfactory system.

">Rhythmic light stimulation elicits multiple concurrent neural responses that separably shape human perception</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic light stimulation offers solutions to innumerable cognitive and neurological disorders. However, like any neuromodulatory technique, responses to rhythmic light stimulation are highly variable, producing challenges in replicating lab-based studies and translating findings to the clinic. Across three MEG/EEG experiments, we show that this variability can, in part, be attributed to rhythmic light stimulation eliciting multiple, coexisting neural responses which have separable impacts on cognition. Specifically, we find that rhythmic light stimulation produces distinct neural responses at the fundamental (f) and second harmonic (2f) frequencies, and that these responses are differentially shaped by endogenous oscillatory dynamics that vary across participants. Importantly, these responses separably contribute to perception, with harmonic gamma-band responses supporting the representation of stimulus-specific information, and the phase of harmonic alpha-band responses causally contributing to near-threshold visual perception. We reproduce these effects across datasets, paradigms, and oscillatory bands, suggesting that the multiplex oscillatory responses elicited by rhythmic light stimulation are a robust and pervasive phenomenon. We propose that the complexity of neural responses to rhythmic stimulation can explain why there is substantial variability between studies using these techniques, and that understanding these complex responses may help advance neuromodulatory technologies for both fundamental and clinical neuroscience.

">Early Sleep-Dependent Sensory Gating in the Olfactory System</a></h4>

              
                Disconnection from the external world is a defining feature of sleep. Although most models attribute sensory gating to thalamocortical mechanisms, the olfactory system-bypassing the thalamus-offers a unique window into earlier stages of sensory disconnection. Here, we combine chronic and acute recordings in rodents to test whether nasal sensory inputs are internalized during sleep. We show that respiration-locked potentials and gamma activity in the olfactory bulb are strongly modulated by brain state: they diminish during sleep and reappear during wakefulness and cortical activation. This gating occurs independently of respiratory dynamics and arises near the first synapse of the olfactory pathway. Finally, we find that neocortical slow-wave activity correlates with reduced olfactory entrainment, with coupling progressively vanishing as sleep deepens. These findings reveal a sleep-dependent sensory gating mechanism at early stages of a non-thalamic pathway, providing new insights into the neural substrates of sensory disconnection during sleep.

">Embodied Navigation: whole-body movement drives path integration in large-scale free-walking virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                Human navigation relies on combining body cues (vestibular and proprioceptive signals) with visual cues such as optic flow. The weighting and integration of these signals during the continuous tracking of walked distances and angles, known as path integration, remain poorly understood. Previous path integration studies have been limited to small spaces (<150 m2) and the influence of complex environments on cue weighting of body and vision cues is still unclear. Here, we conducted the largest-environment free-walking virtual reality navigation study to date in a 45x25 m facility (1,215 m2) using triangle completion tasks in naturalistic environments. We systematically manipulated sensory input across three conditions: natural active walking (full sensory integration), active joystick control (visual cues only), and blindfolded active walking (body cues only). Participants navigated through both sparse fallow land without trees and more complex forest environments with 400 trees. We embedded performance data in a Bayesian cue combination model to analyse the underlying combination mechanism. Our results provide evidence that most participants substantially favour body cues over visual cues in a non-Bayesian combination process, with considerable inter-individual variance in cue dominance strength and side biases. While transitioning from fallow land to forests reduced directional variance, weighting of body and visual information remained constant. These findings advance our understanding of human spatial navigation by demonstrating that body-based cues dominate path integration even in visually rich, large-scale environments, challenging assumptions about optimal Bayesian cue integration in human navigation.

">A switch in arousal circuit architecture shapes sleep across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a continuous behavior across the lifespan, yet its features and functions evolve markedly with development. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in mammals, early life sleep differs from mature sleep, but it is unknown whether disparate sleep regulatory mechanisms underlie these changes. Here, we identify distinct populations of octopaminergic (OA) neurons that promote arousal in larval and adult flies, thus revealing a developmental switch in sleep-wake circuit architecture. Of eight OA neurons present in the sub-esophageal zone (SEZ) of the nervous system at both life stages, dedicated, non-overlapping subsets drive arousal in larvae versus adults. Morphologic and connectomic analyses show that larval OA arousal neurons project primarily to the ventral nerve cord and lack substantial sensory input, suggesting a circuit logic optimized for internally driven arousal during early development. In contrast, adult OA arousal neurons target higher brain regions involved in cognition and receive rich multimodal sensory input, supporting wakefulness in response to environmental cues. These findings highlight a developmental transition in arousal circuitry that mirrors changing ecological demands, with juvenile systems organized to prioritize growth and feeding, insulated from sensory disturbance, and mature systems supporting sensory-guided behavior. Our results support a model of sleep regulation as a developmentally dynamic process, in which shared neuromodulators like OA operate through distinct cellular substrates tailored to life stage-specific behavioral priorities.

">VTA dopamine neuron activity produces spatially organized value representations</a></h4>

              
                How does the activity of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons reinforce actions? A prominent hypothesis is that the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons instructs representations of predicted reward, or value, in downstream neurons1. To directly test this model, we performed comprehensive striatal recordings in mice engaged in a trial-and-error probabilistic learning task where they continuously adapted their choices to obtain a reward of optogenetic stimulation of VTA DA neurons (paired with an auditory cue). We then assessed neural representations of action values (estimated from a behavioral model), revealing for the first time that VTA DA stimulation is sufficient to generate downstream neural correlates of action value. Surprisingly, these value correlates were strongest in the intermediate caudoputamen (CP) and weakest in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), despite NAc being the major projection target of VTA DA neurons2,3. This was true not only for the value of each choice, but also for state value (reward expectation) and relative value (the decision variable). However, value representations were differentially organized within the intermediate CP, with ventromedial domains (which receive inputs from orbitofrontal cortex) preferentially encoding state value and dorsolateral domains (which receive inputs from motor cortex) preferentially encoding relative value. A difference in learning rate for the value computation between NAc and CP did not explain the relatively weak value correlates in NAc. Instead, we found that VTA DA stimulation was sufficient to produce learned neural responses to the stimulation-paired auditory cue throughout the striatum, including in the NAc, and that animals work for this cue rather than for VTA DA stimulation itself. Overall, this suggests that VTA DA neurons support trial-and-error learning indirectly, by making stimuli valuable ('conditioned reinforcers'), which in turn support the generation of action value representations in the CP.

">Unconscious switching of dorsal and medial pathways for plasticity and stability during NREM and REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                While visual perceptual learning improves during non-REM sleep and stabilizes during REM sleep via excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmitter (E/I) balance in early visual areas (EVA), the role of prefrontal regions remains unclear. Here, we show that contributions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) differ by sleep stage in human adults. During non-REM sleep, plasticity increased in DLPFC, indexed by elevated E/I balance measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and polysomnography, in correlation with performance gains. During REM sleep, stability increased in mPFC, indexed by reduced E/I balance, in correlation with resilience to retrograde interference from new learning. E/I balance changes and their effects on learning paralleled those in EVA. Connectivity weights between EVA and DLPFC, and between EVA and mPFC, switched with sleep stage. These findings suggest the presence of dorsal and medial pathways that unconsciously alternate between non-REM sleep and REM sleep to improve and stabilize learning.

">Mitochondrial bioenergetic signatures differentiate asymptomatic from symptomatic Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AsymAD) refers to individuals who, despite exhibiting amyloid-b plaques and tau pathology comparable to Alzheimer's disease (AD), maintain cognitive performance similar to cognitively normal individuals. The resilience mechanism in these AsymAD individual remains understudied. We performed a systematic analysis comparing AsymAD and AD across multiple cohorts (ROSMAP, Banner and Mount Sinai), brain regions (BA6, BA9, BA36 and BA37) and neuronal and glial cell types using proteomics and transcriptomics data. AsymAD brains exhibited preserved mitochondrial bioenergetics, characterized by enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), electron transport chain (ETC) activity, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) utilization. Pathways regulating mitochondrial complex biogenesis and calcium homeostasis were also upregulated. Key mitochondrial proteins such as MRPL47, CPT2, BCAT2, and IDH2, were consistently upregulated in AsymAD, whereas MACROD1 was downregulated. At the cellular level, excitatory neurons, including superficial, mid-layer, and deep-layer subtypes, exhibited the most preserved mitochondrial function, whereas vulnerable inhibitory subtypes, including PVALB and SST neurons, showed increased cellular abundance and bioenergetic activity. In contrast, microglia and oligodendrocytes proportions were reduced in AsymAD relative to AD. Our findings identify preserved mitochondrial bioenergetics as a defining feature of resilience in AD and suggest that enhancing NADH metabolism via NAD+ precursor-based interventions may potentially help in maintaining cognitive function despite amyloid and tau pathology.

">Methodological choices strongly modulate the sensitivity and specificity of lesion-symptom mapping analyses</a></h4>

              
                Lesion mapping results can vary substantially as a function of specific analysis parameters, but the extent to which individual methodological choices interact to modulate the sensitivity and specificity of results is not clear. Here, we employed a large-scale simulation approach to inform practical recommendations for lesion symptom mapping studies. Routine clinical imaging from 959 stroke survivors (mean age = 72.5, 49.3% female) was used to conduct 384,780 lesion mapping analyses based on simulated behavioural data. Each simulated analysis used different combinations of plausible sample inclusion criteria, analysis parameters (e.g., correction factors), analysis types (e.g., univariate vs. multivariate), and underlying target correlates. Simulated analysis accuracy (Dice similarity coefficient and percent coverage of target correlates) was compared across designs.Overall, analysis accuracy varied widely and was substantially modulated by the specific design used. Analyses that maximised lesion coverage by including large and diverse samples reliably outperformed analyses using more restricted samples. Analyses using direct total lesion volume controls outperformed analyses using other (or no) volume corrections across all accuracy measures. False discovery rate corrections yielded the best performance in terms of target coverage, while permutation corrections yielded the best Dice coefficients. While multivariate approaches were more accurate than univariate analyses in terms of Dice coefficient, univariate analyses generated higher target hit rates and percent target coverage.These results identify specific analysis designs suitable for studies aiming to maximise their sensitivity and/or specificity to underlying critical correlates, while highlighting the inferential strengths and weaknesses of these complementary approaches.

">Environmental Noise Alters Neural Regulation Without Behavioral Impairment: A Pilot EEG Study</a></h4>

              
                Environmental factors can profoundly influence cognitive performance and well-being in the workplace. Exposure to environmental noise is a potent stressor that elevates arousal and impairs attention, whereas natural elements are associated with stress reduction and cognitive restoration. In this pilot study, we examined whether natural soundscapes could buffer the neural effects of noise exposure. Eleven healthy adults performed five cognitive tasks, Stroop, N-back, Go/No-Go, Dot-Probe, and Visual Search, under three auditory conditions: Noise (simulated urban traffic), Nature (ambient natural sounds), and Control (silence with earplugs). Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) captured oscillatory activity, and participants provided self-reports of mood, stress, and lifestyle habits. Behavioral accuracy and reaction time did not differ significantly across environments (all p > 0.10), indicating preserved overt performance. However, EEG revealed clear environment-dependent modulation. Relative to Control, the Noise condition produced a marked shift toward beta-dominant activity in midline cortex: mixed-effects models showed higher /{beta} ratios over central (t=3.8, cluster-corrected p<0.01) and centroparietal (t=4.6, p<0.01) regions, reflecting reduced posterior  power and a sustained-alertness profile. In contrast, Nature exposure preserved posterior  regulation while easing cognitive-load markers, {theta}/ ratios fell in bilateral temporal cortex (t=-3.2, p<0.05), {theta}/{beta} ratios dropped across frontocentral and temporal networks (t=-3.6 to -7.4, p<0.01), and the engagement index rose in the same territories (t=-3.6 to -7.3, p<0.001), consistent with greater intrinsic engagement and lower self-reported stress during the nature soundscape. Although behavioral performance remained stable, EEG data revealed distinct neural costs of noise exposure and a protective effect of natural soundscapes. These findings suggest that traditional task metrics may underestimate cognitive strain, and that biophilic auditory environments could help sustain neural efficiency and resilience in demanding work settings.

">Low rank adaptation of chemical foundation models generate effective odorant representations</a></h4>

              
                Featurizing odorants to enable robust prediction of their properties is difficult due to the complex activation patterns that odorants evoke in the olfactory system. Structurally similar odorants can elicit distinct activation patterns in both the sensory periphery (i.e., at the receptor level) and downstream brain circuits (i.e., at a perceptual level). Despite efforts to design or discover features for odorants to better predict how they activate the olfactory system, we lack a universally accepted way to featurize odorants. In this work, we demonstrate that feature-based approaches that rely on pre-trained foundation models do not significantly outperform classical hand-designed features, but that targeted foundation model fine-turning can increase model performance beyond these limits. To show this, we introduce a new model that creates olfaction-specific representations: LoRA-based Odorant-Receptor Affinity prediction with CROSS-attention (LORAX). We compare existing chemical foundation model representations to hand-designed physicochemical descriptors using feature-based methods and identify large information overlap between these representations, highlighting the necessity of fine-tuning to generate novel and superior odorant representations. We show that LORAX produces a feature space more closely aligned with olfactory neural representation, enabling it to outperform existing models on predictive tasks.

">Distinct involvements of the subthalamic nucleus subpopulations in reward-biased decision-making in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a part of the indirect and hyperdirect pathways in the basal ganglia (BG) and has been implicated in movement control, impulsivity, and decision-making. We recently demonstrated that, for perceptual decisions, the STN includes at least three subpopulations of neurons with different decision-related activity patterns (Branam et al., 2024). Here we show that, for decisions that require both perceptual and reward-based processing, many STN neurons are sensitive to both sensory evidence and reward expectations. Within a drift-diffusion framework, STN subpopulations show different relationships to model components reflecting formation of the decision variable, dynamics of the decision bound, and non-decision-related processes. The subpopulations also differ in their representations of quantities related to decision evaluation, including choice accuracy and reward expectation. These results suggest that the STN plays multiple roles in decision formation and evaluation to guide complex decisions that combine multiple sources of information.

">Mapping brain volume changes in the zQ175DN mouse model of Huntington's disease: a longitudinal MRI study</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor and cognitive abilities, as well as exhibiting psychiatric manifestations. Studies in people with HD (PwHD) consistently report atrophy of the caudate and putamen as an early pathological event and is therefore considered an early biomarker. Investigating whether similar phenotypic features are apparent in rodent HD models is important since it could have translational potential in evaluating the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies. We used high-resolution anatomical images to longitudinally investigate brain morphology in the zQ175DN heterozygous mouse model (HET) and wildtype littermates (WT) at 3, 6, and 10 months of age (M), which reflect different stages of phenotypic progression. We investigated volumetric alterations using semi-automatic segmentations of HD on relevant regions-of-interest (striatum, cerebellum, corpus callosum, cerebral cortex, ventricles, and total brain volume) and whole brain voxel-wise Tensor Based Morphometry (TBM) analysis. The striatum showed the earliest progressive lower absolute volume in HET mice compared to WT, starting from 3M, followed by lower absolute volume of cortex and corpus callosum concomitantly at 6 and 10M. TBM highlighted lower relative local volume in the rostral-medial striatum at all ages, and in cerebral cortex in HET mice at 6 and 10M. A bigger relative local volume in the cerebellum was observed at all ages in HET mice, and in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, at 6 and 10M. Overall, this study revealed key structural abnormalities that resemble the natural history of PwHD. Hence, analysis of brain structure through MRI in the zQ175DN heterozygous mouse model holds potential for testing disease-modifying treatments expected to slow down or prevent structural degeneration.

">Biased inter-columnar communication and short-term plasticity in mouse barrel cortex</a></h4>

              
                The barrel cortex (BC) processes input from whiskers to probe and analyze objects in an environment. This sensory input exhibits a complex phase, direction, and frequency-dependent structure arising from whisking kinematics. Little is known about how BC microcircuits process this information. In particular, it remains unclear how the BC extracts relevant spatiotemporal features by integrating input from multiple whiskers. To investigate communication within and between cortical barrels, we targeted a hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) to Scnn1a excitatory neurons in BC layer 4 (L4) of male and female mice (mean age 7.8 weeks), and imaged population responses to electrical stimulation. Coronal and sagittal slices presented the laminar structure with barrels aligned along stereotyped whisking directions. Voltage imaging tracked activity along an L4[-&gt;]L2/3[-&gt;]L4 relay during inter-barrel communication. AMPA receptor blockade demonstrated that this relay depends on excitatory synaptic transmission and revealed intra- and inter-barrel feedforward inhibition. Single-pulse responses were isotropic in amplitude, conduction velocity, and half-width, but latency was longer for communication with dorsal and caudal barrels. Furthermore, paired-pulse depression was weakest and recovery slowest for protraction-related directions, especially between caudally adjacent barrels, suggesting preferential enhancement of repetitive inputs in this direction. These results identify direction-dependent synaptic circuitry in the shaping of inter-barrel communication. Anisotropy in short-term plasticity aligns with whisker motion kinematics, suggesting that BC microcircuits are tuned to preserve temporal fidelity and selectively filter inputs according to whisking phase and direction.

                <p>Amblyopia (lazy eye) is a developmental disorder of the visual cortex that causes deficits in visual acuity and shape perception. The loss of visual acuity is thought to originate from weakened cortical responses to stimuli. Here, we provide evidence for a similar mechanism to explain distortions in shape perception. We introduce a computational model that simulates perceptual distortions of grating patterns drawn by humans with amblyopia (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Barrett et al., 2003</cross-ref>). The model simulates a large variety of distortions by performing a weighted sum of rectified sinusoidal gratings (average, 3.3 gratings ~6 times larger than foveal receptive fields in the primary visual cortex) with different dark/light duty cycles. The simulations accurately reproduce self-reported perceptions of amblyopic patients and decrease drawing-percept differences when ideal percepts (stimuli) are replaced with simulated percepts (9.03 &plusmn; 12.37%; <I>p</I> = 0.0002; Wilcoxon test comparing normalized Laplacian pyramid distances; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B34">Laparra et al., 2016</cross-ref>). The simulations also reveal an increase in the number of stimulus orientations contributing to visual percepts in amblyopia and a strong correlation between contrast sensitivity deficits and both magnitude of perceived visual distortions (<I>r</I> = 0.96; <I>p</I> = 0.0007) and predicted spread of cortical activation (<I>r</I> = 0.82; <I>p</I> = 0.02). The results also demonstrate a compensatory shift in the spatial frequency distribution of cortical filters in amblyopia, which closely resembles the spatial frequency shift caused by contrast reduction in thalamocortical inputs of male cats. Taken together, our results indicate that amblyopia compensates weakened cortical responses by increasing the spread of cortical activation to include neurons with mismatched stimulus preferences that cause perceptual distortions.</p>

                <p>Selective spatial attention plays a critical role in perception in the daily environment where multiple sensory stimuli exist. Even covertly directing attention to a specific location facilitates the brain's information processing of stimuli at the attended location. Previous behavioral and neurophysiological studies have shown that microsaccades (MSs), tiny involuntary saccadic eye movements, reflect such a process in terms of visual space and can be a marker of spatial attention. However, it is unclear whether auditory spatial attention processes that are supposed to interact with visual attention processes influence MSs and vice versa. Here, we examine the relationship between MS direction and auditory spatial attention during dichotic oddball sound detection tasks with human participants of both sexes. The results showed that the MS direction was generally biased contralateral to the ear to which the oddball sound was presented or that to which sustained auditory attention was directed. The postoddball modulation of MS direction was associated with the behavioral performance of the detection task. The results suggest that the inhibition of stimulus-directed MSs occurs to reduce erroneous orientation of ocular responses during selective detection tasks. We also found that the correlation between MS direction and neural response to the tone originated from the auditory brainstem (frequency-following response). Overall, the present study suggests that MSs can be a marker of auditory spatial attention and that the auditory neural activity fluctuates over time with the states of attention and the oculomotor system, also involving auditory subcortical processes.</p>

                <p>Humans frequently make decisions that impact close others. Prior research has shown that people have stable preferences regarding such decisions and maintain rich, nuanced mental representations of their close social partners. Yet, if and how such mental representations shape social decisions preferences remains to be seen. Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and natural language processing, this study investigated how neural and linguistic representations of close others relate to social decision-making. After nominating a parent and friend, male and female participants (<I>N</I> = 63) rated their characteristics while undergoing fMRI and made hypothetical social decisions involving said parent and friend. Neural representations of parents and friends, relative to the self, were linked to social decision preferences. Specifically, greater neural similarity between self and parent in the temporoparietal junction and nucleus accumbens was associated with a preference for parents, while greater self&ndash;friend similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex was associated with friend preference. In a follow-up study, linguistic analysis of written descriptions of close others from an independent sample of males and females (<I>N</I> = 1,641) revealed that social decision preferences could be reliably predicted from semantic features of the text. High correspondence between neural and linguistic data in the imaging sample further strengthened the association with social decision preferences. These findings help elucidate the neural and linguistic underpinnings of social decision-making, emphasizing the critical role of mental representations in guiding choices involving familiar others.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/45/e1705252025?rss=1">Neuroscience Needs Behavioral "Wind Tunnels" for Real-Life Translation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroscience has advanced rapidly over the past century by applying reductionist methods to dissect brain function at molecular, cellular, and circuit levels, primarily in animal models. While this approach has generated extraordinary insights, the field now faces an epistemological bottleneck: efforts to build holistic models of human cognition from fragmented reductionist data are failing to capture the complexity of real-world brain function. Current translational pathways are dominated by a clinical mission&mdash;using dysfunction to model normal function&mdash;which limits ecological validity and reinforces blind spots. We argue that neuroscience must broaden its ontological mission beyond treatment of DSM-defined disorders to include functional misalignments and productivity in everyday life, encompassing education, workplaces, and social contexts. To achieve this, we propose the concept of behavioral "wind tunnels," an analogy to the facilities that transformed aerodynamics. Like wind tunnels, such environments would provide a controlled yet naturalistic middle ground between laboratory reductionism and the uncontrolled complexity of real-world settings. They would enable scalable capture of cognitive traits and states across wide populations, long time horizons, and multiple functional dimensions, yielding ecologically valid feedback loops essential for both theory and application. Embedding neuroscience into real-world contexts would align the field with pressing societal needs&mdash;optimizing human skills in an AI-disrupted economy, fostering resilience to global crises, and advancing brain health as an economic and societal asset. Just as wind tunnels transformed aviation from theory to reliable practice, neuroscience must now adopt analogous infrastructures to realize its full potential for humanity.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior depends on a dynamic balance between acquisition and extinction memories. Male and female rodents differ in extinction learning rates, suggesting potential sex-based differences in this balance. In males, deletion of extinction-recruited neurons in the central nucleus (CN) of the amygdala impairs extinction retrieval, shifting behavior toward acquisition (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Lay et al., 2023</cross-ref>). Here, we tested whether this mechanism also operates in females. In contrast to previously reported findings in males, deleting extinction-recruited CN neurons after single or extended extinction training had no effect on extinction retrieval in female rats. This lack of behavioral impact was not due to sex differences in CN activation during extinction. However, during early extinction, females showed greater activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) than males. Deletion of this BLA ensemble produced a more substantial reduction in conditioned approach than in non-deletion controls. These findings uncover a potential interplay between the CN and BLA in regulating conditioned approach in females. While ablation of extinction-recruited CN neurons do not modulate extinction retrieval in females, targeted BLA neuronal ablation during early extinction shifts behavior toward low, extinction-level responding. Thus heightened BLA activation during early extinction may prevent the emergence of extinction-like behavior in females. These findings, taken together with those reported by <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Lay et al. (2023)</cross-ref>, offer new insights into potential sex-based differences in the neural mechanisms underlying extinction and may inform the development of sex-based treatments for cue-triggered appetitive behaviors.</p>

                <p>Computer programming is a cornerstone of modern society, yet little is known about how the human brain enables this recently invented cultural skill. According to the neural recycling hypothesis, cultural skills (e.g., reading, math) repurpose preexisting neural "information maps." Alternatively, such maps could emerge de novo during learning, as they do in artificial neural networks. Representing and manipulating logical algorithms, such as "for" loops and "if" conditionals, is key to programming. Are representations of these algorithms acquired when people learn to program? Alternatively, do they predate instruction and get "recycled"? College students (<I>n</I> = 22, 11 females and 11 males) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study before and after their first programming course (Python) and completed a battery of behavioral tasks. After a one-semester Python course, reading Python functions (relative to working memory control) activated an independently localized left-lateralized frontoparietal reasoning network. This same network was already engaged by pseudocode, plain English descriptions of Python, even before the course. Critically, multivariate population codes in this frontoparietal network distinguished "for" loops and "if" conditional algorithms, both before and after. Representational similarity analysis revealed shared information in the frontoparietal network before and after instruction. Programming recycles preexisting representations of logical algorithms in frontoparietal cortices, supporting the recycling framework of cultural skill acquisition.</p>

                <p>Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused psychoactive drug that readily establishes reward memories contributing to METH relapse. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is central to cognition, motivation, reward, and emotion, and the hippocampus is critically involved in reward memory. The mPFC possesses an enormous variety of projection neurons. However, the direct projection from the mPFC to the hippocampus involved in METH addiction has not been studied well. To explore the role of a mPFC-hippocampus pathway of regulating METH reward memory, conditioned place preference (CPP) was used to detect reward memory and recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9s (rAAV2/9s) were used to label neurons, identify projections, and optogenetically explore involvement of the male mice mPFC-hippocampus pathway in regulating METH-CPP. We found that a novel prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) projection directly to the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) regulated CPP induced by METH. Moreover, optogenetic activation or inhibition and silencing the PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway with tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) modulated METH-CPP. Our results reveal a PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway that regulates METH-CPP and could serve as a potential target for treating METH use disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/45/e0394252025?rss=1">Common Mechanism Underlying Synaptic Dysfunction Caused by Preformed Fibril-Induced Accumulation of {alpha}-Synuclein or Tau in a Culture Propagation Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>In sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, the endogenous proteins &alpha;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and tau in Alzheimer's disease undergo pathogenic prion-like propagation over many years, accumulating in both soluble and insoluble forms in neurons including synapses, where they impair synaptic transmission and potentially cause various neuronal symptoms. To investigate the functional outcome of such synaptic accumulation, we induced accumulation of endogenous proteins in murine and human synapses by incubating mouse (of either sex) neuronal cultures with pathogenic preformed fibrils (pffs). Two weeks after treatment with human &alpha;-synuclein or tau pff, the respective endogenous proteins accumulated in neurons including presynaptic terminals, where we also observed tubulin accumulation, suggesting microtubule over-assembly. These were not associated with mRNA upregulation and were prevented by pharmacological stimulation of autophagy. Both pffs caused accumulation of p62 in cell bodies, suggesting compromised protein degradation. pHluorin imaging in synapses indicated a marked prolongation of vesicular endocytic time, which was rescued by pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules or by the overexpression of full-length dynamin 1. Since dynamin is a high-affinity binding partner of microtubules as well as an endocytic key molecule, over-assembled microtubules can sequester dynamin, thereby inhibiting endocytosis. We conclude that pff-induced accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein or tau in presynaptic terminals can disrupt vesicle endocytosis through a common mechanism. Since endocytosis-dependent vesicle recycling is critical for maintaining neurotransmitter release, its disruption can affect the neurocircuitry operations involved, thereby causing diverse symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, our data suggest a common molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>

                <p>Although TREK1 channels are widely expressed in several thalamic nuclei, the role of this K<SUB>2P</SUB> family member in modulating thalamic cell excitability and physiological thalamocortical oscillatory activity is not well studied. Here we explored the contribution of TREK1 channels to membrane properties of two important building blocks of the thalamocortical (TC) system, namely, GABAergic neurons of reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and TC neurons in different sensory thalamic nuclei including the ventrobasal complex (VB; somatosensory system) and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN; auditory system), using male TREK1 knock-out (TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice. Furthermore, we show that the loss of TREK1 channels has distinct effects on neuronal function in different thalamic nuclei. Compared with controls, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit decreased excitability in RTN neurons, while VB neurons maintain similar excitability levels. Additionally, the absence of TREK1 channels alters the action potential (AP) characteristics in VB TC neurons and affects GABAergic inhibitory tone in RTN neurons. In TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells is increased. It is tempting to assume that this combination of changes contributes to a high number of sharp, spindle-like oscillations observed in sleep local field potential (LFP) recordings of these mice. In addition, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice show a lower amount of delta (1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) oscillations during slow-wave sleep and a time-of-day-dependent alteration in the amount of sleep and wakefulness. They also show disturbed auditory signal processing and altered excitability in the auditory thalamus. These findings underline the relevance of TREK1 channels&rsquo; broad contribution to the thalamus and thalamocortical system.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/45/e0489252025?rss=1">Walking Modulates Active Auditory Sensing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Walking provides the motor foundation for navigation, while navigation ensures that walking is purposeful and adaptive to environmental contexts. Sensory processing of environmental information acts as the informational bridge that connects walking and adaptive navigation. In the current study, we assessed if walking and the walking direction influences neuronal dynamics underlying environmental information processing. To this end, we conducted two experiments with 12 male and 18 female participants while they walked along an 8-shaped path. Auditory entrainment stimuli were continuously presented, and mobile electroencephalogram was recorded. We found increased auditory entrainment (auditory steady-state response) and early auditory evoked responses during walking compared with standing or stepping in place. We also replicated the well-established reduction of occipital alpha power during walking. The increase of auditory entrainment and the decrease of alpha power were correlated across participants. In the second experiment, randomly presented transient burst sounds led to a perturbation of the auditory entrainment response. The perturbation response was stronger during walking compared with standing; however, only when the burst sounds were presented to one ear but not to both ears. Most importantly, we found that the auditory entrainment was systematically modulated dependent on the walking path. The entrainment responses changed as a function of the turning direction. In general, the current work shows that walking changes auditory processing in a walking path-dependent way which might serve to optimize navigation. The walking path-related modulation might further reflect a shift of attention, marking a form of higher-order active sensing.</p>

                <p>Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation. While impaired gamma oscillations are commonly reported in epilepsy, the dynamics of broadband and narrowband gamma as well as beta oscillations remain underexplored. These oscillations may serve as noninvasive electrophysiological markers associated with altered cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting underlying excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Here, we recorded high-density electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data to investigate visual stimuli-elicited cortical oscillations in 48 neurotypical (20 females) and 49 children (26 females) with epilepsy. We found that epilepsy is characterized by reduced amplitude and prolonged latency of evoked cortical response compared with controls after visual stimulation, with alterations in N1 peaks and M100, M150, and M250 components (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, source imaging revealed disrupted oscillatory features in epilepsy patients, including suppressed power, reduced amplitude, and increased latency in evoked and induced beta and gamma oscillations from the visual cortex (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). These alterations were consistent across diverse epilepsy subtypes, including focal, generalized, and nonlesional epilepsy cases. Utilizing these differences, we developed a novel classification model that differentiates individuals with epilepsy from controls with high accuracy, offering potential clinical utility in epilepsy diagnosis. Our results suggest disrupted beta and gamma oscillations may be associated with impaired inhibitory mechanisms and altered cortical dynamics, potentially indicative of an excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance. Our findings highlight the potential of noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers to capture cortical dynamics possibly influenced by excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy, supporting their use in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>

                <p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by motor coordination and cognitive deficits. In AS, hippocampal neurons show reduced filamentous (F-)actin, a decrease we also reported in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, along with impaired mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Currently, there are no pharmacological targets to prevent the decrease of F-actin in AS. Here, we utilize a first-in-class selective cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) to restore PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons and glutamate-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons from AS mice. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting cofilin, an actin-severing protein, with SZ-3 increases cellular stiffness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, systemic administration of SZ-3 in male and female AS mice enhances their performance in the rotarod and T-maze tests. These findings support that cytoskeletal dysregulation contributes to impaired ion channel function and behavioral deficits and that actin-binding proteins could serve as a target for enhancing motor coordination and spatial learning in AS.</p>

                <p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<I>.</I></p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/45/e1041252025?rss=1">Functional Connectivity Is Dominated by Aperiodic, Rather Than Oscillatory, Coupling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Functional connectivity (FC) has attracted significant interest in the identification of specific circuits underlying brain (dys)function. Classical analyses to estimate FC (i.e., filtering electrophysiological signals in canonical frequency bands and using connectivity metrics) assume that these reflect oscillatory networks. However, this approach conflates nonoscillatory, aperiodic neural activity with oscillations, raising the possibility that these functional networks may reflect aperiodic rather than oscillatory activity. Here, we provide the first study quantifying, in two different human electroencephalography (EEG) databases (<I>n</I> = 59, 30 females and 29 males; <I>n</I> = 103, 62 females and 41 males), the contribution of aperiodic activity on reconstructed oscillatory functional networks in resting state. We also followed the same approach on cognitive task recordings (<I>n</I> = 59, 30 females and 29 males) as a complementary analysis. We found that ~99% of delta, theta, and gamma functional networks, over 90% of beta functional networks, and between 23 and 61% of alpha functional networks were actually driven by aperiodic activity. While there is no universal consensus on how to identify and quantify neural oscillations, our results demonstrate that oscillatory functional networks may be drastically sparser than commonly assumed. These findings suggest that most FC studies focusing on resting state data actually reflect aperiodic networks instead of oscillations-based networks. We highly recommend that oscillatory network analyses first check the presence of aperiodicity-unbiased neural oscillations before estimating their statistical coupling to strengthen the robustness, interpretability, and reproducibility of FC studies.</p>

                Background Tourism is a vital component of economic development, particularly in emerging economies like India, where international tourist arrivals contribute significantly to foreign exchange earnings, employment generation, and regional growth. While prior research has explored various determinants of tourism demand, limited empirical studies have assessed the macroeconomic underpinnings of ITA using time series models capable of handling mixed integration orders. This study investigates the short-run and long-run effects of international tourist arrivals on GDP, FDI, and inflation in India. Methods This study uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag bounds testing approach on annual data spanning from 1995 to 2022. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was conducted to determine the stationarity properties of the time series data, after which the optimal lag structure for the ARDL model was identified using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The model was built on a time series dataset spanning 1995 to 2022, and the empirical results provide both statistically significant findings and interpretive depth that are relevant to policy and theory. Results The findings of this study confirm a statistically significant and positive relationship between GDP and international tourist arrivals in both the short and long run. The ARDL (1,2,0,2) model demonstrated strong explanatory power (Adjusted R² = 0.9565), and the bounds test confirmed the presence of cointegration among the variables. However, FDI and inflation were found to be statistically insignificant in influencing ITA. The error correction term was negative and empirically significant, indicating that approximately 51% of the disequilibrium adjusts each year toward long-run equilibrium. Conclusion This study highlights GDP as the primary macroeconomic driver of international tourism demand in India, with implications for economic planning and tourism policy. While FDI and inflation were not significant in this model, their potential indirect effects needs further investigation.

                Background Biobanks are critical infrastructures for biomedical research but are energy- and cost-intensive due to reliance on ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage and redundant systems. The challenge is reducing environmental impact without compromising specimen quality or continuity. Service centers are well positioned to address this challenge, operating at scale and providing governance beyond the capacity of individual laboratories. Methods The Johns Hopkins Biobank, a CAP-accredited service-center repository, partnered with the School of Medicine Energy and Sustainability Committee to conduct a freezer audit across 34 departments and two campuses. Inventories were assessed for age, utilization, and efficiency, and policies were implemented to encourage migration of biospecimens into centralized storage. Strategies prioritized vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (LN2) for viable collections and incorporated MVE Variō systems as energy-efficient alternatives for ULT needs. Governance required investigators to evaluate centralized options before acquiring new freezers, reinforced through outreach at faculty meetings and symposia. Results The audit identified nearly 1,300 ULT freezers, with over 70% beyond their median life expectancy of 8.5 years. Consolidation of specimens into a Biobank-managed freezer farm reduced institutional energy demand and improved monitoring. LN2 provided stability for viable specimens, while Variō units offered adjustable storage (–20 °C to –150 °C) with minimal electricity use and no facility cooling load. Governance helped to curb uncontrolled expansion of departmental freezers, while the Biobank functioned as an emergency response resource with at-temperature backup capacity. Adoption of centralized storage has been gradual but continues to expand. Conclusions This case study demonstrates how an academic service center can integrate sustainability, quality, and contingency planning. The Johns Hopkins Biobank illustrates that shared resources, supported by institutional governance, provide a practical framework to reduce environmental impact while ensuring uncompromising specimen protection.

                Background The continuous increase in emissions has exacerbated climate change, which is a concern for everyone on a global scale. In addition, the dynamics of democratic quality and development dimensions have been identified as key determinants that affect environmental quality in various countries. This study aims to analyze how economic growth (GDP), human development index (HDI), and democracy (DM) affect Environmental Degradation (ED), particularly in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Methods This study used panel data from 30 countries, divided into 15 developed and 15 developing countries, over an annual period from 2015 to 2022. The variables used in this study consist of CO2 as the dependent variable, while GDP, HDI, and DM serve as independent variables. Considering the characteristics of larger cross-section data and shorter time-series ranges, we used a dynamic panel model with two-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation method to achieve the research objectives. Results The results show that HDI has a negative and significant effect on CO2 emissions in developed countries, but contrasts with developing countries. Democracy is negatively and significantly correlated with CO2 emissions, with the effect being more pronounced in developed countries. The study also confirms the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) with an inverted U-shaped pattern, supporting the hypothesis in both groups of Eurasian countries. Conclusion The results of the study show that there is a significant dynamic relationship that can be measured by comparing econometric results in Eurasian countries with different levels of development. This study is the first of its kind on the subject in this region, making an important contribution to the empirical literature and enhancing the understanding of the impact of socio-economic-political variables on pollution emissions.

                Background Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare, inherited disorder primarily affecting the kidneys and liver. Disease-causing variants in PKHD1 lead to a disruption of the encoded protein fibrocystin/polyductin. This study aims to identify disease causing variants in PKHD1 in families from the Dhofar region of Oman. Methods We conducted a case series of six families with antenatal diagnoses of ARPKD and postnatal deaths. Genetic testing was performed on neonates using Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect variants in PKHD1. In silico analysis of mutational consequences was performed. Results 5 distinct homozygous variants in the PKHD1 gene were identified, including three pathogenic frameshift variants (c.6111_6112delTT, c.7011dupT and c.9550dupT), a nonsense variant (c.340C>T) and a homozygous deletion spanning exons 58-60 of the PKHD1. These alleles have not been reported in previous studies. In silico modelling identified pathogenic alleles, predicted to lead to either truncated protein products or nonsense-mediated decay. Discussion Our findings identify disease causing PKHD1 variants in this genetically distinct Dhofar population, potentially due to factors such as geographical isolation, consanguinity, and founder effects. The identification of previously undescribed variants underscores the need for regional genetic studies in understanding ARPKD and its genotype-phenotype correlations. Conclusion This study reveals distinct PKHD1 disease-causing variants in the Dhofar region of Oman, contributing to the broader genetic understanding of ARPKD. These findings highlight the value of region-specific genetic research in identifying new disease causing variants.

     alt="Differences in Cajal–Retzius Cell Density and Postnatal Persistence Across Cortical Areas Revealed by a Novel Intersectional Genetic Labeling Approach"/>
<p>A novel intersectional genetic labeling approach selectively and effectively captures TRP73-positive Cajal–Retzius (CR) cells across the whole mouse brain. The distribution and persistence of CR cells vary substantially across different brain areas during postnatal development, even between adjacent cortical subregions. CR cells persist in high numbers in the medial entorhinal cortex, while they disappear earlier from the lateral entorhinal cortex. This shows that the persistence of CR cells is more nuanced across cortical areas outside of the hippocampus than previously thought.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cajal–Retzius (CR) cells are glutamatergic neurons that transiently populate the most superficial layer of the isocortex and allocortex during development, serving an essential role during both prenatal and early postnatal brain development. Notably, these cells disappear from most cortical areas by postnatal day 14 but persist for much longer in the hippocampus. We developed a novel intersectional genetic labeling approach for CR cells that captures almost all of the TRP73-positive CR cells throughout the isocortex and allocortex. This intersectional strategy offers several advantages over previous methods commonly used for CR cell targeting. Here, we applied this new CR cell-labeling strategy to investigate the distribution and persistence of CR cells throughout the whole mouse brain at four different postnatal ages. We observed that the initial CR cell density and the rate of their disappearance vary substantially across different brain areas during development. Strikingly, we observed variation in cell death rate even between adjacent cortical subregions: comparing the medial and the lateral entorhinal cortex, the former retains a high density of CR cells for several months in contrast to the latter. Our results present a necessary revision of the phenomenon of CR cell persistence, showing that, in addition to the hippocampus, several other cortical areas maintain a high density of these cells beyond the first 2 postnatal weeks.</p>

Lee, José Alonso Solís-Lemus, Caroline H. Roney, Daniel B. Ennis, Ronak Rajani, Christopher A. Rinaldi, Gernot Plank, Richard D. Wilkinson, Steven E. Williams, Steven A. Niederer</p>

In atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial biomechanics are altered, reducing atrial movement. It remains unclear whether these changes are due to altered anatomy, myocardial stiffness, or constraints from surrounding structures. Understanding the causes of changed atrial deformation in AF could enhance tissue characterization and inform AF diagnosis, stratification, and treatment. We created patient-specific anatomical models of the left atrium (LA) from CT images. Passive LA biomechanics were simulated using finite deformation continuum mechanics equations. LA stiffness was represented by the Guccione material law, where <i>α</i> scaled the anisotropic stiffness parameters. Regional passive stiffness parameters were calibrated to peak regional deformation during the reservoir phase and validated against deformation transients derived from retrospective gated CT images during the reservoir and conduit phase. Physiological LA deformation varies regionally, with the roof deforming significantly less than other regions during the reservoir phase. The fitted model matched peak patient deformations globally and regionally with an average error of 0.90±0.39 mm over our cohort. We compared deformation transients through the reservoir and conduit phases and found that the simulated deformation transients were within an average of ±0.38 mm per unit time of the CT-derived deformation transients. Regional stiffness varied across the atria with average <i>α</i> values of 1.8, 1.6, 2.2, 1.6 and 2.1 across the cohort in the anterior, posterior, septum, lateral and roof regions respectively. Using mixed effect models, we found no correlation between regional patient LA deformation and regional estimates of wall thickness or regional volumes of epicardial adipose tissue. We found a significant correlation between regionally calibrated stiffness and CT-derived LA biomechanics (<i>p</i> = 0.023). We have shown that regional heterogeneity in stiffness contributes to regional LA biomechanics, while anatomical features appeared less important. These findings provide insight into the underlying causes of altered LA biomechanics in AF.

                <p>by Ethan S. Rappaport, Renato Mirollo, Babak Momeni</p>

The human microbiota plays a key role in resisting the colonization of pathogenic microbes, a process known as colonization resistance. However, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms by which colonization of invaders is blocked. Environmental resource supply and resource diversity are essential factors in forming these communities but testing how the environment affects resistance in natural communities is challenging. Here we use a consumer-resource model and computational invasion simulations to investigate how environmental resource diversity and supply affect the richness-resistance relationship, overall colonization resistance, and cross-feeding dynamics. We find a non-monotonic trend between species richness and resistance, shaped by environmental characteristics. Our results show that colonization resistance is negatively correlated with both resource supply and resource diversity except when resource supply is limited. Lastly, we observe that cross-feeding weakens colonization resistance by increasing the diversity of available resources, but this trend disappears with limited resource supply. This work provides insights about colonization resistance in microbial communities of consumers, resources, and resource conversion and exchange.

                <p>by Alberto Liardi, Fernando E. Rosas, Robin L. Carhart-Harris, George Blackburne, Daniel Bor, Pedro A. M. Mediano</p>

A key feature of information theory is its universality, as it can be applied to study a broad variety of complex systems. However, many information-theoretic measures can vary significantly even across systems with similar properties, making normalisation techniques essential for allowing meaningful comparisons across datasets. Inspired by the framework of Partial Information Decomposition (PID), here we introduce Null Models for Information Theory (NuMIT), a null model-based non-linear normalisation procedure which improves upon standard entropy-based normalisation approaches and overcomes their limitations. We provide practical implementations of the technique for systems with different statistics, and showcase the method on synthetic models and on human neuroimaging data. Our results demonstrate that NuMIT provides a robust and reliable tool to characterise complex systems of interest, allowing cross-dataset comparisons and providing a meaningful significance test for PID analyses.

                <p>by Diana Madeira</p>

Thermal tolerance determines winners and losers in a warming world. Oxygen limitation has been the primary hypothesis for the mechanistic basis of thermal tolerance. A new study in PLOS Biology suggests otherwise, reigniting debate on what truly sets thermal limits.

Oxygen limitation is thought to represent a key mechanism underlying thermal tolerance. This primer discusses how a recent PLOS Biology article challenges this idea, by showing minimal protective effects of oxygen supersaturation in aquatic ectotherms exposed to heat stress.

                Background Rapid advances in general-purpose artificial intelligence are compressing automation timelines: around 40–50% of tasks in advanced economies are technically automatable, and a quarter of total hours could be migrated to machines before 2030. Fears of large-scale displacement from artificial-intelligence (AI) adoption have prompted calls for either mass reskilling or unconditional cash transfers. Another option, the emergence of a “supervisory economy” in which humans specialise in overseeing AI systems, remains empirically under-examined. Methods Using a balanced panel of 12 economies observed annually from 2014 to 2023, we construct a sector-weighted AI-exposure index and match it to labour-force data on unemployment, supervisory employment, public transfers, R&D, and GDP per capita. Two-way fixed-effects regressions are estimated, first linearly and then with a quadratic AI term to capture non-linearity in technology shocks. Robustness checks include lagged covariates, alternative normalisations and clustered standard errors. Results The preferred quadratic specification reveals an inverted-U relationship between aggregate AI exposure and unemployment: joblessness rises at low-to-moderate exposure but falls once adoption surpasses approximately 1.7 standard deviations above the mean. Supervisory depth—measured as the share of senior- and middle-management roles—has no significant standalone effect and does not significantly moderate AI’s impact. Higher real income consistently dampens unemployment, while public transfers and contemporaneous R&D outlays show limited short-run cushioning. Conclusions National labour markets appear to follow a concave AI trajectory: modest automation initially displaces routine labour, but at high penetration, complementary demand offsets job losses. However, simply expanding managerial layers is insufficient to buffer early shocks; effective resilience likely hinges on coupling oversight capacity with targeted technical upskilling and productivity-enhancing growth. Policy mixes that rely primarily on cash transfers or untargeted innovation spending risk delaying, rather than mitigating, employment re-equilibration in the age of AI.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1210/v1?src=rss">The Active Learning–GenAI Synergy Framework: Ethical Integration of Generative AI in EFL/ESL Writing in Resource-Constrained Contexts [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This mixed-methods action research study investigates the integration of ethically designed generative AI tools as catalysts for active learning in English as Foreign Language (EFL) writing instruction. The research is situated within resource-constrained higher education contexts and is grounded in Kolb’s experiential learning theory and active learning principles. Design/methodology The study employed a quasi-experimental design involving 148 undergraduate students from Bahauddin Zakariya University, Pakistan. Over a 15-week intervention, an experimental group utilized AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude AI, Meta AI, and Canva) within a cognitive partnership model, while a control group received traditional teacher-centered instruction. Quantitative data on writing performance was supplemented by qualitative data from semi-structured interviews to capture student experiences and the development of ethical awareness. Findings Quantitative results show the experimental group achieved statistically significant improvements in writing performance (Z = -6.325, p < .001) compared to modest gains in the control group (Z = -2.128, p = 0.033), with notable skill progression emerging after 6-8 weeks. Qualitative analysis revealed that AI tools successfully functioned as cognitive partners, metacognitive mirrors, and equity tools. A strong majority of participants (79.7%) expressed positive views about AI integration, with 86% indicating intentions for continued use. Originality/value The paper provides a practical model for embedding AI tools in collaborative-learning settings while upholding academic integrity through a disciplined process of ethical reflection. The findings challenge the presumption that technology alone drives educational improvement, demonstrating instead that it is the pedagogical structures mediating AI interaction that determine an effective and ethical educational process.

                Background South Africa continues to underperform in primary mathematics, with foundational gaps evident across content and cognitive skills. This study investigates domain-specific patterns of achievement and cognitive demand using the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2023, benchmarking South African Grade 5 learners against Singaporean Grade 4 learners. Methods A quantitative secondary analysis was conducted on nationally representative TIMSS 2023 datasets comprising 10,424 South African learners from 285 schools and 6,530 Singaporean learners from 181 schools. Mathematics achievement was disaggregated by content domains (Number, Measurement and Geometry, Data) and cognitive domains (Knowing, Applying, Reasoning). Weighted estimates, mean differences, and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were computed to characterise performance gaps within and between countries. Results South African learners scored well below the international centre point across all content and cognitive domains. The largest content gap with Singapore occurred in Measurement and Geometry, indicating persistent weaknesses in spatial reasoning. We observed the widest disparity in the cognitive domain of knowing, which reflected fragile factual knowledge and procedural fluency. South African learners showed relatively stronger performance in applying mathematical concepts, indicating some competence with routine and structured tasks; however, their deficits in knowing hindered their progression to reasoning, particularly in multi-step and non-routine problem-solving, which were the weakest areas. Conclusions Early mathematics learning in South Africa is characterised by weak foundational knowledge, underdeveloped spatial reasoning, and limited opportunities for higher-order thinking. Targeted reforms should improve number and fact fluency, provide better teaching support for geometry and measurement, and add learning tasks that build on what learners are good at to help them think more clearly. Aligning curriculum intent, teacher development, and assessment expectations is essential to close domain-specific gaps and advance equitable foundational learning outcomes.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Medicinal plants play a crucial role in pharmacological research, as many pharmaceutical companies rely on them for raw materials. Collard greens, also known as “Sukuma wiki,” are a member of the Brassica oleracea var. viridis family and are known for their medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to identify phytochemicals in the ethanol extract of collard green leaves that has traditional use in treating male infertility in Uganda. Method The leaves were dried and crushed into fine powder and the powdered leaves (800 g) A was cold macerated in 5 liters of 99% ethanol (1:5 w/v) for 72 hours in sterile glass container. The ethanol extract (5g) was subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results Phytochemical analysis of the Ethanol extract from Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard green) leaves revealed the presence of various compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, fatty acids, and terpenoids. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 77 bioactive compounds, such as 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, 2, 7-Dimethyl-1, 7-octadien-3-amine, Octadecanoic acid, 9, 12, 15-Octadecatrienoic acid, Pentadecanoic acid, and several phenolic derivatives. Conclusion In conclusion, the phytochemicals identified in Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard greens), including Phytol, Omega-3 fatty acids, phenols, flavonoids, and sterols, demonstrate potential benefits for enhancing male fertility and reproductive health. These phytochemicals exert their beneficial action through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and possibly neuroprotective properties. There is need for further research to establish the effectiveness of these phytochemicals in clinical settings and provide concrete guidelines for their use in treating male infertility.
