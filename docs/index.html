              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03222">The role of gain neuromodulation in layer-5 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the plasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain and inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed by dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate, while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively modulating the synaptic weight updates.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03416">Statistical-Spatial Model for Motor Potentials Evoked Through Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Development of Closed-Loop Procedures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary motor cortex appears to be in the center of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). It is one of few locations that provide directly observable responses, and its physiology serves as model or reference for almost all other TMS targets, e.g., through the motor threshold and spatial targeting relative to its position. It furthermore sets the safety limits for the entire brain. Its easily detectable responses have led to closed-loop methods for a range of aspects, e.g., for automated thresholding, amplitude tracking, and targeting. The high variability of brain stimulation methods would substantially benefit from fast unbiased closed-loop methods. However, the development of more potent methods would early on in the design phase require proper models that allowed tuning and testing with sufficient without a high number of experiments, which are time-consuming and expensive or even impossible at the needed scale. On the one hand, theoretical researchers without access to experiments miss realistic spatial response models of brain stimulation to develop better methods. On the other hand, subjects should potentially not be exposed to early closed-loop-methods without sufficient prior testing as not yet well tuned feed-back as needed for closed-loop operation is known to erratic behavior.
  To bridge this gap, we developed a digital-twin-style population model that generates motor evoked potentials in response to virtual stimuli and includes statistical information on spatial (coil position and orientation) as well as recruitment in the population to represent inter- and intra-individual variability. The model allows users to simulate different subjects and millions of runs for software-in-the loop testing. The model includes all code to stimulate further development.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04442">Entropy measures as indicators of connectivity paths in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the information flow between different brain regions during various stimuli? This is the question we aim to address by studying complex cognitive paradigms in terms of Information Theory. To assess creativity and the emergence of patterns from a Shannon perspective, we applied a range of tools, including Entropy Density, Effective Measure Complexity, and the Lempel-Ziv distance. These entropic tools enable the detection of both linear and non-linear dynamics without relying on pre-established parameters, models, or prior assumptions about the data. To identify connections between different brain regions, we analyse task-based fMRI data from subjects during motor, working memory, emotion recognition, and language stimuli to gain insight into these complex cognitive processes. Since this method does not rely on prior knowledge, it is particularly well-suited for exploratory research, facilitating the discovery of previously unidentified connections or patterns in the brain. The capacity to identify non-linear dynamics is especially important for studying brain connectivity, as the brain exhibits significant non-linear interactions across multiple functional levels.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04575">Lilith: Developmental Modular LLMs with Chemical Signaling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current paradigms in Artificial Intelligence rely on layers of feedforward networks which model brain activity at the neuronal level. We conjecture that expanding to the level of multiple brain regions with chemical signaling may be a productive step toward understanding the emergence of consciousness. We propose LILITH, a novel architecture that combines developmental training of modular language models with brain-inspired token-based communication protocols, mirroring chemical signaling in the brain. Our approach models distinct brain regions as specialized LLM modules including thinking, memory, sensory, and regulatory components that communicate through emergent token-based signaling protocols analogous to neurotransmitter networks. Unlike traditional pre-trained systems, LILITH would employ developmental training where untrained LLM architectures learn through simulated life experiences, developing communication pathways and cognitive abilities through environmental interaction and evolutionary optimization. This framework would enable direct empirical investigation of consciousness emergence using Integrated Information Theory metrics while providing unprecedented insight into inter-module signaling patterns during development. By optimizing for consciousness emergence rather than task performance, LILITH could provide insight into different emergent phenomena at multiple levels of neural correlates, contrasting neuronal-level processing with multi-region coordination dynamics. The goal of this paper is to put the idea forward while recognizing the substantial challenges in implementing such a system.

                arXiv:2507.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For living beings, survival depends on effective regulation of internal physiological states through motivated behaviors. In this perspective we propose that Homeostatically Regulated Reinforcement Learning (HRRL) as a framework to describe biological agents that optimize internal states via learned predictive control strategies, integrating biological principles with computational learning. We show that HRRL inherently produces multiple behaviors such as risk aversion, anticipatory regulation, and adaptive movement, aligning with observed biological phenomena. Its extension to deep reinforcement learning enables autonomous exploration, hierarchical behavior, and potential real-world robotic applications. We argue further that HRRL offers a biologically plausible foundation for understanding motivation, learning, and decision-making, with broad implications for artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and understanding the causes of psychiatric disorders, ultimately advancing our understanding of adaptive behavior in complex environments.

                arXiv:2507.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While visual attention theories abound, neurodevelopmental research remains constrained by infants' unreliable responses and limited attention spans. Through collaboration with Project Prakash, we accessed a unique population: patients gaining vision later in life. This cohort enables investigation of visual process development in cognitively mature, cooperative participants rather than infants. We collected data from pre-operation patients, post-operation patients tracked longitudinally (1, 3, 6, and 12 months), and neurotypical controls wearing blurred goggles matched to patients' post-surgical acuity. All participants performed a modified pre-attentive pop-out visual search task. We implemented the eccNET CNN model (Gupta et al., 2021) to simulate visual search asymmetry, subjecting it to identical tasks as human participants. Reaction time comparisons revealed both convergent and divergent patterns between human and model performance. These findings enabled systematic model ablations informed by human physiological constraints and developmental trajectories observed across patient groups. Critically, human-model divergences proved most informative, directing our focus toward specific architectural modifications needed to better approximate human visual development patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02947">The Application of Large Language Models on Major Depressive Disorder Support Based on African Natural Products</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language models with African natural products for depression support, combining traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and contemporary medical understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631">Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.

                arXiv:2507.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Quick Feedforward (QF) Learning, a novel knowledge consolidation framework for transformer-based models that enables efficient transfer of instruction derived knowledge into model weights through feedforward activations without any gradient back propagation. Unlike traditional finetuning, QF updates are computed in closed form, require minimal parameter modification, and preserve prior knowledge. Importantly, QF allows models to train and infer within the same runtime environment, making the process more resource efficient and closely aligned with how the human brain operates. Code and models are open sourced on GitHub. I hope QF Learning inspires a more efficient and brain-like paradigm for AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05117">Self-consistent moment dynamics for networks of spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.05117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach to moment closure problem is used to derive low dimensional laws for the dynamics of the moments of the membrane potential distribution in a population of spiking neurons. Using spectral expansion of the density equation we derive the recursive and nonlinear relation between the moments, such as the mean potential, and the population firing rates. The self-consistent dynamics found relies on the dominant eigenvalues of the evolution operator, tightly related to the moments of the single-neuron inter-spike interval distribution. Contrary to previous attempts our system can be applied both in noise- and drift-dominated regime, and both for weakly and strongly coupled population. We demonstrate the applicability of the theory for the case of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons deriving closed analytical expressions. Truncating the mode decomposition to the first few more relevant moments, results to effectively describe the population dynamics both out-of-equilibrium and in response to strongly-varying inputs.

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive statistical framework for analysing brain dynamics and testing their associations with behavioural, physiological and other non-imaging variables. Based on a generalisation of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - the Gaussian-Linear HMM - our open-source Python package supports multiple experimental paradigms, including task-based and resting-state studies, and addresses a wide range of questions in neuroscience and related scientific fields. The toolbox is available as both a Python library and a graphical interface so it can be used by researchers with or without programming experience. Statistical inference is performed using permutation-based methods and structured Monte Carlo resampling, and the framework can easily handle confounding variables, multiple testing corrections, and hierarchical relationships within the data, among other features. The package includes tools for intuitive visualisation of statistical results, along with comprehensive documentation and step-by-step tutorials. Altogether, it provides a broadly applicable, end-to-end pipeline for analysis of functional neural data and its dynamics.

                arXiv:2310.07908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can implement complex computations by leveraging a range of dynamics, such as oscillations, attractors, and transient trajectories. A growing body of work has highlighted the emergence of phase codes, a type of oscillatory activity where information is encoded in the relative phase of network activity, in RNNs trained for working memory tasks. However, these studies rely on architectural constraints or regularization schemes that explicitly promote oscillatory solutions. Here, we investigate whether phase coding can emerge purely from task optimization by training continuous-time RNNs to perform a simple modular arithmetic task without oscillatory-promoting biases. We find that in the absence of such biases, RNNs can learn phase code solutions. Surprisingly, we also uncover a rich diversity of alternative solutions that solve our modular arithmetic task via qualitatively distinct dynamics and dynamical mechanisms. We map the solution space for our task and show that the phase code solution occupies a distinct region. These results suggest that phase coding can be a natural but not inevitable outcome of training RNNs on modular arithmetic, and highlight the diversity of solutions RNNs can learn to solve simple tasks.

                arXiv:2507.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria. However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases.

Abstract: This paper discusses how particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be used to generate quantum circuits to solve an instance of the MaxOne problem. It then analyzes previous studies on evolutionary algorithms for circuit synthesis. With a brief introduction to PSO, including its parameters and algorithm flow, the paper focuses on a method of quantum circuit encoding and representation as PSO parameters. The fitness evaluation used in this paper is the MaxOne problem. The paper presents experimental results that compare different learning abilities and inertia weight variations in the PSO algorithm. A comparison is further made between the PSO algorithm and a genetic algorithm for quantum circuit synthesis. The results suggest PSO converges more quickly to the optimal solution.

                arXiv:2507.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment. However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes. Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic (NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.

                arXiv:2507.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++ environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field, without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or massive training datasets.

                arXiv:2507.02945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance, their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

Evolutionary Algorithm is used to encode the ensemble of initial configurations and Monte Carlo method is used to evolve the pattern. Numerical simulation indicates that initial patterns with certain topological properties do evolve faster to market dominance.

                arXiv:2507.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network (SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration. Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover, HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

                arXiv:2507.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour space of meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration, exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features, performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks. The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm generators.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03666">A First Runtime Analysis of the PAES-25: An Enhanced Variant of the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a first mathematical runtime analysis of PAES-25, an enhanced version of the original Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES) coming from the study of telecommunication problems over two decades ago to understand the dynamics of local search of MOEAs on many-objective fitness landscapes. We derive tight expected runtime bounds of PAES-25 with one-bit mutation on $m$-LOTZ until the entire Pareto front is found: $\Theta(n^3)$ iterations if $m=2$, $\Theta(n^3 \log^2(n))$ iterations if $m=4$ and $\Theta(n(2n/m)^{m/2} \log(n/m))$ iterations if $m>4$ where $n$ is the problem size and $m$ the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first known tight runtime bounds for an MOEA outperforming the best known upper bound of $O(n^{m+1})$ for (G)SEMO on $m$-LOTZ when $m$ is at least $4$. We also show that archivers, such as the Adaptive Grid Archiver (AGA), Hypervolume Archiver (HVA) or Multi-Level Grid Archiver (MGA), help to distribute the set of solutions across the Pareto front of $m$-LOTZ efficiently. We also show that PAES-25 with standard bit mutation optimizes the bi-objective LOTZ benchmark in expected $O(n^4)$ iterations, and we discuss its limitations on other benchmarks such as OMM or COCZ.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03777">A Better Multi-Objective GP-GOMEA -- But do we Need it?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Symbolic Regression (SR), achieving a proper balance between accuracy and interpretability remains a key challenge. The Genetic Programming variant of the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GP-GOMEA) is of particular interest as it achieves state-of-the-art performance using a template that limits the size of expressions. A recently introduced expansion, modular GP-GOMEA, is capable of decomposing expressions using multiple subexpressions, further increasing chances of interpretability. However, modular GP-GOMEA may create larger expressions, increasing the need to balance size and accuracy. A multi-objective variant of GP-GOMEA exists, which can be used, for instance, to optimize for size and accuracy simultaneously, discovering their trade-off. However, even with enhancements that we propose in this paper to improve the performance of multi-objective modular GP-GOMEA, when optimizing for size and accuracy, the single-objective version in which a multi-objective archive is used only for logging, still consistently finds a better average hypervolume. We consequently analyze when a single-objective approach should be preferred. Additionally, we explore an objective that stimulates re-use in multi-objective modular GP-GOMEA.

                arXiv:2507.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NSGA-III algorithm relies on uniformly distributed reference points to promote diversity in many-objective optimization problems. However, this strategy may underperform when facing irregular Pareto fronts, where certain vectors remain unassociated with any optimal solutions. While adaptive schemes such as A-NSGA-III address this issue by dynamically modifying reference points, they may introduce unnecessary complexity in regular scenarios. This paper proposes NSGA-III with Update when Required (NSGA-III-UR), a hybrid algorithm that selectively activates reference vector adaptation based on the estimated regularity of the Pareto front. Experimental results on benchmark suites (DTLZ1-7, IDTLZ1-2) and real-world problems demonstrate that NSGA-III-UR consistently outperforms NSGA-III and A-NSGA-III across diverse problem landscapes.

                arXiv:2507.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to represent formal languages particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM)- a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at finite precision, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages that are out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM when interleaved with Mamba outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.

Abstract: This article critically examines the foundational principles of contemporary AI methods, exploring the limitations that hinder its potential. We draw parallels between the modern AI landscape and the 20th-century Modern Synthesis in evolutionary biology, and highlight how advancements in evolutionary theory that augmented the Modern Synthesis, particularly those of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, offer insights that can inform a new design paradigm for AI. By synthesizing findings across AI and evolutionary theory, we propose a pathway to overcome existing limitations, enabling AI to achieve its aspirational goals. We also examine how this perspective transforms the idea of an AI-driven technological singularity from speculative futurism into a grounded prospect.

                arXiv:2410.02011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the Target Set Selection (TSS) Problem in social networks, a fundamental problem in viral marketing. In the TSS problem, a graph and a threshold value for each vertex of the graph are given. We need to find a minimum size vertex subset to "activate" such that all graph vertices are activated at the end of the propagation process. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called "a census-based genetic algorithm" for the TSS problem. In our algorithm, we use the idea of a census to gather and store information about each individual in a population and collect census data from the individuals constructed during the algorithm's execution so that we can achieve greater diversity and avoid premature convergence at locally optimal solutions. We use two distinct census information: (a) for each individual, the algorithm stores how many times it has been identified during the execution (b) for each network node, the algorithm counts how many times it has been included in a solution. The proposed algorithm can also self-adjust by using a parameter specifying the aggressiveness employed in each reproduction method. Additionally, the algorithm is designed to run in a parallelized environment to minimize the computational cost and check each individual's feasibility. Moreover, our algorithm finds the optimal solution in all cases while experimenting on random graphs. Furthermore, we execute the proposed algorithm on 14 large graphs of real-life social network instances from the literature, improving around 9.57 solution size (on average) and 134 vertices (in total) compared to the best solutions obtained in previous studies.

                arXiv:2504.17455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The train timetabling problem in liberalized railway markets represents a challenge to the coordination between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings. Efficient scheduling is critical to maximizing infrastructure capacity and utilization while adhering as closely as possible to the requests of railway undertakings. These objectives ultimately contribute to maximizing the infrastructure manager's revenues. This paper sets out a modular simulation framework to reproduce the dynamics of deregulated railway systems. Ten metaheuristic algorithms using the MEALPY Python library are then evaluated in order to optimize train schedules in the liberalized Spanish railway market. In addition, an analysis of the scalability of the problem has been carried out by comparing the results with those obtained with a classical mathematical model such as SCIP in Pyomo. The results show that the Genetic Algorithm outperforms others in revenue optimization, convergence speed, and schedule adherence. Alternatives, such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization Continuous, show slower convergence and higher variability. The results emphasize the trade-off between scheduling more trains and adhering to requested times, providing insights into solving complex scheduling problems in deregulated railway systems.

                arXiv:2310.19603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of attention-based deep learning models in stochastic filtering, e.g.\ transformers and deep Kalman filters, has recently come into focus; however, the potential for these models to solve stochastic filtering problems remains largely unknown. The paper provides an affirmative answer to this open problem in the theoretical foundations of machine learning by showing that a class of continuous-time transformer models, called \textit{filterformers}, can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-time (possibly non-Gaussian) measurements. Our approximation guarantees hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of continuous-time paths, where the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance between the true optimal filter and our deep learning model quantifies the approximation error. Our construction relies on two new customizations of the standard attention mechanism: The first can losslessly adapt to the characteristics of a broad range of paths since we show that the attention mechanism implements bi-Lipschitz embeddings of sufficiently regular sets of paths into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces; thus, it incurs no ``dimension reduction error''. The latter attention mechanism is tailored to the geometry of Gaussian measures in the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our analysis relies on new stability estimates of robust optimal filters in the conditionally Gaussian setting.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is one of the current research challenges in this field. In this article, we introduce PIP-Net, a novel framework designed to predict pedestrian crossing intentions by AVs in real-world urban scenarios. We offer two variants of PIP-Net designed for different camera mounts and setups. Leveraging both kinematic data and spatial features from the driving scene, the proposed model employs a recurrent and temporal attention-based solution, outperforming state-of-the-art performance. To enhance the visual representation of road users and their proximity to the ego vehicle, we introduce a categorical depth feature map, combined with a local motion flow feature, providing rich insights into the scene dynamics. Additionally, we explore the impact of expanding the camera's field of view, from one to three cameras surrounding the ego vehicle, leading to an enhancement in the model's contextual perception. Depending on the traffic scenario and road environment, the model excels in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions up to 4 seconds in advance, which is a breakthrough in current research studies in pedestrian intention prediction. Finally, for the first time, we present the Urban-PIP dataset, a customised pedestrian intention prediction dataset, with multi-camera annotations in real-world automated driving scenarios.

                arXiv:2407.08641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been found recently that more data can, counter-intuitively, hurt the performance of deep neural networks. Here, we show that a more extreme version of the phenomenon occurs in data-driven models of dynamical systems. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training. Our results highlight the importance of proper regularization in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.

Abstract: This paper extends the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks beyond compact domains, which is of particular interest for the approximation within weighted $C^k$-spaces and weighted Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we establish universal approximation results within function spaces defined over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, including $L^p$-spaces, weighted $C^k$-spaces, and weighted Sobolev spaces, where the latter two include the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Moreover, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.

                arXiv:2411.15235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) - the ability to progressively acquire and integrate new concepts - is essential to intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic environments. However, deep neural networks struggle with catastrophic forgetting (CF) when learning tasks sequentially, as training for new tasks often overwrites previously learned knowledge. To address this, recent approaches constrain updates to orthogonal subspaces using gradient projection, effectively preserving important gradient directions for previous tasks. While effective in reducing forgetting, these approaches inadvertently hinder forward knowledge transfer (FWT), particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In this work, we propose Conceptor-based gradient projection for Deep Continual Learning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix representations, a form of regularized reconstruction, to adaptively handle highly correlated tasks. CODE-CL mitigates CF by projecting gradients onto pseudo-orthogonal subspaces of previous task feature spaces while simultaneously promoting FWT. It achieves this by learning a linear combination of shared basis directions, allowing efficient balance between stability and plasticity and transfer of knowledge between overlapping input feature representations. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks validate CODE-CL's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance, reduced forgetting, and improved FWT as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

                arXiv:2505.10080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLU) have shown great potential in enhancing neural network performance. In this paper, I introduce a novel attention mechanism called GLU Attention, which introduces nonlinearity into the values of Attention. My experiments demonstrate that GLU Attention improves both model performance and convergence speed across text and vision modalities with zero additional parameters and negligible computational costs. GLU Attention is lightweight and can seamlessly integrate with other technologies, such as Flash Attention, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), and various Multi-Head Attention (MHA) variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). This project is open-sourced at github.

                arXiv:2507.02211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge. In this work, using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting, different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this approach. As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102068">β-Glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages via neutrophil/IFNγ axis in a murine model of lung injury</a></h4>

              
                Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside in the lower airways and play a crucial role in lung health and response to sterile inflammation and infections. AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-Glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of central trained immunity by reprogramming haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan in mice induces peripheral trained immunity by reprogramming AMs in the lungs, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) or viral (polyI:C) challenges via a neutrophil/IFN-γ-dependent manner. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98347">Diverse prey capture strategies in teleost larvae</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavior is adapted to the sensory environment in which it evolved, while also being constrained by physical limits, evolutionary history, and developmental trajectories. The hunting behavior of larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>), a cyprinid native to streams in Eastern India, has been well characterized. However, it is unknown if the complement and sequence of movements employed during prey capture by zebrafish is universal across freshwater teleosts. Here, we explore the syntax of prey capture behavior in larval fish belonging to the clade <i>Percomorpha</i>, whose last common ancestor with cyprinids lived ~240 mya. We compared the behavior of four cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika endemic to deep benthic parts of the lake (<i>Lepidiolamprologus attenuatus</i>, <i>Lamprologus ocellatus</i>, and <i>Neolamprologus multifasciatus</i>) or inhabiting rivers (<i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>) with that of medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>), a fish found in rice paddies in East Asia. Using high-speed videography and neural networks, we tracked eye movements and extracted swim kinematics during hunting from larvae of these five species. Notably, we found that the repertoire of hunting movements of cichlids is broader than that of zebrafish, but shares basic features, such as eye convergence, positioning of prey centrally in the binocular visual field, and discrete prey capture bouts, including two kinds of capture strikes. In contrast, medaka swim continuously, track the prey monocularly without eye convergence, and position prey laterally before capturing them with a side swing. This configuration of kinematic motifs suggests that medaka may judge distance to prey predominantly by motion parallax, while cichlids and zebrafish may mainly use binocular visual cues. Together, our study documents the diversification of locomotor and oculomotor adaptations among hunting teleost larvae.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous studies have revealed that the moral level of targets can influence individuals’ empathic responses toward them. Here, we investigated the visual attention patterns and neural mechanisms related to how moral characteristics modulate individuals’ empathic responses to social pain via a word-priming social exclusion empathy task in which participants needed to judge whether the target persons with a high or low moral level were excluded or not in social situations. We found that for ERPs, when participants viewed neutral images, a significantly more negative N1 component was evoked in low-moral priming condition and a significantly more positive P3 component was evoked in high-moral priming condition. Regarding eye-tracking metrics, when participants viewed social exclusion images, the fixation time–related metrics under high-moral priming condition were significantly longer than those under low-moral priming condition. We speculate that this may be related to the expected conflict experienced by the participants when they saw high-moral individuals being socially excluded. This expected conflict may have caused attentional avoidance in that situation, which may be related to the relatively lower emotional arousal. This attentional avoidance during the early stage of visual processing resulted in significantly more cognitive resources being invested and longer fixation time–related metrics.</span>

While mesoscale optical imaging of neurovascular coupling is prevalent, neurometabolic coupling has been explored much less. We describe a multiplexed optical system with a closed cranial window setup for longitudinal studies in Thy1-jRGECO1a mice where neuronal activity is measured with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent red fluorescence, glucose uptake with bolus injections of 2NBDG with green fluorescence, and cerebral blood volume (CBV) with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) provide strong fluorescent signals for assessing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neuronal activity. Thy1-jRGECO1a, a novel GECI with red fluorescence emission that penetrates deeper into tissue, allows for simultaneous imaging of metabolic activity using a green-fluorescent glucose analog, 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2NBDG), which is taken up like glucose and then phosphorylated. Dual-fluorescent (red, green) and NIRS recordings confirm strong neurovascular coupling during hindpaw stimuli (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CBV; <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> = 0.0033, <span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.91), whereas neurometabolic coupling (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-2NBDG; <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.001) was three times stronger during stimulation (<span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.75; slope = 0.6) compared to rest (<span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.49; slope = 0.23).

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Daily life requires simultaneously processing spatial, temporal, and numerical inputs to form a valid mental representation of the environment. The interrelation between these perceptions has been a subject of theoretical debate. For instance, a theory of magnitude (ATOM) asserts that magnitude perceptions are processed in overlapping brain areas, which has been tested in behavioral and neuroimaging studies. We aimed to combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results using a coordinate-based meta-analysis to test this primary assumption of ATOM regarding overlapping brain areas. We conducted separate literature searches for space, time, and number perception following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The analysis was based on 19 articles regarding space, 38 regarding time, and 31 regarding number perception. Coordinates were analyzed using the “Activation Likelihood Estimation” method, which focused on conjunction analysis. Double conjunction analyses revealed activations mainly in the fronto-parietal areas and insular cortex. The triple conjunction analysis revealed activations in the right hemisphere, specifically in the inferior parietal and inferior frontal areas (previously linked to magnitude perception) and the anterior insular cortex (implicated in interoception and salience). In support of the ATOM theory, these findings suggest that overlapping neural networks may underlie space, time, and number perceptions.</span>

Relative to the control group, girls with FXS showed higher brain activation (NoGo&gt;Go) in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), angular gyrus, precentral gyrus, and left frontal pole, and lower activation in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, precentral cortex, middle temporal cortex, parietal lobe, and left superior temporal cortex. A significant positive correlation was found between DLPFC activation and response inhibition deficits in girls with FXS.

Literature search screenings found 16 studies and 16 experiments for the NAE and 46 studies and 47 experiments for the N-IAPS. GingerALE software employed activation likelihood estimation analyses to specify neural correlates within and between NAE and N-IAPS. Meta-analytic results from the NAE solely revealed the right fusiform gyrus encroaching the anterior cerebellum, while activations across frontal, occipital, temporal and subcortical areas were revealed for the N-IAPS. A commonality between the NAE and N-IAPS was revealed within the right fusiform gyrus. These results suggest that the domain-general neural systems are at play across negative visual affective experiences, yet the context of stimulus engagement, such as aesthetic, may modulate how these neural systems are employed. Given the scarcity of results, future research in neuroaesthetics must expand from positive aesthetic evaluations to ascertain neural correlates within negative aesthetic evaluations.</span>

                Background Current advancements in communication and information have important impacts on the agricultural sector. Technology has been instrumental in developing innovative approaches to enhancing farming productivity and efficiency while also addressing environmental concerns. With the aid of technology, researchers can collect and analyze vast amounts of agricultural data, enabling a deeper understanding of farming practices and facilitating more informed decision-making through cutting-edge techniques. Methods The study on Capsicum phenology introduces a nuanced approach by integrating statistical analysis specifically t-test and ANOVA to examine environmental parameters across various growth stages. This methodology offers a more detailed understanding a factors like temperature, humidity and soil moisture influence Capsicum development, providing a statistical foundation for adaptive crop management strategies. Results The results demonstrated substantial variability in these parameters, emphasizing the importance of tailored crop management strategies. Conclusion This research bridges a gap in Capsicum specific phenological studies and also sets a precedent for integrating statistical analysis with a smart agricultural technology paving the way for the development of autonomous crop management system that adapt to specific crop needs, thereby enhancing productivity and sustainability in agriculture.

                Background Sustainability in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which engage heavily in manufacturing provides them with an essential platform for implementing environmental strategy, which is aimed at reducing environmental damage and promoting environmental protection. This study aims to examine the impact of the reduction in resource use, the greening of processes and products on environmental strategy and the mediating role of green employee behaviour. Methods Primary data gathered with the help of questionnaires from employees of SMEs manufacturing in developing countries, Pakistan. The research gathered data from 211 participants by applying a pre-tested instrumental questionnaire and structural equation modelling (SEM) SmartPLS version 3 was used for data analysis. Results The results confirmed all direct effects, including a reduction in resource use, the greening of processes and products and green employee behaviour of environmental strategies in small and medium manufacturing firms. Also, confirmed partial mediation effect of green employee behavior between greening of processes and products and environmental strategy. Conclusion The current study clearly showed the need for programs and infrastructures that support resource reduction and greening businesses in SMEs. Companies’ implementation of green processes and technologies allows SMEs to take an environmentally responsible stand and become part of the movement toward sustainability. The research stresses the importance of green employee conduct as a mediator, the central point being the individual employee being engaged and aware of the subject and willing to participate in environmentally friendly practices. Therefore, small and medium enterprises should enlighten their staff to practice green behaviour, give them what they need and empower them to be change drivers that will trigger sustainability throughout the organisations.

                Background In England, the Professional Nurse Advocate (PNA) and Professional Midwifery Advocate (PMA) role places nurses and midwives at the centre of workforce retention and transformation. The PNA/PMA role blends professional leadership and clinical supervision through the A-EQUIP model, which is grounded in directing change and steering service development. The overarching impetus for the PNA/PMA role is to improve care quality whilst developing and sustaining cultures of professional wellbeing and nurse/midwife retention. To date, however, little is known about what the impact the PNA/PMA role has on the day-to-day practice of nurses and midwives, nor if it improves quality in practice, professional wellbeing, and retention. This study examines the impact of the PNA/PMA role on nurse/midwife involvement in quality improvement, wellbeing, and retention within one public sector healthcare NHS Trust in England. Methods During 2022, fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with PNA’s and PMA’s who had completed their training and are included on the NHS Trust PNA/PMA register. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed through qualitative descriptive analysis. Findings The analysis detected 5 themes and 10 subthemes: (1) Transforming in Tandem (a) Role of Advocacy, (b) Restorative Focus, (2) Creating Safe Spaces, (c) Emotional Support, (d) Interpersonal Relationships, (3) Challenging the Status Quo (e) Counteracting Blame Culture, (f ) Empowering Change (4) Empowerment and Development (g) Building Resilience, (5) Types of Advocacy (h) Educational and Emotional Advocacy (i) Coaching and Conversations. Conclusions The findings suggests that the most effective aspects of the PNA and PMA roles are those that directly empower individuals and create a supportive, reflective environment. However, while building resilience is vital, it is equally important to recognise its limits and ensure that healthcare professionals are not pushed to the point where their resilience becomes a barrier to their well-being and the overall improvement of their work environment.

                Background Motivational variables are of critical importance concerning students’ performance. The objective of the present study was to investigate the interrelationships between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, self-regulation, critical thinking, and academic performance among university students. Methods The participants were 250 students enrolled in university programs in education and psychology. The research instrument was a self-report questionnaire designed to assess intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking, self-regulation, and academic achievement among university students. A path model analysis was employed to identify the relationships among the investigated variables. Results The results demonstrated that self-efficacy was predicted by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking was predicted by self-efficacy, and self-regulation was predicted by self-efficacy and critical thinking, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of self-efficacy. The findings indicate that academic achievement is predicted by critical thinking, and self-regulation, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of these variables in academic contexts. Conclusions The contributions of the present research are twofold, both theoretical and practical. On the one hand, the findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the interconnections between motivation, self-efficacy, critical thinking, and self-regulation. On the other hand, they provide valuable insights for developing educational strategies that enhance academic achievement by fostering these key factors.

                Introduction Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte imbalance, often caused by the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH). SIADH results from excessive water retention due to inappropriate ADH secretion. While fluid restriction is a standard treatment, responses vary, and there is a need to identify predictors of non-response. Methods This prospective observational study involved 171 patients with SIADH. Inclusion criteria included serum sodium <125 mmol/L and urine osmolality >100 mOsm/kg along with others. Patients received fluid restriction (1 litre/day) with or without hypertonic saline. Data collection included clinical features, laboratory parameters, and response to treatment at 12 and 24 hours. The association between urine sodium, urine osmolality, and treatment response was analysed. Results The median age was 69 years, with a male predominance (59.1%). Pneumonia (28.7%) and malignancies (14%) were common aetiologies. Significant predictors of non-response to fluid restriction included high urine sodium and urine osmolality at the specified time limit. The group that failed to achieve the 24-hour serum sodium target had higher urine osmolality and sodium levels than responders. These findings align with previous studies highlighting the predictive value of urine osmolality and urine sodium. Conclusion Elevated urine sodium and urine osmolality significantly predict non-response to fluid restriction in SIADH. Identifying these markers can guide personalized treatment strategies, improving outcomes and avoiding unnecessary interventions

                Background This study investigated the utility of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with COVID-19 with respect to age, early (a week) vs. delayed recovery (> a week) and mortality. Methods This was a retrospective study including 1,016 COVID-19 patients. The discriminatory power and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results The mean age of patients was 45 (± 13.9), and 75.7% were males. Older patients had elevated NLR, PLR, D-dimer, CRP, and Interleukin-6 levels and longer hospital stay than the younger group (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in older adults (26.9% vs. 6.6%, p =0.001). On-admission NLR (5.8 vs. 3.2; P= 0.001) and PLR (253.9±221.1 vs. 192.2±158.5; p = 0.004) were higher in the non-survivors than survivors. Both PLR and NLR displayed significant discriminatory ability for mortality. NLR had a higher AUC and specificity, while PLR exhibited slightly higher sensitivity. In individuals aged ≤55, NLR showed superior discrimination (AUC=0.717) compared to PLR (AUC=0.620). Conversely, for older adults, PLR displayed enhanced discrimination (AUC=0.710), while NLR showed AUC=0.693. Conclusion Higher admission NLR and PLR levels were associated with delayed recovery, whereas an enhanced NLR was associated with considerably higher mortality in older COVID-19 patients.

                Background Antipsychotics are effective in reducing acute psychotic symptoms and preventing relapse in stabilized patients. However, their use remains controversial due to significant side effects and limited efficacy in some patients. This controversy is further compounded by some patients’ preferences to avoid or discontinue use, and the practice of involuntary admissions and antipsychotic medication treatment. Evaluating long-term outcomes, optimal discontinuation strategies, and the risks associated with managing first-episode psychosis without antipsychotics is challenging in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) due to ethical and safety concerns, participant attrition, and feasibility constraints. Real-world clinical practices vary widely in the duration, type, and non-use of antipsychotics due to provider variation. Methods We present a study that will utilize and link multiple longitudinal Norwegian national registry datasets, encompassing mental health care use, prescriptions, hospital emergency care contacts, injury presentations, educational outcomes, employment, criminal justice system contacts, and mortality. These data will enable descriptive analyses of outcomes for patients receiving different types, dosages, durations, and total exposures to antipsychotics, as well as for patients managed without antipsychotics. We also plan to estimate variations in public spending and societal costs. Variation in prescriber preferences will serve as quasi-randomization, allowing for causal inference after testing assumptions. Conclusions This study will provide empirical evidence to inform patients, carers, service providers, and policymakers in making complex decisions about antipsychotic maintenance treatment. Ethics and dissemination Ethic approval was granted by the Regional Ethical Committee for Medical and Health Services Research, Norway (REC South East, Committee D, REK 10895). Data will be pseudonymized for the project. The project group is committed to publishing all relevant findings in peer-reviewed journals, including null findings.

                Background GeoGebra® (a registered trademark of the International GeoGebra Institute) is dynamic, user-friendly, and open-source software that effectively connects geometry and algebra. By reducing abstraction and procedural demands, it facilitates students’ conceptual understanding. This study investigated the impact of GeoGebra integrated mathematics instruction on Grade 9 students’ achievement, conceptual understanding, and motivation regarding quadratic functions. Methods A quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent control groups was employed, involving 42 students in the experimental group and 45 in the control group, drawn from different intact classrooms in Worabe Town Administration, Ethiopia. The experimental group received instruction using GeoGebra, while the control group followed traditional teaching methods. The intervention was grounded in social constructivist theory. Data collection instruments included pre- and post-tests for mathematical achievement and conceptual understanding, as well as a motivation questionnaire. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS. Results The experimental group showed statistically significant improvement in both conceptual understanding and problem-solving performance compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, students in the GeoGebra-integrated instruction group reported significantly higher levels of motivation toward learning quadratic functions. Conclusions GeoGebra-integrated instruction has the potential to improve student achievement, reduce time spent on routine calculations, and address challenges related to multiple representations in mathematics. Furthermore, it enhances student motivation and engagement with critical mathematical concepts. These findings support the inclusion of dynamic mathematical software like GeoGebra in secondary mathematics instruction, especially for topics requiring visualization and symbolic reasoning.

                Backgrounds Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is a Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium known for its probiotic benefits, commonly found in fermented foods and mammalian gastrointestinal tracts. L. plantarum strain L47-2 was selected for its in vitro probiotic characteristics. Methods We investigated its antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria using the dual culture overlay method and assessed survival in a mimicked gastrointestinal tract by subjecting the bacteria to pH levels of 1.0–4.0 and bile salt concentrations of 0.1–0.5%. Adhesion to Caco-2 cells was also evaluated. Safety evaluations included phenotypic tests for antibiotic resistance and hemolytic activity, genotypic screening for virulence genes, and whole genome sequencing. Results After 4 hours, L47-2 survived well at pH 2.0 (57.0±3.6%) and 3.0 (66.3±2.5%), and maintained 35.0±3.0% survival in 0.4% bile salt. The L47-2 strain demonstrated antibacterial activity against gastrointestinal pathogens and exhibited safety as a probiotic strain. Notably, the L47-2 strain had high autoaggregation (76.3±3.2%) and coaggregation with specific pathogens ranging from 33.1 to 46.7%. Additionally, when compared to the assessed pathogens, the L47-2 strain showed the highest surface hydrophobicity, 68.4±0.4%. This strain exhibited potential adhesion to Caco-2 cells and inhibited the adhesion of all tested pathogens. It was most effective at inhibiting pathogenic bacterial strains rather than competing and displacing them. Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant positive relationships between autoaggregation and coaggregation (P=0.037), autoaggregation and adhesion to Caco-2 cells (P=0.020), and hydrophobicity and adhesion to Caco-2 cells (P=0.016). Conclusions The findings shed light on this strain’s probiotic potential and safety, as well as its already established functional capabilities, together with its potential applications as a biopreservative in the food industry and for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

                Background Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health issue among young adults in Latin America. The Questionnaire of Alcohol Consumption Outcome Expectations (CERCA) was developed to assess beliefs related to drinking, but its validity in different sociocultural contexts remains underexplored. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 685 students from a public university in Ecuador, selected through stratified random sampling by sex. The CERCA instrument was applied, and both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed. The EFA used principal axis factoring, and CFA was conducted using AMOS v.24, with standard fit indices. Results The EFA revealed a two-factor model—Emotional Well-being and Social Interaction—explaining 89.5% of the variance, with high internal consistency (α = .952; ω = .948). The CFA confirmed superior fit for the modified two-factor model, the Alcohol Consumption Expectancy Questionnaire (ACEQ), with CFI = .990, RMSEA = .031, and non-significant χ2 (21.5, p = .064), outperforming the original three-factor model. No significant differences were found by sex, ethnicity, or living arrangement, though students from urban areas reported higher alcohol-related expectations. Conclusions The ACEQ demonstrates robust psychometric properties and provides a more parsimonious and culturally aligned structure than the original CERCA model. It offers a valid and reliable tool for assessing alcohol consumption expectations among Ecuadorian university students, supporting the development of targeted prevention strategies.

                Diabetes mellitus (DM) remains a major global health problem and particularly in low to middle income countries both because of the increasing prevalence and as a result of lack of access to affordable and effective treatment. Given the limitations of current pharmacological treatments, such as side effects and poor compliance, there is increasing interest in natural plant-derived alternatives. This systematic review explores the anti-diabetic potential of Cucurbita species, members of the Cucurbitaceae family, which have demonstrated promising hypoglycemic, antioxidant, and insulinotropic activities in preclinical models. Following PRISMA 2020 criteria, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science identified 16 eligible preclinical studies published between 2016 and 2025 that met strict inclusion criteria. Extracts from Cucurbita maxima, C. moschata, C. ficifolia, and C. pepo were shown to significantly reduce blood glucose concentrations, enhance antioxidant enzyme activity, promote pancreatic β-cell regeneration, and improve lipid profiles in diabetic animal models. These effects were predominantly observed following oral administration, reflecting traditional usage patterns and supporting clinical translatability. The geographically diverse research landscape underscores the global ethnobotanical relevance of Cucurbita species as complementary or alternative treatments for DM. However, the review also highlights gaps in the research, including the need for further pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and clinical studies to validate the efficacy and safety of these botanicals and to inform the development of standardized phytotherapeutic interventions. Overall, Cucurbita plants present a compelling case for further investigation as adjunct or alternative treatments for diabetes mellitus.

                Backgrounds Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), is the most significant and highest-yielding crop among oil-producing crops worldwide. In 2020/2022, Basal stem rot (BSR) disease was observed in six oil palm growing Districts in Ghana. Methods Field study and laboratory analysis were conducted. A random sampling technique was used to select five plantation blocks from each District. Single-point disease assessments were done using Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with a severity scale of 0-4. Molecular assays were performed on each sample using nucleic acid as a template. ITS and GanET sequence analysis were performed along with the formation of a phylogenetic tree using the FASTA algorithm with the Fungus database from EBI and NCBI GenBank. Koch’s postulate was followed to confirm the disease. Results The disease incidence was 11.3 % with the highest severity score of 4. Basal Stem Rot (BSR) is characterised by progressive stem decay coupled with the formation of large, perennial, woody basidiocarps. The average measurement of 2-65 cm in diameter on infected palms. Culture colonies were white, striated, undulating, woolly-cottony, and creamish pigment on the reverse, depicting attributes of Ganoderma fungus. Molecular confirmation was done by combining the ITS sequence of top matches of >97% to members of the genus Ganoderma, >98% and 99.3% identity to three sequences of Ganoderma sp. (HM138671; HM138670 and HM138672) generated from strains assigned to Ganoderma ryvardenii and compared with 132 published sequences of Ganoderma isolates. Conclusion This study presents the first report of Ganoderma ryvardenii causing BSR disease on oil palm in Ghana, potentially the first in West Africa, and second in Africa. Notably, the pathogen was previously first reported to cause similar disease on oil palm in Cameroon, highlighting its emerging threat to oil palm production in the Sub-Saharan African region.

                Objective This study analyzes the relationship between productive public policies and women’s empowerment in agricultural activities in the district of Aramango, Amazonas, Peru. The aim was to identify which dimensions of public policies significantly influence the levels of intrinsic, instrumental, and collective agency among women farmers. Methodology The research adopted a quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional approach. A survey validated by experts was administered to 40 women belonging to active agricultural associations in El Porvenir. The variables—public policies and empowerment—were measured in five and three dimensions, respectively. Rating scales were used to establish perception levels, and Spearman’s coefficient was employed to analyze correlations between variables. Results The results reveal a positive and statistically significant correlation between productive public policies and women’s empowerment (ρ = 0.318; p < 0.05), with particularly strong effects in the dimensions of knowledge (ρ = 0.458; p = 0.003) and market access (ρ = 0.344; p = 0.030). The dimensions of infrastructure, access to resources, and institutional framework did not show significant correlations. Medium levels of empowerment predominated, although there were advances in autonomy and participation. Conclusions Women’s empowerment in rural agricultural contexts depends on targeted public policies that prioritize technical training and equitable market access. The evidence supports the need to redesign policies using a territorial and intersectional approach to overcome structural barriers and promote the economic, social, and political autonomy of rural women.

                Introduction Periocular tissues are exposed to sunlight ultraviolet rays. Unreparable DNA damage may also araise. Thus, uncontrolled tumor proliferation may occur. Surgical excision remains a treatment associated with adjuvant management. Observation A 57-year male presented with optic correction. He was classified as skin prototype III. An ophthalmological examination revealed an ulcerative lower eyelid lesion. He underwent a biopsy with histological analysis confirmed the presence of malignant basaloid tumor cells. Complete excision was performed with 3 mm surgical margins and associated with radiotherapy. The follow-up was marked by good oncological and aesthetic results. Conclusion The periocular skin area is the most common site of malignant lesions in the head and neck. Locoregional extension and metastasis remain deadly complications. Early diagnosis is essential. Therefore, any periocular skin lesion should be considered, and biopsy should be performed at the slightest doubt.

                Background The primary barriers to effective and comprehensive treatment of mental disorders are insufficient resources and competent health and medical personnel, alongside social discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. Artificial intelligence-enabled technologies are emerging as a promising solution for longstanding difficulties, most notably is mobile-based therapy chatbots. Methods This is a quantitative, descriptive comparative research design aimed to identify the relationship between the utilization of the Artificial Intelligence Chabot, Stress, Anxiety, and Depression levels among Health Sciences University Students at a University within the United Arab Emirates. The sample was recruited from four health sciences Colleges by using Stratified random sampling technique (n= 298). Results Three tools were used for the data collection and the result revealed that a total of 206 participants (69.1%) reported having interacted with an AI chatbot, with the most used applications being Snapchat (76.9%), followed by ChatGPT and Bard (23.4% each). 40% of the participants reported that the chatbots understood them well, while 16% found that the chatbots helped to reduce their stress. Participants who used the AI chatbot were significantly more likely to suffer from moderate to extremely severe depression (63.5%) compared to those who had not used AI chatbots (36.7%, p<0.001). The multivariate regression analysis indicated that higher levels of depression (OR=1.022, 95% CI: 1.01-1.085, p<0.001) and anxiety (OR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21, p<0.001) were strong predictors of increased AI chatbot usage. Conclusion Stress levels did not significantly predict AI chatbot usage. It is recommended that early intervention and support including university student counselling can significantly alleviate the burden of mental health issues and contribute to the overall well-being and academic success of students. AI chatbots in mental health care present a promising adjunct to nursing interventions; nonetheless, their implementation must be meticulously regulated to guarantee safe and practical assistance akin to the regulatory rigor imposed on registered healthcare practitioners.

                Background Credit card fraud detection remains a major challenge because of the highly imbalanced nature of transaction data. Conventional supervised models often suffer from low recall or high false positive rates, whereas unsupervised methods lack precision. Methods In this study, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that combines an unsupervised autoencoder trained on normal transactions to capture reconstruction error patterns with a supervised XGBoost classifier trained on the same dataset. The hybrid system integrates both scores via an optimized thresholding mechanism to balance sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated the model on the publicly available Kaggle creditcard.csv dataset comprising 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labelled fraudulent. Results The proposed model achieved superior performance, with a recall of 0.9250, precision of 0.9569, F1-score of 0.9407, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9407, with an accuracy of 0.9998, surpassing the results of similar published models using the same dataset. Conclusions This framework provides a practical, reproducible, high-performance solution for detecting financial fraud. The code, model configuration, and data-processing pipeline were made available to support transparency and future research.

                Background The derivation of novel biomarkers from biomedical data to accurately predict individual patient’s responses, would be an advance. We hypothesized that quantitative AI designed to analyze complex data, based on evolutionary computation, could identify algorithmic biomarkers from baseline data in a clinical trial, predictive of individual therapeutic responses. Methods A previously published randomized placebo controlled clinical trial in which patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) naive to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo was analyzed. Baseline peripheral blood gene expression data, plus the treatment variable, infliximab or placebo, yielding 52,379 variables were available for 59 patients. The variable for analysis was a decrease in Disease Activity Score-28 (DSA28) score of 1.2. At 14 weeks, 20 of the 30 patients receiving infliximab had responded, and ten of the 29 patients receiving placebo had responded. Findings The AI derived a discovery algorithm, with 4 gene expression variables plus treatment assignment, that predicted responders versus non-responders for all 59 patients, with 100% accuracy. We present the discovery algorithm to enable transparent verification. Excluding the 4 gene expression variables, we then derived similarly accurate predictive algorithms with 4 other gene expression variables. We tested the hypothesis that the software could derive algorithms as predictors of treatment response applying just these 8 discovery gene expression variables to 6 previously published independent datasets. In each validation analysis, the accuracy of the algorithmic predictors surpassed those benchmarks previously reported, using a variety of analytic approaches. Conclusions AI based on evolutionary computation summarized a clinical trial, with transparent biomarker algorithms derived from baseline data, correctly predicting the outcome for all patients. The biomarker variables, validated in 6 independent cohorts, are now in development as a clinical test. This approach may expedite the discovery of companion diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-662/v1?src=rss">Implementation and Efficacy of COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Controls Measures Among Indonesia’s Health Care Workers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted primary healthcare (PHC) workers, placing them at heightened risk of infection. Ensuring the implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in PHC settings is critical to safeguarding health workers and maintaining essential health services. This study aimed to assess the compliance of PHC facilities with the Indonesian Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 regulations. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted across 17 Primary Health Care (Puskesmas) facilities located in six provinces of Indonesia. Data were collected over a six-month period and analyzed based on 11 key variables: leadership and incident management systems; coordination and communication; surveillance and information management; risk management and public involvement; administrative, financial, and business continuity; human resources; essential support services; patient management; occupational health; mental health and psychosocial support; rapid identification and diagnosis; and infection prevention and control. Compliance was evaluated using a scoring system aligned with Ministry of Health standards. Results Of the 17 PHC facilities evaluated, 12 (71%) were classified as having “very good” compliance with COVID-19 IPC measures, while 5 (29%) were categorized as “good.” However, specific areas showed lower compliance rates, including occupational health, mental health, and psychosocial support (41%), human resources (50%), risk communication and community engagement (57%), and administrative, financial, and business continuity (58%). Conclusions While overall compliance with Ministry of Health regulations among PHC facilities was high, critical areas such as worker mental health, human resource management, and risk communication require targeted improvement. Policymakers, government agencies, and health institutions must enhance protection measures for PHC workers by strengthening human resource systems, updating risk communication strategies, and integrating business continuity planning tailored to pandemic conditions.

                Background Vector-borne diseases transmitted by various arthropods account for approximately 17% of the global burden of infectious diseases. These arthropods, especially mosquitoes, are particularly rampant in Mangalore because of the humid coastal climate and scaling urbanization. Objectives To identify the key determinants of mosquito presence in urban settings and assess community-based prevention strategies and control measures. Also to evaluate community perceptions of mosquito-borne diseases and quantify their burden from self-reported cases. Methods The study involved households in selected wards of the urban field practice area of the Department of Community Medicine, selected through convenience sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic details, mosquito proliferation, breeding determinants, behavioral measures, perception of mosquito control, and self-reported cases of mosquito-borne diseases. The data were analyzed using Jamovi version 2.6.26. Results The study included 95 household participants, primarily female (70.5%) and literate individuals (94.8%). The 42.1% reported an increase in mosquito breeding sites over the past year and 69.4% recognized the rainy season, where mosquitoes were more prevalent. Seventy five percentage responded to water stagnation, which contributed to vector breeding. The survey showed, 91.5% of households used chemical measures as mosquito preventive measures. Ninety two percentage of respondents are aware of mosquito-borne diseases and 80% perceived regular environmental cleaning is a crucial method to prevent disease outbreaks. Thirty percentage of participants had suffered any mosquito-borne disease past year. Water stagnation (p = 0.033) and construction activity (p = 0.014) were significantly associated with a higher number of mosquitoes in the study setting. Conclusion This study reveals a gap in community knowledge and perception of mosquito-borne diseases, even though people are aware of basic precautions, such as using mosquito sprays and screens. However, proper intervention by local authority is needed to combat breeding factors, such as water stagnation and dense vegetation.

                Background Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury is ubiquitous among patients with critical conditions and contributes to high mortality rates. SA-AKI was experimentally elicited in murine models via cecal ligation and puncture. Aims This study aimed to determine the possible protective effects of montelukast on sepsis-induced acute kidney injury in a mouse sepsis model. Methods Albino male Swiss mice (n = 40) were allocated into four distinct groups: (i) normal group, (ii) CLP group, (iii) vehicle group, and (iv) Cecal Ligation and Puncture + Montelukast group (20 mg/kg one hour before Cecal Ligation and Puncture). Blood and tissue biochemical/routine indicators, renal function, Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury -related pathophysiological processes, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 gene expression in septic mice were assessed by histological hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Results The findings highlight that Montelukast reversed CLP-induced increases in serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine (Cr), and kidney injury molecule levels. It also significantly inhibited elevated concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), F2-isoprostane, and caspase-3 in renal tissues. Additionally, NF-κB protein levels were notably lower in the CLP+ montelukast group than in Cecal Ligation and Puncture group P<0.001. In addition, montelukast significantly mitigated extensive tubular damage in the murine sepsis group p<0.001. Conclusion These findings indicate that montelukast may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced AKI.

                <p>by Xiaorui Dong, Du Jiao, Hongzhang Xue, Shiyu Fan, Chaochun Wei</p>

Traditional pangenome analysis focuses on gene presence/absence variations (gene PAVs). However, the current methods for gene PAV analysis are insensitive to detect small but valuable mutations within gene regions, and they overlook variations in intergenic regions. Additionally, the visual inspection of PAVs is an important but time-consuming step for pangenome analysis and result interpretation. To address these issues, we present APAV, an advanced toolkit designed for comprehensive PAV analysis and visualization. It integrates gene element-level PAV analysis and provides PAV analysis for arbitrary given regions in a genome. The resulted PAV profile can be visualized and investigated interactively with reports in HTML format, enabling researchers to conveniently verify sequencing read depth, target region coverage, and intervals of absence for each PAV. Furthermore, APAV offers various subsequent analysis and visualization functions based on the PAV profile table, including basic statistics, sample clustering, genome size estimation, and phenotype association analysis. We demonstrated the capability of APAV with pangenome analysis of tumor genomes and rice genomes. Performing PAV analysis at the element level not only provides more accurate information about the variations but also uncovers a larger number of variations for the phenotype-genotype association studies. In the rice genome analysis, we identified over twenty thousand distributed genes and more than fifty thousand distributed genetic elements. In the tumor genome analysis, element-level analysis revealed approximately three times as many phenotype-related genes as gene-level analysis. This indicates that altering the PAV unit from genes to smaller segments or elements can lead to more biological insights.

                <p>by Gyeongtae Kim, Pilwon Kim</p>

Engrams corresponding to distinct memories compete for retrieval in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, yet the detailed mechanisms underlying their formation remain elusive. Recent findings indicate that hippocampal inhibitory neurons display feature-selective firing patterns and diverse forms of synaptic plasticity, suggesting a crucial role in engram formation. Conventional CA3 attractor network models typically employ global inhibition, where inhibitory neurons uniformly suppress the activity of excitatory neurons. However, such models fail to capture the dynamics arising from sparse distributed coding or reflect inhibitory neurons’ roles in the competition between engrams during memory retrieval. We propose a mechanism for engram formation in CA3 using a spiking neural network model that emphasizes heterosynaptic plasticity at excitatory-to-inhibitory (E-to-I) synapses. In our model, inhibitory neurons associate with specific neural assemblies during encoding and selectively inhibit competing engrams during retrieval. Driven by a simplified feedforward dentate gyrus (DG), this mechanism generates sparse, distributed engrams in CA3. This representation allows us to examine the effects of selective inhibition on pattern completion across various conditions, including partially overlapping engrams. Simulations show that selective inhibition substantially enhances recall stability and accuracy compared to global inhibition alone. Furthermore, emergent activity patterns across DG, CA3, and CA1 of the model replicate experimental signatures of pattern separation and completion. These results suggest that assembly-specific inhibition mediated by heterosynaptic plasticity could provide a parsimonious mechanism for engram formation and competition in CA3, offering testable predictions for future experiments.

                <p>by Yuhan Li, Nicolò Gozzi, Nicola Perra</p>

The initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been challenged by logistical issues, limited availability of doses, scarce healthcare capacity, spotty acceptance, and the emergence of variants of concern. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been critical to support these phases. However, vaccines may have prompted behavioural relaxation, potentially reducing NPIs adherence. Epidemic models have explored this phenomenon, but they have not been validated against data. Moreover, recent surveys provide conflicting results on the matter. The extent of behavioural relaxation induced by COVID-19 vaccines is still unclear. Here, we aim to study this phenomenon in four regions. We implement five realistic epidemic models which include age structure, multiple virus strains, NPIs, and vaccinations. One of the models acts as a baseline, while the others extend it including different behavioural relaxation mechanisms. First, we calibrate the baseline model and run counterfactual scenarios to quantify the impact of vaccinations and NPIs. Our results confirm the critical role of both in reducing infection and mortality rates. Second, using different metrics, we calibrate the behavioural models and compare them to each other and to the baseline. Including behavioural relaxation leads to a better fit of weekly deaths in three regions. However, the improvements are limited to a 2−10% reduction in weighted mean absolute percentage errors and these gains are generally offset by models’ increased complexity. Overall, we do not find clear signs of behavioural relaxation induced by COVID-19 vaccines on weekly deaths. Furthermore, our results suggest that if this phenomenon occurred, it generally involved only a minority of the population. Our work contributes to the retrospective validation of epidemic models developed amid the COVID-19 Pandemic and underscores the issue of non-identifiability of complex social mechanisms.

Under starvation conditions, <i>B. subtilis</i> survives by differentiating into one of two cell types: biofilm matrix-producing cells or sporulating cells. These two cell-differentiation pathways are activated by the same phosphorylated transcription factor - Spo0A~P. Despite sharing the activation mechanism, these cell fates are mutually exclusive at the single-cell level. This decision has been shown to be controlled by the effects of growth rate on gene dosage and protein dilution in the biofilm matrix production network. In this work, we explore an alternative mechanism of growth rate-mediated control of this cell fate decision. Namely, using deterministic and stochastic modeling, we investigate how the growth-rate-dependent pulsing dynamics of Spo0A~P affect biofilm matrix deactivation and activation. Specifically, we show that the Spo0A~P pulsing frequency tunes the biofilm matrix deactivation and activation probability. Interestingly, we found that DNA replication is the cell cycle stage that most substantially contributes to the deactivation of biofilm matrix production. Finally, we report that the deactivation of biofilm matrix production is not primarily regulated by the effects of growth rate on gene dosage and protein dilution. Instead, it is driven by changes in the pulsing period of Spo0A~P. In summary, our findings elucidate another mechanism governing biofilm deactivation during the late stages of starvation, thereby advancing our understanding of how bacterial networks interpret dynamic transcriptional regulatory signals to control stress-response pathways.

                <p>by Christo Morison, Dudley Stark, Weini Huang</p>

Genetic mutations are footprints of cancer evolution and reveal critical dynamic parameters of tumour growth, which otherwise are hard to measure <i>in vivo</i>. The mutation accumulation in tumour cell populations has been described by various statistics, such as site frequency spectra (SFS), single-cell division distributions (DD) and mutational burden distributions (MBD). While DD and SFS have been intensively studied in phylogenetics especially after the development of whole genome sequencing technology of bulk samples, MBD has drawn attention more recently with the single-cell sequencing data. Although those statistics all arise from the same somatic evolutionary process, an integrated understanding of these distributions is missing and requires novel mathematical tools to better inform the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of tumours. Here we introduce dynamical matrices to analyse and unite the SFS, DD and MBD and derive recurrence relations for the expectations of these three distributions. While we successfully recover classic exact results in pure-birth cases for the SFS and the DD through our new framework, we derive a new expression for the MBD and approximate all three distributions when death is introduced. We demonstrate a natural link between the SFS and the single-cell MBD, and show that the MBD can be regenerated through the DD. Counter-intuitively, the single-cell MBD is mainly driven by the stochasticity arising in the DD, rather than the extra stochasticity in the number of mutations at each cell division.

During drug development, candidate compounds are extensively tested for proarrhythmic risk and in particular risk of Torsade de Pointes (TdP), as indicated by prolongation of the QT interval. Drugs that inhibit the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) can prolong the action potential duration (APD) and thereby the QT interval, and so are routinely rejected. However, simultaneous inhibition of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) can mitigate the effect of IKr inhibition, so that including both effects can improve test specificity. Mathematical models of the action potential (AP) can be used to predict the APD prolongation resulting from a given level of IKr and ICaL inhibition, but for use in safety-testing their predictive capabilities should first be carefully verified. We present the first systematic comparison between experimental drug-induced APD and predictions by AP models. New experimental data were obtained <i>ex vivo</i> for APD response to IKr and/or ICaL inhibition by applying 9 compounds at different concentrations to adult human ventricular trabeculae at physiological temperature. Compounds with similar effects on IKr and ICaL exhibited less APD prolongation compared to selective IKr inhibitors. We then integrated <i>in vitro</i> IC50 patch-clamp data for IKr and ICaL inhibition by the tested compounds into simulations with AP models. Models were assessed against the <i>ex vivo</i> data on their ability to recapitulate drug-induced APD changes observed experimentally. None of the tested AP models reproduced the APD changes observed experimentally across all combinations and degrees of IKr and/or ICaL inhibition: they matched the data either for selective IKr inhibitors or for compounds with comparable effects on IKr and ICaL. This work introduces a new benchmarking framework to assess the predictivity of current and future AP models for APD response to IKr and/or ICaL inhibition. This is an essential primary step towards an <i>in silico</i> framework that integrates <i>in vitro</i> data for translational clinical cardiac safety.

When formed in vivo, murine hemostatic thrombi exhibit a heterogeneous architecture comprised of distinct regions of densely and sparsely packed platelets. In this study, we utilize high-resolution electron microscopy alongside machine learning and physics-based simulations to investigate how such clot microstructure impacts molecular diffusivity. We used Serial Block Face – Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM) to image select volumes of hemostatic masses formed in a mouse jugular vein, producing high-resolution 2D images. Images were segmented using machine learning software (Cellpose), whose training was augmented by manually segmented images. The segmented images were then utilized as 2D computational domains for Lattice Kinetic Monte-Carlo (LKMC) simulations. This process constitutes a computational pipeline that combines purely data-derived biological domains with physics-driven simulations to estimate how molecular movement is hindered in a hemostatic platelet mass. Using our pipeline, we estimated that the 2D hindered diffusion rates of a globular protein range from 2% to 40% of the unhindered rate, with denser packing regions lending to lower molecular diffusivity. These data suggest that coagulation reactions rates, thrombin generation and activity, as well as platelet releasate activity may be drastically impacted by the internal geometry of a hemostatic thrombus.

                <p>by Paul van Lent, Olga Bunkova, Bálint Magyar, Léon Planken, Joep Schmitz, Thomas Abeel</p>

Motivation: Metabolic kinetic models are widely used to model biological systems. Despite their widespread use, it remains challenging to parameterize these Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) for large scale kinetic models. Recent work on neural ODEs has shown the potential for modeling time-series data using neural networks, and many methodological developments in this field can similarly be applied to kinetic models.
Results: We have implemented a simulation and training framework for Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models using JAX/Diffrax, which we named <i>jaxkineticmodel</i>. JAX allows for automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation capabilities to speed up the parameterization of kinetic models, while also allowing for hybridizing kinetic models with neural networks. We show the robust capabilities of training kinetic models using this framework on a large collection of SBML models with different degrees of prior information on parameter initialization. We furthermore showcase the training framework implementation on a complex model of glycolysis. Finally, we show an example of hybridizing kinetic model with a neural network if a reaction mechanism is unknown. These results show that our framework can be used to fit large metabolic kinetic models efficiently and provides a strong platform for modeling biological systems.
Implementation: Implementation of <i>jaxkineticmodel</i> is available as a Python package at https://github.com/AbeelLab/jaxkineticmodel.

The mammalian neocortex, organized into six cellular layers or laminae, forms a cortical network within layers. Layer-specific computations are crucial for sensory processing of visual stimuli within the primary visual cortex. Laminar recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) are a powerful tool to study neural activity within cortical layers. Electric brain stimulation is widely used in basic neuroscience and in a large range of clinical applications. However, the layer-specific effects of electric stimulation on LFPs remain unclear. To address this gap, we recorded laminar LFP from capuchin monkeys’ primary visual cortex while presenting a flash visual stimulus. Simultaneously, we applied a low-frequency sinusoidal current to the occipital lobe with an offset frequency to the flash stimulus repetition rate. We analyzed the modulation of visual-evoked potentials with respect to the phase of applied electric stimulation. Our results reveal that only the deeper layers, but not the superficial layers, show phase-dependent changes in LFP components with respect to the applied current. Employing a cortical column model, we show that these in vivo observations can be explained by phase-dependent changes in the driving force within neurons of deeper layers. Our findings offer crucial insight into the selective modulation of cortical layers through electrical stimulation, thus advancing approaches for more targeted neuromodulation.

                <p>by Ainsley Temudo, Nina Dolfen, Bradley R. King, Genevieve Albouy</p>

Memory systems in humans are less segregated than initially thought as learning tasks from different memory domains (e.g., declarative versus procedural) can recruit similar brain areas. However, it remains unclear whether the functional role of these overlapping brain regions – and the hippocampus in particular – is domain-general. Here, we test the hypothesis that the hippocampus encodes and preserves the temporal order of sequential information irrespective of the nature of that information. We used multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during the execution of learned sequences of movements and objects to assess brain patterns related to procedural and declarative memory processes, respectively. We also tested whether the hippocampus represents information about temporal order of items (here movements and objects in the motor and declarative domains, respectively) in a learned sequence irrespective of their nature. We also examined such coding in brain regions involved in both motor (primary and premotor cortices) and object (perirhinal cortex and parahippocampus) sequence learning. Our results suggest that hippocampal and perirhinal multivoxel activation patterns do not carry information about specific items or temporal position in a random series of objects or movements. Rather, these regions code for the representation of items in their learned temporal position in sequences irrespective of their nature (i.e., item-position coding). In contrast, although all other ROIs showed evidence of item-position coding, this representation could – at least partially – be attributed to the coding of other information such as position information. Altogether, our findings indicate that regions in the medial temporal lobe represent the temporal order of sequential information similarly in both the declarative and the motor memory domains. Our data suggest that these regions contribute to the development of item-position maps that might provide a cognitive framework for sequential behaviors irrespective of their nature.

                <p>by Ankita Sengupta, Devarajan Sridharan</p>

Reward expectation robustly guides both attention and decisions. Yet, whether common or distinct mechanisms mediate each of these processes remains unknown. Previous studies have often conflated the effect of reward expectation on sensory processing and decision-making because locations selected for sensory prioritization (sensitivity effects) were also prioritized for decisions (criterion effects). Here, we identify distinct forms of reward expectation that separably control spatial attention and decisional biases in human cortex. Sensitivity and criterion were independently modulated when expected rewards varied across locations (“space-specific”) or choices (“choice-specific”), respectively. Only sensitivity, not criterion, modulations reflected a limited, conserved attentional resource. Established neural and physiological signatures of attention, including gain modulation of event-related potentials, alpha-band power lateralization, and eye-movement biases, were elicited only by space-specific reward modulation. By contrast, neural correlates of decisional biases, including pre-stimulus alpha power suppression, selectively accompanied choice-specific reward modulation. Attention-related neural markers predicted sensitivity modulation by space-specific reward expectation but not criterion modulation by choice-specific reward expectation, indicating their distinct underlying mechanisms. Our findings uncover fundamentally dissociable behavioral and neural underpinnings of reward expectation effects on sensory and decisional selection, with critical implications for understanding how reward, attention, and choice are linked in the human brain.

The locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) system is involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Refining our understanding of LC function largely relies on selective transgene expression in LC-NE neurons, allowing targeted manipulation and readout of noradrenergic neurons. Here, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the most commonly used strategies to genetically target the LC, including different cre driver lines and promoter-mediated transgene expression. We report differences between these strategies in terms of transgene expression efficacy and specificity. Parallelly, we found no behavioral alterations in cre-expressing mice of any mouse line compared to wild-type littermates. Finally, to further facilitate the investigation of LC-NE function, we created a suite of constructs, including a reporter protein, a calcium indicator, and a light-driven cation channel, whose expression is mediated by the previously described PRS×8 promoter. These constructs allow identification, monitoring, and manipulation of LC-NE activity either in wild-type mice, or in combination with tissue-specific manipulations of different cre driver lines. The results of our study are crucial for the interpretation of previous experiments using the respective targeting strategies, as well as for the design of future studies.

                Abstract: Forensic anthropology is the study of skeletal remains for the identification of individuals and anthropology deals with study of human. Many research has been conducted to estimate stature from different body parts like foot, extremities, hand, vertebrae etc. In some cases, finding all body parts and bones in whole will be difficult in the crime scene for forensic examination. In such cases it becomes necessary to use other region such as the head and facial region for the estimation of height. Determination of height is an important in forensic examination for identification of the individual. This study was done to find the correlation between the stature and the morphological variations of the external auricular region for the estimation of stature for the purpose of forensic investigation. The study was conducted on 385 male individuals, total of 4 ear parameters were measured from both the ears using the digital caliper. The data was analyzed using Jamovi version 2.4.11. The result showed that there was positive correlation between all the dimensions with stature. The linear regression was done to find the statically significant difference between the stature and the parameters and it was found that the most predicted variable in males is the left ear length(p<0.001). This study concludes that the external auricular morphometry can be as an additional tool for the estimation of stature in the forensic investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-181/v2?src=rss">The comparison of totally ultrasound-guided versus fluoroscopy-guided shockwave lithotripsy in renal stone treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) has been a well-known therapy since years ago, especially for renal stones less than 20 mm. This study compared the effectiveness of totally ultrasound-guided (US-guided) and fluoroscopy-guided (FS-guided) SWL in treating renal and ureteral stones. A protocol has been registered in PROSPERO databases for systematic reviews. A systematic literature search was conducted in five online databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Scopus). We included all available articles that compared the effectiveness and safety of US-SWL to FS-SWL. A risk of bias assessment was done using Risk of Bias (Rob) Tools for randomized interventional studies and Risk of bias in non-randomized studies interventions (ROBINS-I) Tools for Non-randomized studies. The primary outcome was the stone-free rate, and the secondary outcome was the complication rate. Subgroup analyses were performed for adult and pediatric groups. A comprehensive literature search identified seven comparative articles that matched the criteria: two randomized trials and six retrospective cohort studies comprising 1,255 patients (609 using US-SWL). The results revealed a significant difference in overall stone-free rates between US-guided and FS-guided SWL RR 0.76(95% CI; 0.61-0.95, p=0.02) and in adults RR 0.76(95% CI; 0.60-0.96), but not children groups RR 0.68(95% CI; 0.24-1.88). US-SWL might be favourable due to the radiation-free procedure and real-time presentation. Complication rates were low, and no life-threatening complications were reported. In conclusion, US-guided SWL is more effective than FS-guided SWL for treating renal stones, with a low incidence of complications. Further randomized controlled trials with larger populations are needed to explore the comparison more accurately.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1134/v3?src=rss">Searching for non-English literature may be unnecessary for German HTA Reports [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Health technology assessment (HTA) reports are based on comprehensive information retrieval. Current standards discourage the use of search restrictions, such as publication date and language. Given limited resources, it was unclear whether the effort invested in screening and translating studies published in languages other than English provided relevant additional information compared with the inclusion of English-language publications alone. We therefore analysed the impact of non-English publications on the conclusions of HTA reports produced by the German HTA agency, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Methods We determined whether non-English publications were included in all German HTA reports on non-drug interventions (published by IQWiG between 06/2007 to 08/2018) and on selected drug interventions. If at least one non-English publication was included, we assessed for each endpoint whether or not the exclusion of non-English publications changed the conclusion. If a non-English publication did not contain information relevant to the HTA report, we classified the publication as “not relevant”. Results Of 70 HTA reports, 38 (54%) included 126 non-English publications. In 4 reports (6%) with 50 endpoints investigated in 39 PICO questions, the exclusion of a total of 10 non-English publications led to a change in the conclusions for 13 endpoints (8 PICO questions). This was largely due to the fact that in many cases, non-English publications were the predominant or only literature available, resulting in a lack of analysable data after their exclusion. Conclusions In general, studies only published in non-English languages have little influence on the conclusions of German HTA reports. For the vast majority of topics, a language restriction to English seems justified. Studies published in non-English languages may be useful in exceptional cases, for example when an intervention is only available in certain countries.

                Katahira et al. show scRNA-seq indicating roles of mitochondrial membrane architecture during VSV infection. Altered mitochondrial structure-metabolism by F1FO ATP synthase inhibition, inducing oligomerization of the complex, reduces viral replication. Consistently, MIC60 deletion in CD11c-expressing cells limits viral replication and consequently reduces prolonged immune activation, associated with accumulation of anti-viral itaconate.

NXT2 also interacts with the human testis-specific NXF1 paralogues NXF2 and NXF3. Mutations in NXT2 and NXF3 are linked to a disruption of nuclear export, leading to defective germ cell development and human male infertility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105525">The C-terminus of the multi-drug efflux pump EmrE prevents proton leak by gating transport</a></h4>

              
                The model multi-drug efflux pump from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, EmrE, can perform multiple types of transport leading to different biological outcomes, conferring resistance to some drug substrates and enhancing susceptibility to others. While transporters have traditionally been classified as antiporters, symporters, or uniporters, there is growing recognition that some transporters may exhibit mixed modalities. This raises new questions about their regulation and mechanism. Here, we show that the C-terminal tail of EmrE acts as a secondary gate, preventing proton leak in the absence of drug. Substrate binding unlocks this gate, allowing transport to proceed. Truncation of the C-terminal tail (∆107-EmrE) leads to altered pH regulation of alternating access, an important kinetic step in the transport cycle, as measured by NMR. ∆107-EmrE has increased proton leak in proteoliposomes, and bacteria expressing this mutant have reduced growth. Molecular dynamics simulations of ∆107-EmrE show the formation of a water wire from the open face of the transporter to the primary binding site in the core, facilitating proton leak. In WT-EmrE, the C-terminal tail forms specific interactions that block the formation of the water wire. Together, these data strongly support the C-terminus of EmrE acting as a secondary gate that regulates access to the primary binding site.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105703">Heat stress induces phage tolerance in Enterobacteriaceae</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic resistance and tolerance present significant challenges in global healthcare, necessitating alternative strategies such as phage therapy. However, the rapid emergence of phage-resistant mutants poses a potential risk. Here, using <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> ATCC 43816 and its lytic phage Kp11 as a model system, we investigated bacterial persistence against phages, characterized by heterogeneous survival, analogous to antibiotic persistence. We found that heat treatment enhanced persistence and increased bacterial survival under phage exposure, subsequently promoting the evolution of phage resistance. Further experiments demonstrated that heat stress leads to a reduction in envelope components, thereby inhibiting phage DNA injection. Additionally, this heat-induced reduction resulted in systematic alterations in envelope stress responses, rendering bacteria tolerant to the antibiotic polymyxin while making them hypersensitive to pH changes and immune clearance. Our findings provide novel insights into bacteria-phage interactions and highlight potential challenges in implementing phage therapy in clinical settings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94628">The molecular logic of Gtr1/2- and Pib2-dependent TORC1 regulation in budding yeast</a></h4>

              
                The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex 1 (TORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that, in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the highly conserved small GTPases, Gtr1/2, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding protein, Pib2. However, it was unclear if/how Gtr1/2 and Pib2 cooperate to control TORC1. Here, we report that this dual regulator system pushes TORC1 into at least three distinct signaling states: (i) a Gtr1/2 on, Pib2 on, rapid growth state in nutrient replete conditions; (ii) a Gtr1/2 inhibited, Pib2 on, adaptive/slow growth state in poor-quality growth medium; and (iii) a Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 off, quiescent state in starvation conditions. We suggest that other signaling pathways work in a similar way to drive a multilevel response via a single kinase, but the behavior has been overlooked since most studies follow signaling to a single reporter protein.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91609">Highly sensitive in vivo detection of dynamic changes in enkephalins following acute stress in mice</a></h4>

              
                Enkephalins are opioid peptides that modulate analgesia, reward, and stress. In vivo detection of enkephalins remains difficult due to transient and low endogenous concentrations and inherent sequence similarity. To begin to address this, we previously developed a system combining in vivo optogenetics with microdialysis and a highly sensitive mass spectrometry-based assay to measure opioid peptide release in freely moving rodents (Al-Hasani et al., 2018, eLife). Here, we show improved detection resolution and stabilization of enkephalin detection, which allowed us to investigate enkephalin release during acute stress. We present an analytical method for real-time, simultaneous detection of Met- and Leu-enkephalin (Met-Enk and Leu-Enk) in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) after acute stress. We confirm that acute stress activates enkephalinergic neurons in the NAcSh using fiber photometry and that this leads to the release of Met- and Leu-Enk. We also demonstrate the dynamics of Met- and Leu-Enk release as well as how they correlate to one another in the ventral NAc shell, which was previously difficult due to the use of approaches that relied on mRNA transcript levels rather than posttranslational products. This approach increases spatiotemporal resolution, optimizes the detection of Met-Enk through methionine oxidation, and provides novel insight into the relationship between Met- and Leu-Enk following stress.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103256">Magnetically steered cell therapy for reduction of intraocular pressure as a treatment strategy for open-angle glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                Trabecular meshwork (TM) cell therapy has been proposed as a next-generation treatment for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma, the most common cause of irreversible blindness. Using a magnetic cell steering technique with excellent efficiency and tissue-specific targeting, we delivered two types of cells into a mouse model of glaucoma: either human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) or induced pluripotent cell derivatives (iPSC-TM cells). We observed a 4.5 [3.1, 6.0] mmHg or 27% reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) for 9 months after a single dose of only 1500 magnetically steered hAMSCs, explained by increased outflow through the conventional pathway and associated with a higher TM cellularity. iPSC-TM cells were also effective, but less so, showing only a 1.9 [0.4, 3.3] mmHg or 13% IOP reduction and increased risk of tumorigenicity. In both cases, injected cells remained detectable in the iridocorneal angle 3 weeks post-transplantation. Based on the locations of the delivered cells, the mechanism of IOP lowering is most likely paracrine signaling. We conclude that magnetically steered hAMSC cell therapy has potential for long-term treatment of ocular hypertension in glaucoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101984">The ESCRT protein CHMP5 restricts bone formation by controlling endolysosome-mitochondrion-mediated cell senescence</a></h4>

              
                The dysfunction of the cellular endolysosomal pathway, such as in lysosomal storage diseases, can cause severe musculoskeletal disorders. However, how endolysosomal dysfunction causes musculoskeletal abnormalities remains poorly understood, limiting therapeutic options. Here, we report that CHMP5, a member of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III protein family, is essential to maintain the endolysosomal pathway and regulate bone formation in osteogenic lineage cells. Genetic ablation of <i>Chmp5</i> in mouse osteogenic cells increases bone formation in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, <i>Chmp5</i> deletion causes endolysosomal dysfunction by decreasing the VPS4A protein, and CHMP5 overexpression is sufficient to increase the VPS4A protein. Subsequently, endolysosomal dysfunction disturbs mitochondrial functions and increases mitochondrial ROS, ultimately resulting in skeletal cell senescence. Senescent skeletal cells cause abnormal bone formation by combining cell-autonomous and paracrine actions. Importantly, the elimination of senescent cells using senolytic drugs can alleviate musculoskeletal abnormalities in <i>Chmp5</i> conditional knockout mice. Therefore, our results show that cell senescence represents an underpinning mechanism and a therapeutic target for musculoskeletal disorders caused by the aberrant endolysosomal pathway, such as in lysosomal storage diseases. These results also uncover the function and mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence by affecting the endolysosomal-mitochondrial pathway.

">Listening Beyond The Labels</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition of cognitive decline, presents formidable challenges to patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Early identification is essential for successful intervention, but traditional diagnosis requires expensive neuroimaging and lengthy clinical assessments, which compromise access. This study proposes a semi-supervised machine learning strategy for AD diagnosis based on acoustic features from brief speech samples. The approach takes advantage of mel-spectrogram features to extract vocal patterns without manual transcription or linguistic preprocessing. Informative sound patterns are detected using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that gradually adds unlabeled speech data during training through pseudo-labeling. By emphasizing scalable, non-invasive methods that rely solely on unprocessed vocal inputs, this work presents a practical solution for large-scale cognitive screening in resource-limited settings.

                The letter acuity impairment in the amblyopic eye often exceeds predictions made from the cut-off spatial frequency for grating detection. Spatial scrambling in the amblyopic eye's projections to the visual cortex has been proposed to bear some responsibility for this additional deficit. Using a novel stimulus algorithm that creates spatially scrambled bandpass letters, we generated stimuli simulating either: i) "cortical scrambling" at the output of oriented model "simple cells", or ii) "subcortical scrambling" of isotropic subunits that combine to form these simple cells. We also investigated a more conventional "noise masking" with bandpass noise. We performed two bandpass letter identification experiments, equating the stimuli shown to each eye by normalising either: i) their contrast, presenting them at four times their contrast detection threshold; or ii) their spatial scale, presenting them at twice the participant's acuity threshold for each eye. At the group level, we found that the amblyopic eye is less efficient at performing letter identification in bandpass noise. We did not find an overall significant difference with either scrambling type when comparing efficiency between the amblyopic and fellow eye, but we did find such a difference when partitioning our participants by their stereopsis ability. In further analyses of the pattern of mistakes, we found the amblyopic eye shows a distinctive behaviour which correlates with the acuity deficit for both types of scrambling. These results demonstrate that our scrambled stimuli interrogate a component of amblyopic vision that is functionally distinct from that addressed by contrast noise masking.

">Psilocybin has no immediate or persistent analgesic effect in acute and chronic mouse pain models</a></h4>

              
                The psychedelic psilocybin may have lasting therapeutic effects for patients with chronic pain syndromes. Some clinical and preclinical data suggest these putative benefits derive from direct analgesic effects. However, this possibility has not been comprehensively tested in preclinical models. Here, we show that psilocybin is not analgesic over a range of doses across multiple pain assays and models of acute and chronic inflammatory, neuropathic, or musculoskeletal pain in mice.

">Human TDP-43 overexpression in zebrafish motor neurons triggers MND-like phenotypes through gain-of-function mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), including intraneuronal cytoplasmic mislocalisation and aggregation is a feature of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD), limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and alzheimers disease (AD). Unravelling the causes and functional consequences of TDP-43 dysregulation is paramount to understanding disease mechanisms as well as identifying effective therapeutic targets. Here we present a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of three stable transgenic zebrafish models that express human TDP-43 variants in motor neurons. We demonstrate that overexpression of predominantly nuclear wildtype TDP-43, cytoplasm-targeted TDP-43, and an ALS-linked variant (G294V) each induce toxic gain-of-function effects, leading to impaired motor function, motor neuron loss, and muscle atrophy. Importantly, these models reveal distinct phenotypes, with the ALS-linked mutant exhibiting axonal transport deficits and neuromuscular junction disruption, while cytoplasmic mislocalised TDP-43 heightened susceptibility to oxidative stress. Two FDA-approved drugs used to treat ALS, edaravone and riluzole, were examined in these models and revealed that edaravone, but not riluzole, was effective in rescuing motor deficits associated with cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression and, to a lesser extent, mutant TDP-43_G294V. Collectively, these findings reveal distinct pathological consequences of TDP-43 dysregulation, providing neuron-centric mechanistic insights, and establish the humanised TDP-43 zebrafish as an efficient system for preclinical therapeutic testing.

">Education Shapes the Link Between EEG Aperiodic Components and Cognitive Aging</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging brings widespread shifts in aperiodic (non-oscillatory) electroencephalographic (EEG) components, which may underlie physiological changes in cognitive performance. Education, a known protective factor against age-related decline in cognitive performance, has been largely overlooked in studies linking aperiodic EEG components to cognition. This study addresses this gap, hypothesizing that education moderates the interplay between age, aperiodic components, and cognitive performance, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. We reanalyzed an open-source EEG dataset of 714 healthy individuals aged 18-91 years using Generalized Additive Mixed Models. Aperiodic exponent and offset both declined with age, but higher education levels mitigated these declines. Notably, exponent and offset interacted with age and education in predicting MMSE performance in the bilateral cingulate, left hippocampus, bilateral parietal, right occipital, and left temporal regions. Among older adults, the relationship between the aperiodic components and cognitive performance diverged by education: those with lower education showed worse cognitive outcomes with lower exponents and offsets, whereas higher-educated individuals after 60 years showed a reverse pattern, with lower exponents and offsets predicting better MMSE performance. Our findings suggest that the link between aperiodic components and cognitive aging is not straightforward but depends on moderating factors such as education. These results underscore the importance of accounting for individual differences, like educational background, when exploring age-related changes in EEG aperiodic components and cognition.

">Neural mechanisms of structural inference: an EEG investigation of linguistic phrase structure categorization</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension is a complex cognitive process of understanding spoken or written language, during which the brain derives meanings and interprets messages by constructing hierarchical structures from word sequences. A key component underlying this process is structural inference. This computation determines the syntactic category ('head') of phrases, such as noun phrases (NP) and verb phrases (VP). Categorization confers distinct semantic and distributional properties. However, isolating neural correlates of structural inference is challenging, as modulations of syntactic category usually alter lexical content. Here, we collected the electroencephalography (EEG) data while participants read Mandarin NPs and VPs, which differ in their syntactic 'headedness' but with lexical-semantics, lexical-syntactic categories and word order strictly conserved. We found significant theta power increases at left central-parietal scalp sites in NPs relative to VPs around the presentation (0-210 ms) of the nouns, where only the nouns in NPs project a head. Both NPs and VPs relative to one-word phrases exhibited spatiotemporally consistent low-frequency power increases at the point of linguistic composition, consistent with previous studies. Overall, our findings offer novel constraints on neurocomputational accounts of linguistic structure-building through these previously undocumented signatures of syntactic inference.

">Neural Timescale of Adolescents Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by heterogeneous symptomatology and complex neurodevelopmental underpinnings. Here, we investigated whether cortical intrinsic neural timescales (INT), a measure of temporal stability in neural activity, are altered in adolescents with MDD and whether these alterations relate to clinical symptoms, suicidality, early life adversity, and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Using resting state fMRI in adolescents with MDD and healthy controls (HCs), we found widespread reductions in INT in frontal, parietal, and sensorimotor regions, with a notable prolongation in the left temporoparietal junction. Disrupted timescales significantly impaired network modularity and clustering, and SVR based machine learning revealed that altered INT patterns predicted individual depression and anxiety severity. INT abnormalities were further associated with suicidal ideation and childhood trauma, particularly emotional and physical neglect. Biophysical modeling linked INT variations to local recurrent excitation and external input strength, differing between HCs and MDD. Spatial correlations with PET derived neurotransmitter receptor maps demonstrated that INT alterations colocalize with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic systems. Transcriptomic enrichment analysis revealed associations with genes involved in mitochondrial function, synaptic signaling, and metabolic regulation. Together, these findings identify neural timescale disruption as a core pathophysiological feature of adolescent MDD, bridging macroscale dynamics with microcircuit and molecular architecture. INT may serve as a promising biomarker and mechanistic target for precision psychiatry in youth depression.

">Long-term independent use of an intracortical brain-computer interface for speech and cursor control</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide naturalistic communication and digital access to people with severe paralysis by decoding neural activity associated with attempted speech and movement. Recent work has demonstrated highly accurate intracortical BCIs for speech and cursor control, but two critical capabilities needed for practical viability were unmet: independent at-home operation without researcher assistance, and reliable long-term performance supporting accurate speech and cursor decoding. Here, we demonstrate the independent and near-daily use of a multimodal BCI with novel brain-to-text speech and computer cursor decoders by a man with paralysis and severe dysarthria due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Over nearly two years, the participant used the BCI for more than 3,800 cumulative hours to maintain rich interpersonal communication with his family and friends, independently control his personal computer, and sustain full-time employment -- despite being paralyzed. He communicated 183,060 sentences -- totaling 1,960,163 words -- at an average rate of 56.1 words per minute. He labeled 92.3% of sentences as being decoded at least mostly correctly. In formal quantifications of performance where he was asked to say words presented on a screen, attempted speech was consistently decoded with over 99% word accuracy (125,000 word vocabulary). The participant also used the speech BCI as keyboard input and the cursor BCI as mouse input to control his personal computer, enabling him to send text messages, emails, and to browse the internet. These results demonstrate that intracortical BCIs have the potential to support independent use in the home, marking a critical step toward practical assistive technology for people with severe motor impairment.

">Towards Precision Functional Brain Network Mapping in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinsons disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that leads to widespread disruption of large-scale brain networks and is further complicated by substantial individual variability in symptomology, progression rates, and treatment response. Consequently, the investigation of individual differences in networks measured via resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) may provide insight. However, most RSFC studies are unable to identify interindividual differences due to poor reliability and group average network definitions. Precision RSFC addresses these shortcomings through extended data collection, strict denoising, and individual network definition, but remains untested in PD. Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of precision RSFC studies in PD. Methods: We collected >100 minutes of RSFC data from 20 PD and 6 healthy controls participants. We evaluated the level of motion, reliability and stability of RSFC measures in each participant and contrasted these measures between the PD and HC groups, as well as compared to a conventional 5 minutes of RSFC data. In addition, we created individualized brain network measures in PD participants to establish feasibility in this population. Results: Using precision methods, the PD group produced reliable and stable RSFC measures of brain networks of similar quality to healthy controls and substantially better than conventional methods. Individualized network maps from individuals with PD demonstrate differences from group averages and from each other, including in key motor systems. Conclusion: Precision RSFC is feasible and reliable in individuals with PD. This approach holds promise for advancing personalized diagnostics and identifying brain-based biomarkers underlying clinical variability in PD.

">Neuroplasticity of directed connectivity in long-term meditation: Evidence from EEG Granger causality</a></h4>

              
                The objective of the present study was to characterize the effects of long-term meditation (LTM) on directed connectivity patterns during resting-state and meditative brain states. Specifically, it was aimed to identify major cortical sources of information flow and target regions of information influx, and to reveal which frequency-specific oscillatory networks are critically involved in directing information flux in experienced meditators. Multivariate Granger causality (GC) was computed from high-resolution EEG signals recorded from long-term (LTM, n = 22) and short-term meditators (STM, n = 17) in four conditions: rest, Focused Attention Meditation, Open Monitoring Meditation, and Loving Kindness Meditation. GC was analyzed in the time and frequency domains to assess frequency-specific networks supporting the directed connectivity between key cortical regions (frontal and parietal) in the two hemispheres. According to the results, long-practice meditation was characterized by a significant increase of information flow (1) from posterior to frontal cortical regions, and (2) across frontal regions of the two hemispheres. These dominant transfers were supported by multi-spectral oscillatory networks involving theta, alpha and beta frequency bands, with most prominent expression of GC alpha peak. This pattern of enhanced information transfer in LTM relative to STM was observed in both resting state and each meditation state. These results suggest that long-term meditation is associated with a shift in resting-state brain dynamics toward reduced reliance on slow, undirected intrinsic oscillations, and enhanced directional connectivity in frequencies linked to attention and cognitive control. The dominant posterior-to-anterior directionality points to a reorganization of cognitive control networks that may support the phenomenological qualities of extensive meditation (sustained attention, internal attention, present-moment awareness, and reduced cognitive elaboration). The similarity of between-group differences in directionality patterns across states points to a neuroplastic effect of long-term meditation and highlights meditation as a potential model for investigating adaptive neuroplasticity in large-scale brain networks.

">Psychedelic 5-HT2A agonist increases spontaneous and evoked 5-Hz oscillations in visual and retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception appears largely stable in time. However, psychophysical studies have revealed that theta waves (4-8 Hz) can modulate perception and have been linked to various cognitive states and functions. Neither the contribution of theta waves to cortical activity nor their impact during aberrant brain states have been resolved at high spatiotemporal scales. Here, using cortex-wide population voltage imaging in awake mice, we found that bouts of 5-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex are accompanied by similar oscillations in the retrosplenial cortex, occurring both spontaneously and evoked by visual stimulation. Injection of psychotropic 5-HT2AR agonist induced a significant increase in spontaneous 5-Hz oscillations, and also increased the power, occurrence probability and temporal persistence of visually evoked 5-Hz oscillations. This modulation of 5-Hz oscillations in both cortical areas indicates a strengthening of top-down control of perception, supporting an underlying mechanism of perceptual filling and visual hallucinations.

">Satiety Does Not Silence Food Attention: BMI Modulates Attentional Bias Toward High-Calorie Cues</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attentional bias (AB) for palatable foods has been linked to overeating, yet data on its modulation with body-mass index (BMI) and hunger/satiety are inconsistent. We tested whether hunger, sensory-specific satiety and BMI interact to shape automatic capture of attention by real high-calorie snack foods. Methods: Two emotional-attentional-blink (EAB) experiments presented food distractors either 300 msec (lag-3) or 900 msec (lag-9) before a neutral target. Experiment 1 (N = 183; whole BMI range) randomly assigned participants to taste (non-satiated), satiated or non-eating conditions; the snacks eaten (or not eaten) subsequently re-appeared as distractors in the EAB task. Experiment 2 (N = 61; 31 overweight/obese, 30 normal-weight) manipulated hunger/satiety states and snack type (consumed vs. novel) orthogonally, in a double session design. Results: Experiment 1; food images presented at lag-3 reduced target detection compared with lag-9 (OR = 0.61, CI 0.50 - 0.75, p < .01. Higher BMI predicted a larger AB when hungry, but a smaller AB when satiated (OR = 0.65, CI 0.48 - 0.88, p < 0.01). Experiment 2; For novel snacks, an interaction revealed that participants with overweight/obesity retained robust AB after satiation, whereas AB declined for participants with normal-weight (OR = 2.45, CI 1.09 - 5.51, p = 0.03). For snacks just eaten, AB remained significant in both groups (lag-3 vs. lag-9: OR = 0.37, CI 0.25 - 0.55, p < .001). Conclusions: Real-food cues automatically biased attention regardless of metabolic state, with BMI modulating this effect: even when satiated, individuals with overweight/obesity continue to orient their attention toward both familiar and novel high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that satiety signals alone may be insufficient to curb attentional capture by food in obesity, highlighting the need for interventions that target attentional control and limit food availability.

">Repetition-related reductions in neural activity support improved behavior through increases in oscillatory power</a></h4>

              
                Repeatedly processing an object leads to subsequent behavioral improvements in its identification and reductions in associated neural activity, a form of neural processing efficiency that multiple theoretical models have attempted to explain. Using simultaneous fMRI-EEG in humans during object naming, we find that stimulus-driven oscillatory power from high (gamma) to low frequencies (theta) increases and resolves earlier with repetition in task-engaged frontal and occipitotemporal brain regions identified as showing repetition suppression in fMRI. Changes in gamma oscillatory power in these regions were correlated with behavioral priming across subjects and additionally with fMRI repetition suppression in left frontal cortex, providing multimodal support for a novel mixture of the previously proposed Synchrony and Facilitation models.

">Music-evoked reactivation during continuous perception is associated with enhanced subsequent recall of naturalistic events</a></h4>

              
                Music is a potent cue for recalling personal experiences, yet the neural basis of music-evoked memory remains elusive. We address this question by using the full-length film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to examine how repeated musical themes reactivate previously encoded events in cortex and shape next-day recall. Participants in an fMRI study viewed either the original film (with repeated musical themes) or a no-music version. By comparing neural activity patterns between these groups, we found that music-evoked reactivation of neural patterns linked to earlier scenes in the default mode network was associated with improved subsequent recall. This relationship was specific to the music condition and persisted when we controlled for a proxy measure of initial encoding strength (spatial intersubject correlation), suggesting that music-evoked reactivation may play a role in making event memories stick that is distinct from what happens at initial encoding.

">Sleep promotes aversive value coding in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a state of reduced behavioural responsiveness to the external world. Lowered arousal is thought to arise from sensory gating in the brain, yet there is compelling evidence that stimuli can still be processed to some degree. Which aspects of sensory information are processed during sleep remains largely unknown. Here, we perform comprehensive recordings of activity from multiple neuron types during sleep and wakefulness in the Drosophila olfactory association center. We find that baseline activity of dopamine neurons (DANs) is distinct between active, rest and sleep states, enabling a decoder to predict when the fly is asleep. Optogenetic inhibition of DANs acutely induces sleep and lowers odor-evoked arousal, suggesting causality between DAN activity and behavior. We then examine odor processing during sleep, and find that whereas coding of odor identity in Kenyon cells (KCs) remains intact, coding of odor value in DANs is altered. Specifically, DANs encoding positive (attractive) and negative (aversive) values change their odor responses in an opposing manner, producing more aversive odor representations during sleep. Consistent with these changes in neural activity, sleeping flies awoken by odors show reduced approach and increased avoidance behaviour. Taken together, our data reveal that the brain does not simply suppress the propagation of sensory signals during sleep; rather, it utilizes different cell types to retain or modify specific aspects of sensory information. The aversive odor evaluation in DANs may have ethological benefits as it suppresses the motivation to pursue attractive odors during sleep and primes defensive action when aroused by the scent of potential dangers.

">Cortico-striatal dynamics across working memory stages</a></h4>

              
                Working memory depends on the temporary retention and manipulation of information, bridging the gap between short-term memory and information processing functions. Working memory relies on the temporary retention and manipulation of information, bridging short-term storage with broader cognitive processing. However, when the same working memory task is repeated over several days, it raises the question of whether the rule or task set becomes automated (or proceduralized). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is crucial for working memory. Yet, the role of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in the automation (proceduralization) of rules or task sets remains to be clarified. Using a longitudinal approach of the delay non-match to place (DNMP) task in a T-maze combined to silencing the mPFC or DLS in mice, we show that the mPFC becomes less critical in the maintenance phase of the task as behaviour progressively shifts toward automation. During this phase, the DLS facilitates automated processing. Accordingly, silencing the DLS during maintenance of the task triggers an adaptation in learning strategies, reactivating a goal-directed behaviour. Our findings strengthen the view that memory traces result from a dynamic reorganization of neural networks, challenging the classical view that information merely migrates between brain structures. We here propose that the memory trace remains in a dormant state less energy-consuming for the system while still allowing for rapid flexibility in case of task modification.

">Inhibiting Clarinet/CLA-1 restores function to injured motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                To regain function, injured axons must both regenerate and reform synapses with appropriate postsynaptic cells. We found that inhibiting the scaffolding protein Clarinet/CLA-1, a C. elegans ortholog of Piccolo and Fife, robustly improves axon regeneration. Despite the importance of CLA-1 during synapse development, disrupting the medium isoform of CLA-1 increases the number of axons that regenerate to the neuromuscular junction without significantly influencing synapse reformation. Consequently, the axons that do regenerate are capable of regaining function. Mechanistically, the enhanced axon regeneration observed in cla-1(-) mutants depends on the function of PTRN-1, a microtubule minus-end binding protein. Our data supports a model where loss of CLA-1 promotes PTRN-1 function, which speeds trafficking of injury-related cargo to and from the lesion, thus improving repair. Together, our results reveal a highly conserved synaptic active zone protein that can be manipulated to enhance axon regeneration without sacrificing the function of the repaired axons.

">Multiplexed detection of nuclear immediate early gene expression reveals hippocampal neuronal subpopulations that engage in the acquisition and updating of spatial experience</a></h4>

              
                Acquired spatial representations are not static. Each re-exposure to the spatial environment stimulates retrieval of the stored experience followed by information re-encoding, including updating if the environment has changed. It remains unclear if the same neurons are involved in these three events. Here, we used a multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) approach that detected time-locked nuclear immediate early gene(IEG) expression to identify hippocampal neuronal ensembles that were engaged in the acquisition of a spatial representation, as well as its subsequent stabilization and/or updating. Responses were assessed in distal(dCA1) and proximal CA1(pCA1) of male rats. Homer1a was used to detect neuronal recruitment triggered by novel learning of a holeboard environment(HB). cFos and Arc expression was used to detect ensemble stability and/or expansion, or ensemble remodeling, respectively, that was triggered by animal exposure to the now familiar HB that included novel objects(HBO) 25min after the initial HB exposure. Novel HB exposure resulted in nuclear Homer1a expression in both dCA1 and pCA1. Subsequent HBO triggered significant cFos and Arc expression only in dCA1. IEG co-labelling (Homer1a/cFos, Homer1a/Arc and Homer1a/cFos/Arc) was also only evident in dCA1, reflecting both re-iteration and remodeling of dCA1, but not pCA1 ensembles. In sum, we show that the contiguous acquisition and updating of spatial representations recruits distinct populations of CA1-neurons reflecting ensemble selection and stabilization, as well as ensemble remodeling. Moreover, whereas dCA1 and pCA1 are involved in the acquisition of the original spatial representation, only dCA1 is engaged in representation updating related to changes in spatial content information.

">Genome-wide analysis reveals pathways important for the development and maturation of excitatory synaptic connections to GABAergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                A high degree of cell and circuit-specific regulation has presented challenges for efforts to precisely define molecular mechanisms controlling synapse formation and maturation. Here, we pursue an unbiased forward genetic approach to identify C. elegans genes involved in the formation and maturation of cholinergic synaptic connections with GABAergic motor neurons as indicated by the distribution of GFP-tagged postsynaptic AChRs in GABAergic dendrites. We identified mutations in 3 genes that identify key processes in synapse/circuit maturation: postsynaptic receptor assembly, cargo trafficking, and synapse structural organization. Mutation of the RUN domain (RPIP8, UNC-14, and NESCA) cargo adaptor unc-14 dramatically impacted both dendritic spines and overall GABAergic neuron morphology. In contrast, mutation of the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha subunit unc-63 caused a failure in AChR assembly in GABAergic neurons but did not significantly alter dendritic spine structure or abundance. Notably, specific expression of wild type unc-14 cDNA in either GABAergic neurons or presynaptic cholinergic neurons was not sufficient to rescue the unc-14 mutant phenotype while pan neuronal expression provided significant rescue, indicating that disruptions in GABAergic neuron morphology arise from compound effects. Finally, we obtained a mutation in the Liprin-; synaptic scaffold syd-2 that produces a stop codon in a C-terminal SAM domain and has severe effects on dendritic spines and AChR localization. Our unbiased strategy identified key genes that implicate three distinct cellular processes important for synapse/circuit development and maturation. The identification of these genes from our screen highlights how mechanisms for receptor assembly, cargo trafficking and synapse structural organization each contribute to circuit connectivity.

                Chronic stroke leads to enduring neurological deficits and remains a major clinical challenge. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical organoids (COs) offer promise for regenerative therapies, yet their application in chronic stroke remains understudied, in part due to limited tools for monitoring graft in vivo. Here, we present a Multimodal Imaging Platform for Organoid Tracking (MIPOT), which integrates MRI, bioluminescence imaging, light microscopy, and two-photon fluorescence microscopy to noninvasively track transplanted COs in the post-stroke brain over time. Using MIPOT, we verified precise delivery of COs into cleaned stroke cavities, observed progressive declines in viability within the first 10 days, and introduced labeling methods for functional in vivo tracking of COs at subcellular resolution. By 4 weeks post-transplantation, histological analysis revealed survival of COs in the cerebral cortex. Notably, COs engrafted into the hippocampus displayed enhanced maturation, underscoring the role of local microenvironments in graft integration. MIPOT enables dynamic, noninvasive evaluation of hiPSC COs in chronic stroke, providing a foundation for mechanistic studies and translational development of organoid-based therapies.

                Neurodegenerative disease is marked not just by loss of proteins or cells, but by dynamic rewiring of macromolecular interaction networks that precede and drive pathology. Here, we present the first temporally resolved, systems-scale map of multi-protein complex remodeling in a tauopathy model, integrating cofractionation mass spectrometry, quantitative phosphoproteomics, and machine learning to decode phosphorylation-dependent shifts in protein interactomes across disease progression. This interactomic atlas identifies functionally validated assemblies, including MAPT::Dpysl2 and Cyfip1::actin complexes that modulate early disease phenotypes in vivo. By revealing how phosphorylation tunes macromolecular complex architecture and function, this work reframes tauopathy as a disease of dynamic network instability, and establishes a generalizable framework for early detection and mechanistic dissection of neurodegeneration.

                Collective animal behaviors arise from a complex interplay between internal physiological states and external environmental cues. In Caenorhabditis elegans, favorable conditions promote dispersal, while stressors like food scarcity or overcrowding trigger aggregation. Here, we describe a distinct behavior termed as swarming, where C. elegans move and feed in aggregates despite abundant food availability. While environmental factors have been implicated in this behavior, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a novel role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions in sensory neurons to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype. Our findings reveal a putative neuromodulatory pathway critical for swarming behavior in C. elegans.

">Cerebrospinal fluid-driven ependymal motile cilia defects are implicated in multiple sclerosis pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in which autoreactive immune cells migrate through a damaged blood brain barrier, resulting in focal demyelinating lesions of both the white and grey matter. Of increasing interest is the repeated observation that beyond focal lesions, there are also diffuse, surface-in gradients of pathology in MS, wherein damage is most severe directly adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting surfaces, such as the subpial and periventricular areas. This observation suggests that toxic factors within MS CSF may be contributing to the emergence and/or evolution of surface-in gradients. Directly separating the CSF from the periventricular parenchyma are ependymal cells - a glial epithelium that are equipped with tufts of motile cilia which are critical for circulating CSF solutes and regulating local fluid flow. While damage to ependymal cilia has the potential to drastically modify CSF homeostasis and thus contribute to the damage of CSF exposed regions, these motile cellular structures have yet to be investigated in the context of MS. Methods: We first conducted single cell RNA sequencing of fresh human periventricular brain tissue containing ependymal cells from MS patients and non-MS disease controls. We subsequently collected CSF from MS patients and exposed cultured rodent ependymal cells to this CSF in order to evaluate impact on ependymal ciliary function. To complement our direct evaluation of cilia in the context of MS, we also confirmed whether cilia were altered in a classic animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and also designed a novel transgenic animal model to evaluate the cellular and behavioural effect(s) of adult ependymal ciliary disruption. Results: Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of human ependymal cells in MS demonstrated largescale dysregulation of ciliary genes and in situ stains of MS brain tissue confirmed a loss of ependymal cilia. Exposure of ependymal cells to MS CSF led to transcriptional modification of ciliary gene and protein expression and reduced ciliary beating frequency. Likewise, analysis of ependymal cells in EAE also demonstrated altered cilia gene and protein expression. Conditional knockout in adult mice, of the critical cilia-associated gene Ccdc39 in ependymal cells led to transient ventricular enlargement, increased periventricular microglial density, and alterations in nesting behaviour. Conclusion: These data suggest that motile cilia in ependymal cells are dysregulated in CNS autoimmunity. More importantly, however, they provide evidence to suggest that ependymal cilia disruption could play an active role in the development of periventricular pathology in MS and can lead to behavioural deficits that may underlie aspects of non-motor MS symptomatology.

">Sensory-evoked perturbational complexity in human EEG: Effects of stimulus temperature and peripheral sensitisation in nociceptive processing</a></h4>

              
                The perturbational complexity index (PCI), grounded in systems dynamic and information theory, quantifies the brain's capacity for differentiation and integration of neural activity. While it has been used to characterise consciousness states following transcranial magnetic stimulation, its responsiveness to sensory perturbations remains underexplored. Here, using two publicly available datasets, we computed state-transition PCI from thermal-evoked responses recorded over 3264 scalp channels. Dataset 1 combined three stimulus intensities (10{degrees}C, 42{degrees}C, 60{degrees}C) with topical application of thermosensitive TRP; channel agonists (menthol 20%, capsaicin 1%) or vehicle; Dataset 2 manipulated the block wise transition probability of receiving cold (15{degrees}C) or hot (58{degrees}C) stimulation. PCI scaled non-linearly with temperature, being lowest at the intermediate 42{degrees}C and highest at the cold and hot extremes (Datasets 1 and 2). PCI was sensitive both to peripheral sensitisation, as topical menthol and capsaicin selectively reduced PCI during cold stimulation (Dataset 1), and to changes in block-wise stimulus probability (Dataset 2). Across all analyses, classical ERP peak measures (N2-P2 amplitude/latency) failed to explain PCI variance. These findings demonstrate that sensory-evoked PCI reflects the brain's response to exogenous, sensory-driven perturbations, quantifying changes in neural complexity associated with both stimulus intensity, peripheral sensitisation and probabilistic manipulations. This supports its broader applicability as a measure of temporal and spatial differentiation in the domain of sensory and pain neuroscience.

">Discourse Focus and Memory Encoding: The Role of Trial-Level Alpha Power</a></h4>

              
                The rapid, continuous flow of spoken language places strong demands on attention, and it is thought that listeners meet these demands by predicting when important information will occur and allocating attention accordingly. However, to date there is little direct evidence for the involvement of preparatory attention during language processing. In this study, we investigate preparatory attention during spoken language comprehension by measuring alpha neural activity with EEG, a known measure of temporal attentional preparation. Alpha activity leading up to target words that were either focused or defocused by a preceding discourse question did not vary as a function of focus, challenging the assumption that attention is pre-allocated to the timing of focused words. On the other hand, we found that trial-by-trial fluctuations in alpha activity predicted both the depth of processing and the subsequent memory for new information. Specifically, pre-target alpha modulated a centro-parietal Dm subsequent memory effect for focused words, linking preparatory attention to memory encoding during comprehension. Together, these findings bridge psycholinguistic studies on information structure and cognitive neuroscience research on temporal attention, offering novel insights into the role of alpha activity in attentional dynamics during spoken language processing.

">Eccentric cycling enhances primary motor cortex excitability</a></h4>

              
                Acute aerobic exercise (AAE) can modulate primary motor cortex (M1) excitability. To date, studies evaluating the effects of AAE on M1 excitability have focused almost exclusively on concentric cycling. Interestingly, eccentric cycling increases frontal-parietal brain activation more than concentric cycling. Critically, we recently found eccentric AAE enhances motor learning more than concentric AAE. Yet, the M1 excitability mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of eccentric cycling AAE on M1 excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Thirty adults performed three 20 min-conditions: i) eccentric cycling AAE, ii) concentric cycling AAE, and iii) rest. Cycling AAE was carried out at a workload corresponding to 70% of peak heart rate (%HRpeak) measured during concentric incremental cycling exercise. TMS assessments were conducted before (Pre), immediately (Post0) and 20 minutes after (Post20) AAE/rest to evaluate changes in corticospinal excitability (CSE) and short interval-intracortical inhibition (SICI). We found CSE increased and SICI decreased at Post20 following eccentric and concentric cycling AAE compared to rest. Also, %HRpeak, muscle pain and perceived effort were lower during eccentric cycling AAE compared to concentric cycling AAE. Our results showed that eccentric cycling impacted M1 excitability change to a comparable degree as concentric cycling, while requiring less cardiovascular response, eliciting less muscle pain and lower perceived effort. Taken together, our results suggest that eccentric cycling AAE may be a valuable intervention to modulate M1 excitability for populations with limited cardiovascular capacity and have potential implications in clinical and sports-related contexts.

">Realistic coupling enables flexible macroscopic traveling waves in the mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Traveling waves are ubiquitous in neuronal systems across different spatial scales. While microscopic and mesoscopic waves are relatively well studied, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of macroscopic traveling waves remain less understood. Here, by modeling the mouse cortex using spatial transcriptomic and connectivity data, we show that realistic cortical connectivity can generate a significantly higher level of macroscopic traveling waves than local and uniform connectivity. By quantifying the traveling waves in the 3-D domain, we discovered that the level of macroscopic traveling waves depends not only on the network connectivity but also non-monotonically depends on the coupling strength between neurons in the network. We also found that slow oscillations (0.5 - 4 Hz) are more likely to form large-scale, macroscopic traveling waves than other faster oscillations in the network with realistic connectivity. Together, our work shows how flexible macroscopic traveling waves can emerge in the mouse cortex and offers a computational framework to further study traveling waves in the mouse brain at the single-cell level.

">Reframing Sleep Architecture: A Compositional and Temporal Approach to Sleep Data Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Significant progress has been made in developing sleep staging methodologies; however, less attention has been devoted to the analysis of sleep architecture. Two critical aspects remain underexplored: the choice of binning window (i.e., grouping data into time intervals) and the statistical treatment of the interdependencies among sleep phases. While one-hour bins are commonly used, this choice is often based on convention rather than empirical justification. Additionally, sleep architecture data are typically expressed as proportions of time spent in each sleep phase, forming compositional datasets, non-negative values that represent parts of a whole and are constrained by a constant sum (e.g., 100%). Such data violate the assumptions of traditional statistical methods, yet their compositional nature is often overlooked, compromising analytical validity. In this study, we address two key methodological challenges in sleep architecture analysis: (1) determining the optimal binning window through a data-driven approach that balances information retention and noise reduction, and (2) applying isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformation to account for the compositional structure of the data, enabling the use of conventional statistical tests. By addressing these issues, we propose a more rigorous and interpretable framework for analyzing sleep architecture, aiming to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of findings in sleep research.

">Dissociating the Effects of Light at Night from Circadian Misalignment in a Neurodevelopmental Disorder Mouse Model Using Ultradian Light-Dark Cycles.</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) often experience sleep disturbances and are frequently exposed to light during nighttime hours. Our previous studies using the Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mouse model of NDDs demonstrated that nighttime light exposure increases behaviors such as excessive grooming, reduces social interactions, and disrupts daily locomotor rhythms. To further evaluate the effects of nighttime light exposure, we exposed wild-type (WT) and Cntnap2 KO mice to an ultradian lighting cycle (T7), which alternates 3.5 hours of light and 3.5 hours of darkness. Circadian rhythms in activity, corticosterone levels, and clock gene expression are maintained under T7 lighting despite the presence of light during the usual night phase, whilst animals display increased depressive-like behaviors and reduce performance on the novel object recognition test. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that T7 lighting would mimic the impact of nighttime light exposure seen in standard light-dark cycles with dim light at night (DLaN). However, in this study, adult WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under the T7 cycle did not show the increased grooming behavior or reduced social interaction observed in Cntnap2 KO mice exposed to DLaN. Regarding locomotor activity rhythms, the T7 cycle lengthened the circadian period and weakened the rhythm amplitude but did not abolish rhythmicity in either genotype. Finally, opposite to DLaN, neither the T7 cycle nor constant darkness (DD) elicited an increase in cFos expression in the basolateral amygdala in WT and KO mice. These results demonstrate that the adverse behavioral and neurobiological effects of nighttime light exposure in a model of a neurodevelopmental disorder depend on circadian disruption rather than light exposure alone, highlighting the importance of circadian stability as a protective factor in NDDS.

">Differential encoding of social identity, valence and unfamiliarity in the amygdala and piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                To appropriately respond to social situations, animals must rapidly identify conspecifics as individuals, gauge their familiarity and recall any good or bad associations. In previous work (Mazuski & OKeefe, 2022), we characterized populations of neurons in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) that were strongly tuned to social conspecifics. In this current study, we asked whether these or other populations in the BLA encode properties necessary for social interaction: individual recognition, familiarity detection and reward association. In addition to cells in the rat lateral amygdala (LA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), we recorded from cells in the anatomically-related piriform cortex (PIR) to see how much of the amygdala response was inherited from this input. Here, we show that these three interrelated areas encode distinct features of social conspecifics at the population and single neuron level. We recorded from large populations of neurons using 4-shank Neuropixels probes while rats learned a social discrimination task, where one male conspecific was paired with a food reward (S+) and the other its absence (S-). For comparison, two unfamiliar animals were presented on occasional probe trials. After successful discrimination learning, we looked for transfer effects to our previously studied task where implanted rats freely interacted with all four conspecifics in an open-field environment. The LA dynamically encoded social reward learning. Initially, LA neuronal population activity could not distinguish between the S+ and S- conspecifics, but after learning distinct representations emerged. In contrast, the PIR showed no effect of social reward learning. Single PIR units encoded social identity with strong tuning to individual conspecifics both before and after learning. The BLA encoded both reward learning and social identity suggesting this is where the PIR and LA information streams converge. Unexpectedly, the BLA and LA strongly coded for the unfamiliarity of the rat - single neurons responded to the probe trial animals with firing rates 2-5x higher than to the task animals. This cross-region encoding of identity, reward and unfamiliarity was reactivated during social interaction in the new open-field environment, demonstrating that the learning was not context specific. The results throw light on how distinct neural circuits contribute to social recognition and memory and how they interact with each other.

                Introduction Autoimmune diseases often require long-term management and significantly affect patients’ physical and mental health. Conventional management strategies emphasize disease control and symptom relief, notwithstanding, the integration of positive health models such as the flourishing framework remains underexplored. Objective This protocol outlines a scoping review aimed to map and analyze how the flourishing framework has been applied in research and practice in autoimmune context. Methods Following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we will systematically search across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Studies will be screened using predetermined eligibility criteria. Data will be extracted and charted using a standardize form and will be analyzed narratively by presenting key characteristics and thematic trends. Conclusion The findings from this scoping review will provide a foundational insight into how flourishing is conceptualized, measured, and applied in the context of autoimmune disease. Thus, informing future research and integrative care models.

                Background Disability is widely acknowledged as a major contributor to depression, which is a prevalent mental health condition that profoundly affects individuals, especially those with visual impairments. Objectives This develops a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis aim to examine the prevalence and incidence of depression among visually impaired people globally. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. A thorough search will be conducted using the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ProQuest databases to identify relevant studies published between January 1, 2011, and August 31, 2024, without limitations on language. Two out of three independent reviewers will screen the abstracts and full-text articles, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. Heterogeneity among the included studies will be evaluated individually. Meta-analysis of the pooled prevalence and incidence estimates will be conducted using the metaprop function in StataBE 18.0. Publication bias will be assessed through funnel plot analysis and Egger’s test. Conclusion This protocol defines the planned scope and methodology for a forthcoming systematic review and meta-analysis, which aims to provide updated evidence on the prevalence and incidence of depression among individuals with visual impairment. Accordingly, it will facilitate a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the existing research gap by providing precise estimates of the pooled prevalence and incidence of depression in this population. The findings will offer valuable insights to inform public health policy, advocate for further research, and underscore the critical need to prioritize the mental health concerns of individuals with visual impairment.

                Background There is an ongoing need to develop diverse career paths that support the vital contributions of staff scientists, research engineers, scientific officers, and other knowledge professionals in scientific discovery. Research infrastructures and core facilities have a particular need to support sustainable and diverse careers, as they either employ – if being a legal entity – or daily manage research professionals in a broad variety of roles to enable resources, services, and innovation. Methods In 2019, a survey of the facility staff at SciLifeLab, a large national research infrastructure in Sweden, led to a recommendation for universities to develop career paths for their staff scientists. Five years later, we have conducted a survey and workshop to determine current views of infrastructure staff on career path diversity in Sweden. Results Our results indicate there is a strong need for clarity and communication about planning and implementation of career path structures at Swedish universities, as well as opportunities to foster excellence in infrastructure staff. While the workshop participants ranked Sweden as a stable and attractive place to work and reported continuous development of their technical and service skills, the lack of recognition of this expertise presents a barrier to a sustainable career. Conclusions We conclude that there is a need to continue advocating for increased clarity and diversity in career paths for staff scientists in Sweden, and raise the views presented by infrastructure staff on the challenges and opportunities unique to their roles.

<p>Curumin exerted neuroprotective and anti-epileptic effects through the PPARγ/PTEN/Akt pathway.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic epilepsy is mainly characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma/phosphatase and tensin homolog/protein kinase B (PPARγ/PTEN/Akt) pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of SRS and neuronal loss. Curcumin is a natural compound, and previous studies have shown it provides neuroprotection via anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant effects in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In the present study, we show that curcumin regulates the abnormal expression of PTEN and Akt in the SRS phase, improves the neuronal loss in the hippocampus, and suppresses SRS development and seizure spike activity in epileptic rats. More importantly, these effects are reversed by the PPARγ antagonist, T0070907, suggesting that curcumin exerts neuroprotective and anti-epileptic effects through the PPARγ/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. Other studies have shown that curcumin can cross the BBB and has a safety profiles and pleiotropic pharmacological effects. Thus, our data support the proposition that curcumin might be a potential neuroprotective and anti-epileptic agent for chronic epilepsy.</p>

                Background Early and accurate prediction of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is critical to reducing cardiovascular mortality through timely intervention. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. Fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.
