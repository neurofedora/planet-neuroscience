	<p>(1) Background: Although cognitive impairments in coma survivors are common, methods of measuring long-term cognitive outcomes in this population are inconsistent, precluding the development of a strong evidence-base to support clinical decision making. In this literature review, we identify and characterize the measures used to track cognitive recovery in coma survivors to data. (2) Methods: We extracted the instrument used for cognitive assessment, the cognitive domains assessed, methods administration and scoring, and timing of assessment from 134 of 996 screened records. (3) Results: A total of 133 unique cognitive tests and cognitive testing batteries were identified, with 97 cognitive instruments used in less than three articles. The instruments assessed 20 different cognitive domains, with 73 articles also using tests that assess general &amp;amp;ldquo;cognitive ability&amp;amp;rdquo;. Cognitive instruments ranged from subjective assessments to comprehensive cognitive batteries. There were inconsistent points of reference for the timing of assessment across studies, with few studies repeating assessments at more than one time point, and arbitrary time intervals between tests. (4) Conclusions: Overall, this review illustrates the enormous disparity between studies that track cognitive outcome in coma survivors, and the need for a systematic, patient-accessible method of assessing cognitive functioning in future studies with this population.</p>

	<p>Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have an elevated risk of suicidality. The same has been found for people within the penitentiary system, suggesting a cumulative effect for offender patients suffering from SSD. While there appear to be overlapping characteristics, there is little research on factors distinguishing between offenders and non-offenders with SSD regarding suicidality. Our study therefore aimed at evaluating distinguishing such factors through the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms on a dataset of 232 offenders and 167 non-offender patients with SSD and history of suicidality. With an AUC of 0.81, Na&amp;amp;iuml;ve Bayes outperformed all other ML algorithms. The following factors emerged as most powerful in their interplay in distinguishing between offender and non-offender patients with a history of suicidality: Prior outpatient psychiatric treatment, regular intake of antipsychotic medication, global cognitive deficit, a prescription of antidepressants during the referenced hospitalisation and higher levels of anxiety and a lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation measured by an adapted positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Interestingly, neither aggression nor overall psychopathology emerged as distinguishers between the two groups. The present findings contribute to a better understanding of suicidality in offender and non-offender patients with SSD and their differing characteristics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Right atrial organized thrombus three years after tricuspid annuloplasty [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Occurrence of right atrial masses, especially in patients with history of cardiac surgery, is rare. Differential diagnosis between malignant and non-malignant aetiologies might be cumbersome, and surgery is often required to prevent complications or disease evolution. Case: We report the case of a 16-year-old girl from a rural area of Sudan, who underwent surgery for a modified De Vega’s tricuspid annuloplasty, and mitral and aortic valve replacement with mechanical prostheses. The patient was on regular follow-up but demonstrated a poor compliance to anticoagulation therapy with a time in therapeutic range between 52% and 20%. She remained asymptomatic, but a right atrial mass was diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography during a follow-up visit 41 months after the first operation. Surgical removal of the mass revealed an organized thrombus arising from the point where the Prolene stitches for the tricuspid annuloplasty were previously passed. The patient recovered from surgery, was discharged home on post-operative day 10 and the first follow-up visit at 30 days after discharge confirmed a good clinical status and a normal transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Conclusions: This case report describes the diagnostic and therapeutic work-out of a thrombus formation on the suture lines of a tricuspid annuloplasty. Moreover, it highlights the importance of a strict and long follow-up after valvular surgery and of the adherence to anticoagulation therapy, especially for patients living in rural areas of developing countries.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Degree of organ damage and inflammatory markers in sepsis mice models inducted by various doses of lipopolysaccharides  [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening disease, and animal models of sepsis are minimal. This study aims to find the optimal dose to make a sepsis mouse model by examining the presence of target organ damage. Methods: This study used 30 mice divided into four groups. The control group injected 0.5 cc NaCl 0.9% intraperitoneally (i.p.). Group A was injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) 0.25 mg/kg B.W. i.p. given on the first and second day, group B was injected with LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. i.p. given on the first and second days, and group C was injected by LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. single dose i.p. Each group was terminated on the third, fourth, and fifth days. Results: NF-κB, C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), NF-κB examinations, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in all treatment groups increased when compared with the control. The highest degree of histopathological features of the kidneys and liver and the results of immunohistochemistry examinations on the liver and kidneys were shown in group C. Conclusions: Inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-α, NF-κB, and expression of NF-κB in liver and kidneys) and characteristics of organ damage (ALT, liver, and kidneys histopathology scores) increase on day 3. The highest increase was in the group administered with LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. single dose.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">University students dataset related to achievement, classroom practices, perceptions and attitudes of multimedia-based learning quantum physics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This dataset presents data collected to assess teaching and learning of quantum physics at the University of Rwanda - College of Education (UR-CE), Rwanda. Data were collected between August and November 2019 as the baseline, and between January and April 2022 under a quasi-experimental design. Three sets of data were collected. The first set was about students' performance and conceptual understanding collected before and after teaching intervention (lecture method or multimedia-aided approach) using mainly Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey (QPCS). The second set documented classroom practices during teaching and learning using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS). The last set is comprised of the data related to lecturers' and students' perceptions before teaching and learning quantum physics and students' attitudes after learning Quantum physics. The Quantum Physics Attitude Test (QPAT) was mainly used to collect these data. The dataset is important to education stakeholders because university managers can visualize the status of teaching and learning outcomes, lecturers can reflect on the study, and researchers can use the data to analyze various independent variables.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The patent landscape in the field of stem cell therapy: closing the gap between research and clinic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell technology is a powerful tool ready to respond to the needs of modern medicine that is experiencing rapid technological development. Given its potential in therapeutic applications, intellectual property rights (IPR) as a protection resource of knowledge are a relevant topic. Patent eligibility of stem cells has been controversial as restrictions to access the fundamental technologies open a gap between research and clinic. Therefore, we depicted the current patent landscape in the field to discuss if this approach moves forward in closing this breach by examining patent activity over the last decade from a transdisciplinary perspective. Stem cell therapeutic applications is an area of continuous growth where patent filing through the PCT is the preferred strategy. Patenting activity is concentrated in the USA, European Union, and Australia; this accumulation in a few key players leads to governance, regulation, and inequality concerns. To boost wealthiness and welfare in society - stem cell therapies' ultimate goal - while at post-pandemic recovery, critical elements in the field of IPR rise to overcome current limitations: to promote bridge builders able to connect the research and business worlds, regulatory updates, novel financing models, new vehicles (startups, spinouts, and spin-offs), and alternative figures of intellectual property.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Practice and knowledge of dietary supplement consumption among Indonesian adults post-delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Increasing dietary supplement (DS) consumption was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including during the post-Delta wave period. This study aimed to measure the practice of DS consumption and respondents’ knowledge of DS. Methods: An internet-based survey was distributed from October-December 2021 and obtained 541 valid and completed responses. Descriptive analysis was performed to present the practice of DS consumption, including frequency, duration, aim, preferable dosage form etc. Level of knowledge on DS principles, side effects and regulation were also measured. Inferential analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of the respondents’ DS practice and level of knowledge. Results: Data from 541 valid responses showed that 77.63% of respondents consumed DS in the last 3 months, with only 59.52% reporting also consuming DS before the COVID-19 pandemic. One half of the respondents had good knowledge about DS; however, some knowledge regarding side effects and possible drug-supplement interaction needed improvement. Their DS consumption practice was affected by their economic status and history of contracting COVID-19. Nevertheless, the level of knowledge was not affected by the sociodemographic factors and DS supplement experience. Conclusions: Taken together, the practice of self-consumption of DS in Indonesia is increasing; hence, knowledge of DS is necessary to avoid detrimental effects that might occur in the future. Increasing access to information on better labelling and educating consumers about DS are important actions to consider.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neutral vs. non-neutral genetic footprints of Plasmodium falciparum multiclonal infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frédéric Labbé, Qixin He, Qi Zhan, Kathryn E. Tiedje, Dionne C. Argyropoulos, Mun Hua Tan, Anita Ghansah, Karen P. Day, Mercedes Pascual</p>

At a time when effective tools for monitoring malaria control and eradication efforts are crucial, the increasing availability of molecular data motivates their application to epidemiology. The multiplicity of infection (MOI), defined as the number of genetically distinct parasite strains co-infecting a host, is one key epidemiological parameter for evaluating malaria interventions. Estimating MOI remains a challenge for high-transmission settings where individuals typically carry multiple co-occurring infections. Several quantitative approaches have been developed to estimate MOI, including two cost-effective ones relying on molecular data: i) THE REAL McCOIL method is based on putatively neutral single nucleotide polymorphism loci, and ii) the <i>var</i>coding method is a fingerprinting approach that relies on the diversity and limited repertoire overlap of the <i>var</i> multigene family encoding the major <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> blood-stage antigen PfEMP1 and is therefore under selection. In this study, we assess the robustness of the MOI estimates generated with these two approaches by simulating <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> malaria dynamics under three transmission conditions using an extension of a previously developed stochastic agent-based model. We demonstrate that these approaches are complementary and best considered across distinct transmission intensities. While <i>var</i>coding can underestimate MOI, it allows robust estimation, especially under high-transmission where repertoire overlap is extremely limited from frequency-dependent selection. In contrast, THE REAL McCOIL often considerably overestimates MOI, but still provides reasonable estimates for low- and moderate-transmission. Regardless of transmission intensity, results for THE REAL McCOIL indicate that an inaccurate tail at high MOI values is generated, and that at high transmission, an apparently reasonable estimated MOI distribution can arise from some degree of compensation between overestimation and underestimation. As many countries pursue malaria elimination targets, defining the most suitable approach to estimate MOI based on sample size and local transmission intensity is highly recommended for monitoring the impact of intervention programs.

Dynamical models in the form of systems of ordinary differential equations have become a standard tool in systems biology. Many parameters of such models are usually unknown and have to be inferred from experimental data. Gradient-based optimization has proven to be effective for parameter estimation. However, computing gradients becomes increasingly costly for larger models, which are required for capturing the complex interactions of multiple biochemical pathways. Adjoint sensitivity analysis has been pivotal for working with such large models, but methods tailored for steady-state data are currently not available. We propose a new adjoint method for computing gradients, which is applicable if the experimental data include steady-state measurements. The method is based on a reformulation of the backward integration problem to a system of linear algebraic equations. The evaluation of the proposed method using real-world problems shows a speedup of total simulation time by a factor of up to 4.4. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a substantial improvement in computation time, in particular for large-scale models, where computational efficiency is critical.

Background <p>Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) typically results from transmission of a small and genetically uniform viral population. Following transmission, the virus population becomes more diverse because of recombination and acquired mutations through genetic drift and selection. Viral intrahost genetic diversity remains a major obstacle to the cure the HIV; however, the association between intrahost diversity and disease progression markers has not been investigated in large and diverse cohorts for which the majority of the genome has been deep-sequenced. Viral load (VL) is a key progression marker and understanding of its relationship to viral intrahost genetic diversity could help design future strategies for HIV monitoring and treatment.</p> Methods <p>We analysed deep-sequenced viral genomes from 2,650 treatment-naive HIV-infected persons to measure the intrahost genetic diversity of 2,447 genomic codon positions as calculated by Shannon entropy. We tested for associations between VL and amino acid (AA) entropy accounting for sex, age, race, duration of infection, and HIV population structure.</p> Results <p>We confirmed that the intrahost genetic diversity is highest in the <i>env</i> gene. Furthermore, we showed that mean Shannon entropy is significantly associated with VL, especially in infections of >24 months duration. We identified 16 significant associations between VL (p-value<2.0x10<sup>-5</sup>) and Shannon entropy at AA positions which in our association analysis explained 13% of the variance in VL. Finally, equivalent analysis based on variation in HIV consensus sequences explained only 2% of VL variance.</p> Conclusions <p>Our results elucidate that viral intrahost genetic diversity is associated with VL and could be used as a better disease progression marker than HIV consensus sequence variants, especially in infections of longer duration. We emphasize that viral intrahost diversity should be considered when studying viral genomes and infection outcomes.</p> Trial registration <p>Samples included in this study were derived from participants who consented in the clinical trial, START (NCT00867048) (23), run by the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT).

                Background: Young people with mental illness should be offered evidence-based treatments. In 2018, we developed a national evidence portal in Norway providing mental health professionals and others with living evidence summaries. This immense work has been an important contribution to mental health care in Norway but is also a rich data source for exploring the characteristics and evidence gaps of the existing research internationally. At the time of this study, eight overviews of systematic reviews (OoOs) had been published. These addressed treatments for attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), self-harm and trauma/ post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study was to do a secondary analysis of this evidence to describe the state-of-the art in this field, and to map: treatments evaluated for each patient group and the longest time of follow-up treatment comparisons evaluated for more than one patient group Methods: We performed a mapping review of the eight OoOs. Data extraction was performed by one author and double-checked by another. All data was entered into Excel. Findings were visualized in descriptive tables and using Sunburst-diagrams. We used statistical thresholds to determine the size of effect and report the associated certainty. Results: We identified 200 treatment comparisons including a wide variety of interventions. Some mental illnesses are treated mostly with pharmacological or combination therapies and others solely with psychological or psychosocial treatments or with more diversity. The evidence supporting most treatments is of low to very low certainty. Ten percent of the comparisons included follow-up assessments beyond 12 months. Cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectic behavioural therapy, physical activity and mindfulness interventions were effective across populations. Conclusions: The evidence supporting treatment of mental illness in young people has important limitations. Future research efforts should address these evidence gaps.

                Background: The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene is a reporter gene that can be used to optimize protein isolation procedures and the functional working of a transduction protein. EGFP, with the addition of eleven arginine residues, has been engineered to functionally improve the protein transduction process, which can later be used for cell reprogramming like induced pluripotent stem cells. The addition of six histidine amino acid residues at its C-terminal is intended for the protein isolation process using the His-tag antibody. Methods: The study aimed to investigate the optimization of the EGFP polyarginine protein expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in sufficient quantities for the protein isolation stage. This study also analyzed EGFP expression without polyarginine to analyze the polyarginine addition effect on expression processes. Protein expression was qualitatively measured by looking at expression fluorescence and protein levels of EGFP and EGFP - PolyR proteins. Results: Bands on Western Blots with 6×His-tag monoclonal antibody (primary antibody) and Goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (secondary antibody) showed the EGFP polyarginine and EGFP proteins were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1 at relatively low levels. The lyticase incubation time modification and administration of 3-5 kDa microfilter to concentrate increased the yield of isolated protein. Conclusions: The sufficient amount of protein isolation in S. cerevisiae can be achieved by using lyticase and sonicators combination for the lysis process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular characterization of cell types in the squid Loligo vulgaris</a></h4>

              
                Cephalopods are set apart from other mollusks by their advanced behavioral abilities and by the complexity of their nervous systems. Because of the great evolutionary distance that separates vertebrates from cephalopods, it is evident that higher cognitive features have evolved separately in these clades despite the similarities that they share. Alongside their complex behavioral abilities, cephalopods have evolved specialized cells and tissues, such as the chromatophores for camouflage or suckers to grasp prey. Despite significant progress in genome and transcriptome sequencing, the molecular identities of cell types in cephalopods remain largely unknown. We here combine single-cell transcriptomics with <i>in situ</i> gene expression analysis to uncover cell type diversity in the European squid <i>Loligo vulgaris</i>. We describe cell types that are conserved with other phyla such as neurons, muscles, or connective tissues but also cephalopod-specific cells, such as chromatophores or sucker cells. Moreover, we investigate major components of the squid nervous system including progenitor and developing cells, differentiated cells of the brain and optic lobes as well as sensory systems of the head. Our study provides a molecular assessment for conserved and novel cell types in cephalopods and a framework for mapping the nervous system of <i>L. vulgaris</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Antisense oligonucleotide therapy rescues disturbed brain rhythms and sleep in juvenile and adult mouse models of Angelman syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <i>UBE3A</i> encodes ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, and in neurons its expression from the paternal allele is repressed by the <i>UBE3A</i> antisense transcript (<i>UBE3A-ATS</i>). This leaves neurons susceptible to loss-of-function of maternal <i>UBE3A</i>. Indeed, Angelman syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by maternal <i>UBE3A</i> deficiency. A promising therapeutic approach to treating Angelman syndrome is to reactivate the intact paternal <i>UBE3A</i> by suppressing <i>UBE3A-ATS</i>. Prior studies show that many neurological phenotypes of maternal <i>Ube3a</i> knockout mice can only be rescued by reinstating <i>Ube3a</i> expression in early development, indicating a restricted therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome. Here we report that reducing <i>Ube3a-ATS</i> by antisense oligonucleotides in juvenile or adult maternal <i>Ube3a</i> knockout mice rescues the abnormal electroencephalogram rhythms and sleep disturbance, two prominent clinical features of Angelman syndrome. Importantly, the degree of phenotypic improvement correlates with the increase of Ube3a protein levels. These results indicate that the therapeutic window of genetic therapies for Angelman syndrome is broader than previously thought, and electroencephalogram power spectrum and sleep architecture should be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The meningeal transcriptional response to traumatic brain injury and aging</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that the meningeal compartment plays instrumental roles in various neurological disorders, however, we still lack fundamental knowledge about meningeal biology. Here, we utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques to investigate the transcriptional response of the meninges to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and aging in the sub-acute and chronic time frames. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we first explored how mild TBI affects the cellular and transcriptional landscape in the meninges in young mice at one-week post-injury. Then, using bulk RNA-seq, we assessed the differential long-term outcomes between young and aged mice following TBI. In our scRNA-seq studies, we highlight injury-related changes in differential gene expression seen in major meningeal cell populations including macrophages, fibroblasts, and adaptive immune cells. We found that TBI leads to an upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) signature genes in macrophages and a controlled upregulation of inflammatory-related genes in the fibroblast and adaptive immune cell populations. For reasons that remain poorly understood, even mild injuries in the elderly can lead to cognitive decline and devastating neuropathology. To better understand the differential outcomes between the young and the elderly following brain injury, we performed bulk RNA-seq on young and aged meninges 1.5 months after TBI. Notably, we found that aging alone induced upregulation of meningeal genes involved in antibody production by B cells and type I IFN signaling. Following injury, the meningeal transcriptome had largely returned to its pre-injury signature in young mice. In stark contrast, aged TBI mice still exhibited upregulation of immune-related genes and downregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Overall, these findings illustrate the dynamic transcriptional response of the meninges to mild head trauma in youth and aging.

                Brain function relies on the generation of a large variety of morphologically and functionally diverse, but specific, neuronal synapses. Here, we show that, initially, synapse formation on a common target neuron, the cerebellar Purkinje cells, involves a presynaptic secreted protein common for all types of excitatory inputs. The molecular program then evolves only in one of the inputs with the additional expression of a combination of presynaptic secreted proteins that specify the mature pattern of connectivity on the target. These results show that some inputs actively and gradually specify their synaptic molecular identity while others rely on the "original code". Thus, the molecular specification of excitatory synapses, crucial for proper circuit function, is acquired in a stepwise manner during mouse postnatal development and obeys input-specific rules.

                Attention deficit is one of the most prominent and disabling symptoms in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli contributes to attention difficulties by overwhelming and/or distracting affected individuals, which disrupts activities of daily living at home and learning at school. We find that auditory or visual distractors selectively impair visual discrimination performance in both humans and mice with FXS, but not their typically developing controls. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons were significantly modulated by incorrect responses in the post-stimulus period during early distractor trials in WT mice, consistent with their known role as error signals. Strikingly, however, VIP cells from Fmr1-/- mice showed little modulation in error trials, and this correlated with their poor performance on the distractor task. Thus, VIP interneurons and their reduced modulatory influence on pyramidal cells, could be a potential therapeutic target for attentional difficulties in FXS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding the relative contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms in mediating heterogeneous spiking activities of sensory neurons in vivo using computational modeling</a></h4>

              
                Neurons ubiquitously display heterogeneities in spiking activity even within a given cell type. To date, the relative contributions of extrinsic mechanisms (e.g., synaptic bombardment) and intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., conductances, cell morphology) towards determining spiking activity remain poorly understood. Here we address this important question using a novel approach that combines biophysical techniques, in which extracellular in vivo recordings of electrosensory pyramidal cells within weakly electric fish, are combined with computational modeling. Specifically, by varying parameters, a conductance-based computational model successfully reproduced the highly heterogeneous spiking activities seen experimentally. Model parameters that varied the most were then used to gauge the relative contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic mechanisms. Overall, extrinsic synaptic input was predicted to be the main factor accounting for spiking heterogeneities. We tested this prediction experimentally by performing two different manipulations: i) pharmacologically inactivating feedback; ii) applying the neuromodulator serotonin. Our model predicted that feedback inactivation should reduce while serotonin application should increase spiking heterogeneities. Experiments corroborated these predictions. Importantly, for serotonin application, increased heterogeneity occurred despite a strong reduction in intrinsic membrane conductance, further demonstrating that extrinsic synaptic input is the primary determinant of spiking heterogeneities in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that devising a computational model to capture spiking heterogeneities in vivo and assessing which parameters are responsible can successfully determine the relative contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic inputs. We expect this approach to be generalizable to other systems and species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An original potentiating mechanism revealed by the cryoEM structures of the human α7 nicotinic receptor in complex with nanobodies</a></h4>

              
                The human 7 nicotinic receptor is a pentameric channel mediating cellular and neuronal communication. It has attracted considerable interest to design ligands for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To develop a novel class of 7 ligands, we recently generated two nanobodies named E3 and C4 acting as positive and silent allosteric modulators respectively. Here, we solved the cryo-EM structures of the nanobody-receptor complexes. E3 and C4 bind to a common epitope involving two subunits at the apex of the receptor. They form by themselves a symmetric pentameric assembly that extends the extracellular domain. Unlike C4, the binding of E3 drives an active or desensitized conformation in the absence of orthosteric agonist, and mutational analysis shows a key contribution of a N-linked sugar moiety in mediating E3 potentiation. The nanobody E3, by remotely controlling the global allosteric conformation of the receptor, implements an original mechanism of regulation which opens new avenues for drug design.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial genes in the 22q11.2 deleted region regulate neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation</a></h4>

              
                Microdeletion of a 3Mbp region encompassing 45 protein-coding genes at chromosome 22q11.2 (22q11.2DS) predisposes to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and is one of the greatest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Defective mitochondrial function has been hypothesized to contribute to 22q11.2DS pathogenesis; however, which of the six mitochondrial genes contribute to neurodevelopmental phenotypes and their underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. To systematically test 22q11.2DS genes for functional roles in neurodevelopment and behavior, we generated genetic mutants for each of the 37 conserved zebrafish orthologs and performed high throughput behavioral phenotyping using seven behavioral assays. Through this unbiased approach, we identified five single-gene mutants with partially overlapping behavioral phenotypes. Two of these genes, mrpl40 and prodha, encode for mitochondrial proteins and, similar to what we observed in mrpl40 and prodha mutants, pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial function during development results in microcephaly. Finally, we show that both mrpl40 and prodha mutants display neural stem and progenitor cell phenotypes, with each gene regulating different neural stem cell populations. Combined, our results demonstrate a critical role for mitochondrial function in neural stem and progenitor cell populations in the developing vertebrate brain and provide compelling evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment is linked to brain volume and behavioral phenotypes observed in models of 22q11.2DS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ErbB inhibition impairs cognition via disrupting myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                White matter abnormalities are an emerging feature of schizophrenia, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Disruption of ErbB signaling that is essential for peripheral myelination has been genetically associated with schizophrenia and white matter lesions in schizophrenic patients. However, the roles of ErbB signaling in oligodendrocytes remain elusive. Here, we used a pan-ErbB inhibition strategy and demonstrated the synergistic functions of endogenous ErbB receptors in oligodendrocytes. Through analyses of the cellular, histological, biochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological differences in mice with manipulation of ErbB activities in oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages, we found that ErbB signaling regulates myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes, and both functions are required for working memory. ErbB inhibition in oligodendrocytes at early differentiation stages induces hypomyelination by suppressing the differentiation of newly-formed oligodendrocytes. In contrast, ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes alters neither myelination nor oligodendrocyte numbers, but accelerates axonal conduction decline under energy stress. Mechanistically, mature oligodendrocytes with ErbB inhibition reduce the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A, failing to provide lactate to electrically active axons. Supplementation of L-lactate restores axonal conduction and working memory capacity that are suppressed by ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings reveal the indispensable roles of ErbB signaling in white matter integrity and function, and provide insights into the multifaceted contributions of white matter abnormalities to cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generation of nanobodies acting as silent and positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</a></h4>

              
                The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a potential drug target for treating cognitive disorders, mediates communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Although many competitive antagonists, agonists, and partial-agonists have been found and synthesized, they have not led to effective therapeutic treatments. In this context, small molecules acting as positive allosteric modulators binding outside the orthosteric, acetylcholine, site have attracted considerable interest. Two single-domain antibody fragments, C4 and E3, generated through alpaca immunization with cells expressing the extracellular domain of the human 7-nAChR, are herein described. They bind to the 7-nAChR but not to the other major nAChR subtypes, 4{beta}2 and 3{beta}4. E3 acts as a slowly associating type I positive allosteric modulator, strongly potentiating the acetylcholine-elicited currents, while not significantly altering the desensitization of the receptor. An E3-E3 bivalent construct shows similar potentiating properties but displays very slow dissociation kinetics conferring quasi-irreversible properties. Whereas, C4 does not alter the receptor function, but fully inhibits the E3-evoked potentiation, showing it is a silent allosteric modulator competing with E3 binding. Both nanobodies do not compete with -bungarotoxin, localizing at an allosteric extracellular binding site away from the orthosteric site. The functional differences of each nanobody, as well as the alteration of functional properties through nanobody modifications indicate the importance of this extracellular site. The nanobodies will be useful for pharmacological and structural investigations; moreover, they, along with the extracellular site, have a direct potential for clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of face perception modeled with a convolutional recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                Event-related potential (ERP) sensitivity to faces is predominantly characterized by an N170 peak that has greater amplitude and shorter latency when elicited by human faces than images of other objects. We developed a computational model of visual ERP generation to study this phenomenon which consisted of a convolutional neural network (CNN) connected to a recurrent neural network (RNN). We used open-access data to develop the model, generated synthetic images for simulating experiments, then collected additional data to validate predictions of these simulations. For modeling, visual stimuli presented during ERP experiments were represented as sequences of images (time x pixels). These were provided as inputs to the model. The CNN transformed these inputs into sequences of vectors that were passed to the RNN. The ERP waveforms evoked by visual stimuli were provided to the RNN as labels for supervised learning. The whole model was trained end-to-end using data from the open-access dataset to reproduce ERP waveforms evoked by visual events. Cross-validation model outputs strongly correlated with open-access (r = 0.98) and validation study data (r = 0.78). Open-access and validation study data correlated similarly (r = 0.81). Some aspects of model behavior were consistent with neural recordings while others were not, suggesting promising albeit limited capacity for modeling the neurophysiology of face-sensitive ERP generation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meditation attenuates Default-mode activity: a pilot study using ultra-high strength MRI</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Mapping the neurobiology of meditation using 3 Tesla functional MRI (fMRI) has burgeoned recently. However, limitations in signal quality and neuroanatomical resolution have impacted reliability and precision of extant findings. Although ultra-high strength 7 Tesla MRI overcomes these limitations, investigation of meditation using 7 Tesla fMRI is still in its infancy. Methods: In this feasibility study, we scanned 10 individuals who were beginner meditators using 7 Tesla fMRI while they performed focused attention meditation and non-focused rest. We also measured and adjusted the fMRI signal for key physiological differences between meditation and rest. Finally, we explored the 2-week impact of the single fMRI meditation session on mindfulness, anxiety and focused attention attributes. Results: Group-level task fMRI analyses revealed significant reductions in activity during meditation relative to rest in Default-mode network hubs, i.e., antero-medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, precuneus, as well as visual and thalamic regions. These findings survived stringent statistical corrections for fluctuations in physiological responses which demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) between meditation and rest. Compared to baseline, State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) scores were significantly elevated (F = 8.16, p<0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) following the fMRI meditation session, and were closely maintained at 2-week follow up. Conclusions: This pilot study establishes the feasibility and utility of investigating focused attention meditation using ultra-high strength (7 Tesla) fMRI, by supporting widespread evidence that focused attention meditation attenuates Default-mode activity responsible for self-referential processing. Future functional neuroimaging studies of meditation should control for physiological confounds and include behavioural assessments.

                During cortico-basal ganglia dependent learning, relevant environmental information is associated with certain outcomes; such learning is essential to generate adaptive behaviour in a continuously changing environment. Through repetitive trial-and-error experiences, actions are optimized and cognitive associative load can be relieved through consolidation and automatization. Although the molecular basis of learning is well studied, region-specific genome-wide expression profiles of the striatum, the major input region of cortico-basal ganglia circuits, during learning are lacking. Here we combined an automated operant conditioning paradigm with an efficient RNA-sequencing protocol to compare expression profiles among three learning stages in three striatal regions per hemisphere in a total of 240 striatal biopsies. Notably, the inclusion of matched yoked controls allowed reliably identifying learning-related expression changes. With 593 differently expressed genes (3.3% of all detected genes), we find the strongest effect of learning at an early, goal-directed stage across all three striatal region and identify a total of 921 learning-related expression changes. Our dataset provides a unique resource to study molecular markers of striatal learning.

                Chronic social stress in mice causes behavioral and physiological changes resulting in perturbed rhythms of body temperature, activity and sleep-wake cycle. To further understand the link between mood disorders and temperature rhythmicity, we measured core body temperature (Tcore) in mice before and after exposure to the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm. Our results revealed that Tcore amplitudes of stress resilient and susceptible mice are dampened during exposure to CSDS. However, after exposure to social stress, the temperature amplitude of resilient mice recovered faster than the susceptible mice. There were minimal changes in locomotor activity after stress exposure which correlates with regular rhythmic expression of Prok2, an output signal of the SCN (Suprachiasmatic nucleus). We also investigated the molecular changes associated with these dampened temperature rhythms, and determined the expression levels of thermosensitive genes Cirbp, Rbm3 and Hsf1. Expression of Rbm3 and Cirbp in the LHb (Lateral habenula) were blunted 1 day after CSDS. These molecular rhythms recovered 10 days later such that daytime expression was higher compared to nighttime, similar to stress-naive controls. Hsf1 did not show robust rhythmic expression in the LHb.

                Maintaining good cognitive function is crucial for well-being across the lifespan. We proposed that the degree of cognitive maintenance is determined by the functional interactions within and between large-scale brain networks. Such connectivity can be represented by the white matter architecture of structural brain networks that shape intrinsic neuronal activity into integrated and distributed functional networks. We explored how the function-structure connectivity convergence, and the divergence of functional connectivity from structural connectivity, contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function across the adult lifespan. Multivariate analyses were used to investigate the relationship between function-structure connectivity convergence and divergence with multivariate cognitive profiles, respectively. Cognitive function was increasingly dependent on function-structure connectivity convergence as age increased. The dependency of cognitive function on connectivity was particularly strong for high-order cortical networks and subcortical networks. The results suggest that brain functional network integrity sustains cognitive functions in old age, as a function of the integrity of the brain's structural connectivity.

To address it, we focused on the motor neuron (MN) disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), caused by reduced levels of the ubiquitous protein SMN. Taking advantage of the first isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived SMA model that we have generated and a spinal cord organoid system, here we report that the relative and temporal expression of early neural progenitor and MN markers is altered in SMA. Furthermore, the corrected isogenic controls only partially reverse these abnormalities. These findings raise the relevant clinical implication that SMN-increasing treatments might not fully amend SMA pathological phenotypes. The approach we have taken demonstrates that the discovery of new disease mechanisms is greatly improved by using human isogenic models. Moreover, our study implies that SMA has a developmental component that might trigger the MN degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How honey bees make fast and accurate decisions</a></h4>

              
                Honey bee ecology demands they make both rapid and accurate assessments of which flowers are most likely to offer them nectar or pollen. To understand the mechanisms of honey bee decision-making we examined their speed and accuracy of both flower acceptance and rejection decisions. We used a controlled flight arena that varied both the likelihood of a stimulus offering reward and punishment and the quality of evidence for stimuli. We found that the sophistication of honey bee decision-making rivalled that reported for primates. Their decisions were sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence. Acceptance responses had higher accuracy than rejection responses and were more sensitive to changes in available evidence and reward likelihood. Fast acceptances were more likely to be correct than slower acceptances; a phenomenon also seen in primates and indicative that the evidence threshold for a decision changes dynamically with sampling time. To investigate the minimally sufficient circuitry required for these decision-making capacities, we developed a novel model of decision-making. Our model can be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain and is neurobiologically plausible. Our model proposes a system for robust autonomous decision-making with potential application in robotics.

                Even before the eyes move, visual sensitivity improves at the target of the planned eye movement. Yet, it is unknown if such "presaccadic" benefits are merely sensory, or also influence decisional processes. We teased apart these contributions with signal detection theory, and discovered a surprising absence of presaccadic benefits in visual change detection tasks. Participants planned and executed saccades while concurrently detecting and localizing either orientation or contrast changes. Spatial choice bias reliably improved presaccadically but, surprisingly, without a concomitant increase in perceptual sensitivity. Additional investigation with an orientation estimation task, and a Bayesian "variable precision" model, revealed that sensory precision increased at the saccade target, but only for the most recent of two successive stimuli. Moreover, the recent stimulus perceptually biased feature estimates of the prior stimulus, rendering accurate change detection even more challenging. Our results uncover novel perceptual and decisional mechanisms that mediate presaccadic change detection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimizing FreeSurfer's Surface Reconstruction Parameters for Anatomical Feature Estimation</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for non-invasive imaging of the human body. However, the quality and reliability of MRI data can be influenced by various factors, such as hardware and software configurations, image acquisition protocols, and preprocessing techniques. In recent years, the introduction of large-scale neuroimaging datasets has taken an increasingly prominent role in neuroscientific research. The advent of publicly available and standardized repositories has enabled researchers to combine data from multiple sources to explore a wide range of scientific inquiries. This increase in scale allows the study of phenomena with smaller effect sizes over a more diverse sample and with greater statistical power. Other than the variability inherent to the acquisition of the data across sites, preprocessing and feature generation steps implemented in different labs introduce an additional layer of variability which may influence consecutive statistical procedures. In this study, we show that differences in the configuration of surface reconstruction from anatomical MRI using FreeSurfer results in considerable changes to the estimated anatomical features. In addition, we demonstrate the effect these differences have on within-subject similarity and the performance of basic prediction tasks based on the derived anatomical features. Our results show that although FreeSurfer may be provided with either a T2w or a FLAIR scan for the same purpose of improving pial surface estimation (relative to based on the mandatory T1w scan alone), the two configurations have a distinctly different effect. In addition, our findings indicate that the similarity of within-subject scans and performance of a range of models for the prediction of sex and age are significantly effected, they are not significantly improved by either of the enhanced configurations. These results demonstrate the large extent to which elementary and sparsely reported differences in preprocessing workflow configurations influence the derived brain features. The results of this study are meant to underline the importance of optimizing preprocessing procedures based on experimental results prior to their distribution and consecutive standardization and harmonization efforts across public datasets. In addition, preprocessing configurations should be carefully reported and included in any following analytical workflows, to account for any variation originating from such differences. Finally, other representations of the raw data should be explored and studied to provide a more robust framework for data aggregation and sharing.

                Shape perception is essential for numerous everyday behaviors from object recognition to grasping and handling objects. Yet how the brain encodes shape remains poorly understood. Here, we probed shape representations using visual aftereffects (perceptual distortions that occur following extended exposure to a stimulus) to resolve a long-standing debate about shape encoding. We implemented contrasting low-level and high-level computational models of neural adaptation, which made precise and distinct predictions about the illusory shape distortions the observers experience following adaptation. Directly pitting the predictions of the two models against one another revealed that the perceptual distortions are driven by high-level shape attributes derived from the statistics of natural shapes. Our findings suggest that the diverse shape attributes thought to underlie shape encoding (e.g., curvature distributions, shape skeleton, aspect ratio) are the result of a visual system that learns to encode natural shape geometries based on observing many objects.

                Whether you are reading, running or sleeping, your brain and its fluid environment continuously interacts to distribute nutrients and clear metabolic waste. Yet, the precise mechanisms for solute transport within the human brain have remained hard to quantify using imaging techniques alone. From multi-modal human brain MRI data sets in sleeping and sleep-deprived subjects, we identify and quantify CSF tracer transport parameters using forward and inverse subject-specific computational modelling. Our findings support the notion that extracellular diffusion alone is not sufficient as a brain-wide tracer transport mechanism. Instead, we show that human MRI observations align well with transport by either substantially enhanced (3.5 times faster) extracellular diffusion in combination with local clearance rates corresponding to a tracer half-life of up to 5 hours, or by extracellular diffusion augmented by advection with brain-wide average flow speeds on the order of 1-9 micrometers/min. Reduced advection fully explains reduced tracer clearance after sleep-deprivation, supporting the role of sleep and sleep deprivation on human brain clearance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple independent components contribute to event-related potential correlates of conscious vision</a></h4>

              
                Research has revealed two major event-related potential (ERP) markers of visual awareness: the earlier Visual Awareness Negativity (VAN, around 150-250 ms after stimulus onset), and the following Late Positivity (LP, around 300-500 ms after stimulus onset). Understanding the neural sources that give rise to VAN and LP is important in order to understand what kind of neural processes enable conscious visual perception. Although the ERPs afford high temporal resolution, their spatial resolution is limited because multiple separate sources sum up at the scalp level. In the present study, we sought to characterize the locations and time-courses of independent neural sources underlying the ERP correlates of visual awareness by means of Independent Component Analysis (ICA). ICA allows identifying and localizing the temporal dynamics of different neural sources that contribute to the ERP correlates of conscious perception. The present results show that while LP reflects a combination of multiple sources distributed among frontal, parietal and occipito-temporal cortex, the sources of VAN are localized to posterior areas including occipital and temporal cortex. In addition, our analysis reveals that activity in very early sources (roughly -100-100 ms after stimulus onset) in temporal and fronto-parietal cortices correlates with conscious vision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDPs) in Human Large Basket Cells by Norepinephrine and Acetylcholine</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic brain activity has been implicated in many brain functions and it is sensible to neuromodulation, but so far very few studies have been carried out from in vitro experiments in humans. In this study we revealed and characterized a novel rhythmic network activity in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of human neocortex. Intracellular patch-clamp recordings showed that giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) were frequently found in human cortical neurons. GDPs appeared in a low frequency band (~ 0.3 Hz) similar to that described for slow oscillations in vivo, and displayed large amplitudes and long decay times. Under the same experimental conditions, no rhythmic activity was found in L2/3 of the rat neocortex. GDPs were predominantly observed in a subset of L2/3 interneurons considered to be large basket cells based on previously described morphological features. In addition, GDPs are highly sensitive to norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh), two neuromodulators known to affect slow waves in brain activity. NE increased the frequency of the GDPs by enhancing {beta}-adrenergic receptor activity while ACh decreased GDP frequency through M4 muscarinic receptor-activation. Multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings demonstrated that NE promoted synchronous oscillatory network activity while the application of ACh led to a desynchronization of neuronal activity. Our data indicate that the human neocortex is more prone to generate slow wave activity, which was reflected by more pronounced GDPs in L2/3 large basket cells. The distinct modulation of GDPs and slow wave activity by NE and ACh exerts a specific modulatory control over the human neocortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Facial representation comparisons between human brain and deep convolutional neural network reveal a fatigue repetition suppression mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Repetition suppression for faces, a phenomenon that neural responses are reduced to repeated faces in the visual cortex, have long been studied. However, the underlying primary neural mechanism of repetition suppression remains debated. In recent years, artificial neural networks can achieve the performance of face recognition at human level. In our current study, we combined human electroencephalogram (EEG) and the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and applied reverse engineering to provide a novel way to investigate the neural mechanisms of facial repetition suppression. First, we used brain decoding approach to explore the representations of faces and demonstrates its repetition suppression effect in human brains. Then we constructed two repetition suppression models, Fatigue and Sharpening models, to modify the activation of DCNNs and conducted cross-modal representational similarity analysis (RSA) comparisons between human EEG signals and activations in two modified DCNNs, respectively. We found that representations of human brains were more similar to representations of Fatigue-modified DCNN instead of Sharpening modified DCNN. Our results suggests that the facial repetition suppression effect in face perception is more likely caused by the fatigue mechanism suggesting that the activation of neurons with stronger responses to face stimulus would be attenuated more. Therefore, the current study supports the fatigue mechanism as a more plausible neural mechanism of facial repetition suppression. The comparison between representations in the human brain and DCNN provides a promising tool to simulate and infer the brain mechanism underlying human behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The predictive power of intrinsic timescale during the perceptual decision-making process across the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Across the cortical hierarchy, single neurons are characterized by differences in the extent to which they can sustain their firing rate over time (i.e., their "intrinsic timescale"). Previous studies have demonstrated that neurons in a given brain region mostly exhibit either short or long intrinsic timescales. In this study, we sought to identify populations of neurons that accumulate information over different timescales in the mouse brain and to characterize their functions in the context of a visual discrimination task. Thus, we separately examined the neural population dynamics of neurons with long or short intrinsic timescales across different brain regions. More specifically, we looked at the decoding performance of these neural populations aligned to different task variables (stimulus onset, movement). Taken together, our population-level findings support the hypothesis that long intrinsic timescale neurons encode abstract variables related to decision formation. Furthermore, we investigated whether there was a relationship between how well a single neuron represents the animal's choice or stimuli and their intrinsic timescale. We did not observe any significant relationship between the decoding of these task variables and a single neuron's intrinsic timescale. In summary, our findings support the idea that the long intrinsic timescale population of neurons, which appear at different levels of the cortical hierarchy, are primarily more involved in representing the decision variable.

	<p>Objectives: Investigate the biomechanical characteristics in tracheostomized patients with aspiration following acquired brain injury (ABI) and further explore the relationship between the biomechanical characteristics and aspiration. Methods: This is a single-center cross-sectional study. The tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. The biomechanical characteristics, including velopharynx (VP) maximal pressure, tongue base (TB) maximal pressure, upper esophageal sphincter (UES) residual pressure, UES relaxation duration, and subglottic pressure, were examined by high-resolution manometry and computational fluid dynamics simulation analysis. The penetration&amp;amp;ndash;aspiration scale (PAS) score was evaluated by a videofluoroscopic swallowing study. Results: Fifteen healthy subjects and fifteen tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI were included. The decreased VP maximal pressure, increased UES residual pressure, and shortened UES relaxation duration were found in the patient group compared with the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the subglottic pressure significantly decreased in patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while no significant difference was found in TB maximal pressure between groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). In addition, in the patient group, VP maximal pressure (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.439; p = 0.015), UES relaxation duration (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.532; p = 0.002), and the subglottic pressure (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.775; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were negatively correlated with the PAS score, while UES residual pressure (rs = 0.807; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) was positively correlated with the PAS score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), the correlation between TB maximal pressure and PAS score (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.315; p = 0.090) did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: The biomechanical characteristics in tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI might manifest as decreased VP maximal pressure and subglottic pressure, increased UES residual pressure, and shortened UES relaxation duration, in which VP maximal pressure, UES relaxation duration, subglottic pressure, and UES residual pressure were correlated with aspiration.</p>

	<p>Nowadays, fostered by technological progress and contextual circumstances such as the economic crisis and pandemic restrictions, remote education is experiencing growing deployment. However, this growth has generated widespread doubts about the actual effectiveness of remote/online learning compared to face-to-face education. The present study was aimed at comparing face-to-face and remote education through a multimodal neurophysiological approach. It involved forty students at a driving school, in a real classroom, experiencing both modalities. Wearable devices to measure brain, ocular, heart and sweating activities were employed in order to analyse the students&amp;amp;rsquo; neurophysiological signals to obtain insights into the cognitive dimension. In particular, four parameters were considered: the Eye Blink Rate, the Heart Rate and its Variability and the Skin Conductance Level. In addition, the students filled out a questionnaire at the end to obtain an explicit measure of their learning performance. Data analysis showed higher cognitive activity, in terms of attention and mental engagement, in the in-presence setting compared to the remote modality. On the other hand, students in the remote class felt more stressed, particularly during the first part of the lesson. The analysis of questionnaires demonstrated worse performance for the remote group, thus suggesting a common &amp;amp;ldquo;disengaging&amp;amp;rdquo; behaviour when attending remote courses, thus undermining their effectiveness. In conclusion, neuroscientific tools could help to obtain insights into mental concerns, often &amp;amp;ldquo;blind&amp;amp;rdquo;, such as decreasing attention and increasing stress, as well as their dynamics during the lesson itself, thus allowing the definition of proper countermeasures to emerging issues when introducing new practices into daily life.</p>

	<p>Background: The number of geriatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is increasing every year due to the population&amp;amp;rsquo;s aging in most of the developed countries. Unfortunately, there is no widely recognized tool for specifically evaluating the prognosis of geriatric TBI patients. We designed this study to compare the prognostic value of different machine learning algorithm-based predictive models for geriatric TBI. Methods: TBI patients aged &amp;amp;ge;65 from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were eligible for this study. To develop and validate machine learning algorithm-based prognostic models, included patients were divided into a training set and a testing set, with a ratio of 7:3. The predictive value of different machine learning based models was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F score. Results: A total of 1123 geriatric TBI patients were included, with a mortality of 24.8%. Non-survivors had higher age (82.2 vs. 80.7, p = 0.010) and lower Glasgow Coma Scale (14 vs. 7, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than survivors. The rate of mechanical ventilation was significantly higher (67.6% vs. 25.9%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) in non-survivors while the rate of neurosurgical operation did not differ between survivors and non-survivors (24.3% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.735). Among different machine learning algorithms, Adaboost (AUC: 0.799) and Random Forest (AUC: 0.795) performed slightly better than the logistic regression (AUC: 0.792) on predicting mortality in geriatric TBI patients in the testing set. Conclusion: Adaboost, Random Forest and logistic regression all performed well in predicting mortality of geriatric TBI patients. Prognostication tools utilizing these algorithms are helpful for physicians to evaluate the risk of poor outcomes in geriatric TBI patients and adopt personalized therapeutic options for them.</p>

	<p>Background: Balance impairment is a common disability in post-stroke survivors, leading to reduced mobility and increased fall risk. Robotic gait training (RAGT) is largely used, along with traditional training. There is, however, no strong evidence about RAGT superiority, especially on balance. This study aims to determine RAGT efficacy on balance of post-stroke survivors. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PeDRO databases were investigated. Randomized clinical trials evaluating RAGT efficacy on post-stroke survivor balance with Berg Balance Scale (BBS) or Timed Up and Go test (TUG) were searched. Meta-regression analyses were performed, considering weekly sessions, single-session duration, and robotic device used. Results: A total of 18 trials have been included. BBS pre-post treatment mean difference is higher in RAGT-treated patients, with a pMD of 2.17 (95% CI 0.79; 3.55). TUG pre-post mean difference is in favor of RAGT, but not statistically, with a pMD of &amp;amp;minus;0.62 (95%CI &amp;amp;minus; 3.66; 2.43). Meta-regression analyses showed no relevant association, except for TUG and treatment duration (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;1.019, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus; 1.827; &amp;amp;minus;0.210, p-value = 0.0135). Conclusions: RAGT efficacy is equal to traditional therapy, while the combination of the two seems to lead to better outcomes than each individually performed. Robot-assisted balance training should be the focus of experimentation in the following years, given the great results in the first available trials. Given the massive heterogeneity of included patients, trials with more strict inclusion criteria (especially time from stroke) must be performed to finally define if and when RAGT is superior to traditional therapy.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is widely regarded to be the intermediate stage to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Cerebral morphological alteration in cortical subregions can provide an accurate predictor for early recognition of MCI. Thirty patients with MCI and thirty healthy control subjects participated in this study. The Desikan&amp;amp;ndash;Killiany cortical atlas was applied to segment participants&amp;amp;rsquo; cerebral cortex into 68 subregions. A complexity measure termed fractal dimension (FD) was applied to assess morphological changes in cortical subregions of participants. The MCI group revealed significantly decreased FD values in the bilateral temporal lobes, right parietal lobe including the medial temporal, fusiform, para hippocampal, and also the orbitofrontal lobes. We further proposed a novel FD-based brain structural network to compare network parameters, including intra- and inter-lobular connectivity between groups. The control group had five modules, and the MCI group had six modules in their brain networks. The MCI group demonstrated shrinkage of modular sizes with fewer components integrated, and significantly decreased global modularity in the brain network. The MCI group had lower intra- and inter-lobular connectivity in all lobes. Between cerebral lobes, the MCI patients may maintain nodal connections between both hemispheres to reduce connectivity loss in the lateral hemispheres. The method and results presented in this study could be a suitable tool for early detection of MCI.</p>

     alt="Architecture of the inferior parietal cortex in capuchin monkey"/><p>Architectural subdivision of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) of the capuchin monkey in a 3D reconstruction of the left hemisphere. Five architectural areas are shown: three areas in the IPC convexity (PFG, in red; PG, in blue; and Opt, in brown), and two areas in the IPC operculum (PFop, in purple; and PGop, in green).

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the organization of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) in five capuchin monkey (6 hemispheres) using cytoarchitectonic (Nissl), myeloarchitectonic (Gallyas), and immune-architectonic (SMI-32 monoclonal antibody) techniques. We partitioned the IPC into five distinct areas: PFG, PG, Opt, PFop, and PGop. Since we used parasagittal sections, we were not able to study area PF due to its far lateral position, which yielded slices that were tangential to the pial surface. Areas PFG, PG, and Opt were in the convexity close to the lateral sulcus, while PFop and PGop were positioned more posteriorly, in the opercular region of IPC. Of all the five regions, area Opt was the one most similar to its analogue in the macaque, especially as revealed with SMI-32 staining. Namely, in both primate species area Opt showed a low density of large pyramidal neurons. Additionally, the apical dendrites of these neurons were sparse and vertically orientated, resembling columns. We also found area PG to be similar: both species exhibited cell body layers with a radial arrangement. On the other hand, Nissl staining revealed area PFG to be architectonically different between New and Old-World monkeys: PFG in the capuchin showed a comparatively higher cell density than in macaques, especially in layers II and IV. These results suggest that evolution may have enabled the functional specialization of these brain regions based on behavioral demands of upper limb use. The small differences in the IPC of the two primates may be linked to interspecies variability.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sympathetic efferent axons regulate cardiac functions. However, the topographical distribution and morphology of cardiac sympathetic efferent axons remain insufficiently characterized due to the technical challenges involved in immunohistochemical labeling of the thick walls of the whole heart. In this study, flat-mounts of the left and right atria and ventricles of FVB mice were immunolabeled for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of sympathetic nerves. Atrial and ventricular flat-mounts were scanned using a confocal microscope to construct montages. We found (1) <i>In the atria</i>: A few large TH-immunoreactive (IR) axon bundles entered both atria, branched into small bundles and then single axons that eventually formed very dense terminal networks in the epicardium, myocardium and inlet regions of great vessels to the atria. Varicose TH-IR axons formed close contact with cardiomyocytes, vessels, and adipocytes. Multiple intrinsic cardiac ganglia (ICG) were identified in the epicardium of both atria, and a subpopulation of the neurons in the ICG were TH-IR. Most TH-IR axons in bundles traveled through ICG before forming dense varicose terminal networks in cardiomyocytes. We did not observe varicose TH-IR terminals encircling ICG neurons. (2) <i>In the left and right ventricles and interventricular septum</i>: TH-IR axons formed dense terminal networks in the epicardium, myocardium, and vasculature. Collectively, TH labeling is achievable in flat-mounts of thick cardiac walls, enabling detailed mapping of catecholaminergic axons and terminal structures in the whole heart at single-cell/axon/varicosity scale. This approach provides a foundation for future quantification of the topographical organization of the cardiac sympathetic innervation in different pathological conditions.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate molecular biomarkers of a-synuclein and tau aggregation, autophagy, and inflammation in the saliva of de novo Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in comparison to healthy subjects (HS), and to correlate molecular data with clinical features of PD patients, in order to establish whether abnormalities of these parameters are associated with specific clusters of de novo PD patients, and their potential diagnostic power in differentiating PD patients from HS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured total and oligomeric a-synuclein, total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 beta (MAP-LC3beta), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in the saliva of 80 de novo PD patients and 62 HS, using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent Assay analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Oligomeric a-synuclein, total-tau, MAP-LC3beta, and TNFalpha levels resulted significantly higher in patients with respect to HS, while no significant differences were detected for total a-synuclein or phosphorylated-tau. Phosphorylated-tau directly correlated with MAP-LC3beta, whereas it inversely correlated with TNFalpha in PD patients. An inverse correlation was detected between MAP-LC3beta and non-motor symptoms severity. Principal Component Analysis showed that molecular and clinical parameters were independent of each other in de novo PD patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis reported an accurate diagnostic performance of oligomeric a-synuclein and MAP-LC3beta. The diagnostic accuracy of total a-synuclein increased when it was combined with other salivary biomarkers targeting different molecular pathways.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study proposes a novel biomarker panel using saliva, a non-invasive biofluid, in de novo PD patients, with implications in understanding the molecular pathways involved in PD pathogenesis and the relevance of different molecular pathways in determining clinical PD subtypes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic factors have long been debated as a cause of failure of surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). We investigated whether rare genetic variation influences seizure outcomes of MTLE surgery.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an international, multicenter, whole exome sequencing study of patients who underwent surgery for drug-resistant, unilateral MTLE with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or MRI evidence of hippocampal sclerosis and ≥2-year postsurgical follow-up. Patients with either sustained seizure freedom (favorable outcome) or ongoing uncontrolled seizures since surgery (unfavorable outcome) were included. Exomes of controls without epilepsy were also included. Gene set burden analyses were carried out to identify genes with significant enrichment of rare deleterious variants in patients compared to controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine centers from 3 continents contributed 206 patients operated for drug-resistant unilateral MTLE, of whom 196 (149 with favorable outcome and 47 with unfavorable outcome) were included after stringent quality control. Compared to 8,718 controls, MTLE cases carried a higher burden of ultrarare missense variants in constrained genes that are intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variants (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9–3.5, <i>p</i> = 1.3E-09) and in genes encoding voltage-gated cation channels (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4–3.8, <i>p</i> = 2.7E-04). Proportions of subjects with such variants were comparable between patients with favorable outcome and those with unfavorable outcome, with no significant between-group differences.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Rare variation contributes to the genetic architecture of MTLE, but does not appear to have a major role in failure of MTLE surgery. These findings can be incorporated into presurgical decision-making and counseling. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Grasping with a twist: Dissociating action goals from motor actions in human frontoparietal circuits</a></h4>

              
                In daily life, prehension is typically not the end goal of hand-object interactions but a precursor for manipulation. Nevertheless, functional MRI (fMRI) studies investigating manual manipulation have primarily relied on prehension as the end goal of an action. Here, we used slow event-related fMRI to investigate differences in neural activation patterns between prehension in isolation and prehension for object manipulation. Eighteen participants were instructed either to simply grasp the handle of a rotatable dial (isolated prehension) or to grasp and turn it (prehension for object manipulation). We used representational similarity analysis to investigate whether the experimental conditions could be discriminated from each other based on differences in task-related brain activation patterns. We also used temporal multivoxel pattern analysis to examine the evolution of regional activation patterns over time. Importantly, we were able to differentiate isolated prehension and prehension for manipulation from activation patterns in the early visual cortex, the caudal intraparietal sulcus, and the superior parietal lobule. Our findings indicate that object manipulation extends beyond the putative cortical grasping network (anterior intraparietal sulcus, premotor and motor cortices) to include the superior parietal lobule and early visual cortex.

Significance statementA simple act such as turning an oven dial requires not only that the central nervous system encode the initial state (starting dial orientation) of the object but also the appropriate posture to grasp it in order to achieve the desired end state (final dial orientation) and the motor commands to achieve that state. Using advanced temporal neuroimaging analysis techniques, we reveal how such actions unfold over time and how they differ between object manipulation (turning a dial) vs. grasping alone. We find that a combination of brain areas implicated in visual processing and sensorimotor integration can distinguish between the complex and simple tasks during planning, with neural patterns that approximate those during the actual execution of the action.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory and Reward Connectivity in Young and Older Adults During Music Listening and Rest</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic organization of functional brain networks is known to change with age, and is affected by perceptual input and task conditions. Here, we compare functional activity and connectivity during music listening and rest between young (N=24) and older (N=24) adults, using whole brain regression, seed-based connectivity, and ROI-ROI connectivity analyses. We found that although auditory and reward regions follow expected patterns of activation in response to music listening across both groups, younger adults show higher within-network connectivity of auditory and reward regions as compared to older adults during both rest and music listening. We also show that this age-related difference was reduced during music listening, especially in individuals showing high self-reported musical reward. Furthermore, young adults showed higher connectivity between auditory network and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that was specific to music listening and varied as a function of liking ratings. Meanwhile, older adults showed a more globally diffuse pattern of connectivity, including higher connectivity to bilateral lingual and inferior frontal gyri. Finally, connectivity between auditory and reward regions was higher during well-liked musical stimuli across all participants, and especially higher when listening to music selected by the participant. These results highlight the roles of aging and reward sensitivity on auditory and reward networks. Results may inform the design of music-based interventions in aging populations, and improve our understanding of functional network dynamics as a whole.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Synchronization as a Function of Engagement with the Narrative</a></h4>

              
                We can all agree that a good story engages us, however, agreeing which story is good is far more debatable. In this study, we explored whether engagement with a narrative synchronizes listeners' brain responses, by examining individual differences in engagement to the same story. To do so, we pre-registered and re-analyzed a previously collected dataset by Chang et al. (2021) of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of 25 participants who listened to a one-hour story and answered questionnaires. We assessed the degree of their overall engagement with the story and their engagement with the main characters. The questionnaires revealed individual differences in engagement with the story, as well as different valence towards specific characters. Neuroimaging data showed that the auditory cortex, the default mode network (DMN) and language regions were involved in processing the story. Increased engagement with the story was correlated with increased neural synchronization within regions in the DMN (especially the medial prefrontal cortex), as well as regions outside the DMN such as the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the reward system. Interestingly, positively and negatively engaging characters elicited different patterns of neural synchronization. Finally, engagement increased functional connectivity within and between the DMN, the dorsal attention network and the control network. Taken together, these findings suggest that engagement with a narrative synchronizes listeners' responses in regions involved in mentalizing, reward, working memory and attention. By examining individual differences in engagement, we revealed that these synchronization patterns are due to engagement, and not due to differences in the narrative's content.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning Cortical Hierarchies with Temporal Hebbian Updates.</a></h4>

              
                A key driver of mammalian intelligence is the ability to represent incoming sensory information across multiple abstraction levels. For example, in the visual ventral stream, incoming signals are first represented as low-level edge filters and then transformed into high-level object representations. These same hierarchical structures routinely emerge in artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained for image/object recognition tasks, suggesting that a similar process might underlie biological neural networks. However, the classical ANN training algorithm, backpropagation, is considered biologically implausible, and thus several alternative biologically plausible methods have been developed. For instance, several cortical-inspired ANNs in which the apical dendrite of a pyramidal neuron encodes top-down prediction signals have been proposed. In this case, akin to theories of predictive coding, a prediction error can be calculated locally inside each neuron for updating its incoming weights. Notwithstanding, from a neuroscience perspective, it is unclear whether neurons could compare their apical vs. somatic spiking activities to compute prediction errors. Here, we propose a solution to this problem by adapting the framework of the apical-somatic prediction error to the temporal domain. In particular, we show that if the apical feedback signal changes the postsynaptic firing rate, we can use differential Hebbian updates, a rate-based version of the classical spiking time-dependent plasticity (STDP) updates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a cortical-like deep ANN has been trained using such time-based learning rules. Overall, our work removes a key requirement of biologically plausible models for deep learning that does not align with plasticity rules observed in biology and proposes a learning mechanism that would explain how the timing of neuronal activity can allow supervised hierarchical learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Both GEF domains of the autism and epilepsy-associated Trio protein are required for proper tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Recessive mutations in the TRIO gene are associated with intellectual deficiency (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). TRIO is a dual guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA. Trio has been extensively studied in excitatory neurons, and has recently been found to regulate the switch from tangential to radial migration in GABAergic interneurons (INs), through GEFD1-Rac1-dependent SDF1/CXCR4 signalling. Given the central role of Rho-GTPases during neuronal migration and the implication of IN pathologies in ASD and DEE, we investigated the relative roles of both Trios GEF domains in regulating the dynamics of INs tangential migration. In Trio-/- mice, we observed reduced numbers of tangentially migrating INs, with intact progenitor proliferation. Further, we noted increased growth cone collapse in developing INs, suggesting altered cytoskeleton dynamics. To bypass the embryonic mortality of Trio-/- mice, we generated Dlx5/6Cre;Trioc/c conditional mutant mice, which develop spontaneous seizures and behavioral deficits reminiscent of ASD and ID. These phenotypes are associated with reduced cortical IN density and functional cortical inhibition. Mechanistically, this reduction of cortical IN numbers reflects a premature switch to radial migration, with an aberrant early entry in the cortical plate, as well as major deficits in cytoskeletal dynamics, including enhanced leading neurite branching and slower nucleokinesis reflecting reduced actin filament condensation and turnover. Further, we show that both Trio GEFD1 and GEFD2 domains are required for proper IN migration, with a dominant role of the RhoA-activating GEFD2 domain. Altogether, our data show a critical role of the DEE/ASD-associated Trio gene in the establishment of cortical inhibition and the requirement of both GEF domains in regulating IN migration dynamics.

                The goal of describing how the human brain responds to complex acoustic stimuli has driven auditory neuroscience research for decades. Often, a systems-based approach has been taken, in which neurophysiological responses are modeled based on features of the presented stimulus. This includes a wealth of work modeling electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to complex acoustic stimuli such as speech. Examples of the acoustic features used in such modeling include the amplitude envelope and spectrogram of speech. These models implicitly assume a direct mapping from stimulus representation to cortical activity. However, in reality, the representation of sound is transformed as it passes through early stages of the auditory pathway, such that inputs to the cortex are fundamentally different from the raw audio signal that was presented. Thus, it could be valuable to account for the transformations taking place in lower-order auditory areas, such as the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, and inferior colliculus (IC) when predicting cortical responses to complex sounds. Specifically, because IC responses are more similar to cortical inputs than acoustic features derived directly from the audio signal, we hypothesized that linear mappings (temporal response functions; TRFs) fit to the outputs of an IC model would better predict EEG responses to speech stimuli. To this end, we modeled responses to the acoustic stimuli as they passed through the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, and inferior colliculus before fitting a TRF to the output of the modeled IC responses. Results showed that using model-IC responses in traditional systems analyses resulted in better predictions of EEG activity than using the envelope or spectrogram of a speech stimulus. Further, it was revealed that model-IC derived TRFs predict different aspects of the EEG than acoustic-feature TRFs, and combining both types of TRF models provides a more accurate prediction of the EEG response.

                The immediate molecular consequences of traumatic brain injuries or TBI are poorly understood. Here, we simulated TBI using an innovative laboratory apparatus that employs a 5.1 kg dummy head holding neuronal cells and generating a [&le;]4,000 g-force acceleration upon impact. Dynamic impact led to both reduction in neuron viability and massive solubility changes in the proteome profiled using Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay. The affected proteins mapped not only to the expected pathways like cell adhesion, collagen and laminin structures, as well as response to stress, but also to other dense protein networks, such as immune response, complement and coagulation cascades. The cellular effects are found to be mainly due to the shockwave rather than the g-force acceleration. Soft materials could reduce the impact severity only until being fully compressed. This study shows way to develop a proteome-based meter for measuring irreversible shockwave-induced cell damage and provides a resource for identifying TBI protein biomarkers and potential drug targets for developing products aiming at primary prevention and intervention.

                Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading cause of non-genetic intellectual disabilities in the Western world and is responsible of a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Structural and functional deficits in brain connectivity have been reported in FASD patients; still, whether and how PAE affects the axonal development of neurons and disrupts the wiring between brain regions is not known. Here, we developed a mouse model of moderate alcohol exposure during prenatal brain wiring to study the impact of PAE on corpus callosum (CC) development, a major white matter tract reported to be affected in FASD patients. Our results show that PAE induces aberrant navigation of interhemispheric CC axons that persist even after the end of the exposure, causing their ectopic termination in the contralateral cortex. Furthermore, these defects in interhemispheric connectivity persist into adulthood and are associated with defective bilateral sensorimotor coordination in behavioral tasks requiring cortical control and interhemispheric communication. Finally, we identified neuronal miR-17-5p and its target Ephrin type A receptor 4 (EphA4) as mediators of the effect of alcohol on the contralateral targeting of CC axons. Taken together, our results suggest that alteration of miRNA-mediated regulation of axon guidance signaling by prenatal alcohol exposure affects interhemispheric cortical connectivity and associated behavior in FASD.

                The neonatal period represents a critical phase of human brain development. During this time, the brain shows a dramatic increase in size, but it remains largely unclear how the morphology of the human brain develops in early post-partum life. Here we show that human newborns undergo a rapid formation of brain shape, beyond the expected growth in brain size. Using fractal analysis of structural neuroimaging data, we show that brain shape (i) strongly reflects infant maturity beyond differences in brain size, (ii) significantly outperforms brain size in predicting infant age at scan (mean error ~4 days), (iii) detects persistent alterations in prematurely born infants that are not captured by brain size, (iv) is consistently more sensitive to genetic similarity among neonates, and (v) is superior in predicting which newborns are twin siblings, with up to 97% accuracy. These findings identify the formation of brain shape as a fundamental maturational process in human brain development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the neural underpinnings of motivation for walking exercise</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motivation is critically important for rehabilitation, exercise, and motor performance, but its neural basis is poorly understood. Recent correlational research suggests that superior frontal gyrus medial area 9 (SFG9m) may be involved in motivation for walking activity. This study experimentally evaluated brain activity changes in periods of additional motivation during walking exercise, and tested how these brain activity changes relate to self-reported exercise motivation and walking speed. Methods: Non-disabled adults (N=26; 65% female; 25 {+/-} 5 years old) performed a vigorous exercise experiment involving 20 trials of maximal speed overground walking. Half of the trials were randomized to include "extra motivation" stimuli (lap timer, tracked best lap time and verbal encouragement). Wearable near-infrared spectroscopy measured oxygenated hemoglobin responses ({Delta}HbO2) from frontal lobe regions, including the SFG9m, primary motor, dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior prefrontal, supplementary motor and dorsal premotor cortices. Results: Compared with standard trials, participants walked faster during "extra-motivation" trials (2.67 vs. 2.43 m/s; p<0.0001) and had higher {Delta}HbO2 in all tested brain regions. This extra motivation effect on {Delta}HbO2 was greatest for SFG9m (+703 uM) compared with other regions (+45 to +354 uM; p[&le;]0.04). Greater SFG9m activity was correlated with more self-determined motivation for exercise and faster walking speed. Conclusions: Simple motivational stimuli during walking exercise seem to upregulate widespread brain regions, especially SFG9m. This could help explain the positive effects of motivational feedback on gait outcomes observed in prior rehabilitation research. Thus, these findings provide a potential biologic basis for the benefits of motivational stimuli, elicited with clinically-feasible methods during walking exercise. Future clinical studies could build on this information to develop prognostic biomarkers and test novel brain stimulation targets for enhancing exercise motivation (e.g. SFG9m).

                Memory problems are common among older adults with a history of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Employing a machine learning framework, the current study investigates the use of multi-domain features to classify individuals with and without alcohol-induced memory problems. A group of 94 individuals (ages 50-81 years) with alcohol-induced memory problems (Memory group) were compared with a matched Control group who did not have memory problems. The Random Forests model identified specific features from each domain that contributed to the classification of Memory vs. Control group (AUC=88.29%). Specifically, individuals from the Memory group manifested a predominant pattern of hyperconnectivity across the default mode network regions except some connections involving anterior cingulate cortex which were predominantly hypoconnected. Other significant contributing features were (i) polygenic risk scores for AUD, (ii) alcohol consumption and related health consequences during the past 5 years, such as health problems, past negative experiences, withdrawal symptoms, and the largest number of drinks in a day during the past 12 months, and (iii) elevated neuroticism and increased harm avoidance, and fewer positive "uplift" life events. At the neural systems level, hyperconnectivity across the default mode network regions, including the connections across the hippocampal hub regions, in individuals with memory problems may indicate dysregulation in neural information processing. Overall, the study outlines the importance of utilizing multidomain features, consisting of resting-state brain connectivity collected ~18 years ago, together with personality, life experiences, polygenic risk, and alcohol consumption and related consequences, to predict alcohol-related memory problems that arise in later life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Garments that measure EEG: Evaluation of an EEG sensor layer fully implemented with smart textiles</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents the first garment capable of measuring EEG activity with accuracy comparable to state-of-the art dry EEG systems. The main innovation is an EEG sensor layer (i.e., the electrodes, the signal transmission, and the cap support) fully implemented as a garment, using threads, fabrics and smart textiles, without relying on any metal or plastic materials. The garment is interfaced via a connector to a mobile EEG amplifier to complete the measurement system. The new EEG system (Garment-EEG) has been characterized with respect to a state-of-the-art Ag/AgCl dry-EEG system (Dry-EEG) over the forehead area of healthy participants in terms of: (1) skin-electrode impedance; (2) electrophysiological measurements (spontaneous and evoked EEG activity); (3) artifacts; and (4) user ergonomics and comfort. The results show that the Garment-EEG system provides comparable recordings to Dry-EEG, but it is more prone to getting affected by artifacts in adverse recording conditions due to poorer contact impedances. Ergonomics and comfort favor the textile-based sensor layer with respect to its metal-based counterpart. User acceptance is the main obstacle for EEG systems to democratize neurotechnology and non-invasive brain-computer interfaces. EEG sensor layers encapsulated in wearables have the potential to enable neurotechnology that is naturally accepted by people in their daily lives. Furthermore, by supporting the EEG implementation in the textile industry it is manufactured with lower cost and much less pollution compared to the metal and plastic industries.

                Oligodendrocytes are the sole myelin producing cells in the central nervous system. Oligodendrocyte numbers are tightly controlled across diverse brain regions to match local axon type and number, but the underlying mechanisms and functional significance remain unclear. Here, we show that autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved cellular process that promotes cell survival under canonical settings, elicits premyelinating oligodendrocyte apoptosis during development and regulates critical aspects of nerve pulse propagation. Autophagy flux is increased in premyelinating oligodendrocytes, and its genetic blockage causes ectopic oligodendrocyte survival throughout the entire brain. Autophagy acts in the TFEB-Bax/Bak pathway and elevates PUMA mRNA levels to trigger premyelinating oligodendrocyte apoptosis cell-autonomously. Autophagy continuously functions in the myelinating oligodendrocytes to limit myelin sheath numbers and fine-tune nerve pulse propagation. Our results provide in vivo evidence showing that autophagy promotes apoptosis in mammalian cells under physiological conditions and reveal key intrinsic mechanisms governing oligodendrocyte number.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The (Limited?) Utility of Brain Age as a Biomarker for Capturing Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                For decades, neuroscientists have been on a quest to search for a biomarker that can help capture age-related cognitive decline. One well-known candidate is Brain Age, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict chronological age from brain MRI data. Here we aim to formally evaluate the utility of Brain Age as a biomarker for capturing cognitive decline. Using 504 aging participants (36-100 years old) from the Human Connectome Project in Aging, we created 26 age-prediction models for Brain Age based on different combinations of MRI modalities. We first tested how much Brain Age from these age-prediction models added to what we had already known from a chronological age in capturing cognitive decline. Based on the commonality analyses, we found a large degree of overlap between Brain Age and chronological age, so much so that, at best, Brain Age could uniquely add only around 1.6% in explaining the variation in cognitive decline. Next, the age-prediction models that performed better at predicting chronological age did not necessarily create better Brain Age for capturing cognitive decline beyond chronological age. Instead, better-performing age-prediction models created Brain Age that overlapped larger with chronological age, up to around 29% out of 32%, in explaining cognitive decline. Lastly, unlike Brain Age, Brain Cognition, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict cognitive abilities from brain MRI data, provided much higher unique effects. Brain Cognition added over 11% to explain the variation in cognitive decline beyond chronological age, leading to around a 1/3-time improvement of the total variation explained. Accordingly, while demonstrating the limited utility of Brain Age, we provided a solution to improve our ability to use brain MRI data as a biomarker for cognitive decline.

                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been proposed to link sensory inputs and behavioral outputs to mediate the execution of learned behaviors. However, how such a link is implemented has remained unclear. To measure prefrontal neural correlates of sensory stimuli and learned behaviors, we performed population calcium imaging during a novel tone-signaled active avoidance paradigm in mice. We developed a novel analysis approach based on dimensionality reduction and decoding that allowed us to identify and isolate population activity patterns related the tone stimulus, learned avoidance actions and general motion. While tone-related activity was not informative about behavior, avoidance-related activity was predictive of upcoming avoidance actions. Moreover, avoidance-related activity distinguished between two different learned avoidance actions, consistent with a model in which mPFC contributes to the selection between different goal-directed actions. Overall, our results suggest that mPFC circuit dynamics transform sensory inputs into specific behavioral outputs through distributed population-level computations.

                Neurophysiological studies suggest that intrinsic brain oscillations influence sensory processing, especially of rhythmic stimuli like speech. Prior work suggests that brain rhythms may mediate perceptual grouping and selective attention to speech amidst competing sound, as well as more linguistic aspects of speech processing like predictive coding. However, we know of no prior studies that have directly tested, at the single-trial level, whether brain oscillations relate to speech-in-noise outcomes. Here, we combined electroencephalography while simultaneously measuring intelligibility of spoken sentences amidst two different interfering sounds: multi-talker babble or speech-shaped noise. We find that induced parieto-occipital alpha (7-15 Hz; thought to modulate attentional focus) and frontal beta (13-30 Hz; associated with speech-motor predictive coding) oscillations covary with trial-wise percent-correct scores; importantly, alpha and beta power provide significant independent contributions to predicting single-trial behavioral outcomes. Moreover, we observed large individual differences in the across-trial distribution of alpha and beta power as well as in the alpha-to-beta power ratio. This raises the possibility that listeners employed different task strategies: some may have relied heavily on focusing attention, while others on predictive coding. These results can inform models of speech processing and guide noninvasive measures to index different neural processes that together support complex listening.

	<p>Objective: To explore the characteristics and dynamic evolution of cognitive impairment in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Methods: Twenty-five patients with acute NMOSD and 30 age-matched healthy individuals were consecutively recruited in this study. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Chinese Version of Rey Auditory Vocabulary Learning Test (CRAVLT), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Digital Span Test (DST), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task 3/2s version (PASAT-3/2), Rey&amp;amp;ndash;Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF) and Stroop Color and Word Test (CWT) were used to evaluate cognitive function. The correlations between cognitive function and serum aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) antibody titer were analyzed. Results: Sixty-four percent of patients with acute NMOSD had cognitive dysfunction. MoCA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CRAVLT-N7 (p = 0.004), CRAVLT-N8 (p = 0.011), ROCF-C (p = 0.005), ROCF-R (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), PASAT-3 (p = 0.013), PASAT-2 (p = 0.001) and CWT-A (p = 0.017) were significantly worse in patients with acute NMOSD than those in control group. During follow-up visits, significant differences of serum AQP-4 antibody titers were still noted in NMOSD patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while no significant differences were found by MoCA. Conclusion: A high number of patients with acute NMOSD suffer from cognitive dysfunction. Serum AQP-4 antibody titers can decrease during disease remission, while obvious cognitive decline in these patients still exists.</p>

	<p>The objective of this meta-analysis was to present transparent data on the morphology of the pituitary gland (PG) using the available data in the literature. The main online medical databases, such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched to gather all relevant studies regarding PG morphology. The mean overall volume of the PG was found to be 597.23 mm3 (SE = 28.81). The mean overall height of the PG was established to be 5.64 mm (SE = 0.11). The mean overall length of the PG was found to be 9.98 mm (SE = 0.26). In the present study, the PG&amp;amp;rsquo;s overall morphology and morphometric features were analyzed. Our results showed that, on average, females from Asia have the highest volume of PG (706.69 mm3), and males from Europe have the lowest (456.42 mm3). These values are crucial to be aware of because they represent the normal average properties of the PG, which may be used as reference points when trying to diagnose potential pathologies of this gland. Furthermore, the present study&amp;amp;rsquo;s results prove how the PG&amp;amp;rsquo;s size decreases with age. The results of the present study may be helpful for physicians, especially surgeons, performing procedures on the PG.</p>

	<p>It is reasonable to assume that emotional processes are involved in creative tasks and the generation of creative ideas. In this pilot study, we investigate the emotional correlates in professional drummers during different degrees of creative music playing. Ten participants performed three tasks: repetitive rhythmic drum playing, pattern-based improvisation, and attention-intensive free improvisation, while their EEG activity was recorded. Arousal and valence levels were estimated from the EEG data at baseline and for the three tasks. Results show significantly increased levels of valence (i.e., increased prefrontal right alpha power compared to prefrontal left alpha power) during pattern-based and free improvisation relative to baseline, and significantly increased levels of valence during free improvisation relative to pattern-based improvisation. These results seem to indicate that positive emotion (characterized as increased valence) is associated with the creation of original ideas in drum playing and that the freer the creative process, the greater the positive effect. The implication of these results may be of particular relevance in the fields of music-based therapeutic interventions and music pedagogy.</p>

	<p>Objective: Anxiety symptoms are persistent in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but the underlying neural substrates are still unclear. In the current study, we aimed to explore the underlying neural mechanisms in PD patients with anxiety symptoms. Methods: 42 PD-A patients, 41 PD patients without anxiety symptoms (PD-NA), and 40 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in the present study. All the subjects performed 3.0T fMRI scans. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) analysis was used to investigate the alterations in neural activity among the three groups. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the altered fALFF value of the PD-A group and anxiety scores. Results: Compared with HCs, PD-A patients had higher fALFF values in the left cerebellum, cerebellum posterior lobe, bilateral temporal cortex, and brainstem and lower fALFF values in the bilateral inferior gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia areas, and left inferior parietal lobule. Moreover, between the two PD groups, PD-A patients showed higher fALFF values in the right precuneus and lower fALFF values in the bilateral inferior gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia areas, left inferior parietal lobule, and left occipital lobe. Furthermore, Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis demonstrated that the right precuneus and left caudate were correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Conclusion: Our study found that anxiety symptoms in PD patients may be related to alterations of neurological activities in multiple brain regions. Furthermore, these may be critical radiological biomarkers for PD-A patients. Therefore, these findings can improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD-A.</p>

	<p>These are the preliminary results of a 12-week non-randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study comparing the effectiveness of trazodone in an extended-release formulation (XR) versus SSRIs in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants (n = 76) were recruited, and 42 were assigned to the trazodone XR group and 34 to the SSRIs group. The choice of drug was based on clinical presentation and relied upon the attending physician. Assessments were made at five observation time points, at the following weeks: 0, and after 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The evaluations included: symptoms of depression (MADRS, QIDS-clinician, and self-rated versions-primary study endpoints), anhedonia (SHAPS), anxiety (HAM-A), insomnia (AIS), psychosocial functioning (SDS), and therapeutic efficacy (CGI). At baseline, the trazodone group had significantly more severe depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms and worse psychosocial functioning compared to the SSRIs group. After 12 weeks, trazodone XR was more effective than SSRIs in reducing the severity of insomnia and depression. There were no differences between the groups in the frequencies of therapeutic response and remission, which indicated the non-inferiority of the trazodone XR treatment. In conclusion, our results showed that in a &amp;amp;ldquo;real world&amp;amp;rdquo; setting, trazodone XR is effective in the treatment of patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: We investigated the differences in the neuropsychological profile as well as the pneumological and motor functions in two groups of patients admitted to rehabilitation who received different respiratory support during their COVID-19 infection. (2) Methods: Group-1 (n = 18; 15 male, median age 67.5) consisted of patients who received non-invasive mechanical ventilation; Group-2 (n = 19; 16 male, median age 63) consisted of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (R-BANS) to evaluate the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; cognition. Depression and anxiety were also measured at admission and discharge to rehabilitation. (3) Results: At admission, patients impaired at MMSE were 44% in Group-1 and 5% in Group-2, while patients impaired at FAB were 88% in Group-1 and 26% in Group-2. Wilcoxon&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size revealed meaningful differences between groups for FAB, R-BANS global score, immediate and delayed memory, and attention-coding task, with Group-2 performing better than Group-1 across all measures. At discharge, 52% of the 25 patients re-assessed still had mild to moderate cognitive deficits, while 19% had depression and 35% had anxiety. (4) Conclusions: Patients who received oxygen therapy experienced higher levels of acute and chronic stress compared to those who benefitted from invasive mechanical ventilation. Despite patients showing a meaningful improvement at discharge, cognitive impairment persisted in a great number of patients; therefore, long-term neuropsychological follow-up and treatment for COVID-19 patients are recommended.</p>

	<p>GGC repeat expansions in the 5&amp;amp;rsquo; untranslated region (5&amp;amp;rsquo;UTR) of the Notch Homolog 2 N-terminal-like C gene (NOTCH2NLC) have been reported to be the genetic cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). However, whether they exist in other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. To determine whether there is a medium-length amplification of NOTCH2NLC in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we screened 476 ALS patients and 210 healthy controls for the presence of a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC by using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) and fragment analysis. The repeat number in ALS patients was 16.11 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.7 (range 7&amp;amp;ndash;46), whereas the repeat number in control subjects was 16.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.79 (range 10&amp;amp;ndash;29). An intermediate-length GGC repeat expansion was observed in two ALS patients (numbers of repeats: 45, 46; normal repeat number &amp;amp;le; 40) but not in the control group. The results suggested that the intermediate NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion was associated with Chinese ALS patients, and further functional studies for intermediate-length variation are required to identify the mechanism.</p>

	<p>The aim of the present study was to examine the neurobiological correlates of the two negative symptom domains of schizophrenia, the Motivational Deficit domain (including avolition, anhedonia, and asociality) and the Expressive Deficit domain (including blunted affect and alogia), focusing on brain areas that are most commonly found to be associated with negative symptoms in previous literature. Resting-state (rs) fMRI data were analyzed in 62 subjects affected by schizophrenia (SZs) and 46 healthy controls (HCs). The SZs, compared to the HCs, showed higher rs brain activity in the right inferior parietal lobule and the right temporoparietal junction, and lower rs brain activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the bilateral anterior dorsal cingulate cortex, and the ventral and dorsal caudate. Furthermore, in the SZs, the rs brain activity in the left orbitofrontal cortex correlated with negative symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.436, p = 0.006), in particular with the Motivational Deficit domain (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.424, p = 0.002), even after controlling for confounding factors. The left ventral caudate correlated with negative symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.407, p = 0.003), especially with the Expressive Deficit domain (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.401, p = 0.003); however, these results seemed to be affected by confounding factors. In line with the literature, our results demonstrated that the two negative symptom domains might be underpinned by different neurobiological mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Prolactinomas have been reported to impair cognition in broad aspects. However, few studies investigated the influence of prolactinomas on cognitive flexibility never mentioning the underlying neural and electrophysiological mechanism. We recorded scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in a colour-shape switching task. Patients with prolactinomas showed longer reaction time in switch trials and larger switch costs relative to healthy controls (HCs). Compared to HCs who showed stronger frontal theta activity in switch trials, the generally weak frontal theta activity in patients implied that they could not afford the executive control to configure task sets. Meanwhile, machine-learning based classification revealed that patients manifested non-selective brain patterns in response to different task types (colour vs. shape task) and different task states (switch vs. repeat state), which collectively suggested the cognitive dysfunction in preparation for a changing environment. Compared to HCs who showed stronger frontoparietal synchronization in switch trials, this enhanced frontoparietal connectivity was disrupted among patients with severe prolactinomas. This finding implicated greater hyperprolactinemia was linked to a larger decrease in cognitive performance. Taken together, the present study highlighted frontal theta power, and frontoparietal connectivity at theta band as the electrophysiological markers of the impaired cognitive flexibility and task control in patients with prolactinomas.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the association between beta oscillations and brain iron deposition. Beta oscillations were filtered from the microelectrode recordings of local field potentials (LFP) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the ratio of the power spectral density of beta oscillations (PSDXb) to that of the LFP signals was calculated. Iron deposition in the deep gray matter (DGM) structures was indirectly assessed using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), part III, was used to assess the severity of symptoms. Spearman correlation coefficients were applied to assess the associations of PSDXb with QSM values in the DGM structures and the severity of symptoms. PSDXb showed a significant positive correlation with the average QSM values in DGM structures, including caudate and substantia nigra (SN) (p = 0.008 and 0.044). Similarly, the PSDXb showed significant negative correlations with the severity of symptoms, including axial symptoms and the gait in the medicine-off state (p = 0.006 for both). The abnormal iron metabolism in the SN and striatum pathways may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the occurrence of abnormal beta oscillations in the STN, and beta oscillations may serve as important pathophysiological biomarkers of PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal synaptic density PET with 11C‐UCB‐J 6 months after ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore longitudinal changes in synaptic density after ischemic stroke in vivo with synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) PET.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited patients with an ischemic stroke to undergo <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J PET/MR within the first month and 6 months after stroke. We investigated longitudinal changes of partial volume corrected <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio; relative to centrum semiovale) within the ischemic lesion, peri-ischemic area and unaffected ipsilesional and contralesional grey matter. We also explored crossed cerebellar diaschisis at 6 months. Additionally, we defined brain regions potentially influencing upper limb motor recovery after stroke and studied <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR evolution in comparison to baseline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 13 patients (age = 67±15 years) we observed decreasing <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR in the ischemic lesion (ΔSUVR = -1.0, p=0.001) and peri-ischemic area (ΔSUVR = -0.31, p=0.02) at 6 months after stroke compared to baseline. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis as measured with <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR was present in 11/13 (85%) patients at 6 months. <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR did not augment in ipsilesional or contralesional brain regions associated with motor recovery. On the contrary, there was an overall trend of declining <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR in these brain regions, reaching statistical significance only in the non-lesioned part of the ipsilesional supplementary motor area (ΔSUVR = -0.83, p=0.046).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>At 6 months after stroke, synaptic density further declined in the ischemic lesion and peri-ischemic area compared to baseline. Brain regions previously demonstrated to be associated with motor recovery after stroke did not show increases in synaptic density.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The role of ascending ventral‐tegmental fibers for recovery after stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The integrity of cortical motor networks and their descending effector-pathway (the corticospinal tract; CST) is a major determinant motor recovery after stroke. However, this view neglects the importance of ascending tracts and their modulatory effects on cortical physiology. Here, we explore the role of such a tract that connects dopaminergic ventral tegmental midbrain nuclei to motor cortex (the VTMC-tract) for post-stroke recovery.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Lesion data and diffusivity parameters (fractional anisotropy) of the ipsi- and contralesional VTMC-tract and CST were obtained from 133 patients (63.9±13.4 years, 45 female) during acute and chronic stage after first-ever ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. Degeneration of VTMC-tract and CST was quantified and related to clinical outcome parameters (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] with motor and cortical-symptom subscores; modified Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score [mFMMS]; modified Ranking Scale [mRS]).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A significant post-stroke degeneration occurred in both tracts, but only VTMC-degeneration was associated with lesion size. Using multiple regression models, we dissected the impact of particular tracts on recovery: Changes in VTMC-tract integrity were stronger associated with independence in daily activities (mRS), upper limb motor impairment (mFMMS) and cortical symptoms (aphasia, neglect) captured by NIHSS compared to CST. Changes in CST-integrity merely were associated with the degree of hemiparesis (NIHSS motor subscale).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Post-stroke outcome is influenced by ascending (VTMC) and descending (CST) fiber tracts. Favourable outcome regarding independence (mRS), upper limb motor function (mFMMS) and cortical symptoms (aphasia, neglect) was stronger related to the ascending than descending tract.</p>

                DNA repair via non-homologous end joining is regulated by poorly understood accessory factors. De Bragança et al. find that APLF promotes the stable joining of DNA ends by Ku70-Ku80, further reinforced by long non-coding RNA NIHCOLE. They propose that Ku70-Ku80 simultaneously binds DNA ends, APLF, and lncRNAs to strengthen DNA synapsis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Traumatic brain injury induced microglial and Caspase3 activation in the retina</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is among the main causes of sudden death after head trauma. These injuries can result in severe degeneration and neuronal cell death in the CNS, including the retina which is a crucial part of the brain responsible for perceiving and transmitting visual information. The long-term effects of mild-repetitive TBI (rmTBI) are far less studied thus far, even though damages induced by repetitive injuries occurring in the brain are more common, especially amongst athletes. rmTBI can also have a detrimental effect on the retina and the pathophysiology of these injuries are likely to differ from the severe TBI (sTBI) retinal injury.

Here we showed how rmTBI and sTBI can dissimilarly affect the retina. Our results indicate an increase in the number of activated microglial cells and Caspase3-positive cells in the retina in both traumatic models, suggesting a rise in the level of inflammation and cell death after TBI. The pattern of microglial activation appears evenly distributed and widespread but differs amongst the various retinal layers. sTBI induced microgial activation in both the superficial and deep retinal layers. In contrast to sTBI, no significant change occurred following the repetitive mild injury in the superficial layer, only the deep layer (spanning from the inner nuclear layer to the outer plexiform layer) shows microglial activation. This difference suggests that alternate response mechanisms play a role in the case of the different TBI incidents. The Caspase3 activation pattern showed a uniform increase in both the superficial and deep layers of the retina. This suggests a different action in the course of the disease in sTBI and rmTBI models and points to the need for new diagnostic procedures. Our present results suggest that the retina might serve as such a model of head injuries since the retinal tissue reacts to both forms of TBI and is the most accessible part of the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CLIP-Seq Analysis Enables the Design of Ribosomal RNA Bait Oligonucleotides That Protect Against C9orf72 ALS/FTD-Associated Poly-GR Pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia patients with a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 (C9-HRE) accumulate poly-GR and poly-PR aggregates. The pathogenicity of these arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (R-DPRs) is thought to be driven by their propensity to bind to low complexity domains of multivalent proteins. However, the ability of R-DPRs to bind native RNA and the significance of this interaction remains unclear. We used computational and experimental approaches to characterize the physicochemical properties of R-DPRs and their interaction with RNA. We find that poly-GR predominantly binds ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in cells and exhibits an interaction that is predicted to be energetically stronger than that for associated ribosomal proteins. Critically, modified rRNA "bait" oligonucleotides restore poly-GR-associated ribosomal deficits in cells and ameliorate poly-GR toxicity in patient neurons and Drosophila models. Our work strengthens the hypothesis that ribosomal function is impaired by R-DPRs, highlights a role for direct rRNA binding in mediating ribosomal disfunction, and presents a strategy for protecting against C9-HRE pathophysiological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A newly-recognized population of residual neural crest cells in the adult leptomeninges is re-activated for vascular repair</a></h4>

              
                The neural crest (NC) is a transient structure in vertebrate embryogenesis comprising highly migratory multipotent stem cells that give rise to a diverse array of cell types in organs throughout the body, including initiating neurovascular patterning. It is assumed that neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) disappear after development. Unexpectedly, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we discovered residual quiescent NCSCs in the adult mouse meninges which are activated by injury and contribute to the brains homeostatic response. RNA velocity, pathway, and transcription factor analyses in a murine stroke model (combined with in vivo imaging) show that these adult NCSCs migrate towards the perivascular spaces of the infarct and undergo a perivascular stromal cell transition that is regulated by Ptp1b, Ghr, and Stat3. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that these "vestigial" NCSCs are required for restoring vascular endothelial barrier function via {beta}-catenin and Stat3 signaling. These findings suggest that, in the adult, an unexpected reservoir of cells -- once pivotal to embryogenesis and vascular morphogenesis -- are re-invoked for neurovascular repair.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional control of visual neural circuit development by GS homeobox 1</a></h4>

              
                As essential components of gene expression networks, transcription factors regulate neural circuit assembly. GS homeobox 1 (gsx1) is expressed in the developing visual system; however, no studies have examined its role in visual system formation. In zebrafish, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons terminate in ten arborization fields (AFs) in the optic tectum (TeO) and pretectum (Pr). Pretectal AFs (AF1-AF9) mediate distinct and essential visual behaviors, yet we understand less about their development compared to AF10 in the TeO. Using gsx1 zebrafish mutants, immunohistochemistry, and transgenic lines, we observed that gsx1 is required for vesicular glutamate transporter, slc17a6b, expression in the Pr, but not overall neuron number. gsx1 mutants have normal eye morphology, yet exhibit impaired vision and a significantly reduced volume of RGC axons innervating the Pr and TeO, including loss of AF7. Consistent with this, prey capture is reduced in gsx1 mutants. Timed laser ablation of slc17a6b-positive neurons reveals that they aide directly in AF7 formation. This work is the first to implicate gsx1 in establishing cell identity and functional neural circuits in the visual system.

SUMMARY STATEMENTThis is the first study in any vertebrate model to establish a requirement for the homeobox transcription factor encoding gene, gsx1, in visual neural circuit formation and function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Sensory-Motor Theory of the Neocortex based on Active Predictive Coding</a></h4>

              
                We propose that the neocortex implements active predictive coding (APC), a form of predictive coding that incorporates hierarchical dynamics and actions. In this model, each neocortical area estimates both sensory states and actions, and the cortex as whole learns to predict the sensory consequences of actions at multiple hierarchical levels. "Higher" cortical areas maintain more abstract representations at larger spatiotemporal scales compared to "lower" areas. Feedback from higher areas modulate the dynamics of both state and action networks in lower areas. This allows the cortical network to model the complex dynamics and physics of the world in terms of simpler compositional elements (state transition functions). Simultaneously, current higher level goals invoke sequences of lower level sub-goals and actions, allowing the network to solve complex planning problems by composing simpler solutions. Planning ("system 2" thinking) in turns allows the network to learn, over time, perception-to-action mappings (policies; "system 1" thinking) at multiple abstraction levels. We provide examples from simulations illustrating how the same APC architecture can solve problems that, at first blush, seem very different from each other: (1) how do we recognize an object and its parts using eye movements? (2) why does perception seem stable despite eye movements? (3) how do we learn compositional representations, e.g., part-whole hierarchies, and nested reference frames for equivariant vision? (4) how do we model the "physics" of a complex environment by decomposing it into simpler components? (5) how do we plan actions in a complex domain to achieve a goal by composing sequences of sub-goals and simpler actions? and (6) how do we form episodic memories of sensory-motor experiences? We propose a mapping of the APC network to the laminar architecture of the cortex and suggest possible roles for cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic, cortico-hippocampal and cortico-subcortical pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expanded tRNA methyltransferase family member TRMT9B regulates synaptic growth and function</a></h4>

              
                Nervous system function relies on the formation and function of synaptic connections between neurons. Through a genetic screen in Drosophila for new conserved synaptic genes, we identified CG42261/Fid/ TRMT9B as a negative regulator of synaptogenesis. TRMT9B has been studied for its role as a tumor suppressor in multiple carcinomas and is one of two metazoan homologs of yeast tRNA methyltransferase 9 (Trm9), which methylates tRNA wobble uridines. Members of the expanded family of tRNA methyltransferases are increasingly being associated with neurological disorders and new biochemical functions. Interestingly, whereas Trm9 homolog ALKBH8/CG17807 is ubiquitously expressed, we find that TRMT9B is enriched in the nervous system, including at synapses. However, in the absence of animal models the role of TRMT9B in the nervous system has remained unknown. Here, we generated null alleles of TRMT9B and ALKBH8, and through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry find that ALKBH8 is responsible for canonical tRNA wobble uridine methylation under basal conditions. In the nervous system, we find that TRMT9B negatively regulates synaptogenesis through a methyltransferase-dependent mechanism in agreement with our modeling studies. Finally, we find that neurotransmitter release is impaired in TRMT9B mutants. Our findings reveal a role for TRMT9B in regulating synapse formation and function, and highlight the importance of the expanded family of tRNA methyltransferases in the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurological Disorder after Severe Pneumonia is Associated with Translocation of Bacteria from Lung to Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neurological disorders after severe acute pneumonia have been attacked much attention in recent years. However, the underline mechanisms remain not very clear. Here we show that these neurological syndromes after severe acute pneumonia are partly attributed to the translocation of bacteria from the lung to the brain during acute pneumonia. We detected an emerging and increased bacteria in the brain tissue of mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced experimental severe pneumonia. Interestingly, using 16S rDNA amplification sequencing, similarities were found between the brains flora species and those of the lungs, indicating the bacteria in the brain may come from the lung. We also observed the impairment of the lung-blood barrier and brain-blood barrier, simultaneously, allowing lung bacteria invade the brain during pneumonia. An elevated microglia and astrocytes activation markers signature though bacterial infection-related pathways are observed by single-cell RNA sequencing, indicating a bacteria-induced disruption of brain homeostasis. Rapamycin delivered by platelet-derived extracellular vesicles provides an effective strategy to rescue the brain microenvironment and neurological disorders. Collectively, we identify lung bacteria that play a role in altering brain homeostasis, which provides new insight into the mechanism of neurological syndromes after severe pneumonia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simple Models For Neuroscience Research Discoveries: How Often Are These Models Used In Africa</a></h4>

              
                Simple animal model systems such as Drosophila, Zebrafish, and C. Elegans have enabled numerous breakthroughs in understanding human health and disease. Their conserved biological processes, ever-expanding established procedures for handling, and amenability for molecular and genetic manipulation, in addition to the minimal ethical concerns, have made these models preferred choices in several life science disciplines globally. Owing to their cheap maintenance cost, adopting these model systems will help bridge the research gap between Africa and the Global North and contribute to advancing scientific knowledge in African universities through practical sessions. However, the extent to which these models are used across Africa is unknown. Here, we analysed the use of Drosophila, Zebrafish, and C. elegans model systems in scientific publications from African laboratories from the year 2000 to 2021. Of 1851 PubMed-indexed publications in which at least one simple animal model was mentioned, 168 used at least one of these models for the actual investigation. With an average of 21 articles per country, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia contributed 75% of these studies. The remaining 25% were contributed by seven other countries at 2-7 articles per country. From here, we extracted and analysed information on funding and international collaboration. This revealed that 24.4 % of the studies were exclusively funded locally, 28.57 % exclusively funded internationally, 15.5% received both local and international funding, and the rest (31.5%) were unfunded, revealing that there is satisfactory access to funds for simple animal model studies, especially from external funders. By analysing the pattern of collaborations, we show that most of these studies had international collaborations, while very few collaborated within Africa. Our work provides data on the current state of research using simple model systems in African laboratories and argues that incorporating these models will advance biomedical science research in Africa.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A stochastic world model on gravity for stability inference</a></h4>

              
                The fact that objects without proper support will fall to the ground is not only a natural phenomenon, but also common sense in humans minds. Previous studies have found that humans develop a world model on gravity in the mind to infer the stability of objects. However, its characteristics are less clear, especially how it benefits our rapid response with satisfactory accuracy. Here we measure participants sensitivity to the direction of gravity in a stability inference task by directly manipulating gravitys direction in a game engine. We find that the world model is not a faithful copy of Newtonian Laws on gravity, but encodes gravitys direction as a Gaussian distribution with the vertical direction as the maximum likelihood of gravitys direction. The stochastic nature of the world model fits nicely with participants subjective assessment on the stability of stacks and explains the illusion that taller objects are considered more prone to collapse. Further, a computational model with reinforcement learning reveals that the stochastic nature originated from agents interaction with the real world, and simulations from the game engine illustrate its ecological advantage of balancing accuracy and speed for efficient stability inference. In sum, our stochastic world model on gravity provides an example of the predictive nature of neural networks implemented with a priori knowledge about the physical world, which may shed light on developing AI with human-like intelligence that can flexibly operate in open-ended environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral pallidal GABAergic neuron calcium activity encodes cue-driven reward-seeking and persists in the absence of reward delivery</a></h4>

              
                Reward-seeking behavior is often initiated by environmental cues that signal reward availability. This is a necessary behavioral response; however, cue reactivity and reward-seeking behavior can become maladaptive. To better understand how cue elicited reward-seeking becomes maladaptive, it is important to understand the neural circuits involved in assigning appetitive value to rewarding cues and actions. Ventral pallidum (VP) neurons are known to contribute to cue elicited reward-seeking behavior and have heterogeneous responses in a discriminative stimulus (DS) task. The VP neuronal subtypes and output pathways that encode distinct aspects of the DS task remain unknown. Here, we used an intersectional viral approach with fiber photometry to record bulk calcium activity in VP GABAergic (VP GABA) neurons in male and female rats as they learned and performed the DS task. We found that VP GABA neurons are excited by reward-predictive cues but not neutral cues, and that this response develops over time. We also found that this cue-evoked response predicts reward-seeking behavior. Additionally, we found increased VP GABA calcium activity at the time of expected reward delivery, which occurred even on trials when reward was omitted. Together, these findings suggest that VP GABA neurons encode reward expectation and calcium activity in these neurons is predictive of the vigor of cue-elicited reward-seeking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A thalamo-parietal cortex circuit is critical for place-action coordination</a></h4>

              
                The anterior and lateral thalamus (ALT) contains head direction cells that signal the directional orientation of an animal within an environment. ALT has direct and indirect connections with the parietal cortex (PC), an area hypothesized to play a role in coordinating viewer-dependent and viewer-independent spatial reference frames. This coordination between reference frames would allow an individual to translate movements toward a desired location from memory. Thus ALT-PC functional connectivity would be critical for moving toward remembered locations. This hypothesis was tested with a place-action task that requires associating an appropriate action (left or right turn) with a spatial location. There are four arms, each offset by 90 degrees, positioned around a central starting point. A trial begins in the central starting point. After exiting a pseudorandomly selected arm, the rat had to displace the correct object covering one of two (left versus right) feeding stations to receive a reward. For a pair of arms facing opposite directions, the reward was located on the left, and for the other pair, the reward was located on the right. Thus, each reward location had a different combination of allocentric location and egocentric action. Removal of an object was scored as correct or incorrect. Trials in which the rat did not displace any objects were scored as  no response trials. After an object was removed, the rat returned to the center starting position and the maze was reset for the next trial. To investigate the role of the ALT-PC network, muscimol inactivation infusions targeted bilateral PC, bilateral ALT, or the ALT-PC network. Muscimol sessions were counterbalanced and compared to saline sessions within the same animal. All inactivations resulted in decreased accuracy. Only bilateral PC inactivations resulted in increased no response trials, increased errors, and longer latency responses on the remaining trials. Thus, the ALT-PC network is critical for linking an action with a spatial location for successful navigation.

	<p>Background: Some authors have hypothesized that cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy (DC) could positively influence functional recovery through several mechanisms. However, only a few studies with small sample sizes have investigated the effects of cranioplasty on functional recovery. Our study aims at evaluating the role of post-DC cranioplasty in influencing the functional recovery in a large cohort of patients with different etiologies of acquired brain injury (ABI). Methods: This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 253 patients with ABI, consisting of 108 adults who underwent post-DC cranioplasty and 145 adults who did not. All the subjects underwent a 6-month individual rehabilitation program. Demographic data, etiology, classification and anatomical site of brain injury, neurological and functional assessment at baseline and on discharge, and number of deaths during hospitalization were recorded. Results: In our cohort, 145 patients (57.3%) and 108 patients (42.7%) had, respectively, a hemorrhagic stroke (HS) and a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Only in the patients with TBI cranioplasty emerged as an independent predictor of better functional outcome in terms of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) total score at discharge (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.217, p = 0.001) and of the FIM variation during rehabilitation (&amp;amp;Delta;FIM) (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.315, p = 0.001). Conversely, in the case of HS, no associations were found between post-DC cranioplasty and functional recovery. Conclusions: Post-DC cranioplasty was associated with better functional recovery six months after TBI but not in the patients with HS. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HS are different from those of TBI and possibly play a role in the different outcomes between the two groups, further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed differences.</p>

	<p>Background: The society is aging in China, and the cognitive level of elderly post-stroke patients gradually declines. Face-to-face cognitive functional training is no longer sufficient. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a promising rehabilitation training device. In this study, we developed an IVR-based puzzle game to explore its effectiveness, feasibility, and safety in elderly stroke patients with cognitive dysfunction. Methods: A total of 30 patients with mild post-stroke cognitive impairment after stroke were randomly assigned to a control or IVR group. Patients in both groups received routine rehabilitation therapy. Patients in the control group received traditional cognitive training, and those in the IVR group received IVR-based puzzle game therapy. Before and after treatment, Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), trail-making test-A (TMT-A), digit symbol substitution test (DSST), digital span test (DST), verbal fluency test (VFT), and modified Barthel index (MBI) were evaluated in both groups. In addition, the IVR group was administered a self-report questionnaire to obtain feedback on user experience. Results: There was no significant difference in the baseline data between the two groups. After six weeks of treatment, the cognitive assessment scores were improved in both groups. Moreover, the IVR group showed more improvements than the control group in the DSST (Z = 2.203, p = 0.028 &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.16); MOCA (T = 1.186, p = 0.246 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, d = 0.44), TMT-A (T = 1.791, p = 0.084 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, d = 0.65), MBI (T = 0.783, p = 0.44 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, d = 0.28), FDST (Z = 0.78, p = 0.435 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.02), BDST (Z = 0.347, p = 0.728 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.004), and VFT(Z = 1.087, p = 0.277 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.039) did not significantly improve. The significant difference in DSST represents an improvement in executive function and visual&amp;amp;ndash;spatial cognitive characteristics. The other assessment scores did not show such features. Therefore, we did not observe significant differences through this measure. According to the results of the self-report questionnaire, most of the patients were satisfied with the equipment stability and training content. Several individuals reported mild adverse reactions. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that IVR-based puzzle games are a promising approach to improve post-stroke cognitive function, especially executive cognitive function, and visual&amp;amp;ndash;spatial attention in older adults.</p>

	<p>Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a subtype of motor speech disorder usually co-occurring with language impairment. A supramodal processing difficulty, involving executive functions (EFs), might contribute to the cognitive endophenotypes and behavioral manifestations. The present study aimed to profile the EFs in CAS, investigating the relationship between EFs, speech and language severity, and the connectivity of the frontal aslant tract (FAT), a white matter tract involved in both speech and EFs. A total of 30 preschool children with CAS underwent speech, language, and EF assessments and brain MRIs. Their FAT connectivity metrics were compared to those of 30 children without other neurodevelopmental disorders (NoNDs), who also underwent brain MRIs. Alterations in some basic EF components were found. Inhibition and working memory correlated with speech and language severity. Compared to NoND children, a weak, significant reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left presupplementary motor area (preSMA) FAT component was found. Only speech severity correlated and predicted FA values along with the FAT in both of its components, and visual-spatial working memory moderated the relationship between speech severity and FA in the left SMA. Our study supports the conceptualization of a composite and complex picture of CAS, not limited to the speech core deficit, but also involving high-order cognitive skills.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fine-grained, nonlinear registration of live cell movies reveals spatiotemporal organization of diffuse molecular processes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xuexia Jiang, Tadamoto Isogai, Joseph Chi, Gaudenz Danuser</p>

We present an application of nonlinear image registration to align in microscopy time lapse sequences for every frame the cell outline and interior with the outline and interior of the same cell in a reference frame. The registration relies on a subcellular fiducial marker, a cell motion mask, and a topological regularization that enforces diffeomorphism on the registration without significant loss of granularity. This allows spatiotemporal analysis of extremely noisy and diffuse molecular processes across the entire cell. We validate the registration method for different fiducial markers by measuring the intensity differences between predicted and original time lapse sequences of Actin cytoskeleton images and by uncovering zones of spatially organized GEF- and GTPase signaling dynamics visualized by FRET-based activity biosensors in MDA-MB-231 cells. We then demonstrate applications of the registration method in conjunction with stochastic time-series analysis. We describe distinct zones of locally coherent dynamics of the cytoplasmic protein Profilin in U2OS cells. Further analysis of the Profilin dynamics revealed strong relationships with Actin cytoskeleton reorganization during cell symmetry-breaking and polarization. This study thus provides a framework for extracting information to explore functional interactions between cell morphodynamics, protein distributions, and signaling in cells undergoing continuous shape changes. Matlab code implementing the proposed registration method is available at https://github.com/DanuserLab/Mask-Regularized-Diffeomorphic-Cell-Registration.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) is a critical structure that mediates sustained vigilant responses to contextual, diffuse, and unpredictable threats. Dysfunction of the BST could lead to excessive anxiety and hypervigilance, which are often observed in posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders. Vigilance of potential future threats from the external environment is a basic brain function and probably requires rapid and/or short neural circuits, which enable both quick detection of the potential threats and fast adaptive responses. However, the BST in literature does not appear to receive spatial information directly from earlier visual or spatial processing structures. In this study, a novel subdivision of the BST is uncovered in monkey, rat, and mouse brains based on the human equivalent and is found in mouse to receive direct inputs from the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and pretectal nucleus as well as from the spatial processing structures such as subiculum, presubiculum, and medial entorhinal cortex. This new subdivision, termed spindle-shaped small cell subdivision (BSTsc), is located between the known BST and the anterior thalamus. In addition to the unique afferent connections and cell morphology, the BSTsc also displays unique molecular signature (e.g., positive for excitatory markers ) compared with other BST subdivisions, which are mostly composed of inhibitory GABAergic neurons. The BSTsc appears to have largely overlapping efferent projections with other BST subdivisions such as the projections to the amygdala, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, septum, and brainstem. Together, the present study suggests that the BSTsc is poised to serve as a shortcut bridge directly linking spatial information from the environment to vigilant adaptive internal responses.</p>

     alt="Circadian rhythmicity of amyloid-beta-related molecules is disrupted in the choroid plexus of a female Alzheimer's disease mouse model"/>
<p>Alzheimer's phenotype, sex and age affect the expression of Amyloid-β scavengers. Amyloid-β scavengers such as angiotensin-converting enzymes show circadian rhythmicity in the choroid plexus of female 6-month-old mice. This rhythmicity is impaired in Alzheimer's disease animal models or in choroid plexus epithelial cells treated with Amyloid-β. Amyloid-β uptake by the choroid plexus epithelial cells displays circadian rhythmicity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The choroid plexus (CP) is part of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) and was recently described as an important component of the circadian clock system. It is the principal source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and responsible for the synthesis and secretion of various neuroprotective peptides including those involved in amyloid-β (Aβ) transport/degradation, contributing to Aβ homeostasis. Inadequate Aβ metabolic clearance and transport across the BCSFB have been associated with circadian dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. To investigate whether AD pathology influences Aβ scavengers circadian expression, we collected CP at different time points from an AD mouse model (APP/PS1) (female and male animals, aged 6- and 12-months-old) and analyzed their mRNA expression by Real-time RT-PCR. Only angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace) expression in 6-month-old female wild-type mice and transthyretin (Ttr) expression in 12-month-old female wild-type mice presented significant rhythmicity. The circadian rhythmicity of Ace and Ttr, prompt us to analyze the involvement of circadian rhythm in Aβ uptake. A human CP papilloma (HIBCPP) cell line was incubated with Aβ-488 and uptake was evaluated at different time points using flow cytometry. Aβ uptake displayed circadian rhythmicity. Our results suggest that AD might affect Aβ scavengers rhythmicity and that Aβ clearance is a rhythmic process possibly regulated by the rhythmic expression of Aβ scavengers.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Complex pattern of facial remapping in somatosensory cortex following congenital but not acquired hand loss</a></h4>

              
                Cortical remapping after hand loss in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is thought to be predominantly dictated by cortical proximity, with adjacent body parts remapping into the deprived area. Traditionally, this remapping has been characterised by changes in the lip representation, which is assumed to be the immediate neighbour of the hand based on electrophysiological research in non-human primates. However, the orientation of facial somatotopy in humans is debated, with contrasting work reporting both an inverted and upright topography. We aimed to fill this gap in the S1 homunculus by investigating the topographic organisation of the face. Using both univariate and multivariate approaches we examined the extent of face-to-hand remapping in individuals with a congenital and acquired missing hand (hereafter one-handers and amputees, respectively), relative to two-handed controls. Participants were asked to move different facial parts (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) during fMRI scanning. We first confirmed an upright face organisation in all three groups, with the upper-face and not the lips bordering the hand area. We further found little evidence for remapping of both forehead and lips in amputees, with no significant relationship to the chronicity of their PLP. In contrast, we found converging evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in congenital one-handers across multiple facial parts, where relative to controls, the location of the cortical neighbour - the forehead - is shown to shift away from the deprived hand area, which is subsequently more activated by the lips and the tongue. Together, our findings demonstrate that the face representation in humans is highly plastic, but that this plasticity is restricted by the developmental stage of input deprivation, rather than cortical proximity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LabNet hardware control software for the Raspberry Pi</a></h4>

              
                Single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi make it easy to control hardware setups for laboratory experiments. GPIOs and expansion boards (HATs) give access to a whole range of sensor and control hardware. However, controlling such hardware can be challenging, when many experimental setups run in parallel and the time component is critical. LabNet is a C++ optimized control layer software to give access to the Raspberry Pi connected hardware over a simple network protocol. LabNet was developed to be suitable for time-critical operations, and to be simple to expand. It leverages the actor model to simplify multithreading programming and to increase modularity. The message protocol is implemented in Protobuf and offers performance, small message size, and supports a large number of programming languages on the client side. It shows good performance compared to locally executed tools like Bpod, pyControl, or Autopilot and reaches sub-millisecond range in network communication latencies. LabNet can monitor and react simultaneously to up to 14 pairs of digital inputs, without increasing latencies. LabNet itself does not provide support for the design of experimental tasks. This is left to the client. LabNet can be used for general automation in experimental laboratories with its control PC located at some distance. LabNet is open source and under continuing development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heterogeneous levels of delta-like 4 within a multinucleated niche cell maintains muscle stem cell diversity</a></h4>

              
                The quiescent muscle stem cell (QSC) pool is heterogeneous and generally characterized by the presence and levels of intrinsic myogenic transcription factors. Whether extrinsic factors maintain the diversity of states across the QSC pool remains unknown. The muscle fiber is a multinucleated syncytium that serves as a niche to QSCs, raising the possibility that the muscle fiber regulates the diversity of states across the QSC pool. Here, we show that the muscle fiber maintains a continuum of quiescent states, through a gradient of Notch ligand, Dll4, produced by the fiber and captured by QSCs. The abundance of Dll4 captured by the QSC correlates with the protein levels of the stem cell (SC) identity marker, Pax7. Niche-specific loss of Dll4 decreases QSC diversity and shifts the continuum to cell states that are biased toward more proliferative and committed fates. We reveal that fiber-derived Mindbomb1 (Mib1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase activates Dll4 and controls the heterogeneous levels of Dll4. In response to injury, with a Dll4-replenished niche, the normal continuum and diversity of the SC pool is restored, demonstrating bidirectionality within the SC continuum. Our data show that a post-translational mechanism controls heterogeneity of Notch ligands in a multinucleated niche cell to maintain a continuum of metastable states within the SC pool during tissue homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coordinated cadherin functions sculpt respiratory motor circuit connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Breathing, and the motor circuits that control it, are essential for life. At the core of respiratory circuits are Dbx1-derived interneurons, which generate the rhythm and pattern of breathing, and phrenic motor neurons (MNs), which provide the final motor output that drives diaphragm muscle contractions during inspiration. Despite their critical function, the principles that dictate how respiratory circuits assemble are unknown. Here we show that coordinated activity of a type I cadherin (N-cadherin) and type II cadherins (Cadherin-6, -9, and -10) is required in both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons to generate robust respiratory motor output. Both MN- and Dbx1-specific cadherin inactivation in mice during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a striking reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. This combinatorial cadherin code is required to establish phrenic MN cell body and dendritic topography; surprisingly, however, cell body position appears to be dispensable for the targeting of phrenic MNs by descending respiratory inputs. Our findings demonstrate that type I and type II cadherins function cooperatively throughout the respiratory circuit to generate a robust breathing output and reveal novel strategies that drive the assembly of motor circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The ‘ForensOMICS’ approach for postmortem interval estimation from human bone by integrating metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics</a></h4>

              
                The combined use of multiple omics allows to study complex interrelated biological processes in their entirety. We applied a combination of metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics to human bones to investigate their combined potential to estimate time elapsed since death (i.e., the postmortem interval [PMI]). This ‘ForensOMICS’ approach has the potential to improve accuracy and precision of PMI estimation of skeletonized human remains, thereby helping forensic investigators to establish the timeline of events surrounding death. Anterior midshaft tibial bone was collected from four female body donors before their placement at the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility owned by the Forensic Anthropological Center at Texas State (FACTS). Bone samples were again collected at selected PMIs (219-790-834-872days). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to obtain untargeted metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic profiles from the pre- and post-placement bone samples. The three omics blocks were investigated independently by univariate and multivariate analyses, followed by Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent variable approaches for Omics studies (DIABLO), to identify the reduced number of markers describing postmortem changes and discriminating the individuals based on their PMI. The resulting model showed that pre-placement metabolome, lipidome and proteome profiles were clearly distinguishable from post-placement ones. Metabolites in the pre-placement samples suggested an extinction of the energetic metabolism and a switch towards another source of fuelling (e.g., structural proteins). We were able to identify certain biomolecules with an excellent potential for PMI estimation, predominantly the biomolecules from the metabolomics block. Our findings suggest that, by targeting a combination of compounds with different postmortem stability, in the future we could be able to estimate both short PMIs, by using metabolites and lipids, and longer PMIs, by using proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Calcium dependence of both lobes of calmodulin is involved in binding to a cytoplasmic domain of SK channels</a></h4>

              
                KCa2.1–3 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup>-channels (SK) require calmodulin to gate in response to cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. A model for SK gating proposes that the N-terminal domain (N-lobe) of calmodulin is required for activation, but an immobile C-terminal domain (C-lobe) has constitutive, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding. Although structures support a domain-driven hypothesis of SK gate activation by calmodulin, only a partial understanding is possible without measuring both channel activity and protein binding. We measured SK2 (KCa2.2) activity using inside-out patch recordings. Currents from calmodulin-disrupted SK2 channels can be restored with exogenously applied calmodulin. We find that SK2 activity only approaches full activation with full-length calmodulin with both an N- and a C-lobe. We measured calmodulin binding to a C-terminal SK peptide (SKp) using both composition-gradient multi-angle light-scattering and tryptophan emission spectra. Isolated lobes bind to SKp with high affinity, but isolated lobes do not rescue SK2 activity. Consistent with earlier models, N-lobe binding to SKp is stronger in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and C-lobe-binding affinity is strong independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, a native tryptophan in SKp is sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to both the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin at Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations that activate SK2, demonstrating that the C-lobe interaction with SKp changes with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our peptide-binding data and electrophysiology show that SK gating models need deeper scrutiny. We suggest that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent associations of both lobes of calmodulin to SKp are crucial events during gating. Additional investigations are necessary to complete a mechanistic gating model consistent with binding, physiology, and structure.

Much of our understanding of its neural basis comes from seminal work showing that lesions to the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) increase stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), a latent variable that expresses the speed of inhibitory control. However, recent work has identified substantial limitations of the SSRT method. Notably, SSRT is confounded by trigger failures: stop-signal trials in which inhibitory control was never initiated. Such trials inflate SSRT, but are typically indicative of attentional, rather than inhibitory deficits. Here, we used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to identify stop-signal trigger failures in human rIFG lesion patients, non-rIFG lesion patients, and healthy comparisons. Furthermore, we measured scalp-EEG to detect β-bursts, a neurophysiological index of inhibitory control. rIFG lesion patients showed a more than fivefold increase in trigger failure trials and did not exhibit the typical increase of stop-related frontal β-bursts. However, on trials in which such β-bursts did occur, rIFG patients showed the typical subsequent upregulation of β over sensorimotor areas, indicating that their ability to implement inhibitory control, once triggered, remains intact. These findings suggest that the role of rIFG in inhibitory control has to be fundamentally reinterpreted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intracranial recordings reveal three distinct neural response patterns in the language network</a></h4>

              
                A left-lateralized network of frontal and temporal brain regions is specialized for language processing--spoken, written, or signed. Different regions of this  language network have all been shown to be sensitive to various forms of linguistic information, from combinatorial sentence structure to word meanings, to sub-lexical regularities. However, whether neural computations are the same across and within these different brain regions remains debated. Here, we examine responses during language processing recorded intracranially in patients with intractable epilepsy. Across two datasets (Dataset 1: n=6 participants, m=177 language-responsive electrodes; Dataset 2: n=16 participants, m=362 language-responsive electrodes), we clustered language-responsive electrodes and found three distinct response profiles, with differences in response magnitude between linguistic conditions (e.g., sentences vs. lists of words), different temporal dynamics over the course of the stimulus, and different degrees of stimulus locking. We argue that these profiles correspond to different temporal receptive windows that vary in size between sub-lexical units and multi-word sequences. These results demonstrate the functional heterogeneity of neural responses in the language network and highlight the diversity of neural computations that may be needed in order to extract meaning from linguistic input. Importantly, electrodes that exhibit these distinct profiles do not cluster spatially and are instead interleaved across frontal and temporal language areas, which likely made It difficult to uncover functional differences in past fMRI studies. This mosaic of neural responses across the language network suggests that all language regions have direct access to distinct response types--a property that may be crucial for the efficiency and robustness of language processing mechanisms.

                Epileptic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are strongly influenced by sleep and circadian rhythms. However, human data on the effect of sleep on neuronal behavior during interictal activity have been lacking. We analyzed EEG data from epileptic patients implanted with macro and micro electrodes targeting mesial temporal structures. Sleep staging was performed on concomitantly recorded polysomnography and video-EEG. Automated IED detection identified thousands of IEDs per patient. Both the rate and amplitude of IEDs were increased with deeper stages of NREM sleep. Single unit activity (SUA) and multi-unit activity (MUA) increased their firing during the IED spike, and strongly decreased during the subsequent slow wave. These time-locked firing rate modulations were shown to increase during deeper stages of NREM sleep. Finally, during resting behaviour, neuronal firing rate, bursting rate and firing regularity were all shown to progressively decrease with deeper stages of NREM sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">dcSBM: A federated constrained source-based morphometry approach for multivariate brain structure mapping</a></h4>

              
                The examination of multivariate brain morphometry patterns has gained attention in recent years, especially for their powerful exploratory capabilities in the study of differences between patients and controls. Among many existing methods and tools for analysis of brain anatomy based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data, data-driven source based morphometry (SBM) focuses on the exploratory detection of such patterns. Constrained source-based morphometry (constrained SBM) is a widely used semi-blind extension of SBM that enables extracting maximally independent reference-alike sources using the constrained independent component analysis (ICA) approach. In order to operate, constrained SBM needs the data to be locally accessible. However, there exist many reasons (e.g., the concerns of revealing identifiable rare disease information, or violating strict IRB policies) that may preclude access to data from different sites. In this scenario, constrained SBM fails to leverage the benefits of decentralized data. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel approach: decentralized constrained source-based morphometry (dcSBM). In dcSBM, the original data never leaves the local site. Each site operates constrained ICA on their private local data while using a common distributed computation platform. Then, an aggregator/master node aggregates the results estimated from each local site and applies statistical analysis to find out the significant sources. In our approach, we first use UK Biobank sMRI data to investigate the reliability of our dcSBM algorithm. Finally, we utilize two additional multi-site patient datasets to validate our model by comparing the resulting group difference estimates from both centralized and decentralized constrained SBM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral posterolateral and ventral posteromedial thalamus neurons have distinct synaptic and cellular physiology</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory information is propagated from the periphery to the cerebral cortex by two parallel pathways through the ventral posterolateral (VPL) and ventral posteromedial (VPM) thalamus. VPL and VPM neurons receive somatosensory signals from the body and head, respectively. VPL and VPM neurons also receive cell-type-specific GABAergic input from the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (nRT). Although VPL and VPM neurons have distinct connectivity and physiological roles, differences in the functional properties of VPL and VPM neurons remain unclear as they are often studied as one ventrobasal (VB) thalamus neuron population. Here, we directly compared synaptic and intrinsic properties of VPL and VPM neurons in C57Bl/6J mice of both sexes aged P25-P32. Recordings of spontaneous synaptic transmission suggested that VPL neurons receive excitatory synaptic input with higher frequency and strength than VPM neurons, while VPL neurons exhibited weaker inhibitory synapse strength than VPM neurons. Furthermore, VPL neurons showed enhanced depolarization-induced spike firing and greater spike frequency adaptation than VPM neurons. VPL and VPM neurons fired similar numbers of spikes during hyperpolarization rebound bursts, but VPM neurons exhibited shorter burst latency compared to VPL neurons, which correlated with increased sag potential during hyperpolarization. This work indicates that VPL and VPM thalamocortical neurons are functionally distinct populations. The observed functional differences could have important implications for their specific physiological and pathophysiological roles within the somatosensory thalamocortical network.

                Highly specialized microtubules in neurons are crucial to the health and disease of the nervous system, and their properties are strictly regulated by different post-translational modifications, including alpha-Tubulin acetylation. An imbalance in the levels of acetylated alpha-Tubulin has been reported in experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD) whereas pharmacological or genetic modulation that leads to increased acetylated alpha-Tubulin successfully rescues axonal transport defects and inhibits alpha-Synuclein aggregation. However, the role of acetylation of alpha-Tubulin in the human nervous system is largely unknown as most studies are based on in vitro evidence. To capture the complexity of the pathological processes in vivo, we analysed post-mortem human brain of PD patients and control subjects. In the brain of PD patients at Braak stage 6, we found a redistribution of acetylated alpha-Tubulin, which accumulates in the neuronal cell bodies in subcortical structures but not in the cerebral cortex, and decreases in the axonal compartment, both in the central and peripheral nervous system. High-resolution and 3D reconstruction analysis linked acetylated alpha-Tubulin redistribution to alpha-Synuclein oligomerization, leading us to propose a model for Lewy body (LB) morphogenesis. Finally, for the first time in post-mortem human brain, we observed threadlike structures, resembling tunnelling nanotubes that contain alpha-Synuclein oligomers and are associated with acetylated alpha-Tubulin enriched neurons. In conclusion, we disclose a novel aspect of LB morphogenesis, indicating the role of acetylated alpha-Tubulin in PD, that may provide clues to design novel therapeutic interventions.

                Adolescent cocaine exposure (ACE) induce anxiety and higher sensitivity to drug addiction in adulthood. Here, we show that the claustrum is crucial for control of these two distinct psychiatric disorders in ACE mice. In the process of anxiety test, the CaMKII-positive neurons in median portion of claustrum (MClaustrum) were obviously triggered, and chemogenetic suppressing these neurons efficiently reduced ACE-induced anxiety in adulthood. While, the CaMKII-positive neurons in anterior portion of claustrum (AClaustrum) were obviously activated in response to cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), and chemogenetic suppressing these neurons efficiently blocked cocaine CPP in ACE mice during adulthood. Our findings dissociating specific sub-portions of claustrum for drug-related anxiety and susceptibility of addiction, extending our understanding to diverse functions of claustrum subregions.

                The process of brain folding is thought to play an important role in the development and organisation of the cerebrum and the cerebellum. The study of cerebellar folding is challenging due to the small size and abundance of its folia. In consequence, little is known about its anatomical diversity and evolution. We constituted an open collection of histological data from 56 mammalian species and manually segmented the cerebrum and the cerebellum. We developed methods to measure the geometry of cerebellar folia and to estimate the thickness of the molecular layer. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to study the diversity and evolution of cerebellar folding and its relationship with the anatomy of the cerebrum. Our results show that the evolution of cerebellar and cerebral anatomy follows a stabilising selection process. Ancestral estimations indicate that size and folding of the cerebrum and cerebellum increase and decrease concertedly through evolution. Our analyses confirm the strong correlation between cerebral and cerebellar volumes across species, and show that large cerebella are disproportionately more folded than smaller ones. Compared with the extreme variations in cerebellar surface area, folial wavelength and molecular layer thickness varied only slightly, showing a much smaller increase in the larger cerebella. These findings provide new insight into the diversity and evolution of cerebellar folding and its potential influence on brain organisation across species.

                Dorsal pulvinar has been implicated in visuospatial attentional and perceptual confidence processing. Perturbations of the dorsal pulvinar also induce an overt spatial saccade bias during free choices. But it remains unclear whether the dorsal pulvinar inactivation during an oculomotor target selection based on a perceptual decision will lead to perceptual impairment or a more general orienting deficit. To address this question, we reversibly inactivated unilateral dorsal pulvinar by injecting GABA-A agonist THIP while two macaque monkeys performed a color discrimination saccade response task with varying perceptual difficulty. We used Signal Detection Theory to dissociate perceptual discrimination (dprime) and spatial selection bias (response criterion) effects. We expected a decrease in dprime if dorsal pulvinar affects perceptual discrimination and a shift in response criterion if dorsal pulvinar is mainly involved in spatial orienting. After inactivation, we observed response criterion shifts away from contralesional stimuli, especially when two competing peripheral stimuli in opposite hemifields were present, for both difficulty levels. The saccade latency for the contralesional selection increased under all conditions. Notably, the dprime and overall accuracy remained largely unaffected. Our results underline the critical contribution of the dorsal pulvinar to spatial orienting while being less important for perceptual discrimination.

                Previous research has shown practice within an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment improves real-world (RW) performance. Increased user motivation is one possible advantage of practicing in VR. One recent study showed that an enriched gaming environment led to higher levels of engagement, resulting in a direct learning benefit. The purpose of this study was to compare the intrinsic motivation, engagement, and transfer of learning differences between VR practice and RW practice of the same motor skill. Participants (n = 61) were randomly assigned to a RW practice group (n = 30) or a VR practice group (n = 31) in which they performed a golf putting task. Analyses showed VR practice led to a significantly greater increase in average IMI score than RW practice. Analyses for performance showed there was a significant (p < .001) improvement in accuracy (i.e., radial error) from pre to posttest, but the two groups did not differ from one another. Overall, these results partially support our hypotheses and suggest that VR practice led to a greater increase in motivation compared to RW practice. Additionally, these results suggest that VR practice was similarly effective at improving accuracy compared to RW practice. Future research directions are discussed.

                The preBotzinger Complex (preBotC), a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus (7n) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBotC neurons, we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetised and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBotC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity. We show that modulation of subgroups of preBotC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviours. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviours have been associated with the development and progression of diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metastatic infiltration of nervous tissue and periosteal nerve sprouting in multiple myeloma induced bone pain</a></h4>

              
                Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplasia of B plasma cells that often induces bone pain. However, the mechanisms underlying myeloma-induced bone pain (MIBP) are mostly unknown. Using a syngeneic MM mouse model, we show that periosteal nerve sprouting of calcitonin-gene related protein (CGRP+) and growth associated protein 43 (GAP43+) fibres occurs concurrent to the onset of nociception and its blockade provides transient pain relief. MM patient samples also showed increased periosteal innervation. Mechanistically, we investigated MM induced gene expression changes in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) innervating the MM-bearing bone and found alterations in pathways associated with cell cycle, immune response and neuronal signalling. The MM transcriptional signature was consistent with metastatic MM infiltration to the DRG, a never-before described feature of the disease that we further demonstrated histologically. In the DRG, MM cells caused loss of vascularization and neuronal injury, which may contribute to late-stage MIBP. Interestingly, the transcriptional signature of a MM patient was consistent with MM cell infiltration to the DRG. Overall, our results suggest that MM induces a plethora of peripheral nervous system alterations that may contribute to the failure of current analgesics and suggest neuroprotective drugs as appropriate strategies to treat early onset MIBP.

Significance statementMultiple myeloma induces periosteal nerve sprouting and metastasizes to the dorsal root ganglia, damaging blood vessels and causing transcriptional alterations that may mediate myeloma-induced bone pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social context modulates multibrain broadband dynamics and functional brain-to-brain coupling in the group of mice</a></h4>

              
                Although mice are social animals, studies that explore the simultaneously recorded neural activities of multiple mice, especially in a social setting, are still lacking. In this study, we simultaneously recorded local field potential (LFP) signals in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) from up to four mice. The brain activities of the mice were measured in two contradicting conditions - freely interacting in a group or being individually separated. We found that social context and the locomotive states predominately modulate the entire LFP structure. Power spectral density (PSD) estimate and spectrogram of LFP signals showed a broadband modulation; lower frequency bands--delta (<4Hz), theta (4-7Hz), and alpha (8-12Hz) power were highly correlated to each other and anti-correlated with gamma and high gamma (>30Hz) power. We calculated the high-to-low-power ratio (HLR) and found that HLR was higher when the mice were in a group than were separated. The HLR was also higher when they were active--whether or not they were moving. The mice in the group showed higher HLR in any locomotive states. We then analyzed whether social context can be divided into sub-contexts. Notably, the aggregation of animals, called huddling, decreased social context-induced increase in HLR. Multibrain analyses of HLR indicated that the mice in the group displayed high cross-correlation to each other, indicating interbrain synchrony. Then we examined whether there is any directional relationship between HLR from pairs of mice. A majority of dyad selected within the group of mice showed unilateral precedence of HLR by Granger causality analysis, comprising a hierarchical social structure based on a directionality of influence. Overall, this study shows the importance of the social environment in brain dynamics and emphasizes the value of simultaneous multibrain recording for researching social behaviors and their neural correlates.

One-sentence summaryCoexistence modulates overall brain activities with unilateral causal relationship.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A change in behavioral state switches the pattern of motor output that underlies rhythmic head and orofacial movements</a></h4>

              
                The breathing rhythm serves as a reference that paces orofacial motor actions and orchestrates active sensing. Past work reports that pacing occurs solely at a fixed phase relative to sniffing. We reevaluated this constraint as a function of exploratory behavior. Allocentric and egocentric rotations of the head and the electromyogenic activity of the underlying motoneurons for head and orofacial movements were recorded in free-ranging rats as they searched for food. We found that a change in state from foraging to rearing is accompanied by a change in the phase of muscular activation relative to sniffing, so that pacing now occurs at one of two phases. Further, head-turning is biased such that an animal gathers a novel sample of its environment upon inhalation. In toto, the coordination of active sensing has a previously unrealized computational complexity that, in principle, can emerge from hindbrain circuits with fixed architecture and credible synaptic time-delays.

	<p>The process of categorizing sounds into distinct phonetic categories is known as categorical perception (CP). Response times (RTs) provide a measure of perceptual difficulty during labeling decisions (i.e., categorization). The RT is quasi-stochastic in nature due to individuality and variations in perceptual tasks. To identify the source of RT variation in CP, we have built models to decode the brain regions and frequency bands driving fast, medium and slow response decision speeds. In particular, we implemented a parameter optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; behavioral RTs from their neural EEG data. We adopted visual interpretation of model response using Guided-GradCAM to identify spatial-spectral correlates of RT. Our framework includes (but is not limited to): (i) a data augmentation technique designed to reduce noise and control the overall variance of EEG dataset; (ii) bandpower topomaps to learn the spatial-spectral representation using CNN; (iii) large-scale Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization to find best performing CNN model; (iv) ANOVA and posthoc analysis on Guided-GradCAM activation values to measure the effect of neural regions and frequency bands on behavioral responses. Using this framework, we observe that &amp;amp;alpha;&amp;amp;minus;&amp;amp;beta; (10&amp;amp;ndash;20 Hz) activity over left frontal, right prefrontal/frontal, and right cerebellar regions are correlated with RT variation. Our results indicate that attention, template matching, temporal prediction of acoustics, motor control, and decision uncertainty are the most probable factors in RT variation.</p>

	<p>Subthreshold neural oscillations have been observed in several brain regions and can influence the timing of neural spikes. However, the spatial extent and function of these spontaneous oscillations remain unclear. To study the mechanisms underlying these oscillations, we use optogenetic stimulation to generate oscillating waves in the longitudinal hippocampal slice expressing optopatch proteins. We found that optogenetic stimulation can generate two types of neural activity: suprathreshold neural spikes and subthreshold oscillating waves. Both waves could propagate bidirectionally at similar speeds and go through a transection of the tissue. The propagating speed is independent of the oscillating frequency but increases with increasing amplitudes of the waves. The endogenous electric fields generated by oscillating waves are about 0.6 mV/mm along the dendrites and about 0.3 mV/mm along the cell layer. We also observed that these oscillating waves could interfere with each other. Optical stimulation applied simultaneously at each slice end generated a larger wave in the middle of the tissue (constructive interference) or destructive interference with laser signals in opposite phase. However, the suprathreshold neural spikes were annihilated when they collided. Finally, the waves were not affected by the NMDA blocker (APV) and still propagated in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) but at a significantly lower amplitude. The role of these subthreshold waves in neural function is unknown, but the results show that at low amplitude, the subthreshold propagating waves lack a refractory period allowing a novel analog form of preprocessing of neural activity by interference independent of synaptic transmission.</p>

	<p>Background: This study sought to determine whether (1) evidence is available of interactions between anodal tDCS and oscillated tDCS stimulation patterns to increase the power of endogenous brain oscillations and (2) the frequency matching the applied anodal otDCS&amp;amp;rsquo;s frequency and the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s dominant intrinsic frequency influence power shifting during stimulation pattern sessions by both anodal DCS and anodal oscillated DCS. Method: Rats received different anodal tDCS and otDCS stimulation patterns using 8.5 Hz and 13 Hz state-related dominant intrinsic frequencies of anodal otDCS. The rats were divided into groups with specific stimulation patterns: group A: tDCS&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS (8.5 Hz)&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS (13 Hz); group B: otDCS (8.5 Hz)&amp;amp;ndash;tDCS&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS (13 Hz); group C: otDCS (13 Hz)&amp;amp;ndash;tDCS&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS (8.5 Hz). Acute relative power changes (i.e., following 10 min stimulation sessions) in six frequency bands&amp;amp;mdash;delta (1.5&amp;amp;ndash;4 Hz), theta (4&amp;amp;ndash;7 Hz), alpha-1 (7&amp;amp;ndash;10 Hz), alpha-2 (10&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz), beta-1 (12&amp;amp;ndash;15 Hz) and beta-2 (15&amp;amp;ndash;20 Hz)&amp;amp;mdash;were compared using three factors and repeated ANOVA measurement. Results: For each stimulation, tDCS increased theta power band and, above bands alpha and beta, a drop in delta power was observed. Anodal otDCS had a mild increasing power effect in both matched intrinsic and delta bands. In group pattern stimulations, increased power of endogenous frequencies matched exogenous otDCS frequencies&amp;amp;mdash;8.5 Hz or 13 Hz&amp;amp;mdash;with more potent effects in upper bands. The power was markedly more potent with the otDCS&amp;amp;ndash;tDCS stimulation pattern than the tDCS&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS pattern. Significance: The findings suggest that the otDCS&amp;amp;ndash;tDCS pattern stimulation increased the power in matched intrinsic oscillations and, significantly, in the above bands in an ascending order. We provide evidence for the successful corporation between otDCS (as frequency-matched guidance) and tDCS (as a power generator) rather than tDCS alone when stimulating a desired brain intrinsic band (herein, tES specificity).</p>

	<p>Objectives: Hemispherotomy (HT) is a surgical option for treatment of drug-resistant seizures due to hemispheric structural lesions. Factors affecting seizure outcome have not been fully clarified. In our study, we used a brain Machine Learning (ML) approach to evaluate the possible role of Inter-hemispheric EEG Connectivity (IC) in predicting post-surgical seizure outcome. Methods: We collected 21 pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy; who underwent HT in our center from 2009 to 2020; with a follow-up of at least two years. We selected 5-s windows of wakefulness and sleep pre-surgical EEG and we trained Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) to estimate epilepsy outcome. We extracted EEG features as input data and selected the ANN with best accuracy. Results: Among 21 patients, 15 (71%) were seizure and drug-free at last follow-up. ANN showed 73.3% of accuracy, with 85% of seizure free and 40% of non-seizure free patients appropriately classified. Conclusions: The accuracy level that we reached supports the hypothesis that pre-surgical EEG features may have the potential to predict epilepsy outcome after HT. Significance: The role of pre-surgical EEG data in influencing seizure outcome after HT is still debated. We proposed a computational predictive model, with an ML approach, with a high accuracy level.</p>

	<p>A large number of studies have studied the influence of emotional experience on an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s estimation performance, but the influence of implicit emotion regulation is still unknown. Participants were asked to complete the following tasks in order: idiom matching task, multiplication computational estimation task (MCE task), gender judgment task (GJ task), and emotional experience intensity assessment task. The words matching task was adopted to achieve the purpose of implicit emotion regulation (implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression). Behavioral results showed that implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression equally contributed to improving an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s estimation speed (but not ACC (accuracy)). The MCE task related ERP (event-related potential) results showed that the influence of implicit emotion regulation on estimation consisted of two phases. In the first phase (encoding phase), implicit reappraisal both enhanced (larger P1 amplitudes) and weakened (smaller N170 amplitudes) an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s encoding sensitivity, while implicit suppression enhanced an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s encoding sensitivity (larger P1 amplitudes). In the second phase (estimation strategies retrieval phase), implicit reappraisal (but not implicit suppression) cost more attention resources (larger LPC2 and LPC3 amplitudes). The present study suggested that both implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression contributed to improving an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s estimation performance, and the regulation effect of implicit suppression (vs. implicit reappraisal) was better.</p>

	<p>The association between impaired speech perception and reading difficulty has been well established in native language processing, as can be observed from brain activity. However, there has been scarce investigation of whether this association extends to brain activity during foreign language processing. The relationship between reading skills and neuronal speech representation of foreign language remains unclear. In the present study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) with high-density EEG to investigate this question. Eleven- to 13-year-old children typically developed (CTR) or with reading difficulties (RD) were tested via a passive auditory oddball paradigm containing native (Finnish) and foreign (English) speech items. The change-detection-related ERP responses, the mismatch response (MMR), and the late discriminative negativity (LDN) were studied. The cluster-based permutation tests within and between groups were performed. The results showed an apparent language effect. In the CTR group, we found an atypical MMR in the foreign language processing and a larger LDN response for speech items containing a diphthong in both languages. In the RD group, we found unstable MMR with lower amplitude and a nonsignificant LDN response. A deficit in the LDN response in both languages was found within the RD group analysis. Moreover, we observed larger brain responses in the RD group and a hemispheric polarity reversal compared to the CTR group responses. Our results provide new evidence that language processing differed between the CTR and RD groups in early and late discriminatory responses and that language processing is linked to reading skills in both native and foreign language contexts.</p>

	<p>Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is a rare brain congenital malformation, consisting in altered neuronal migration and proliferation within one hemisphere, which is responsible for early onset drug-resistant epilepsy. Hemispherotomy is an effective treatment option for patients with HME and drug-resistant epilepsy. Surgical outcome may be variable among different surgical series, and the long-term neuropsychological trajectory has been rarely defined using a standardized neurocognitive test. We report the epileptological and neuropsychological long-term outcomes of four consecutive HME patients, operated on before the age of three years. All patients were seizure-free and drug-free, and the minimum follow-up duration was of five years. Despite the excellent post-surgical seizure outcome, the long-term developmental outcome is quite variable between patients, ranging from mild to severe intellectual disabilities. Patients showed improvement mainly in communication skills, while visuo-perceptive and coordination abilities were more impaired. Epileptological outcome seems to be improved in early treated patients; however, neuropsychological outcome in HME patients may be highly variable despite early surgery.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A fast lasso-based method for inferring higher-order interactions</a></h4>

Large-scale genotype-phenotype screens provide a wealth of data for identifying molecular alterations associated with a phenotype. Epistatic effects play an important role in such association studies. For example, siRNA perturbation screens can be used to identify combinatorial gene-silencing effects. In bacteria, epistasis has practical consequences in determining antimicrobial resistance as the genetic background of a strain plays an important role in determining resistance. Recently developed tools scale to human exome-wide screens for pairwise interactions, but none to date have included the possibility of three-way interactions. Expanding upon recent state-of-the-art methods, we make a number of improvements to the performance on large-scale data, making consideration of three-way interactions possible. We demonstrate our proposed method, Pint, on both simulated and real data sets, including antibiotic resistance testing and siRNA perturbation screens. Pint outperforms known methods in simulated data, and identifies a number of biologically plausible gene effects in both the antibiotic and siRNA models. For example, we have identified a combination of known tumour suppressor genes that is predicted (using Pint) to cause a significant increase in cell proliferation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Development of hidden Markov modeling method for molecular orientations and structure estimation from high-speed atomic force microscopy time-series images</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomonori Ogane, Daisuke Noshiro, Toshio Ando, Atsuko Yamashita, Yuji Sugita, Yasuhiro Matsunaga</p>

High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) is a powerful technique for capturing the time-resolved behavior of biomolecules. However, structural information in HS-AFM images is limited to the surface geometry of a sample molecule. Inferring latent three-dimensional structures from the surface geometry is thus important for getting more insights into conformational dynamics of a target biomolecule. Existing methods for estimating the structures are based on the rigid-body fitting of candidate structures to each frame of HS-AFM images. Here, we extend the existing frame-by-frame rigid-body fitting analysis to multiple frames to exploit orientational correlations of a sample molecule between H frames in HS-AFM data due to the interaction with the stage. In the method, we treat HS-AFM data as time-series data, and they are analyzed with the hidden Markov modeling. Using simulated HS-AFM images of the taste receptor type 1 as a test case, the proposed method shows a more robust estimation of molecular orientations than the frame-by-frame analysis. The method is applicable in integrative modeling of conformational dynamics using HS-AFM data.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Social health and cognitive change in old age: the role of brain reserve</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Individual aspects of social health (SH; e.g. network, engagement, support) have been linked to cognitive health. However, their combined effect, and the role of the structural properties of the brain (brain reserve, BR) remain unclear. We investigated the interplay of SH and BR on cognitive change in older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Within the Swedish National study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen, 368 dementia-free adults aged ≥60 years with baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging were followed over 12 years to assess cognitive change. A measure of global cognition was computed at each of the five waves of assessment by averaging domain-specific Z-scores for episodic memory, perceptual speed, semantic memory, letter and category fluency. An SH composite score was computed at baseline by combining leisure activities and social network. BR was proxied by total brain tissue volume (TBTV). Linear mixed models (adjusted for sociodemographic, vascular, and genetic factors) were used to estimate cognitive trajectories in relation to SH, TBTV. Interaction analysis and stratification were used to examine the interplay between SH and TBTV.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Moderate-good SH (n=245; vs. poor; β-slope=0.01 [95% CI 0.002, 0.02]; p=0.018) and moderate-to-large TBTV (n=245; vs. small; β-slope=0.03 [95% CI 0.02, 0.04]; p&lt;0.001) were separately associated with slower cognitive decline. In stratified analysis, moderate-good SH was associated with higher cognitive levels (but not change) only in participants with moderate-to-large TBTV (β-intercept=0.21 [95%CI 0.06; 0.37], p&lt;0.01; interaction SH*TBTV p&lt;0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight the interplay between social health and brain reserve that likely unfolds throughout the entire life course to shape old-age cognitive outcomes.</p>

<p>During reactive gliosis, Muller glia (1) initiate the posttranslational modification citrullination in Muller endfeet (2) via activation of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). Citrullinated glial fibrillary acidic protein (3) accumulates after laser injury in wild-type mice and feature retinal fibrosis (4), but this phenotype is not observed in glial-specific PAD4-specific KO mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retinal scarring with vision loss continues to be an enigma in individuals with advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Müller glial cells are believed to initiate and perpetuate scarring in retinal degeneration as these glial cells participate in reactive gliosis and undergo hypertrophy. We previously showed in the murine laser-induced model of choroidal neovascularization that models wet-AMD that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, an early marker of reactive gliosis, increases along with its posttranslational modification citrullination. This was related to increased co-expression of the citrullination enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase-4 (PAD4), which also colocalizes to GFAP filaments. However, whether such hypercitrullination in Müller glial drives fibrotic pathology has remained understudied. Here, using male and female C57Bl6 mice subjected to laser injury, we investigated in a temporal study how citrullination impacts GFAP and PAD4 dynamics. We found that high molecular weight citrullinated species that accumulate in Müller glia corresponded with dynamic changes in GFAP and PAD4 showing their temporal redistribution from polymeric cytoskeletal to soluble protein fractions using immunostaining and western blot analysis. In conditional glial-specific PAD4 knockout (PAD4cKO) mice subjected to laser injury, there was a stark reduction of citrullination and of polymerized GFAP filaments. These injured PAD4cKO retinas showed improved lesion healing, as well as reduced fibronectin deposition in the subretinal space at 30 days. Taken together, these findings reveal that pathologically overexpressed PAD4 in reactive Müller glia governs GFAP filament dynamics and alters their stability, suggesting chronic PAD4-driven hypercitrullination may be a target for retinal fibrosis.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to identify magnetic resonance (MR) metrics that are most sensitive to early changes in the brain in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and type 3 (SCA3) using an advanced multimodal MR imaging (MRI) protocol in the multisite trial setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SCA1 or SCA3 mutation carriers and controls (n = 107) underwent MR scanning in the US-European READISCA study to obtain structural, diffusion MRI, and MR spectroscopy data using an advanced protocol at 3T. Morphometric, microstructural, and neurochemical metrics were analyzed blinded to diagnosis and compared between preataxic SCA (n = 11 SCA1, n = 28 SCA3), ataxic SCA (n = 14 SCA1, n = 37 SCA3), and control (n = 17) groups using nonparametric testing accounting for multiple comparisons. MR metrics that were most sensitive to preataxic abnormalities were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Atrophy and microstructural damage in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles and neurochemical abnormalities in the pons were prominent in both preataxic groups, when patients did not differ from controls clinically. MR metrics were strongly associated with ataxia symptoms, activities of daily living, and estimated ataxia duration. A neurochemical measure was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA1 (ROC area under the curve [AUC] = 0.95), and a microstructural metric was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA3 (AUC = 0.92).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Changes in cerebellar afferent and efferent pathways underlie the earliest symptoms of both SCAs. MR metrics collected with a harmonized advanced protocol in the multisite trial setting allow detection of disease effects in individuals before ataxia onset with potential clinical trial utility for subject stratification.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Associations between cortical β‐amyloid burden, fornix microstructure and cognitive processing of faces, places, bodies and other visual objects in early Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Using two imaging modalities, that is, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) the present study tested associations between cortical amyloid-beta (Aβ) burden and fornix microstructural changes with cognitive deficits in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), namely deficits in working memory (1-back) processing of visual object categories (faces, places, objects, bodies and verbal material). Second, we examined cortical Aβ associations with fornix microstructure. Seventeen early AD patients and 17 healthy-matched controls were included. Constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography was used to segment the fornix and a control tract the central branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (CB-SLF) previously implicated in working memory processes. Standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) of Aβ were extracted from 45 cortical/subcortical regions from the AAL atlas and subject to principal component analysis for data reduction. Patients exhibited (i) impairments in cognitive performance (ii) reductions in fornix fractional anisotropy (FA) and (iii) increases in a component that loaded highly on cortical Aβ. There were no group differences in CB-SLF FA and in a component loading highly on subcortical Aβ. Partial correlation analysis in the patient group showed (i) positive associations between fornix FA and performance for all the visual object categories and (ii) a negative association between the cortical Aβ component and performance for the object categories but not for the remaining classes of visual stimuli. A subsequent analysis showed a positive association between overall cognition (performance across distinct 1-back task conditions) with fornix FA but no association with cortical Aβ burden, in keeping with influential accounts on early onset AD. This indicates that the fornix degenerates early in AD and contributes to deficits in working memory processing of visual object categories; though it is also important to acknowledge the importance of prospective longitudinal studies with larger samples. Overall, the effect sizes of fornical degeneration on visual working memory appeared stronger than the ones related to amyloid burden.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein composition of axonal dopamine release sites in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is an important modulator of cognition and movement. We recently found that evoked dopamine secretion is fast and relies on active zone-like release sites. Here, we used in vivo biotin-identification (iBioID) proximity proteomics in mouse striatum to assess which proteins are present at these sites. Using three release site baits, we identified proteins that are enriched over the general dopamine axonal protein content, and they fell into categories including active zone, Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory and synaptic vesicle proteins. We also detected many proteins not previously associated with vesicular exocytosis. Knockout of the presynaptic organizer protein RIM strongly decreased the hit number obtained with iBioID, while Synaptotagmin-1 knockout did not. α-Synuclein, a protein linked to Parkinson's disease, was enriched at release sites, and its enrichment was lost in both tested mutants. We conclude that RIM organizes scaffolded dopamine release sites and provide a proteomic assessment of the composition of these sites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Is calcium a link between inflammatory bone resorption and heart disease?</a></h4>

              
                Several epidemiologic studies associate bone-resorbing chronic inflammatory conditions with increased risk of atherosclerotic heart disease. These include post-menopausal osteoporosis, spinal cord injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Additional studies have noted that the use of anti-resorptive agents following hip fracture, during rheumatoid arthritis, and prior to intensive care management have resulted in reduced overall mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disorders. The careful study of burn patients has allowed us to detect that children and adolescents have a mechanism that protects them from the entry of calcium into the circulation following inflammatory bone resorption. That is, they respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines by up-regulating the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) with consequent development of hypocalcemic hypoparathyroidism and hypercalciuria. As extracellular calcium appears to exacerbate and/or prolong the inflammatory response, this responsiveness of the CaSR to inflammatory cytokines may be the factor that reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In adults with chronic inflammatory conditions, the ability of the CaSR to respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines is lost, suggesting that the calcium that enters the circulation following inflammatory bone resorption may persist in the circulation, entering the small coronary blood vessels and favoring the formation of coronary artery calcification, inflammation, and consequent cardiovascular disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inducible lncRNA transgenic mice reveal continual role of HOTAIR in promoting breast cancer metastasis</a></h4>

              
                <i>HOTAIR</i> is a 2.2 kb long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) whose dysregulation has been linked to oncogenesis, defects in pattern formation during early development, and irregularities during the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the oncogenic transformation determined by <i>HOTAIR</i> in vivo and its impact on chromatin dynamics are incompletely understood. Here we generate a transgenic mouse model with doxycycline-inducible expression of human <i>HOTAIR</i> in the context of the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer-prone background to systematically interrogate the cellular mechanisms by which human <i>HOTAIR</i> lncRNA acts to promote breast cancer progression. We show that sustained high levels of <i>HOTAIR</i> over time increased breast metastatic capacity and invasiveness in breast cancer cells, promoting migration and subsequent metastasis to the lung. Subsequent withdrawal of <i>HOTAIR</i> overexpression reverted the metastatic phenotype, indicating oncogenic lncRNA addiction. Furthermore, <i>HOTAIR</i> overexpression altered both the cellular transcriptome and chromatin accessibility landscape of multiple metastasis-associated genes and promoted epithelial to mesenchymal transition. These alterations are abrogated within several cell cycles after <i>HOTAIR</i> expression is reverted to basal levels, indicating an erasable lncRNA-associated epigenetic memory. These results suggest that a continual role for <i>HOTAIR</i> in programming a metastatic gene regulatory program. Targeting <i>HOTAIR</i> lncRNA may potentially serve as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate breast cancer progression.

                The expression of a mutant Lamin A, progerin, in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome leads to alterations in genome architecture, nuclear morphology, epigenetic states, and altered phenotypes in all cells of the mesenchymal lineage. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional status of patient derived HGPS fibroblasts, including nine cell lines not previously reported, in comparison with age-matched controls, adults, and old adults. We find that Progeria fibroblasts carry abnormal transcriptional signatures, centering around several functional hubs: DNA maintenance and epigenetics, bone development and homeostasis, blood vessel maturation and development, fat deposition and lipid management, and processes related to muscle growth. Stratification of patients by age revealed misregulated expression of genes related to endochondral ossification and chondrogenic commitment in children aged four to seven years old, where this differentiation program starts in earnest.  Hi-C measurements on patient fibroblasts show weakening of genome compartmentalization strength but increases in TAD strength. While the majority of gene misregulation occurs in regions which do not change spatial chromosome organization, some expression changes in key mesenchymal lineage genes coincide with lamin associated domain misregulation and shifts in genome compartmentalization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Clonally related, Notch-differentiated spinal neurons integrate into distinct circuits</a></h4>

              
                Shared lineage has diverse effects on patterns of neuronal connectivity. In mammalian cortex, excitatory sister neurons assemble into shared microcircuits. In <i>Drosophila</i>, in contrast, sister neurons with different levels of Notch expression (Notch<sup>ON</sup>/Notch<sup>OFF</sup>) develop distinct identities and diverge into separate circuits. Notch-differentiated sister neurons have been observed in vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but whether they integrate into shared or distinct circuits remains unknown. Here, we evaluate how sister V2a (Notch<sup>OFF</sup>)/V2b (Notch<sup>ON</sup>) neurons in the zebrafish integrate into spinal circuits. Using an in vivo labeling approach, we identified pairs of sister V2a/b neurons born from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and observed that they have somata in close proximity to each other and similar axonal trajectories. However, paired whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics revealed that sister V2a/b neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. These results resemble the divergent connectivity in <i>Drosophila</i> and represent the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Working strokes produced by curling protofilaments at disassembling microtubule tips can be biochemically tuned and vary with species</a></h4>

              
                The disassembly of microtubules can generate force and drive intracellular motility. During mitosis, for example, chromosomes remain persistently attached via kinetochores to the tips of disassembling microtubules, which pull the sister chromatids apart. According to the conformational wave hypothesis, such force generation requires that protofilaments curl outward from the disassembling tips to exert pulling force directly on kinetochores. Rigorously testing this idea will require modifying the mechanical and energetic properties of curling protofilaments, but no way to do so has yet been described. Here, by direct measurement of working strokes generated in vitro by curling protofilaments, we show that their mechanical energy output can be increased by adding magnesium, and that yeast microtubules generate larger and more energetic working strokes than bovine microtubules. Both the magnesium and species-dependent increases in work output can be explained by lengthening the protofilament curls, without any change in their bending stiffness or intrinsic curvature. These observations demonstrate how work output from curling protofilaments can be tuned and suggest evolutionary conservation of the amount of curvature strain energy stored in the microtubule lattice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological Activity of Primary Cortical Neuron-Glia Mixed Cultures</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundWe have previously described a tri-culture of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia that accurately mimics the in vivo neuroinflammatory response (both neurotoxic and neuroprotective) to a wide range of neuroinflammatory stimuli. Electrophysiological activity is an essential measure of neuronal function, which is influenced by neuroinflammation. Microelectrode array (MEA) technology is a versatile tool to non-invasively study in vitro neural networks by simultaneously recording electrophysiological activity from multiple sites. In this study, we used extracellular recordings to determine the effect of microglia on neural network formation and stability in primary cortical cultures and monitor the changes in neural activity in response to neuroinflammatory stimuli.

MethodsPrimary neonatal rat cortical tri-cultures of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia or co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes were cultured on custom MEAs and the neural activity was monitored for 21 days in vitro to assess culture maturation and network formation. Quantification of synaptic puncta and averaged spike waveforms were used to determine the difference in excitatory to inhibitory neuron ratio (E/I ratio) of the neurons in tri- and co-cultures. The electrophysiological response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of both culture types were compared.

ResultsThe tri- and co-culture showed minimal difference in electrophysiological markers of neural network formation and stability with the exception of a significant increase in spike frequency in the tri-culture at later timepoints (DIV 17 and 21). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the density of either post-synaptic or excitatory pre-synaptic puncta between the culture types. However, characterization of the average spike waveforms revealed that the tri-culture had an E/I ratio much closer to that found in the rat cortex. Finally, only the tri-culture displayed a significant decrease in both the number of active channels and spike frequency following LPS exposure.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that the microglia in the tri-culture do not disrupt neural network formation and stability as quantified using extracellular recordings and may be a better representation of the in vivo cortex due to the closer E/I ratio than more traditional isolated neuron and neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. Additionally, the tri-culture is better able to mimic the neuroinflammatory response to LPS, which was quantified via changes in neural electrophysiological activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the efficacy of commercially available antisense oligonucleotides to reduce mouse and human tau in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies, including Alzheimers disease (AD), are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of tau protein encoded by the MAPT (Microtubule Associated Protein Tau) gene. Various strategies targeting mechanisms to reduce tau pathology have been proposed and several tau-directed therapies are being investigated in clinical trials. Our lab previously developed a novel strategy to lower tau protein levels using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), showing that human tau (hTau) reduction in aged PS19 tauopathy mice reversed phosphorylated tau pathology, spared neurons, and prolonged survival. Currently, the tau-lowering ASO is being evaluated in the clinical trials with successful phase 1b results. Similarly, preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the use of other ASOs as effective therapeutic strategies. Acquiring ASOs for research purposes may be limited by partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. However, ASOs can be obtained through commercial vendors. The current study evaluates the efficacy of mouse and human tau-targeting ASOs obtained from a commercial vendor in various mouse models. We show that mice treated with purchased ASOs distribute among various brain cell types including neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Mice treated with tau lowering ASOs show decreased mouse or human tau mRNA and protein levels. In addition, human tau lowering ASO-treated PS19 mice showed decreased phosphorylated tau (AT8) and gliosis relative to saline-treated PS19 mice. The results obtained in PS19 mice are consistent with data obtained from our previous study using a non-commercial tau-lowering ASO. Overall, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of commercially-available tau targeting ASOs in vivo to support their broad use by researchers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sparse and stereotyped encoding implicates a core glomerulus for ant alarm behavior</a></h4>

              
                Ants communicate via large arrays of pheromones and possess expanded, highly complex olfactory systems, with antennal lobes in the brain comprising ~500 glomeruli. This expansion implies that odors could activate hundreds of glomeruli, which would pose challenges for higher order processing. To study this problem, we generated the first transgenic ants, expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon imaging, we mapped complete glomerular responses to four ant alarm pheromones. Alarm pheromones robustly activated [&le;]6 glomeruli, and activity maps for the three pheromones inducing panic-alarm in our study species converged on a single glomerulus. These results demonstrate that, rather than using broadly tuned combinatorial encoding, ants employ precise, narrowly tuned, and stereotyped representation of alarm pheromone cues. The identification of a central sensory hub glomerulus for alarm behavior suggests that a simple neural architecture is sufficient to translate pheromone perception into behavioral outputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex and age specific effects on the development of addiction and compulsive-like drinking in rats</a></h4>

              
                Biological factors are known to influence disease trajectories and treatment effectiveness in alcohol addiction. One important biological factor influencing disease dynamics in alcohol use disorder is sex, as preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that gender influences disease trajectories in subjects with alcohol use disorder. Another critical factor is age at first intoxicating drink, which has been identified as a risk factor for later alcohol binging. Preclinical research allows prospective monitoring of rodents throughout the lifespan, providing very detailed information that cannot be acquired in humans. Lifetime monitoring in rodents can be conducted under highly controlled conditions, during which one can systematically introduce multiple biological and environmental factors that impact behaviors of interest.

Here, we used the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) rat model of alcohol addiction in a computerized drinkometer system to study disease dynamics and transition points of addictive behavior in cohorts of adolescent vs. adult as well as male vs. female rats in direct comparison. Early age of onset of drinking (postnatal day 40) in male rats had surprisingly little impact on the development of drinking behavior and compulsivity (quinine taste adulteration) when compared to rats that started drinking during early adulthood (postnatal day 72). However, female rats showed a stronger resistance to quinine taste adulteration after a history of ADEs, indicative of more pronounced compulsive behavior in females as compared to male rats. Specifically, female rats exhibit during quinine taste adulteration a higher frequency of drinking events and a larger access size, especially from the 20% alcohol solution, resulting in fast intoxication despite taste aversion in a relapse-like situation. Our results suggest that drinking patterns, and specifically solution preference as well as access size, provide a valuable indication into determining compulsive drinking. These findings provide a better understanding of sex and age factors involved in the development of drinking behavior that are important in preclinical development of models of addiction, drug development and exploration options for new treatments.

                SATB2 is genetically associated with human intelligence. Since SATB2 protein structure predicts a function in DNA looping, we analyzed the impact of SATB2 on 3D genome architecture and chromatin accessibility in cortical neurons. Our data reveal strong effects of SATB2 on chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters of neuronal activity-regulated genes, which closely correlate with gene expression. We furthermore identify SATB2-dependent alterations at all 3D genome architectural levels, including compartments, Topologically Associated Domains and Frequently Interacting Regions. Genes linked to SATB2-dependent 3D genome changes are implicated in highly specialized neuronal functions and contribute to cognitive ability and risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The altered non-coding regions are enriched for common variants associated with educational attainment, intelligence and schizophrenia. Our data establish SATB2 as a 3D genome organizer, which operates both independently and in cooperation with CTCF to set up the chromatin landscape of pyramidal neurons for cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ultrastructure of Precapillary Sphincters and the Neurovascular Unit</a></h4>

              
                Neurons communicate with vasculature to regulate blood flow in the brain. The cells that maintain this are collectively named the neurovascular unit (NVU). This communication, known as neurovascular coupling, is thought to involve astrocytes or molecules that can pass through the astrocytic endfeet. However, the exact mechanism is still unclear. Using large 3D electron microscopy datasets, we can now study the entire NVU in context. In this study, I provide evidence for the role of precapillary sphincters as a hub for neurovascular coupling and endothelial transcytosis, as well as the role of collagen synthesized by fibroblasts in strengthening first-order capillaries. I also show how astrocytic endfeet form a barrier for fluid flow and how the microvasculature of the cortex is not innervated but is surrounded by a surprising organization of parenchymal neuronal processes around penetrating arterioles and arterial-end capillaries in both mouse and human brains.

Significance statementThe neurovascular unit (NVU) is made up of various types of cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, which work together to regulate blood flow in response to changes in neural activity. This process, known as neurovascular coupling, is crucial for ensuring that the brain receives an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. This study suggests a novel organization of the NVU and neurovascular coupling. Through ultrastructural analysis, I was able to identify previously unknown relationships between the different types of cells in the NVU. These findings provide new insights into the structure of the NVU and how it functions, which may help researchers develop new strategies for preserving cognitive function and promoting healthy aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astroglial mediation of fast-acting antidepressant effect in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Rapid-acting antidepressants like ketamine hold promise to change the approach to treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but their cellular and molecular targets remain unclear. Passivity induced by behavioral futility underlies learned helplessness, a process that becomes maladaptive in MDD. Antidepressants decrease futility-induced passivity (FIP) in rodent models such as the forced swimming or tail suspension tasks, but these models lack the throughput and accessibility for screening compounds and investigating their effects on the brain in vivo. Therefore, we adapted a recently discovered FIP behavior in the small and optically accessible larval zebrafish to create a scalable behavioral assay for antidepressant action. We found that rapid-acting antidepressants with diverse pharmacological targets demonstrated a suppression of FIP conserved between fish and rodents. While fast-acting antidepressants are thought to primarily target neurons, using brain-wide imaging in vivo we found, surprisingly, that ketamine, but not psychedelics or typical antidepressants, drove cytosolic calcium elevation in astroglia lasting many minutes. Blocking neural activity did not prevent ketamine's effects on FIP or astroglial calcium, suggesting an astroglia-autonomous mechanism of ketamine's action. Chemogenetic and optogenetic perturbations of astroglia reveal that the aftereffects of calcium elevation are sufficient to suppress FIP by inhibiting astroglial integration of futile swimming. In sum, our work provides evidence that ketamine exerts its antidepressant effects by inhibiting an astroglial population that integrates futility and changes behavioral state. Astroglia play central roles in modulating circuit dynamics, and our work argues that targeting astroglial signaling may be a fruitful strategy for designing new rapid-acting antidepressants.

                Background: Processes that drive Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis have long been considered to occur within the central nervous system, yet recent studies have bolstered the possibility that changes in the periphery may be relevant to the disease process. Accumulating evidence has suggested that proteins changing in the blood may be reliable indicators of disease within the brain. Recent advances in geroscience have identified potential mechanisms of blood-brain communication that modulate brain function in ways that could be harnessed for therapy. While blood-borne proteins associated with either youth or old age have been targeted to restore function to the aged brain, it remains unclear whether other dysfunctional systemic states can be exploited for similar benefits. Here we investigate whether APOE allelic variation or presence of brain amyloid are associated with distinct proteomic changes within the systemic environment and what molecular processes are associated with these changes. Methods: Using the SOMAscan assay, we measured 1,305 plasma proteins from 53 homozygous APOE3 and APOE4 subjects (mean age = 68 years; minimum = 54 years) who exhibited no cognitive impairment, some of whom can be categorized as harboring cerebral amyloid based on cerebrospinal fluid A{beta}42 measurements. Using the Dream R package for linear mixed effects modeling, we investigated possible contributions of either the APOE-{epsilon}4 allele or amyloid positivity to changes in the plasma proteome. Ontology-based pathway and module trait correlation analyses were performed to understand disrupted pathways that vary based on APOE genotype or amyloid positivity. Results: We found that expression of the APOE-{epsilon}4 allele produced distinct changes in the composition of the plasma proteome. Using both pathway enrichment analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we found that plasma proteins associated with APOE4 expression were linked to pathways related to atherosclerosis, lipid transport, the extracellular matrix, and synaptogenesis signaling. Independent of APOE4, we found that cognitively normal, amyloid-positive subjects exhibit distinct plasma proteome signatures associated with pathways previously linked to AD pathology, relative to amyloid-negative controls. Harboring brain amyloid was associated with plasma proteomic changes linked to dysfunction in blood-brain barrier and other neural cell types. Our results indicate that changes in the plasma proteome are related to possession of AD risk alleles, as well as the presence of amyloid pathology in subjects prior to the onset of symptoms. This work highlights the possibility that pathways in the systemic environment in certain risk contexts may be plausible targets to explore for modulating disease.

                Numbers and letters are the fundamental building blocks of our everyday social interactions. Previous studies have focused on determining the cortical networks shaped by numeracy and literacy in the human brain, partially supporting the hypothesis of distinct neural circuits involved the processing of the two categories. In this study, we aim to investigate the temporal dynamics for number and letter processing. We present MEG data from two experiments (N=20 each). In the first experiment, single numbers, letter, and their respective false fonts (false numbers and false letters) were presented, whereas, in the second experiment, numbers, letters, and their respective false fonts were presented as a string of characters. We used multivariate pattern analysis techniques (time-resolved decoding and temporal generalization) testing the strong hypothesis that the neural mechanisms supporting letter and number processing can be logistically classified as categorically separate. Our results show a very early dissociation ([~]100 ms) between numbers, and letters when compared to false fonts. Number processing can be dissociated with similar accuracy when presented as isolated items or strings of characters, while letter processing shows dissociable classification accuracy for single items compared to strings. These findings reinforce the evidence indicating that early visual processing can be differently shaped by the experience with numbers and letters; this dissociation is stronger for strings compared to single items, thus showing that combinatorial mechanisms for numbers and letters could be categorically distinguished and influence early brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Displacement of extracellular chloride by sulfated glycosaminoglycans of the brain extracellular matrix</a></h4>

              
                GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Membrane currents evoked by GABAA receptor activation have uniquely small driving forces: their reversal potential (EGABA) is very close to the resting membrane potential. As a consequence, GABAA currents can flow in either direction, depending on both the membrane potential and the local intra and extracellular concentrations of the primary permeant ion, chloride (Cl). Cytoplasmic Cl concentrations vary widely due to displacement of mobile Cl ions by relatively immobile anions. Here we describe new reporters of extracellular chloride (Cl-o) and demonstrate that Cl is displaced in the extracellular space by high and spatially heterogenous concentrations of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. The mean Cl-o is only half the canonical concentration, i.e. the Cl concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. Cl-o microdomains provide a mechanism to link the highly stable distribution of GAGs in the brains extracellular space to neuronal signal processing via the effects on the amplitude and direction of GABAA transmembrane Cl currents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cost of multiplexing: PFC integrates multiple sources of information in non-orthogonal components accounting for behavioral variability</a></h4>

              
                The frontal eye field (FEF) is a prefrontal cortical area classically associated with spatial attention, perception, and oculomotor functions. FEF exhibits complex response properties through mixed selectivity neurons, allowing a high dimensional representation of the information. However, recent studies have shown that FEF encodes information in a low-dimensional regime hence limiting the coding capacity of the neural population. How the FEF encodes multiple sources of information with such limited encoding capacity remains elusive. To address this question, we trained two macaques to perform a visual attention task while we recorded FEF neuronal activity using multi-contact electrodes. FEF neurons encoded task- (spatial location of cue, POS; time in trial, CTOA) and behaviour- (reaction time, RT; focus of attention, TA) related parameters prior to target onset. We found a clear modulation of the RT and TA as a function of the CTOA. Using dPCA, we characterized the functional relationship between neural populations associated with each parameter and investigated how this functional relationship predicts behavior. We found that CTOA variability was associated to two different components the activation of which was correlated with the TA and the RT, respectively. These CTOA related components were non-orthogonal with the RT and TA related components. These results suggest that when different sources of information are implemented during task performance, they show a very precise geometrical configuration in non-orthogonal components. This allows high simultaneous information encoding capacity at the cost of an impaired capacity to use attention information and an enhanced responsiveness toward external stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human neurons lacking amyloid precursor protein exhibit cholesterol-associated developmental and presynaptic deficits</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid precursor protein (APP) produces aggregable {beta}-amyloid peptides and its mutations are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease, which makes it one of the most studied proteins. However, APP's role in the human brain remains unclear despite years of investigation. One problem is that most studies on APP have been carried out in cell lines or model organisms, which are physiologically different from human neurons in the brain. Recently, human-induced neurons (hiNs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells provide a practical platform for studying the human brain in vitro. Here, we generated APP-null iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and differentiate them into matured human neurons with functional synapses using a two-step procedure. During hiN differentiation and maturation, APP-null cells exhibited less neurite growth and reduced synaptogenesis in serum-free but not serum-containing media. We have found that cholesterol (Chol) remedies those developmental defects in APP-null cells, consistent with Chol's role in neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis. The phenotypic rescue was also achieved by co-culturing those cells with wild-type mouse astrocytes, suggesting that APP's developmental role is likely astrocytic. Next, we examined matured hiNs using patch-clamp recording and detected reduced synaptic transmission in APP-null cells. This change was largely due to decreased synaptic vesicle (SV) release and retrieval, which was confirmed by live-cell imaging using two SV-specific fluorescent reporters. Adding Chol shortly before stimulation mitigated the SV deficits in APP-null iNs, indicating that APP facilitates presynaptic membrane Chol turnover during the SV exocytosis and endocytosis cycle. Taken together, our study in hiNs supports the notion that APP contributes to neurodevelopment, synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission via maintaining brain Chol homeostasis. Given the vital of Chol in the central nervous system, the functional connection between APP and Chol bears important implications in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolutionary divergence of basal and activity-dependent exon splicing in cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing of mRNA exons in mammalian neurons increases diversity of the proteome and is regulatable by signaling pathways. However, the degree of conservation of basal and signal-dependent exon usage between human neurons and those from experimental models such as mice is incompletely understood. We previously showed that cortical neuronal activity-dependent gene transcription exhibits human/mouse differences, driven by evolutionary divergence of cis-acting promoter elements (Qiu et al. 2016). Since alternative exon usage influences brain development and cognition, is controlled by neuronal activity, and is disturbed in brain disorders, we investigated human/mouse differences in exon usage in cortical neurons. Comparing orthologous exons, basal exon inclusion levels showed human-mouse conservation, but also significant differences determined by cis-acting sequences: human-mouse conservation and divergence in exon usage was recapitulated in neurons from Tc1 mice carrying human chromosome-21 (hCh21). Activity-dependent changes in exon usage also exhibited significant conservation: gene structure was more likely to be conserved in activity-regulated exons, and exons regulated in both human and mouse neurons were enriched in RBFOX and SAM68 targets, and genes were centred on cytoskeletal organisation, mRNA transcription/processing, and synaptic signaling. However, divergence was also evident, and human-specific activity-dependent exon usage was dominated by genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, signaling and trafficking. Notably, the pattern of activity-dependent usage of hCh21 exons in human neurons was not recapitulated in mouse Tc1 neurons. Thus, unlike species-specific differences in activity-dependent gene transcription, cis-acting DNA sequence divergence is insufficient to explain inter-species differences in activity-regulated exon usage. Trans-acting factors involved in activity-responsive splicing have likely also diverged.

                The present study investigated whether neonatal exposure to the proinflammatory endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by antibiotic (ATB)-induced dysbiosis in early adulthood could induce schizophrenia-like behavioral changes in adult male rats. The combination of these two stressors resulted in decreased weight gain, but no significant behavioral abnormalities were observed. LPS treatment resulted in adult rats hypoactivity and induced anxiety-like behavior in the social recognition paradigm, but these behavioral changes were not exacerbated by ATB-induced gut dysbiosis. ATB treatment seriously disrupted the gut bacterial community, but dysbiosis did not affect locomotor activity, social recognition, and acoustic reactivity in adult rats. Fecal bacterial community analyzes showed no differences between the LPS challenge exposed/unexposed rats, while the effect of ATB administration was decisive regardless of prior LPS exposure. ATB treatment resulted in significantly decreased bacterial diversity, suppression of Clostridiales and Bacteroidales, and increases in Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriales, and Burkholderiales. The persistent effect of LPS on some aspects of behavior suggests a long-term effect of early toxin exposure that was not observed in ATB-treated animals. However, an anti-inflammatory protective effect of ATB cannot be assumed because of the increased abundance of pro-inflammatory, potentially pathogenic bacteria (Proteus, Suttrella) and the elimination of the bacterial families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, which are generally considered beneficial for gut health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-Brain Three-Dimensional Imaging of RNAs at Single-Cell Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain three-dimensional (3D) imaging is desirable to obtain a comprehensive and unbiased view of architecture and neural circuitry. However, current spatial analytic methods for brain RNAs are limited to thin sections or small samples. Here, we combined multiple new techniques to develop TRIC-DISCO, a new pipeline that allows imaging of RNA spatial distributions in whole adult mouse brains. First, we developed Tris-mediated retention of in situ hybridization signal during clearing (TRIC), which produces highly transparent tissue while maintaining the RNA signal intensities. We then combined TRIC with DISCO clearing (TRIC-DISCO) by controlling temperature during the in situ hybridization chain reaction (isHCR) to ensure uniform whole-brain staining. This pipeline eliminates the requirements for both strict RNase-free environments and workflow-compatible RNase inhibitors. Our TRIC-DISCO pipeline enables simple and robust, single-cell, whole-brain, 3D imaging of transcriptional signatures, cell-identity markers, and noncoding RNAs across the entire brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual light history matters to cope with the Antarctic summer</a></h4>

              
                The effect of light, main zeitgeber of the circadian system, depends on the time of day it is received. A brief trip to the Antarctic summer (ANT) allowed us to explore the impact of a sudden and synchronized increase in light exposure on activity-rest rhythms and sleep patterns of 11 Uruguayan university students, and to assess the significance of light history in determining individual circadian phase shift. Measurements collected in the peri-equinox in Montevideo, Uruguay (baseline situation, MVD) and in ANT, included sleep logs, actigraphy, and salivary melatonin to determine dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), the most reliable marker of circadian phase. The increase in light exposure in ANT with respect to MVD (affecting both light-sensitive windows with opposite effects on the circadian phase) resulted in no net change in DLMO among participants as some participants advanced their DLMO and some others delayed it. The ultimate cause of each participants distinctive circadian phase shift relied on the unique change in light exposure each individual was subjected to between their MVD and ANT. This is the first study to show a clear physiological effect of light either advancing or delaying the circadian phase dependent on individual light history in an ecological study.

                Mutations in the single-copy RNU4ATAC gene, which encodes U4atac snRNA of the minor spliceosome are linked to the developmental disorder microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I). Partial loss-of-function mutations of U4atac snRNA lead to a poor prognosis, with less than three year survival. The most prominent characteristic of MOPD I is disrupted central nervous system development resulting in severe microcephaly and lissencephaly. In this study, we used self-organizing 3D cerebral organoids from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate defective cellular events that disturb the laminar organization of the cortex and influence brain topology. We analyzed organoids from iPSCs homozygous for the partial loss-of-function U4atac snRNA 51G>A mutation and compared them to isogenic organoids obtained from iPSCs expressing wild-type U4atac snRNA, using immunostaining and 10X Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing. In our MOPD I organoids, we observed: a) reduced proliferation accompanied by premature neurogenesis depleting the neuro-progenitor pool due to an increased frequency of horizontal cell divisions in the ventricular zone; b) reduced numbers of intermediate progenitor and outer radial glial cells in the outer sub-ventricular zone; and c) defective radial neuronal migration, which is critical for cortical expansion in humans. Our findings therefore provide insight into MOPD I cellular pathogenesis and underline the value of these cerebral organoids as model systems for human neurodevelopmental disorders.

                The functional output of the hippocampus, a brain region subserving memory processes, depends on highly orchestrated cellular and molecular processes that regulate synaptic plasticity throughout life. However, little is known regarding the structural requirements of such plasticity and molecular processes involved in this regulation. Specific molecules, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) have been implicated in serving a pro-plasticity role within the hippocampus, a role that decreases with brain aging. Here, we report that TIMP2 is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus by neurons and its loss in TIMP2 KO mice drives changes in cellular programs related to adult neurogenesis and dendritic spine turnover with corresponding impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory performance. We find that TIMP2 regulates the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) around synapses in the hippocampus with concomitant hindrance in the migration of newborn neurons through a denser ECM network. Deleting the neuronal pool of TIMP2 using a conditional TIMP2 KO mouse reveals that neuronal TIMP2 regulates adult neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory, as well as accumulation of ECM. Our results define a mechanism whereby hippocampus-dependent function is regulated by TIMP2 and its interactions with the ECM to regulate diverse processes associated with synaptic plasticity.

                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a global healthcare crisis. The TgF344-AD rat is an AD model exhibiting age-dependent AD pathological hallmarks. We confirmed that AD rats developed cognitive deficits at 6 months without alteration of any other major biophysical parameters. We longitudinally characterized cerebral hemodynamics in AD rats at 3, 4, 6, and 14 months. The myogenic responses of the cerebral arteries and arterioles were impaired at 4 months of age in the AD rats. Consistent with the ex vivo results, the AD rat exhibited poor autoregulation of surface and deep cortical cerebral blood flow two months preceding cognitive decline. The dysfunction of cerebral hemodynamics in AD is exacerbated with age associated with reduced cerebral perfusion. Further, abolished cell contractility contributes to cerebral hemodynamics imbalance in AD. This may be attributed to enhanced ROS production, reduced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, and disrupted actin cytoskeleton in cerebral vascular contractile cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Open-Source Rodent Chronic EEG Array System with High Density MXene-Based Skull Surface Electrodes</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) is an indispensable tool in epilepsy, sleep, and behavioral research. In rodents, EEG recordings are typically performed with metal electrodes that traverse the skull into the epidural space. In addition to requiring a major surgery, this intracranial EEG technique is difficult to perform for more than a few electrodes, is time-intensive, and confounds experiments studying traumatic brain injury. Here, we describe an open-source cost-effective refinement of this technique for chronic mouse EEG recording. Our alternative two channel (EEG2) and sixteen channel high-density EEG (HdEEG) arrays use electrodes made of the novel, flexible 2D nanomaterial titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene. The MXene electrodes are placed on the surface of the intact skull and establish electrical connection without conductive gel or paste. Fabrication and implantation times of MXene EEG electrodes are significantly shorter than the standard approach and recorded resting baseline and epileptiform EEG waveforms are similar to those obtained with traditional epidural electrodes. Applying HdEEG to a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) model in mice of both sexes revealed that mTBI significantly altered awake resting state spectral density with a spatiospectral region of interest in the {beta} spectral band (12-30 Hz) in the central and posterior regions. These findings indicate that fabrication of MXene electrode arrays is a cost effective, efficient technology for multichannel EEG recording in rodents that obviates the need for skull-penetrating surgery. Moreover, increased {beta} spectral power may contribute to the development of early post-mTBI seizures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Understanding prefrontal cortex functions by decoding its molecular, cellular and circuit organization</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is functionally one of the most complex regions of mammalian brain. Unlike other cortical areas that process single sensory modalities (like vision, touch, smell etc.), the PFC integrates information across brain regions to regulate diverse functions ranging from cognition, emotion, executive action to even pain sensitivity. However, it is unclear how such diverse functions are organized at the cellular and circuit levels within the anatomical modules of the PFC. Here we employed spatially resolved single cell profiling to decode PFC's organizational heterogeneity. The results revealed that PFC has very distinct cell type composition relative to all neighboring cortical areas. Interestingly, PFC adopts specialized transcriptional features, distinct from all neighbors, with differentially express genes regulating neuronal excitability. Additionally, projections of PFC neuron subclusters to major subcortical targets are determined in a target-intrinsic fashion. These cellular and molecular features further segregated within subregions of PFC, alluding to the subregion-specific specialization of several PFC functions. Finally, to exemplify the utility of these unique cellular, molecular and projection properties, we identified distinct cell types and circuits in PFC engaging in pathogenesis of chronic pain. Collectively, we not only present a comprehensive organizational map of the PFC, critical for supporting its diverse functions, but also reveal the cluster and circuit identity of a pathway underlying chronic pain pathogenesis, which paves ways for mechanistic understanding and potential interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Origin of wiring specificity in an olfactory map: dendrite targeting of projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                How does wiring specificity of neural maps emerge during development? Formation of the adult Drosophila olfactory glomerular map begins with patterning of projection neuron (PN) dendrites at the early pupal stage. To better understand the origin of wiring specificity of this map, we created genetic tools to systematically characterize dendrite patterning across development at PN type-specific resolution. We find that PNs use lineage and birth order combinatorially to build the initial dendritic map. Specifically, birth order directs dendrite targeting in rotating and binary manners for PNs of the anterodorsal and lateral lineages, respectively. Two-photon- and adaptive optical lattice light-sheet microscope-based time-lapse imaging reveals that PN dendrites initiate active targeting with direction-dependent branch stabilization on the timescale of seconds. Moreover, PNs that are used in both the larval and adult olfactory circuits prune their larval-specific dendrites and re-extend new dendrites simultaneously to facilitate timely olfactory map organization. Our work highlights the power and necessity of type-specific neuronal access and time-lapse imaging in identifying wiring mechanisms that underlie complex patterns of functional neural maps.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disease-modifying effects of Vincamine supplementation in Drosophila and human cell models of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Current therapies are only symptomatic, and are not able to stop or delay its progression. In order to search new and more effective therapies, our group carried out a high-throughput screening assay, identifying several candidate compounds able to suppress motor defects in DJ-1{beta} mutant flies (a Drosophila model of familial PD) and to reduce oxidative stress (OS)-induced lethality in DJ-1-deficient SH-SY5Y human cells. One of them was vincamine (VIN), a natural alkaloid obtained from the leaves of Vinca minor. Our results showed that VIN is able to suppress PD-related phenotypes in both Drosophila and human cell PD models. Specifically, VIN reduced OS levels in PD model flies. Besides, VIN diminished OS-induced lethality by decreasing apoptosis, increased mitochondrial viability and reduced OS levels in DJ-1-deficient human cells. In addition, we have demonstrated that VIN is able to exert its beneficial role, at least partially, by the inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Therefore, we propose that these channels might be a promising target in the search for new compounds to treat PD, and that VIN constitutes a potential therapeutic treatment for the disease.

                Thalamus provides the principal input to cortex, thus understanding the mechanisms of cortical computations in behaving animals requires to characterize the thalamocortical connectivity in vivo. We show that tangential insertions of high-density electrodes into mouse cortex capture the activity of thalamocortical axons simultaneously with their synaptically connected cortical neurons. Multiple thalamic synaptic inputs to cortical neurons can be measured providing an efficient approach for mapping the thalamocortical connectivity in vivo.

	<p>The corticocortical vestibular network (CVN) plays an important role in maintaining balance and stability. In order to clarify the specific relationship between the CVN and the balance ability of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we recruited 30 MCI patients in the community. According to age and sex, they were 1:1 matched to 30 older adults with normal cognitive function. We evaluated balance ability and performed MRI scanning in the two groups of participants. We analyzed functional connectivity within the CVN based on the region of interest. Then, we performed a Pearson correlation analysis between the functional connection and the Berg Balance Scale scores. The research results show that compared with the control group, there were three pairs of functional connections (hMST_R&amp;amp;ndash;Premotor_R, PFcm_R&amp;amp;ndash;SMA_L, and hMST_L&amp;amp;ndash;VIP_R) that were significantly decreased in the CVNs of the MCI group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Further correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between hMST_R&amp;amp;ndash;Premotor_R functional connectivity and BBS score (r = 0.364, p = 0.004). The decline in balance ability and increase in fall risk in patients with MCI may be closely related to the change in the internal connection mode of the corticocortical vestibular network.</p>

	<p>Background: Monitoring the depth of anesthesia by electroencephalogram (EEG) based on the prefrontal cortex is an important means to achieve accurate regulation of anesthesia for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) under general anesthesia in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). However, no previous study has conducted an in-depth investigation into this monitoring data. Here, we aimed to analyze the characteristics of prefrontal cortex EEG during DBS with propofol general anesthesia in patients with PD and determine the reference range of parameters derived from the depth of anesthesia monitoring. Additionally, we attempted to explore whether the use of benzodiazepines in the 3 days during hospitalization before surgery impacted the interpretation of the EEG parameters. Materials and Methods: We included the data of 43 patients with PD who received STN DBS treatment and SedLine monitoring during the entire course of general anesthesia with propofol in a single center. Eighteen patients (41.86%) took benzodiazepines during hospitalization. We divided the anesthesia process into three stages: awake state before anesthesia, propofol anesthesia state, and shallow anesthesia state during microelectrode recording (MER). We analyzed the power spectral density (PSD) and derived parameters of the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; prefrontal EEG, including the patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF) of the left and right sides, and the suppression ratio. The baseline characteristics, preoperative medication, preoperative frontal lobe image characteristics, preoperative motor and non-motor evaluation, intraoperative vital signs, internal environment and anesthetic information, and postoperative complications are listed. We also compared the groups according to whether they took benzodiazepines before surgery during hospitalization. Results: The average PSI of the awake state, propofol anesthesia state, and MER state were 89.86 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.89, 48.68 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.65, and 62.46 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.08, respectively. The preoperative administration of benzodiazepines did not significantly affect the PSI or SEF, but did reduce the total time of suppression, maximum suppression ratio, and the PSD of beta and gamma during MER. Regarding the occurrence of postoperative delirium and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi-square test, p = 0.48; Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test, p = 0.30). Conclusion: For the first time, we demonstrate the reference range of the derived parameters of the depth of anesthesia monitoring and the characteristics of the prefrontal EEG of patients with PD in the awake state, propofol anesthesia state, and shallow anesthesia during MER. Taking benzodiazepines in the 3 days during hospitalization before surgery reduces suppression and the PSD of beta and gamma during MER, but does not significantly affect the observation of anesthesiologists on the depth of anesthesia, nor affect the postoperative delirium and MMSE scores.</p>

	<p>The investigation of the perception of others&amp;amp;rsquo; actions and underlying neural mechanisms has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive stimulus set covering the human behavioral repertoire. To fill this void, we present a video set showing 100 human actions recorded in natural settings, covering the human repertoire except for emotion-driven (e.g., sexual) actions and those involving implements (e.g., tools). We validated the set using fMRI and showed that observation of the 100 actions activated the well-established action observation network. We also quantified the videos&amp;amp;rsquo; low-level visual features (luminance, optic flow, and edges). Thus, this comprehensive video set is a valuable resource for perceptual and neuronal studies.</p>

	<p>Cholinergic muscarinic stimulation of vast areas of the limbic brain induced a well-documented polydipsia in laboratory rats. This excessive water-drinking behavior has not received any convincing biological and physiological interpretation for the last 50 years. This review offers such an interpretation and suggests that cholinergically induced drinking response, mostly by carbachol, is associated with activation of the ascending mesolimbic cholinergic system that serves for initiation of emotional aversive arousal of the organism. The ascending cholinergic system originates from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, has a diffuse nature, and affects numerous subcortical limbic structures. It is proposed that the carbachol-induced drinking response is related to the state of anxiety and does not serve the regulation of thirst. Instead, the response is anxiety-induced polydipsia that might occur as a soothing procedure that decreases the aversiveness of the negative emotional state induced by carbachol. It is concluded that carbachol-induced water-drinking behavior is a rewarding process that contributes to alleviating the feeling of anxiety by bringing some relief from the cholinergically induced aversive state, and it is a homologue to anxiety-driven polydipsia in humans.</p>

	<p>Background: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective method for treating Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). However, safety of STN-DBS treating PD patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidity is rarely focused and reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of STN-DBS treating PD patients with CVD comorbidity. Methods: We retrospectively included PD patients with CVD comorbidity who underwent STN-DBS under general anesthesia in our center from January 2019 to January 2021. Patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s PD symptoms and cardiopulmonary function were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) before surgery. Post-operative clinical outcome and complications were collected until 1-year follow-up. Results: A total of 38 patients (26 men/12 women) of mean body mass index (BMI) 24.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.11 kg/m2, with different CVD comorbidity were finally speculated in the study. These CVD include mainly hypertension, coronary artery disease, thoracic aortic aneurysm, heart valve replacement, pacemaker implantation, atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, and so on. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 38 patients at admission day, pre-operation day, and discharge day timepoint was 135.63 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.08 mmHg, 137.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.26 mmHg, and 126.87 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.36 mmHg, respectively. This showed that blood pressure was controlled well under stable and normal state. The indicators of myocardial infarction Troponin T (Tn T-T) levels at pre-operation, 1 day and 7 days after operation timepoint were 0.014 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.011 ng/mL, 0.015 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.011 ng/mL, and 0.014 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.008 ng/mL, showing no significant fluctuation (F = 0.038, p = 0.962). STN-DBS improved PD patients&amp;amp;rsquo; UPDRS III scores by 51.38% (t = 12.33, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) at 1-year follow-up compared with pre-operative baseline. A total of 11 adverse events were recorded until 1-year follow-up. No obvious cardiovascular complications such as intracranial hematoma or clot-related events occurred within 1 year after surgery except 1 case of hematuria. Conclusions: STN-DBS under general anesthesia is safe and effective for treating PD patients with CVD comorbidity. Our clinical experience and protocol of the MDT offers comprehensive perioperative evaluation for DBS surgery and mitigates bleeding and cardiovascular-associated events in PD patients with CVD comorbidity.</p>

	<p>Approximately two-thirds of stroke survivors experience chronic upper-limb paresis; however, treatment options are limited. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can enhance motor function recovery in stroke survivors, but its efficacy is controversial. We compared the efficacy of stimulating different targets in 10 chronic stroke patients with severe upper-limb motor impairment. Motor imagery-based brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface training augmented with virtual reality was used to induce neural activity in the brain region during an imagery task. Participants were then randomly assigned to two groups: an experimental group (received high-frequency rTMS delivered to the brain region activated earlier) and a comparison group (received low-frequency rTMS delivered to the contralesional primary motor cortex). Behavioural metrics and diffusion tensor imaging were compared pre- and post rTMS. After the intervention, participants in both groups improved somewhat. This preliminary study indicates that in chronic stroke patients with severe upper-limb motor impairment, inducing activation in specific brain regions during motor imagery tasks and selecting these regions as a target is feasible. Further studies are needed to explore the efficacy of this intervention.</p>

	<p>Why do neurons communicate through spikes? By definition, spikes are all-or-none neural events which occur at continuous times. In other words, spikes are on one side binary, existing or not without further details, and on the other, can occur at any asynchronous time, without the need for a centralized clock. This stands in stark contrast to the analog representation of values and the discretized timing classically used in digital processing and at the base of modern-day neural networks. As neural systems almost systematically use this so-called event-based representation in the living world, a better understanding of this phenomenon remains a fundamental challenge in neurobiology in order to better interpret the profusion of recorded data. With the growing need for intelligent embedded systems, it also emerges as a new computing paradigm to enable the efficient operation of a new class of sensors and event-based computers, called neuromorphic, which could enable significant gains in computation time and energy consumption&amp;amp;mdash;a major societal issue in the era of the digital economy and global warming. In this review paper, we provide evidence from biology, theory and engineering that the precise timing of spikes plays a crucial role in our understanding of the efficiency of neural networks.</p>

	<p>What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area (left BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (left medial BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of left BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of left medial BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.</p>

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in school-age children. Although it has been well documented that children with ADHD are associated with impairment of executive functions including working memory (WM) and inhibitory control, there is not yet a consensus as to the relationship between ADHD and memory-driven attentional capture (i.e., representations in WM bias attention toward the WM-matched distractors). The present study herein examined whether children with ADHD have sufficient cognitive control to modulate memory-driven attentional capture. 73 school-age children (36 with ADHD and 37 matched typically developing (TD) children) were instructed to perform a visual search task while actively maintaining an item in WM. In such a paradigm, the modality and the validity of the memory sample were manipulated. The results showed that under the visual WM encoding condition, no memory-driven attentional capture was observed in TD children, but significant capture was found in children with ADHD. In addition, under the audiovisual WM encoding condition, memory-matched distractors did not capture the attention of both groups. The results indicate a deficit of cognitive control over memory-driven attentional capture in children with ADHD, which can be improved by multisensory WM encoding. These findings enrich the relationship between ADHD and cognitive control and provide new insight into the influence of cross-modal processing on attentional guidance.</p>
