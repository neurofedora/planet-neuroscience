              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of BiP as a CB1 Receptor-Interacting Protein That Fine-Tunes Cannabinoid Signaling in the Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cannabinoids, the bioactive constituents of cannabis, exert a wide array of effects on the brain by engaging Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<SUB>1</SUB>R). Accruing evidence supports that cannabinoid action relies on context-dependent factors, such as the biological characteristics of the target cell, suggesting that cell population-intrinsic molecular cues modulate CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-dependent signaling. Here, by using a yeast two-hybrid-based high-throughput screening, we identified BiP as a potential CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-interacting protein. We next found that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R and BiP interact specifically <I>in vitro</I>, and mapped the interaction site within the CB<SUB>1</SUB>R <I>C</I>-terminal (intracellular) domain and the BiP <I>C</I>-terminal (substrate-binding) domain-&alpha;. BiP selectively shaped agonist-evoked CB<SUB>1</SUB>R signaling by blocking an "alternative" G<SUB>q/11</SUB> protein-dependent signaling module while leaving the "classical" G<SUB>i/o</SUB> protein-dependent inhibition of the cAMP pathway unaffected. <I>In situ</I> proximity ligation assays conducted on brain samples from various genetic mouse models of conditional loss or gain of CB<SUB>1</SUB>R expression allowed to map CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes selectively on terminals of GABAergic neurons. Behavioral studies using cannabinoid-treated male BiP<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice supported that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes modulate cannabinoid-evoked anxiety, one of the most frequent undesired effects of cannabis. Together, by identifying BiP as a CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-interacting protein that controls receptor function in a signaling pathway- and neuron population-selective manner, our findings may help to understand the striking context-dependent actions of cannabis in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cannabis use is increasing worldwide, so innovative studies aimed to understand its complex mechanism of neurobiological action are warranted. Here, we found that cannabinoid CB<SUB>1</SUB> receptor (CB<SUB>1</SUB>R), the primary molecular target of the bioactive constituents of cannabis, interacts specifically with an intracellular protein called BiP. The interaction between CB<SUB>1</SUB>R and BiP occurs selectively on terminals of GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons, and induces a remarkable shift in the CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-associated signaling profile. Behavioral studies conducted in mice support that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes act as fine-tuners of anxiety, one of the most frequent undesired effects of cannabis use. Our findings open a new conceptual framework to understand the striking context-dependent pharmacological actions of cannabis in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Subpopulation of Microglia Generated in the Adult Mouse Brain Originates from Prominin-1-Expressing Progenitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Microglia maintain brain health and play important roles in disease and injury. Despite the known ability of microglia to proliferate, the precise nature of the population or populations capable of generating new microglia in the adult brain remains controversial. We identified Prominin-1 (Prom1; also known as CD133) as a putative cell surface marker of committed brain myeloid progenitor cells. We demonstrate that Prom1-expressing cells isolated from mixed cortical cultures will generate new microglia <I>in vitro</I>. To determine whether Prom1-expressing cells generate new microglia <I>in vivo</I>, we used tamoxifen inducible fate mapping in male and female mice. Induction of Cre recombinase activity at 10 weeks in Prom1-expressing cells leads to the expression of TdTomato in all Prom1-expressing progenitors and newly generated daughter cells. We observed a population of new TdTomato-expressing microglia at 6 months of age that increased in size at 9 months. When microglia proliferation was induced using a transient ischemia/reperfusion paradigm, little proliferation from the Prom1-expressing progenitors was observed with the majority of new microglia derived from Prom1-negative cells. Together, these findings reveal that Prom1-expressing myeloid progenitor cells contribute to the generation of new microglia both <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate the existence of an undifferentiated myeloid progenitor population in the adult mouse brain that expresses Prom1. We conclude that Prom1-expressing myeloid progenitors contribute to new microglia genesis in the uninjured brain but not in response to ischemia/reperfusion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, can divide to slowly generate new microglia throughout life. Newly generated microglia may influence inflammatory responses to injury or neurodegeneration. However, the origins of the new microglia in the brain have been controversial. Our research demonstrates that some newly born microglia in a healthy brain are derived from cells that express the stem cell marker Prominin-1. This is the first time Prominin-1 cells are shown to generate microglia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oligodendrocyte HCN2 Channels Regulate Myelin Sheath Length</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oligodendrocytes generate myelin sheaths vital for the formation, health, and function of the CNS. Myelin sheath length is a key property that determines axonal conduction velocity and is known to be variable across the CNS. Myelin sheath length can be modified by neuronal activity, suggesting that dynamic regulation of sheath length might contribute to the functional plasticity of neural circuits. Although the mechanisms that establish and refine myelin sheath length are important determinants of brain function, our understanding of these remains limited. In recent years, the membranes of myelin sheaths have been increasingly recognized to contain ion channels and transporters that are associated with specific important oligodendrocyte functions, including metabolic support of axons and the regulation of ion homeostasis, but none have been shown to influence sheath architecture. In this study, we determined that hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, typically associated with neuronal and cardiac excitability, regulate myelin sheath length. Using both <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> approaches, we show that oligodendrocytes abundantly express functional, predominantly HCN2 subunit-containing ion channels. These HCN ion channels retain key pharmacological and biophysical features and regulate the resting membrane potential of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Further, reduction of their function via pharmacological blockade or generation of transgenic mice with two independent oligodendrocyte-specific HCN2 knock-out strategies reduced myelin sheath length. We conclude that HCN2 ion channels are key determinants of myelin sheath length in the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin sheath length is a critical determinant of axonal conduction velocity, but the signaling mechanisms responsible for determining sheath length are poorly understood. Here we find that oligodendrocytes express functional hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated 2 (HCN2) ion channels that regulate the length of myelin sheaths formed by oligodendrocytes in myelinating cultures and in the mouse brain and spinal cord. These results suggest that the regulation of HCN2 channel activity is well placed to refine sheath length and conduction along myelinated axons, providing a potential mechanism for alterations in conduction velocity and circuit function in response to axonal signals such as those generated by increased activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{mu}-Opioid Receptor (Oprm1) Copy Number Influences Nucleus Accumbens Microcircuitry and Reciprocal Social Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>The &mu;-opioid receptor regulates reward derived from both drug use and natural experiences, including social interaction, through actions in the nucleus accumbens. Here, we studied nucleus accumbens microcircuitry and social behavior in male and female mice with heterozygous genetic knockout of the &mu;-opioid receptor (Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup>). This genetic condition models the partial reduction of &mu;-opioid receptor signaling reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders. We first analyzed inhibitory synapses in the nucleus accumbens, using methods that differentiate between medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. Inhibitory synaptic transmission was increased in D2-MSNs of male mutants, but not female mutants, while the expression of gephyrin mRNA and the density of inhibitory synaptic puncta at the cell body of D2-MSNs was increased in mutants of both sexes. Some of these changes were more robust in Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mutants than Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants, demonstrating that partial reductions of &mu;-opioid signaling can have large effects. At the behavioral level, social conditioned place preference and reciprocal social interaction were diminished in Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> and Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants of both sexes. Interaction with Oprm1 mutants also altered the social behavior of wild-type test partners. We corroborated this latter result using a social preference task, in which wild-type mice preferred interactions with another typical mouse over Oprm1 mutants. Surprisingly, Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice preferred interactions with other Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants, although these interactions did not produce a conditioned place preference. Our results support a role for partial dysregulation of &mu;-opioid signaling in social deficits associated with neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activation of the &mu;-opioid receptor plays a key role in the expression of normal social behaviors. In this study, we examined brain function and social behavior of female and male mice, with either partial or complete genetic deletion of &mu;-opioid receptor expression. We observed abnormal social behavior following both genetic manipulations, as well as changes in the structure and function of synaptic input to a specific population of neurons in the nucleus accumbens, which is an important brain region for social behavior. Synaptic changes were most robust when &mu;-opioid receptor expression was only partially lost, indicating that small reductions in &mu;-opioid receptor signaling can have a large impact on brain function and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneous Multimodal Neural Transmission Suggests That Adult Spinal Networks Maintain an Intrinsic State of Readiness to Execute Sensorimotor Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spontaneous action potential discharge (spAP) is both ubiquitous and functionally relevant during neural development. spAP remains a prominent feature of supraspinal networks in maturity, even during unconsciousness. Evidence suggests that spAP persists in mature spinal networks during wakefulness, and one function of spAP in this context could be maintenance of a "ready state" to execute behaviors. The extent to which spAP persists in mature spinal networks during unconsciousness remains unclear, and its function(s), if any, are likewise unresolved. Here, we attempt to reconcile some of the questions and contradictions that emerge from the disintegrated picture of adult spinal spAP currently available. We recorded simultaneously from large populations of spinal interneurons <I>in vivo</I> in male rats, characterizing the spatial distribution of spAP in the lumbar enlargement and identifying subgroups of spontaneously active neurons. We find (1) concurrent spAP throughout the dorsoventral extent of the gray matter, with a diverse yet strikingly consistent mixture of neuron types across laminae; (2) the proportion of neurons exhibiting spAP in deeper, sensorimotor integrative regions is comparable to that in more superficial, sensory-dominant regions; (3) firing rate, but not spike train variability, varies systematically with region; and (4) spAP includes multimodal neural transmission consistent with executing a spinally-mediated behavior. These findings suggest that adult spAP may continue to support a state of readiness to execute sensorimotor behaviors even during unconsciousness. Such functionality has implications for our understanding of how perception is translated into action, of experience-dependent modification of behavior, and (mal)adaptative responses to injury or disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons often discharge action potentials (APs) seemingly spontaneously, that is, in the absence of ongoing behaviors or overt stimuli. This phenomenon is particularly evident during neural development, where spontaneous AP discharge (spAP) is ubiquitous in the central nervous system and is crucial to establishing connectivity among functionally related groups of neurons. The function(s) of spAP in adult spinal networks, if any, have remained enigmatic, especially during unconsciousness. Here, we report evidence that one such function could be to support an intrinsic state of readiness to execute sensorimotor behaviors. This finding has implications for our understanding of how perception is translated into action, of experience-dependent modification of behavior, and (mal)adaptative responses to injury or disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency Selectivity of Persistent Cortical Oscillatory Responses to Auditory Rhythmic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical oscillations have been proposed to play a functional role in speech and music perception, attentional selection, and working memory, via the mechanism of neural entrainment. One of the properties of neural entrainment that is often taken for granted is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. We tested the existence of this phenomenon by studying cortical neural oscillations during and after presentation of melodic stimuli in a passive perception paradigm. Melodies were composed of ~60 and ~80 Hz tones embedded in a 2.5 Hz stream. Using intracranial and surface recordings in male and female humans, we reveal persistent oscillatory activity in the high- band in response to the tones throughout the cortex, well beyond auditory regions. By contrast, in response to the 2.5 Hz stream, no persistent activity in any frequency band was observed. We further show that our data are well captured by a model of damped harmonic oscillator and can be classified into three classes of neural dynamics, with distinct damping properties and eigenfrequencies. This model provides a mechanistic and quantitative explanation of the frequency selectivity of auditory neural entrainment in the human cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been proposed that the functional role of cortical oscillations is subtended by a mechanism of entrainment, the synchronization in phase or amplitude of neural oscillations to a periodic stimulation. One of the properties of neural entrainment that is often taken for granted is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. Using intracranial and surface recordings of humans passively listening to rhythmic auditory stimuli, we reveal consistent oscillatory responses throughout the cortex, with persistent activity of high- oscillations. On the contrary, neural oscillations do not outlast low-frequency acoustic dynamics. We interpret our results as reflecting harmonic oscillator properties, a model ubiquitous in physics but rarely used in neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">History Modulates Early Sensory Processing of Salient Distractors</a></h4>

              
                <p>To find important objects, we must focus on our goals, ignore distractions, and take our changing environment into account. This is formalized in models of visual search whereby goal-driven, stimulus-driven, and history-driven factors are integrated into a priority map that guides attention. Stimulus history robustly influences where attention is allocated even when the physical stimulus is the same: when a salient distractor is repeated over time, it captures attention less effectively. A key open question is how we come to ignore salient distractors when they are repeated. Goal-driven accounts propose that we use an active, expectation-driven mechanism to attenuate the distractor signal (e.g., predictive coding), whereas stimulus-driven accounts propose that the distractor signal is attenuated because of passive changes to neural activity and inter-item competition (e.g., adaptation). To test these competing accounts, we measured item-specific fMRI responses in human visual cortex during a visual search task where trial history was manipulated (colors unpredictably switched or were repeated). Consistent with a stimulus-driven account of history-based distractor suppression, we found that repeated singleton distractors were suppressed starting in V1, and distractor suppression did not increase in later visual areas. In contrast, we observed signatures of goal-driven target enhancement that were absent in V1, increased across visual areas, and were not modulated by stimulus history. Our data suggest that stimulus history does not alter goal-driven expectations, but rather modulates canonically stimulus-driven sensory responses to contribute to a temporally integrated representation of priority.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual search refers to our ability to find what we are looking for in a cluttered visual world (e.g., finding your keys). To perform visual search, we must integrate information about our goals (e.g., "find the red keychain"), the environment (e.g., salient items capture your attention), and changes to the environment (i.e., stimulus history). Although stimulus history impacts behavior, the neural mechanisms that mediate history-driven effects remain debated. Here, we leveraged fMRI and multivariate analysis techniques to measure history-driven changes to the neural representation of items during visual search. We found that stimulus history influenced the representation of a salient "pop-out" distractor starting in V1, suggesting that stimulus history operates via modulations of early sensory processing rather than goal-driven expectations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Processing of Arithmetic and Simple Sentences in an Auditory Attention Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical processing of arithmetic and of language rely on both shared and task-specific neural mechanisms, which should also be dissociable from the particular sensory modality used to probe them. Here, spoken arithmetical and non-mathematical statements were employed to investigate neural processing of arithmetic, compared with general language processing, in an attention-modulated cocktail party paradigm. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded from 22 human subjects listening to audio mixtures of spoken sentences and arithmetic equations while selectively attending to one of the two speech streams. Short sentences and simple equations were presented diotically at fixed and distinct word/symbol and sentence/equation rates. Critically, this allowed neural responses to acoustics, words, and symbols to be dissociated from responses to sentences and equations. Indeed, the simultaneous neural processing of the acoustics of words and symbols was observed in auditory cortex for both streams. Neural responses to sentences and equations, however, were predominantly to the attended stream, originating primarily from left temporal, and parietal areas, respectively. Additionally, these neural responses were correlated with behavioral performance in a deviant detection task. Source-localized temporal response functions (TRFs) revealed distinct cortical dynamics of responses to sentences in left temporal areas and equations in bilateral temporal, parietal, and motor areas. Finally, the target of attention could be decoded from MEG responses, especially in left superior parietal areas. In short, the neural responses to arithmetic and language are especially well segregated during the cocktail party paradigm, and the correlation with behavior suggests that they may be linked to successful comprehension or calculation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural processing of arithmetic relies on dedicated, modality independent cortical networks that are distinct from those underlying language processing. Using a simultaneous cocktail party listening paradigm, we found that these separate networks segregate naturally when listeners selectively attend to one type over the other. Neural responses in the left temporal lobe were observed for both spoken sentences and equations, but the latter additionally showed bilateral parietal activity consistent with arithmetic processing. Critically, these responses were modulated by selective attention and correlated with task behavior, consistent with reflecting high-level processing for speech comprehension or correct calculations. The response dynamics show task-related differences that were used to reliably decode the attentional target of sentences or equations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">VTA and Anterior Hippocampus Target Dissociable Neocortical Networks for Post-Novelty Enhancements</a></h4>

              
                <p>The detection of novelty indicates changes in the environment and the need to update existing representations. In response to novelty, interactions across the VTA-hippocampal circuit support experience-dependent plasticity in the hippocampus. While theories have broadly suggested plasticity-related changes are also instantiated in the cortex, research has also shown evidence for functional heterogeneity in cortical networks. It therefore remains unclear how the hippocampal-VTA circuit engages cortical networks, and whether novelty targets specific cortical regions or diffuse, large-scale cortical networks. To adjudicate the role of the VTA and hippocampus in cortical network plasticity, we used fMRI to compare resting-state functional coupling before and following exposure to novel scene images in human subjects of both sexes. Functional coupling between right anterior hippocampus and VTA was enhanced following novelty exposure. However, we also found evidence for a double dissociation, with anterior hippocampus and VTA showing distinct patterns of post-novelty functional coupling enhancements, targeting task-relevant regions versus large-scale networks, respectively. Further, significant correlations between these networks and the novelty-related plasticity in the anterior hippocampal-VTA functional network suggest that the central hippocampal-VTA network may facilitate the interactions with the cortex. These findings support an extended model of novelty-induced plasticity, in which novelty elicits plasticity-related changes in both local and global cortical networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Novelty detection is critical for adaptive behavior, signaling the need to update existing representations. By engaging the bidirectional hippocampal-VTA circuit, novelty has been shown to induce plasticity-related changes in the hippocampus. However, it remains an open question how novelty targets such plasticity-related changes in cortical networks. We show that anterior hippocampus and VTA target cortical networks at different spatial scales, with respective enhancements in post-novelty functional coupling with a task-relevant cortical region and a large-scale memory network. The results presented here support an extended model of novelty-related plasticity, in which engaging the anterior hippocampal-VTA circuit through novelty exposure propagates cortical plasticity through hippocampal and VTA functional pathways at distinct scales, targeting specific or diffuse cortical networks.</p>

Cell ensembles in the DLS, but not the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), exhibit a burst of firing at the start of a well-learned action sequence ("task-bracketing"). However, it is currently unclear what information is contained in these bursts. Some theories suggest that these bursts should represent the procedural action sequence itself (that they should be about future action chains), whereas others suggest that they should contain representations of the current state of the world, taking into account primarily past information. In addition, the DLS local field potential shows transient bursts of power in the 50 Hz range (50) around the time a learned action sequence is initiated. However, it is currently unknown how bursts of activity in DLS cell ensembles and bursts of 50 power in the DLS local field potential are related to each other. We found that DLS bursts at lap initiation in rats represented recently experienced reward locations more than future procedural actions, indicating that task-initiation DLS bursts contain primarily retrospective, rather than prospective, information to guide procedural actions. Furthermore, representations of past reward locations increased during periods of increased 50 power in the DLS. There was no evidence of task-initiation bursts, increased 50 power, or retrospective reward location information in the neighboring dorsomedial striatum. These data support a role for the DLS in model-free theories of procedural decision-making over planned action-chain theories, suggesting that procedural actions derive from representations of the current and recent past.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While it is well-established that the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) plays a critical role in procedural decision-making, open questions remain about the kinds of representations contained in DLS ensemble activity that guide procedural actions. We found that DLS, but not DMS, cell ensembles contained nonlocal representations of past reward locations that appear moments before task-initiation DLS bursts. These retrospective representations were temporally linked to a rise in 50 power that also preceded the characteristic DLS burst at task-initiation. These results support models of procedural decision-making based on associations between available actions and the current state of the world over models based on planning over action-chains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Role of Inferior Frontal Junction (IFJ) in the Control of Feature versus Spatial Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Feature-based visual attention refers to preferential selection and processing of visual stimuli based on their nonspatial attributes, such as color or shape. Recent studies have highlighted the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) as a control region for feature but not spatial attention. However, the extent to which IFJ contributes to spatial versus feature attention control remains a topic of debate. We investigated in humans of both sexes the role of IFJ in the control of feature versus spatial attention in a cued visual spatial (attend-left or attend-right) and feature (attend-red or attend-green) attention task using fMRI. Analyzing cue-related fMRI using both univariate activation and multivoxel pattern analysis, we found the following results in IFJ. First, in line with some prior studies, the univariate activations were not different between feature and spatial attentional control. Second, in contrast, the multivoxel pattern analysis decoding accuracy was above chance level for feature attention (attend-red vs attend-green) but not for spatial attention (attend-left vs attend-right). Third, while the decoding accuracy for feature attention was above chance level during attentional control in the cue-to-target interval, it was not during target processing. Fourth, the right IFJ and visual cortex (V4) were observed to be functionally connected during feature but not during spatial attention control, and this functional connectivity was positively associated with subsequent attentional selection of targets in V4, as well as with behavioral performance. These results support a model in which IFJ plays a crucial role in top-down control of visual feature but not visual spatial attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Past work has shown that the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), a prefrontal structure, is activated by both attention-to-feature (e.g., color) and attention-to-location, but the precise role of IFJ in the control of feature- versus spatial-attention is debated. We investigated this issue in a cued visual spatial (attend-left or attend-right) and feature (attend-red or attend-green) attention task using fMRI, multivoxel pattern analysis, and functional connectivity methods. The results show that (1) attend-red versus attend-green can be decoded in single-trial cue-evoked BOLD activity in IFJ but not attend-left versus attend-right and (2) only right IFJ modulates V4 to enhance task performance. This study sheds light on the function and hemispheric specialization of IFJ in the control of visual attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anterior Cingulate Cortex Ablation Disrupts Affective Vigor and Vigilance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite many observations of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity related to cognition and affect in humans and nonhuman animals, little is known about the causal role of the ACC in psychological processes. Here, we investigate the causal role of the ACC in affective responding to threat in rhesus monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>), a species with an ACC largely homologous to humans in structure and connectivity. Male adult monkeys received bilateral ibotenate axon-sparing lesions to the ACC (sulcus and gyrus of areas 24, 32, and 25) and were tested in two classic tasks of monkey threat processing: the human intruder and object responsiveness tasks. Monkeys with ACC lesions did not significantly differ from controls in their overall mean reactivity toward threatening or novel stimuli. However, while control monkeys maintained their reactivity across test days, monkeys with ACC lesions reduced their reactivity toward stimuli as days advanced. Critically, this attenuated reactivity was found even when the stimuli presented each day were novel, suggesting that ACC lesions did not simply cause accelerated adaptation to stimuli as they became less novel over repeated presentations. Rather, these results imply that the primate ACC is necessary for maintaining appropriate affective responses toward potentially harmful and/or novel stimuli. These findings therefore have implications for mood disorders in which responding to threat and novelty is disrupted.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decades of research in humans and nonhuman animals have investigated the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in a huge number and variety of psychological processes spanning cognition and affect, as well as in psychological and neurologic diseases. The structure is broadly implicated in psychological processes and mental and neurologic health, yet its causal role in these processes has largely gone untested, particularly in primates. Here we demonstrate that when anterior cingulate cortex is completely eliminated, rhesus monkeys are initially responsive to threats, but these responses attenuate rather than persist, resembling a pattern of behavior commonly seen in patients diagnosed with mood disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">C-Boutons and Their Influence on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease with progressive motor neuron death, where patients usually die within 5 years of diagnosis. Previously, we showed that the C-boutons, which are large cholinergic synapses to motor neurons that modulate motor neuron activity, are necessary for behavioral compensation in <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice, a mouse model for ALS. We reasoned that, since the C-boutons likely increase the excitability of surviving motor neurons to compensate for motor neuron loss during ALS disease progression, then amplitude modulation through the C-boutons likely increases motor neuron stress and worsens disease progression. By comparing male and female <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice to <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice with genetically silenced C-boutons [<I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I>; <I>Dbx1::cre</I>; <I>ChAT<sup>fl/fl</sup></I> (<I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>/C<sup>off</sup></I>)], we show that the C-boutons do not influence the humane end point of <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice; however, our histologic analysis shows that C-bouton silencing significantly improves fast-twitch muscle innervation over time. Using immunohistology, we also show that the C-boutons are active in a task-dependent manner, and that symptomatic <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice show significantly higher C-bouton activity than wild-type mice during low-intensity walking. Last, by using behavioral analysis, we provide evidence that C-bouton silencing in combination with swimming is beneficial for the behavioral capabilities of <I>mSOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice. Our observations suggest that manipulating the C-boutons in combination with a modulatory-targeted training program may therefore be beneficial for ALS patients and could result in improved mobility and quality of life.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite decades of research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there have been little improvements in treatments and therapies. We sought to better understand how the activation of C-boutons, which are large cholinergic modulatory synapses on motor neurons, change and affect the disease as it progresses. When these C-boutons are genetically silenced and exercises designed to otherwise activate the C-boutons are frequently performed in ALS model mice, the mice perform better than their untreated counterparts over time. C-bouton-targeted therapies could therefore be beneficial for ALS patients and could result in improved mobility and quality of life.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">University-Industry R&D Alliances – An Exploration of Alliance Capabilities Measures [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alliance capabilities studies have long emerged since the 1990s, focusing mainly on firm-to-firm collaboration. However, research on university-industry alliances only emerged from the 2000s. Alliance capabilities are portrayed as a crucial condition to achieve the targeted collaboration outcomes and sustainable relationships. As most alliance capabilities studies focus on firm-to-firm collaboration, research on university-industry R&D alliance is still scarce. Thus, the measurement items for alliance capabilities in the university-industry R&D context are still under-developed. Thus, to investigate how alliance capabilities affect university-industry R&D performance in Malaysia, the relevant measures must first be defined. This paper intends to properly define the measurement items for alliance capabilities in the context of university-industry R&D alliances. Methodology: The alliance capabilities measures are adapted from various literature to accommodate both university and industry perspectives. In finalizing the measurement, in-depth pre-testing was conducted by five strategic management subject matter experts in ensuring face and content validity. Results: There are three alliance capability dimensions. The first dimension is alliance management capability which includes goal setting, process configuration, alliance structure, coordination, management support, and alliance evaluation. The second dimension is alliance integration capability which incorporates relational capabilities, inter-organizational communication, relational capital, and project team effectiveness. The third is alliance learning capability which measures alliance experience, knowledge articulation, knowledge sharing, knowledge codification, internalization, and relationship learning. Although this study successfully develops a set of measurement items for alliance capabilities in university-industry R&D, further statistical analysis is required to test this scale. Conclusion: To date, quantitative measurement items for alliance capabilities in the context of university-industry R&D alliances are still at the infancy stage. Although the measurements are yet to be statistically analyzed, they can be used as a benchmark for future university-industry R&D alliances studies.

                Background: Mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and their aggravation have been studied extensively in the general population. However, there are few studies on depression in older adults and the few existing results may be contradictory, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with depression in older adults in two coastal regions of Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study uses an analytical cross-sectional design in a population of older adults, who participated in a non-governmental ambulatory social support program in Callao and Ica, two coastal regions of Peru. We administered an on-site structured questionnaire to record sociodemographic data, the Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage to measure depression, and the Barthel Index to assess physical function. In order to determine cognitive impairment as an exclusion criterion, the MEC-30 was used. The association between variables was assessed through contingency tables, using the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI) and the X2 test. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Out of the 244 older adults surveyed, 39% had depressive symptoms, of which 28.3% (n=69) and 10.7% (n=26) were moderately and severely depressive, respectively. The findings significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms were being 76 years old or older [p=0.005, OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29-4.20], not participating in weekly recreational activities [p=0.004, OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.31-3.99] and the presence of comorbidities [p=0.026, OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.29]. Conclusion: There are few studies exploring depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic; this research shows the importance of mental health care in this population and, particularly, of those who are 76 or older because they suffer from comorbid conditions and have interrupted recreational activities.

                Background: Poor milk handling practices due to lack of knowledge or deliberate adulteration compromises the safety of milk and that of the consumer. With the increase of milk vending machines in informal settlements, the knowledge and practices of vendors concerning milk hygiene are critical in determining milk safety. The operation of milk vending machines is guided by strict regulations that aim at ensuring proper practices among milk handlers, but the level of implementation among milk vendors is questionable. This study sought to establish hygienic knowledge and handling practices of vendors operating milk vending machines in Nairobi’s informal settlements of Kibra and Dagoretti North. Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, 37 milk vendors were interviewed at the study setting with the aid of questionnaires. Data was then recorded in datasheets and analyzed using frequencies, correlation, and t-test with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. Results: The mean percentage score for knowledge and practices was 68.83% and 54.05%, respectively. The knowledge and practices of vendors significantly improved with the increase in their level of education (p=0.04 and p=0.02). There was a significantly positive correlation between knowledge and practices (r=0.626, p=0.000). Conclusions: There is a low level of hygienic knowledge and poor practices among vendors operating milk vending machines in the study area. The efforts by the regulator to ensure proper implementation of the regulations was also not sufficient. Training is required to improve the hygienic knowledge and practices of milk vending machine handlers in informal settlements. Frequent inspections should also be carried out in the informal settlements to ensure proper implementation of regulations on the operation of milk vending machines.

                Background Aquaculture systems for giant gourami, Osphronemus goramy Lacepède (1801), have significantly improved fish production yields and food security in Indonesia. However, these systems also cause serious problems in terms of eutrophication in waterbodies. This study analysed the nutrient loading and farm characteristics of giant gourami in floating cages in Lake Maninjau. Method A total of 20 floating cages were used to record these nutrients in feed supply, female and male juvenile fish, dead fish and harvested fish to estimate nutrient loading. Data on the harvested fish, production cycle, stock number and cage capacity were used to estimate the stocking density, feeding rate, feed efficiency, and net fish yield, and the relationship between feed supply and nutrient loading and farm characteristics was analysed by least squares regression methods. Results A total of 20 floating cages released nutrients into waterbodies at an average rate of 236.27±60.44 kg/cycle for C, 84.52±20.86 kg/cycle for N and 8.70±3.63 kg/cycle for P. On average, fish production for each floating cage (±SD) was 1226±282 kg wet weight/cycle, and the net fish yield was 12.63±2.82 kg/m3/cycle. Survival rates ranged from 86.33 to 95.27%/cycle. The production cycles varied from 160 to 175 days with feed conversion ratios between 1.60 and 1.75, feed conversion efficiencies were between 0.58 and 0.63. The production parameters that had strong relationships with the net fish yield were feed supply (r2=0.960), stocking rates (r2=0.924) and feeding rates (r2=0.961). In contrast, the length of the production cycle was not strongly related to the net fish yield (r2=0.187). Conclusion Nutrient loading from the supplied feed was greater than that from the harvested fish, juvenile fish and dead fish. Increasing the net fish yield in floating cages was better predicted by the stocking densities and feeding levels than by the other factors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Physical rehabilitation versus no physical rehabilitation after total hip and knee arthroplasties: Protocol for a pragmatic, randomized, controlled, superiority trial (The DRAW1 trial) [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Following total hip- and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA), post-discharge physical rehabilitation is common practice, but varies significantly regarding content, duration, intensity and mode of delivery. Recent systematic reviews have found home-based rehabilitation to be as good as outpatient rehabilitation in terms of pain and physical function. We therefore wonder if physical rehabilitation “works” at all when compared to no physical rehabilitation after THA and TKA – “no rehabilitation” defined as no prescribed therapeutic rehabilitation exercises. The purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness of home-based telerehabilitation, home-based rehabilitation and no physical rehabilitation following THA and TKA.  Methods: This pragmatic, randomized controlled trial will include 168 patients following discharge after THA or TKA, in Bornholm Denmark. Patients will be randomized into one of the three 6-week rehabilitation strategies: home-based telerehabilitation, home-based rehabilitation or no physical rehabilitation. The trial is designed as a superiority trial to test the hypothesis that rehabilitation (home-based telerehabilitation and home-based rehabilitation) is superior to no physical rehabilitation. The primary outcome will be the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS)/ the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS)-subscale: function of daily living at first follow-up (end of the 6-weeks' intervention). Additional follow-ups are scheduled at 3 and 12 months. Outcome assessors and data analysts are blinded to group allocation. Conclusions: Knowledge about the effectiveness of the three investigated rehabilitation strategies will help guide the future organization of post-discharge rehabilitation after THA and TKA.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Seroprevalence and characterisation of herpes simplex virus from human immunodeficiency virus in samples collected from two provinces in South Africa: a retrospective study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a widely distributed human pathogen that is known for its ulcerative lesions at the infection site. HSV can cause persistent infection in the host that is often followed by a period of latency within the neurons. Considering the high rate of HIV infection in South Africa, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of HSV with a focus to determine the epidemiological association between HSV-DNA and HIV-1 in the population. Methods: A total of 44 sera samples were screened for HSV and HIV-1 using the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA positive samples were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the positivity of both viruses and to further differentiate HSV into HSV-1 and -2. Thereafter, the samples were analysed for relatedness using phylogenetic analysis. Results: Of the 44 samples, 36 (81.8%) were positive for HIV-1, while 35 (79.5%) were positive for HSV when screened with ELISA kits. The PCR results, with the use of type specific primers, showed that 4/35 (11.4%) samples were specific for HSV-1 while 30/35 (85.7%) were specific for HSV-2. Statistical analysis performed using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test showed that there is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 transmission. Conclusions: The prevalence of HSV in the population is high with an increased HSV-2 infection in women. Our study shows that some of the HSV-2 isolates are not related to the clinical isolate SD90e from South Africa, suggesting diversity in HSV-2 viral transmission.

Recent neuroscience studies demonstrate that a deeper understanding of brain function requires a deeper understanding of behavior. Detailed behavioral measurements are now often collected using video cameras, resulting in an increased need for computer vision algorithms that extract useful information from video data. Here we introduce a new video analysis tool that combines the output of supervised pose estimation algorithms (e.g. DeepLabCut) with unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods to produce interpretable, low-dimensional representations of behavioral videos that extract more information than pose estimates alone. We demonstrate this tool by extracting interpretable behavioral features from videos of three different head-fixed mouse preparations, as well as a freely moving mouse in an open field arena, and show how these interpretable features can facilitate downstream behavioral and neural analyses. We also show how the behavioral features produced by our model improve the precision and interpretation of these downstream analyses compared to using the outputs of either fully supervised or fully unsupervised methods alone.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Emergent spatiotemporal population dynamics with cell-length control of synthetic microbial consortia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James J. Winkle, Bhargav R. Karamched, Matthew R. Bennett, William Ott, Krešimir Josić</p>

The increased complexity of synthetic microbial biocircuits highlights the need for distributed cell functionality due to concomitant increases in metabolic and regulatory burdens imposed on single-strain topologies. Distributed systems, however, introduce additional challenges since consortium composition and spatiotemporal dynamics of constituent strains must be robustly controlled to achieve desired circuit behaviors. Here, we address these challenges with a modeling-based investigation of emergent spatiotemporal population dynamics using cell-length control in monolayer, two-strain bacterial consortia. We demonstrate that with dynamic control of a strain’s division length, nematic cell alignment in close-packed monolayers can be destabilized. We find that this destabilization confers an emergent, competitive advantage to smaller-length strains—but by mechanisms that differ depending on the spatial patterns of the population. We used complementary modeling approaches to elucidate underlying mechanisms: an agent-based model to simulate detailed mechanical and signaling interactions between the competing strains, and a reductive, stochastic lattice model to represent cell-cell interactions with a single rotational parameter. Our modeling suggests that spatial strain-fraction oscillations can be generated when cell-length control is coupled to quorum-sensing signaling in negative feedback topologies. Our research employs novel methods of population control and points the way to programming strain fraction dynamics in consortial synthetic biology.

Recurrent neural networks with memory and attention mechanisms are widely used in natural language processing because they can capture short and long term sequential information for diverse tasks. We propose an integrated deep learning model for microbial DNA sequence data, which exploits convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and attention mechanisms to predict taxonomic classifications and sample-associated attributes, such as the relationship between the microbiome and host phenotype, on the read/sequence level. In this paper, we develop this novel deep learning approach and evaluate its application to amplicon sequences. We apply our approach to short DNA reads and full sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) marker genes, which identify the heterogeneity of a microbial community sample. We demonstrate that our implementation of a novel attention-based deep network architecture, Read2Pheno, achieves read-level phenotypic prediction. Training Read2Pheno models will encode sequences (reads) into dense, meaningful representations: learned embedded vectors output from the intermediate layer of the network model, which can provide biological insight when visualized. The attention layer of Read2Pheno models can also automatically identify nucleotide regions in reads/sequences which are particularly informative for classification. As such, this novel approach can avoid pre/post-processing and manual interpretation required with conventional approaches to microbiome sequence classification. We further show, as proof-of-concept, that aggregating read-level information can robustly predict microbial community properties, host phenotype, and taxonomic classification, with performance at least comparable to conventional approaches. An implementation of the attention-based deep learning network is available at https://github.com/EESI/sequence_attention (a python package) and https://github.com/EESI/seq2att (a command line tool).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Incorporating metadata in HIV transmission network reconstruction: A machine learning feasibility assessment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sepideh Mazrouee, Susan J. Little, Joel O. Wertheim</p>

HIV molecular epidemiology estimates the transmission patterns from clustering genetically similar viruses. The process involves connecting genetically similar genotyped viral sequences in the network implying epidemiological transmissions. This technique relies on genotype data which is collected only from HIV diagnosed and in-care populations and leaves many persons with HIV (PWH) who have no access to consistent care out of the tracking process. We use machine learning algorithms to learn the non-linear correlation patterns between patient metadata and transmissions between HIV-positive cases. This enables us to expand the transmission network reconstruction beyond the molecular network. We employed multiple commonly used supervised classification algorithms to analyze the San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium (PIRC) cohort dataset, consisting of genotypes and nearly 80 additional non-genetic features. First, we trained classification models to determine genetically unrelated individuals from related ones. Our results show that random forest and decision tree achieved over 80% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score by only using a subset of meta-features including age, birth sex, sexual orientation, race, transmission category, estimated date of infection, and first viral load date besides genetic data. Additionally, both algorithms achieved approximately 80% sensitivity and specificity. The Area Under Curve (AUC) is reported 97% and 94% for random forest and decision tree classifiers respectively. Next, we extended the models to identify clusters of similar viral sequences. Support vector machine demonstrated one order of magnitude improvement in accuracy of assigning the sequences to the correct cluster compared to dummy uniform random classifier. These results confirm that metadata carries important information about the dynamics of HIV transmission as embedded in transmission clusters. Hence, novel computational approaches are needed to apply the non-trivial knowledge collected from inter-individual genetic information to metadata from PWH in order to expand the estimated transmissions. We note that feature extraction alone will not be effective in identifying patterns of transmission and will result in random clustering of the data, but its utilization in conjunction with genetic data and the right algorithm can contribute to the expansion of the reconstructed network beyond individuals with genetic data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Interplay between the EMT transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2 regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation and hematopoietic lineage fidelity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jueqiong Wang, Carlos Farkas, Aissa Benyoucef, Catherine Carmichael, Katharina Haigh, Nick Wong, Danny Huylebroeck, Marc P. Stemmler, Simone Brabletz, Thomas Brabletz, Christian M. Nefzger, Steven Goossens, Geert Berx, Jose M. Polo, Jody J. Haigh</p>

The ZEB2 transcription factor has been demonstrated to play important roles in hematopoiesis and leukemic transformation. ZEB1 is a close family member of ZEB2 but has remained more enigmatic concerning its roles in hematopoiesis. Here, we show using conditional loss-of-function approaches and bone marrow (BM) reconstitution experiments that ZEB1 plays a cell-autonomous role in hematopoietic lineage differentiation, particularly as a positive regulator of monocyte development in addition to its previously reported important role in T-cell differentiation. Analysis of existing single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of early hematopoiesis has revealed distinctive expression differences between <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i> in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) differentiation, with <i>Zeb2</i> being more highly and broadly expressed than <i>Zeb1</i> except at a key transition point (short-term HSC [ST-HSC]➔MPP1), whereby <i>Zeb1</i> appears to be the dominantly expressed family member. Inducible genetic inactivation of both <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i> using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated approach leads to acute BM failure at this transition point with increased long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cell numbers and an accompanying decrease in all hematopoietic lineage differentiation. Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data has revealed that ZEB2 acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor involved in restraining mature hematopoietic lineage gene expression programs from being expressed too early in HSPCs. ZEB1 appears to fine-tune this repressive role during hematopoiesis to ensure hematopoietic lineage fidelity. Analysis of Rosa26 locus–based transgenic models has revealed that <i>Zeb1</i> as well as <i>Zeb2</i> cDNA-based overexpression within the hematopoietic system can drive extramedullary hematopoiesis/splenomegaly and enhance monocyte development. Finally, inactivation of <i>Zeb2</i> alone or <i>Zeb1/2</i> together was found to enhance survival in secondary MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models attesting to the oncogenic role of ZEB1/2 in AML.

                Objective: To evaluate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration safety and efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a literature search on PubMed/MEDLINE, medRxiv, EBSCOhost/CINAHL, ProQuest, and Scopus with keywords adjusted to each search engine’s specifications on February 12, 2021. Interventional studies that reviewed MSC efficacy (mortality, hospitalization duration, need for mechanical ventilators, and inflammation markers) and/or safety (adverse events) in COVID-19 patients who were 18 years old or more were included in this study. Study eligibility, data extraction, and study quality assessment were conducted independently by each author. Results: A total of five studies of moderate to high quality with a total of 193 patients were included. One of the three randomized studies included did not apply blinding to either participants or medical professionals. Pooled OR (Odd Ratio) for mortality risk, adverse events incidence, and use of mechanical ventilators for patients on MSC therapy were 0.13 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.68], 0.91 [95% CI: 0.45, 1.86], and 0.42 [95% CI: 0.12, 1.47], respectively. Pooled mean difference for hospitalization duration in the MSC group versus the control was -3.54 [CI 95%: -4.68, -2.40] with 7% heterogeneity. All studies agreed that there was an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decrease of anti-inflammatory markers that were statistically different in the MSC group. Conclusion: Mesenchymal stem cell administration to COVID-19 patients is safe and effective in reducing mortality and hospitalization duration. Furthermore, a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed.

                Background: The increase in aged populations in Malaysia has brought unprecedented challenges to families, policy makers, scholars, and business organisations.  This paper adapted the WHO 2007 framework of features of age-friendly cities to examine age-friendly environment constructs and their linkages with social connectedness from the perspective of Malaysian middle-aged and older adults caring for themselves. Methods: A face-to-face cross-sectional survey was conducted on 402 middle-aged and older adults caring for themselves across selected states in west Malaysia, selected via purposive sampling. Firstly, features of age-friendly cities were explored through exploratory factor analysis involving 82 respondents. Subsequently, structural equation modelling was performed, involving 320 respondents. Results: The results indicated that the constructs of an age-friendly environment were built environment, community support and health services, civic participation, and employment as well as communication and information. The structural model provided evidence that implementing age-friendly initiatives relating to built environment, community support and health services, civic participation and employment as well as communication and information enables the ageing population to improve their connectedness with society. These findings supported the ecological theories, agreeing that age-friendly environments help middle-aged and older adults caring for themselves to increase their adaptability and reduce perceived pressure from the environment. This result was in line with the current literature in which an age-friendly environment is a form of support and an enabling environment to cultivate positive social relationships and connectivity. Conclusions: Creating an age-friendly environment that supports active and healthy living for middle-aged and older adults caring for themselves allows them to continue to share their experiences, knowledge, and wisdom. This is helpful and beneficial for societal well-being and economic development as well as for the future generations.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">The nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound</a></h4>

              
                Hearing is thought to exist only in vertebrates and some arthropods, but not other animal phyla. Here, Xu and colleagues report that the earless nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound and engages in phonotaxis. Thus, hearing might have evolved multiple times independently in the animal kingdom, suggesting convergent evolution.

                He et al. find that DREADD-mediated silencing of CA2 decreases the temporal and informational precision of hippocampal replay. Ripples are less coordinated across CA1 and CA3, and cell assemblies show increased co-activity, both in and out of SWRs. CA2 plays a role in filtering information to be reactivated during replay.

                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder without effective disease-modifying therapeutics. Here, we establish a chemogenetic dopamine (DA) neuron ablation model in larval zebrafish with mitochondrial dysfunction and robustness suitable for high-content screening. We use this system to conduct an in vivo DA neuron imaging-based chemical screen and identify the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors as significantly neuroprotective. Knockdown of the angiotensin receptor 1 (<i>agtr1</i>) in DA neurons reveals a cell-autonomous mechanism of neuroprotection. DA neuron-specific RNA-seq identifies mitochondrial pathway gene expression that is significantly restored by RAAS inhibitor treatment. The neuroprotective effect of RAAS inhibitors is further observed in a zebrafish Gaucher disease model and <i>Drosophila pink1</i>-deficient PD model. Finally, examination of clinical data reveals a significant effect of RAAS inhibitors in delaying PD progression. Our findings reveal the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of targeting the RAAS pathway for neuroprotection and demonstrate a salient approach that bridges basic science to translational medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Circadian regulation of vertebrate cone photoreceptor function</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotes generally display a circadian rhythm as an adaption to the reoccurring day/night cycle. This is particularly true for visual physiology that is directly affected by changing light conditions. Here we investigate the influence of the circadian rhythm on the expression and function of visual transduction cascade regulators in diurnal zebrafish and nocturnal mice. We focused on regulators of shut-off kinetics such as <i>recoverins, arrestins, opsin kinases, </i>and<i> GTPase-accelerating protein</i> that have direct effects on temporal vision. Transcript as well as protein levels of most analyzed genes show a robust circadian rhythm dependent regulation, which correlates with changes in photoresponse kinetics. Electroretinography demonstrates that photoresponse recovery in zebrafish is delayed in the evening and accelerated in the morning. This physiological rhythmicity is mirrored in visual behaviors, such as optokinetic and optomotor responses. Functional rhythmicity persists in continuous darkness, it is reversed by an inverted light cycle and disrupted by constant light. This is in line with our finding that orthologous gene transcripts from diurnal zebrafish and nocturnal mice are often expressed in an anti-phasic daily rhythm.

                Introduction Huntingtons disease (HD) is a genetic incurable lethal disease. Biomarkers are needed for objective assessment of disease progression. Evidence supports both complex protein aggregation and astrocyte activation in HD. This study assesses the 42 amino acid long amyloid beta (A{beta}42) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as potential biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HD mutation carriers. Methods CSF was obtained from manifest HD patients (ManHD), premanifest HD-gene-expansion carriers (PreHD) and gene-negative controls (controls). Disease Burden Score (DBS) and Total Functional Capacity (TFC) were calculated. Protein concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and intergroup differences were analysed using Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman correlations were calculated to assess disease stage association. Age-adjustment was included in the statistical tests. Results The study enrolled 27 ManHD and 13 PreHD subjects. The number of controls differed in the analysis of A{beta}42 and GFAP (n = 19, and 8 respectively). A{beta}42 levels were higher in ManHD (mean 741 ng/l, SD 361) compared with PreHD (mean 468 ng/l, SD 184) (p= 0.025). Likewise GFAP concentration was higher in ManHD (mean 435 ng/l, SD 255) compared with both PreHD (mean 266 ng/l, SD 92.4)(p = 0.040) and controls (mean 208 ng/l, SD 83.7)(p = 0.011). GFAP correlated with DBS (r = 0.361, p = 0.028), TFC (r = -0.463, p = 0.005), and 5-year risk of onset in PreHD (r = 0.694, p = 0.008). In contrast, there was no correlation between A{beta}42 concentration and DBS, TFC or 5-year risk of onset. Conclusion CSF A{beta}42 levels did not correlate with disease stage suggesting no A{beta}aggregation in HD. GFAP is a potential biomarker in HD with association to disease stage. Validation in larger HD cohorts and potential correlations with clinical phenotype would be of interest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1 mediates β-amyloid-induced tau mislocalization and synaptotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Pathological interactions between beta-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau drive the synapse loss that underlies neural circuit disruption and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reactive astrocytes, displaying altered functions, are also a prominent feature of AD brain. This large and heterogeneous population of cells are increasingly recognised as contributing to early phases of disease. However, the contribution of astrocytes to A{beta}-tau interactions in AD is not well understood. Here we stimulated mouse and human astrocytes with concentrations and species of human A{beta} that mimic those in human AD brain. Astrocyte conditioned medium was collected and immunodepleted of A{beta} before being added to rodent and human neuron cultures. Cytokines, identified in unbiased screens, were also applied to neurons, including following the pre-treatment of neurons with chemokine receptor antagonists. Tau mislocalisation, synaptic markers and dendritic spine numbers were measured in cultured neurons and organotypic brain slice cultures. Conditioned medium from astrocytes stimulated with A{beta} induced tau mislocalisation and exaggerated synaptotoxicity that is recapitulated following spiking of neuron culture medium with recombinant C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1 (CXCL1), a chemokine we show to be upregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain. Antagonism of neuronal C-X-C motof chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), prevented tau mislocalisation and synaptotoxicity in response to CXCL1 and A{beta}-stimulated astrocyte secretions. Our data indicate that astrocytes exacerbate tau mislocalisation and the synaptotoxic effects of A{beta} via interactions of astrovyctic CXCL1 and the neuronal CXCR2 receptor, highlighting this chemokine-receptor pair as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The 22q11.2 region regulates presynaptic gene-products linked to schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                To study how the 22q11.2 deletion predisposes to psychiatric disease, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from deletion carriers and controls, as well as utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce the heterozygous deletion into a control cell line. Upon differentiation into neural progenitor cells, we found the deletion acted in trans to alter the abundance of transcripts associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder. In more differentiated excitatory neurons, altered transcripts encoded presynaptic factors and were associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia, including common (per-SNP heritability p ({tau}_c)= 4.2 x 10-6) and rare, loss of function variants (p = 1.29x10-12). These findings suggest a potential relationship between cellular states, developmental windows and susceptibility to psychiatric conditions with different ages of onset. To understand how the deletion contributed to these observed changes in gene expression, we developed and applied PPItools, which identifies the minimal protein-protein interaction network that best explains an observed set of gene expression alterations. We found that many of the genes in the 22q11.2 interval interact in presynaptic, proteasome, and JUN/FOS transcriptional pathways that underlie the broader alterations in psychiatric risk gene expression we identified. Our findings suggest that the 22q11.2 deletion impacts genes and pathways that may converge with risk loci implicated by psychiatric genetic studies to influence disease manifestation in each deletion carrier.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of touch neurons underlying dopaminergic pleasurable touch and sexual receptivity</a></h4>

              
                Pleasurable touch during social behavior is the key to building familial bonds and meaningful connections. One form of social touch occurs during sex. Although sexual behavior is initiated in part by touch, and touch is ongoing throughout copulation, the identity and role of sensory neurons that transduce sexual touch remain completely unknown. A population of sensory neurons labeled by the G-protein coupled receptor Mrgprb4 detect stroking touch in mice. Here, we study the social relevance of this population by genetically engineering mice to allow activation or ablation of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons and reveal that these neurons are required for sexual receptivity and sufficient to activate reward circuitry. Even in social isolation, optogenetic stimulation of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons through the back skin is sufficient to induce a conditioned place preference and a striking lordosis-like copulatory posture in females. In the absence of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons, female mice no longer find male mounts rewarding: sexual receptivity is supplanted by aggression and a coincident decline in dopaminergic release in the mesolimbic reward pathway. In addition to sexual behavior, Mrgprb4-lineage neurons are also required for social postures induced by female-to-female back touch. Together, these findings reveal a skin-to-brain circuit encoding the rewarding quality of social touch.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-resolution imaging and manipulation of endogenous AMPA receptor surface mobility during synaptic plasticity and learning</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of synaptic neurotransmitter receptor content is a fundamental mechanism for tuning synaptic efficacy during experience-dependent plasticity and behavioral adaptation. However, experimental approaches to track and modify receptor movements in integrated experimental systems are limited. Exploiting AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) as a model, we generated a knock-in mouse expressing the biotin acceptor peptide (AP) tag on the GluA2 extracellular N-terminus. Cell-specific introduction of biotin ligase allows the use of monovalent or tetravalent avidin variants to respectively monitor or manipulate the surface mobility of endogenous AMPAR containing biotinylated AP-GluA2 in neuronal subsets. AMPAR immobilization precluded the expression of long-term potentiation and formation of contextual fear memory, allowing for target-specific control of the expression of synaptic plasticity and animal behavior. The AP tag knock-in model offers unprecedented access to resolve and control the spatiotemporal dynamics of endogenous receptors, and opens new avenues to study the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Educational Attainment Polygenic Scores, Socioeconomic Factors, and Cortical Structure in Children and Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Genome-wide polygenic scores for educational attainment (PGS-EA) and socioeconomic factors, which are correlated with each other, have been consistently associated with academic achievement and general cognitive ability in children and adolescents. Yet, the independent associations of PGS-EA and socioeconomic factors with specific underlying factors at the neural and neurocognitive levels are not well understood. The goal of this study was to examine the unique contributions of PGS-EA and parental education to cortical thickness (CT), cortical surface area (SA), and neurocognitive skills in children and adolescents. Methods: Participants were typically developing children and adolescents (3-21 years of age; 53% male; N = 391). High-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired. PGS-EA were computed based on the most recent genome-wide association study of educational attainment. Sustained attention, inhibitory control, working memory, vocabulary, and episodic memory were measured. Results: PGS-EA and parental education were independently and significantly associated with SA, vocabulary, and attention outcomes but were not associated with CT. Vertex-wise analyses indicated that higher PGS-EA was significantly associated with greater SA in the left medial orbitofrontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus after accounting for parental education. Higher parental education was significantly associated with greater SA in the left parahippocampal gyrus after accounting for PGS-EA. Conclusions: These findings suggest that education-linked genetics may influence SA, particularly in certain frontal regions, leading to variability in academic achievement. Results suggested genetic confounding in associations between parental education and SA in children and adolescents, with these associations remaining significant after controlling for PGS-EA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring neural correlates of behavioral and academic resilience among children in poverty</a></h4>

              
                Children in poverty must contend with systems that do not meet their needs. We explored what, at a neural level, helps explain children's resilience in these contexts. Lower coupling between lateral frontoparietal network (LFPN) and default mode network (DMN)--linked, respectively, to externally- and internally-directed thought--has previously been associated with better cognitive performance. However, we recently found the opposite pattern for children living in poverty. Here, we investigated trajectories of network coupling over ages 9-13, and their relation to academic achievement and attention problems. Critically, we explored if these relations differed meaningfully between children above and below poverty. In a pre-registered study, we analyzed longitudinal data from the first three yearly timepoints of the ABCD Study (N = 8366 children at baseline; 1303 below poverty). As predicted, higher LFPN-DMN connectivity was linked to worse grades and more attentional problems for children living above poverty, while children below poverty showed the opposite tendencies. Moreover, this interaction between LFPN-DMN connectivity and poverty status at baseline was associated with children's grades one year later, even controlling for baseline grades. Together, these findings suggest that network connectivity is differentially predictive of academic performance and attention problems for children above and below poverty.

	<p>Attachment security priming effects therapeutic change in people with depression and anxiety. Preliminary studies indicate that visualising secure attachment memories also reduces paranoia in non-clinical and clinical groups, probably due to a decrease in cognitive fusion. Benefits to clinical populations depend on the sustainability of these effects and the impact on help-seeking behaviours. The combination of paranoia and an insecure-avoidant attachment style is likely to be a particular barrier to help seeking. We used a longitudinal experimental design to test the impact of repeated attachment priming on paranoia, mood and help-seeking intentions and whether cognitive fusion mediates these effects (pre-registration: https://osf.io/5yebw). Seventy-nine people with high levels of non-clinical paranoia, aged 18–50 years (M = 20.53, SD = 4.57), were randomly assigned to a secure or insecure-avoidant priming condition. Participants rehearsed the visualisation prime on four consecutive days and were assessed on standardised measures of paranoia, positive and negative affect, help-seeking intentions and cognitive fusion. A series of mixed-model analyses of variance showed that security priming decreases paranoia, negative affect and cognitive fusion and increases positive affect and help seeking, compared to insecure-avoidant priming. Examining the impact of primed attachment (rather than measured attachment style) allows us to draw conclusions about the causal processes involved; mediation analyses showed indirect effects of the primes on paranoia and negative affect through cognitive fusion. With a growing understanding of (1) the impact of security priming on paranoia, affect and help-seeking behaviours, (2) causal mechanisms and (3) sustainability of effects, security priming may be developed into a viable intervention for clinical populations.</p>

	<p>Anti-contagion measures restricting individual freedom, such as social distancing and wearing a mask, are crucial to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision-making patterns and attitudes about uncertainty can highly influence the adherence to these restrictive measures. Here we investigated the relationship between risky behavior and individual preferences for immediate vs. delayed reward, as indexed by temporal discounting (TD), as well as the association between these measures and confidence in the future, perceived risk and confidence in the containment measures. These measures were collected through an online survey administered on 353 participants at the end of the more restrictive phase of the first Italian lockdown. The results showed an unexpected inverse relationship between the individual pattern of choice preferences and risky behavior, with an overall greater adherence to containment measures in more discounter participants. These findings were interpreted in terms of a reframing process in which behaviors aimed at protecting oneself from contagion turn into immediate gains rather than losses. Interestingly, an excessive confidence in a better future was correlated with a higher tendency to assume risky behavior, thereby highlighting the downside of an overly and blindly optimistic view.</p>

	<p>Adult rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) related to their affective states, potentially providing information about their subjective experiences during behavioral neuroscience experiments. If so, USVs might provide an important link between invasive animal preclinical studies and human studies in which subjective states can be readily queried. Here, we induced USVs in male and female Long Evans rats using acute amphetamine (2 mg/kg), and asked how reversibly inhibiting nucleus accumbens neurons using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) impacts USV production. We analyzed USV characteristics using “Deepsqueak” software, and manually categorized detected calls into four previously defined subtypes. We found that systemic administration of the DREADD agonist clozapine-n-oxide, relative to vehicle in the same rats, suppressed the number of frequency-modulated and trill-containing USVs without impacting high frequency, unmodulated (flat) USVs, nor the small number of low-frequency USVs observed. Using chemogenetics, these results thus confirm that nucleus accumbens neurons are essential for production of amphetamine-induced frequency-modulated USVs. They also support the premise of further investigating the characteristics and subcategories of these calls as a window into the subjective effects of neural manipulations, with potential future clinical applications.</p>

	<p>Pain management necessitates assessment of pain; the gold standard being self-report. Among individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), self-report may be limited and therefore indirect methods for pain assessment are required. A new, internationally agreed upon and user-friendly observational tool was recently published—the Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition (PAIC-15). The current study’s aims were: to test the use of the PAIC-15 in assessing pain among people with IDD and to translate the PAIC-15 into Arabic for dissemination among Arabic-speaking professionals. Pain behavior following experimental pressure stimuli was analyzed among 30 individuals with IDD and 15 typically developing controls (TDCs). Translation of the PAIC followed the forward–backward approach; and reliability between the two versions and between raters was calculated. Observational scores with the PAIC-15 exhibited a stimulus–response relationship with pressure stimulation. Those of the IDD group were greater than those of the TDC group. The overall agreement between the English and Arabic versions was high (ICC = 0.89); single items exhibited moderate to high agreement levels. Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC = 0.92). Both versions of the PAIC-15 are feasible and reliable tools to record pain behavior in individuals with IDD. Future studies using these tools in clinical settings are warranted.</p>

	<p>West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most common mosquito borne cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. Physical and neuro-cognitive recovery from WNND may be prolonged or incomplete leading to chronic cognitive inefficiencies and functional decline. There continues to be no effective treatment of WNV and current management is primarily supportive. The objective of this review is to evaluate the functional outcomes and role of rehabilitation services in subjects with WNND. The charts of five subjects admitted to an acute inpatient brain injury rehabilitation facility from June to December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. (Mean, Range)-Age (64.8, 43–78 years), Admission Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (45.2, 14–63), Discharge FIM (82.2, 61–100), FIM score gain (37, 24–60), Cognitive FIM gain (7, 1–18), Mobility FIM gain (17.4, 13–20), ADL FIM gain (12.6, 4–23); acute brain injury inpatient rehabilitation facility length of stay (LOS) (17.8, 14–21 days); acute hospital LOS (15, 10–22 days). Of the five subjects, three were discharged home, one was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, and one was discharged to an assisted living facility. Subjects with WNND have significant functional decline across all FIM subcategories and may benefit from a course of brain injury-specific acute inpatient rehabilitation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Analysis of ISLET‐1, NKX2.1, PAX6, and Otp in the forebrain of the sturgeon Acipenser ruthenus identifies conserved prosomeric characteristics</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The distribution patterns of a set of conserved brain developmental regulatory transcription factors were analyzed in the forebrain of the basal actinopterygian fish <i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>, consistent with the prosomeric model. In the telencephalon, the pallium was characterized by ventricular expression of Pax6. In the subpallium, the combined expression of Nkx2.1/Islet-1 (Isl1) allowed to propose ventral and dorsal areas, as the septo-pallidal (Nkx2.1/Isl1+) and striatal derivatives (Isl1+) respectively, and a dorsal portion of the striatal derivatives, ventricularly rich in Pax6 and devoid of Isl1 expression. Dispersed Orthopedia (Otp) cells were found in the supracommissural and posterior nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, related to the medial portion of the amygdaloid complex. The preoptic area was identified by the Nkx2.1/Isl1 expression. In the alar hypothalamus, an Otp-expressing territory, lacking Nkx2.1/Isl1, was identified as the paraventricular domain. The adjacent subparaventricular domain was subdivided in a rostral territory expressing Nkx2.1 and an Isl1+ caudal one. In the basal hypothalamus, the tuberal region was defined by the Nkx2.1/Isl1 expression and a rostral Otp-expressing domain was identified. Moreover, the Otp/Nkx2.1 combination showed an additional zone lacking Isl1, tentatively identified as the mamillary area. In the diencephalon, both Pax6 and Isl1 defined the prethalamic domain, and within the basal prosomere 3 scattered Pax6- and Isl1-expressing cells were observed in the posterior tubercle. Finally, a small group of Pax6 cells was observed in the pretectal area. These results improve the understanding of the forebrain evolution and demonstrate that its basic bauplan is present very early in the vertebrate lineage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Savings in Human Force Field Learning Supported by Feedback Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Savings have been described as the ability of healthy humans to relearn a previously acquired motor skill faster than the first time, which in the context of motor adaptation suggests that the learning rate in the brain could be adjusted when a perturbation is recognized. Alternatively, it has been argued that apparent savings were the consequence of a distinct process that instead of reflecting a change in the learning rate, revealed an explicit re-aiming strategy. Based on recent evidence that feedback adaptation may be central to both planning and control, we hypothesized that this component could genuinely accelerate relearning in human adaptation to force fields (FFs) during reaching. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that on re-exposure to a previously learned FF, the very first movement performed by healthy volunteers in the relearning context was better adapted to the external disturbance, and this occurred without any anticipation or cognitive strategy because the relearning session was started unexpectedly. We conclude that feedback adaptation is a medium by which the nervous system can genuinely accelerate learning across movements.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Contribution of Premotor Cortico-Striatal Projections to the Execution of Serial Order Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Striatal activity is necessary to initiate and execute sequences of actions. The main excitatory input to the striatum comes from the cortex. While it is hypothesized that motor and premotor cortico-striatal projections are important to guide striatal activity during the execution of sequences of actions, technical limitations have made this challenging to address. Here, we implemented a task in mice that allows for the study of different moments to execute a serial order sequence consisting of two subsequences of actions. Using this task, we performed electrophysiological recordings in the premotor (M2) and primary motor (M1) cortices, and state-dependent optogenetic inhibitions of their cortico-striatal projections. We show that while both M2 and M1 contain activity modulations related to the execution of self-paced sequences, mainly, the premotor cortico-striatal projections contribute to the proper execution/structuring of these sequences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Pseudomonas can take a toll on a patient [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an aerobic Gram-negative bacterium that is implicated in the development of severe systemic infections among pediatric patients.  It is identified in hospitalized chronically ill pediatric patients in association with genitourinary, respiratory tract, and skin or soft tissue infections as well as severe and life-threating infection including sepsis.  A variety of immunologic mechanisms play a vital role in the host defense mechanisms against invasive infections with P. aeruginosa. Rarely, specific inborn errors of immune function are implicated in deficiencies that predispose to invasive infections with P. aeruginosa.  Innate immune function including germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their downstream signaling is vital in the host defense against P. aeruginosa through the generation of antimicrobial peptides, cytokines/chemokines, and shaping of adaptive immune responses. Herein, we describe a previously healthy two-year-old female with an invasive skin, soft tissue, and central nervous system infection secondary to P. aeruginosa.  The invasive nature of this infection prompted a careful evaluation for an inborn error of immunity. Decreased cytokine response to agonists of TLRs was documented. Targeted sequencing of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-4 documented a homozygous deletion of exons 8-13 consistent with IRAK-4 deficiency.  This report provides a vital educative message in the existing scientific literature by underscoring the importance of considering inborn errors of immunity in all patients with severe P. aeruginosa infections.  Functional assessments of immune function often in combination with sequencing can accurately assign a diagnosis in a timely fashion allowing for definitive treatment and the use of necessary supportive care.

                Genotyping of single cells using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is a cost-effective technology that provides good coverage and precision, but requires whole genome amplification (WGA) due to the low amount of genetic material. Since WGA introduces noise, we recently developed SureTypeSC, an algorithm to minimize genotyping errors. Here, we present SureTypeSCR, an R package that integrates a state-of-the-art algorithm (SureTypeSC) for noise reduction in single cell genotyping and unites all common parts of genotyping workflow in a single tool. SureTypeSCR is built on top of the tidyverse ecosystem, which facilitates common operations over the data and allows users to create and experiment with the genotyping pipeline. Furthermore, the workflow of SureTypeSCR can also be used for standard genotyping of bulk DNA for batch processing in a single pipeline. SureTypeSCR is avaliable from: https://github.com/Meiomap/SureTypeSCR

                Background: Surgical resection remains the primary curative treatment for intra-cavity cancer. Low physical fitness and psychological factors such as depression are predictive of post–operative morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. Prolonged post-operative morbidity is associated with persistently elevated risk of premature death. We aim to investigate whether a structured, responsive exercise training programme, a psychological support programme or combined exercise and psychological support, delivered between treatment decision and major intra-cavity surgery for cancer, can reduce length of hospital stay, compared with standard care. Methods: WesFit is a pragmatic, 2x2 factorial-design, multi-centre, randomised-controlled trial, with planned recruitment of N=1560. Participants will be randomised to one of four groups. Group 1 (control) will receive usual pre-operative care, Group 2 (exercise) patients will undergo 2/3 aerobic, high-intensity interval training sessions per week supervised by personal trainers. Group 3 (psychological support) patients are offered 1 session per week at a local cancer support centre. Group 4 will receive both exercise and psychological support. All patients undergo baseline and pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing, complete self-report questionnaires and will be followed up at 30 days, 12 weeks and 12 months post-operatively. Primary outcome is post-operative length-of-stay. Secondary outcomes include disability-adjusted survival at 1-year postoperatively, post-operative morbidity, and health-related quality of life. Exploratory investigations include objectively measured changes in physical fitness assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test, disease-free and overall mortality at 1-year postoperatively, longer-term physical activity behaviour change, pre-operative radiological tumour regression, pathological tumour regression, pre and post-operative body composition analysis, health economics analysis and nutritional characterisation and its relationship to post-operative outcome. Conclusions: The WesFit trial will be the first randomised controlled study investigating whether an exercise training programme +/- psychological intervention results in improvements in clinical and patient reported outcomes in patients undergoing major inter-cavity resection of cancer.

                Pneumatosis cystoid intestinalis is a rare disease reported in the literature affecting 0.03% of the population. It has a variety of causes and its manifestation may change widely. It usually presents as a marginal finding resulting from various gastrointestinal pathologies. In the acute complicated form of pneumatosis intestinalis, management is challenging for physicians and surgeons. We present a case of a 60-year-old patient who was admitted to our surgical department with a symptomatology suggestive of small bowel occlusion. Computed tomography demonstrated ileal volvulus associated with parietal signs suffering and pneumoperitoneum. An emergent exploratory laparoscopy followed by conversion was performed demonstrating segmental ileal pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to a small bowel volvulus due to an inflammatory appendix wrapping around the distal ileum. Further, detorsion, retrograde draining, and appendectomy were performed because there were no signs of necrosis and the appendix was pathological. The postoperative course was uneventful. This case is exceedingly rare in the literature, because it was featured by the ileal volvulus due to appendicitis.This case report emphasizes the importance of surgical procedures in the management of symptomatic pneumatosis intestinalis.

                Background: Horses are herd animals that have been domesticated in the last century. In several countries, an overview of risk factors and clinical evaluation in horses with colic has not been well‐described. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors and hematological profiles in horses associated with colic in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed during April - October 2019. A total of 115 horses were diagnosed based on physical examination, clinical symptoms, and rectal examination. A questionnaire was asked to the horse-owners to analyze the risk factors while the clinical examination was performed and blood samples were collected for pre-treatment and 14 days post-treatment. Hematological profile was evaluated from a whole blood sample. Serum cortisol, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations were also evaluated after separating the aliquots.  Results: Of the 115 horses, 96 were diagnosed with colic. The horses with colic showed a significant association between cases with gender (p<0.021), breed (p<0.000), wheat bran feeding (p<0.015), concentrate feeding (p<0.003), anthelmintics administration (p<0.000), gastrointestinal parasites (p<0.000), dental diseases (p<0.024), previous exposure to colic (p<0.000), body condition score (p<0.000), and access to water per day (p<0.000). Based on whole blood and serum evaluation, there were ameliorated significantly on the hematological profile (p<0.01), serum cortisol (p<0.05), and plasma epinephrine (p<0.01) at 14 days post-treatment. Conclusion: This study has identified factors associated with colic in Delman horses. The study provides crucial information to investigate cases of colic and to contribute the development of healthcare strategies during treatment and clinical evaluation.

                Background In order to facilitate better international and cross-cultural comparisons of health professionals (HPs) attitudes towards Religiosity and/or Spirituality (R/S) using individual participant data meta-analysis we updated the NERSH Data Pool. Methods We performed both a network search, a citation search and systematic literature searches to find new surveys. Results We found six new surveys (N=1,068), and the complete data pool ended up comprising 7,323 observations, including 4,070 females and 3,253 males. Most physicians (83%, N=3,700) believed that R/S had “some” influence on their patients’ health (CI95%) (81.8%–84.2%). Similarly, nurses (94%, N=1,020) shared such a belief (92.5%–95.5%). Across all samples 649 (16%; 14.9%–17.1%) physicians reported to have undergone formal R/S-training, compared with nurses where this was 264 (23%; 20.6%–25.4%). Conclusions Preliminary analysis indicates that HPs believe R/S to be important for patient health but lack formal R/S-training. Findings are discussed. We find the data pool suitable as a base for future cross-cultural comparisons using individual participant data meta-analysis.

                Background: Infrared (IR) sensors are useful tools for detecting distance and proximity. However, these sensors are not good at detecting edges of an area, therefore when used in a smart toilet it has difficulty in detecting the orientation and position of the user’s body. The aim of this study was to design an IR sensor for a smart toilet with a more accurate and consistent detection.  Methods: A total of 12(six men and six women) participants with different body types were involved in this study. IR sensor detection was tested in the sitting and squatting toilets. For the best accuracy, the  IR sensor's angle was measured. Red, blue, and red-blue plastic covers were used, as these colors improve precision. The microcontroller was  set up to calculate the participant’s distance and presence in the cubicle.    Results:  Toilet positioning varied greatly depending on whether one is sitting or squatting. For sitting toilet, the red cover was close to the accurate distance at a 172˚ angle. IR detected a man but not a woman's body. The blue cover provided the same best angle of 172˚ with a higher sensor distance. When the red and blue cover combination was applied, the reading of 141cm detected both men and women, at 172˚  angle. The actual distance for squatting toilets  was 158cm. The optimal angle for both red and blue covers was 176˚, however the sensor distance was greater for the blue cover. Finally, the red and blue cover combination gave a more accurate distance of up to 163cm from the actual reading, when detecting both genders at a normal angle of 76˚.  Conclusion: The combination of red and blue cover gave the most accurate detection for the squatting and sitting toilets. The best angle for sitting was 172˚, and for squatting was 176˚.

                Diabetes is one of the top ten causes of death among adults worldwide. People with diabetes are prone to suffer from eye disease such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR damages the blood vessels in the retina and can result in vision loss. DR grading is an essential step to take to help in the early diagnosis and in the effective treatment thereof, and also to slow down its progression to vision impairment. Existing automatic solutions are mostly based on traditional image processing and machine learning techniques. Hence, there is a big gap when it comes to more generic detection and grading of DR. Various deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been previously utilized for this purpose. To enhance DR grading, this paper proposes a novel solution based on an ensemble of state-of-the-art deep learning models called vision transformers. A challenging public DR dataset proposed in a 2015 Kaggle challenge was used for training and evaluation of the proposed method. This dataset includes highly imbalanced data with five levels of severity: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. The experiments conducted showed that the proposed solution outperforms existing methods in terms of precision (47%), recall (45%), F1 score (42%), and Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) (60.2%). Finally, it was able to run with low inference time (1.12 seconds). For this reason, the proposed solution can help examiners grade DR more accurately than manual means.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">DARPP‐32 distinguishes a subset of adult‐born neurons in zebra finch HVC</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult male zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) continually incorporate adult-born neurons into HVC, a telencephalic brain region necessary for the production of learned song. These neurons express activity-dependent immediate early genes (e.g. <i>zenk</i> and <i>c-fos</i>) following song production, suggesting that these neurons are active during song production. Half of these adult-born HVC neurons (HVC NNs) can be backfilled from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and are a part of the vocal motor pathway underlying learned song production, but the other half do not backfill from RA, and they remain to be characterized. Here we used cell birth-dating, retrograde tract tracing, and immunofluorescence to demonstrate that half of all HVC NNs express the phosphoprotein DARPP-32, a protein associated with dopamine (DA) receptor expression. We also demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs are contacted by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers suggesting that they receive catecholaminergic input, have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs, and do not backfill from RA. Taken together, these findings help characterize a group of HVC NNs that have no apparent projections to RA and so far have eluded positive identification other than HVC NN status.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hematologic and coagulopathy parameter as a survival predictor among moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in non- ICU ward: a single-center study at the main referral hospital in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with rese</a></h4>

              
                Background : This research aimed to examine and analyze risk factors for death, hematologic parameters and coagulation in COVID-19 patients at RSUD Dr. Soetomo Surabaya, one of the referral centers for probable COVID-19 patient cases in East Java. Method : This was a retrospective analytical study by taking secondary data on patients with probable COVID-19 cases who were treated in hospital isolation rooms from May to September, 2020. Result : Of 538 probable COVID-19 patients, 217  tested positive, with an average age of 52.11±13.12 years, and there were 38 death cases. Hematologic parameters, such as white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, were significantly different in the deceased group. On the other hand, coagulation parameters, consisting of D-dimer, CRP, PT, and aPTT showed significantly similar value in the deceased group. Univatiate analysis concluded that chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, WBC, NLR, and PPT counts could predict the mortality, while multivariate analysis revealed that coronary heart disease was the only significant independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion : This research shows that hematologic and coagulation parameters were increased in the majority of COVID-19 patients and the deceased group. While the number of neutrophils and WBC increases, the number of lymphocytes decreases significantly with increasing disease severity. Coronary heart disease is an independent predictor of mortality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">General public awareness, knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19 infection and prevention: a cross-sectional study from Pakistan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the knowledge, perceptions, and attitude of the public in Pakistan (using social media) towards COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 1120 individuals nationwide. A self-developed, pre-tested questionnaire was used that comprised of sections covering demographic characteristics, medical history, hygiene awareness, COVID-19-related knowledge, and learning attitude. Descriptive statistics were used for frequencies, percentages, averages and standard deviations. Inferential statistics were done using the Student’s t-test and ANOVA. Results: The average age of participants was 31 years (range 18-60 years). In total 56 individuals (5%) had completed primary or secondary school education; 448 (40%) were employed (working from home) and 60% were jobless due to the COVID-19 crisis. Almost all the study subjects (1030 (92%)) were washing their hands multiple times a day. A total of 83% had awareness regarding quarantine time, 82% used face masks whenever they left their homes, 98% were aware of the origin of the disease, and 70% had knowledge regarding the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: It can be concluded from the current study that female participants had higher level of education, and more awareness regarding the coronavirus. The majority of the participants followed proper hand washing regimes and washed their faces. Further knowledge and awareness should be promoted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Flow cytometry of bone marrow aspirates from neuroblastoma patients is a highly sensitive technique for quantification of low-level neuroblastoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bone marrow involvement is an important aspect of determining staging of disease and treatment for childhood neuroblastoma. Current standard of care relies on microscopic examination of bone marrow trephine biopsies and aspirates respectively, to define involvement. Flow cytometric analysis of disaggregated tumour cells, when using a panel of neuroblastoma specific markers, allows for potentially less subjective determination of the presence of tumour cells. Methods: A retrospective review of sequential bone marrow trephine biopsies and aspirates, performed at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, between the years 2015 and 2018, was performed to assess whether the addition of flow cytometric analysis to these standard of care methods provided concordant or additional information. Results: There was good concurrence between all three methods for negative results 216/302 (72%). Positive results had a concordance of 52/86 (61%), comparing samples positive by flow cytometry and positive by either or both cytology and histology.  Of the remaining samples, 20/86 (23%) were positive by either or both cytology and histology, but negative by flow cytometry. Whereas 14/86 (16%) of samples were positive only by flow cytometry. Conclusions: Our review highlights the ongoing importance of expert cytological and histological assessment of bone marrow results. Flow cytometry is an objective, quantitative method to assess the level of bone marrow disease in aspirates.  In this study, flow cytometry identified low-level residual disease that was not detected by cytology or histology. The clinical significance of this low-level disease warrants further investigation.

                Background: Dermatoglyphics is considered, in the scientific milieu, to be an epigenetic marker. The objective of this study was to analyze the presence of dermatoglyphic marks characteristic of neuromotor capacity and abdominal resistance in children and adolescents. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 1,002 individuals, female children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 16, from public and private schools in the city of Joaçaba, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The protocol selected for analyzing the fingerprints was dermatoglyphics, proposed by Cummins and Midlo using a Dermatoglyphic Reader. The Brazilian Sports Project Manual - PROESP 2015 was used to collect data on muscle strength motor tests. Results: The results showed the presence of a dermatoglyphic mark characteristic of abdominal motor capacity and muscle strength in females. A higher frequency of arches was identified in MET4 and whorls in MET5 and MDT4 in the Risk Zone group. In the Healthy Zone group, ulnar loop was found to be more frequent in MET4, MET5, and MDT4 fingers. Conclusions: The results demonstrated a predictive marker for abdominal motor capacity and strength in females through dermatoglyphics.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Cre driver mouse lines for thalamocortical circuit mapping</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Subpopulations of neurons and associated neural circuits can be targeted in mice with genetic tools in a highly selective manner for visualization and manipulation. However, there are not well-defined Cre ‘driver’ lines that target expression of Cre recombinase to thalamocortical neurons. Here were characterize three Cre driver lines for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre.</i> We examined the postnatal distribution of Cre expression for each of these lines with the Cre-dependent reporter <i>CAG-tdTomato</i> (<i>Ai9)</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within thalamus, including thalamocortical neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to thalamocortical neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Cre expression is present by the time of natural birth in all three lines, underscoring their utility for developmental studies. To demonstrate the utility of these Cre drivers for studying sensory thalamocortical circuitry, we targeted expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to thalamus from the <i>CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP (Ai32)</i> allele with either <i>HDC-Cre</i> or <i>CRH-Cre.</i> Optogenetic activation of thalamocortical afferents in primary visual cortex was sufficient to measure frequency-dependent depression. Thus, these Cre drivers provide selective Cre-dependent gene expression in thalamus suitable for both anatomical and functional studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Comparative neuroanatomical distribution and expression levels of neuropeptide F in the central nervous system of the female freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, during the ovarian cycle</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide F (NPF) plays critical roles in controlling feeding and reproduction of prawns. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression levels of <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> neuropeptide F (MrNPF), and its neuroanatomical distribution in eyestalk (ES), brain (BR), subesophageal ganglion (SEG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG), during the ovarian cycle of female prawn. By qRT-PCR, the amount of <i>MrNPF</i> transcripts exhibited a gradual increase in the ES, BR, and combined SEG and TG from stages I and II, to reach maximum level at stage III, and slightly declined at stage IV, respectively. The highest to lowest expression levels were detected in combined SEG and TG, BR, ES, and AG, respectively. MrNPF immunolabelling was observed in several neuronal clusters, associated fibers and neuropils of these CNS tissues. MrNPF-ir was more intense in neurons and neuropils of SEG and TG than those found in other parts of the CNS. The number of MrNPF-ir neurons, and intensity of MrNPF-ir were higher in the ES, BR, SEG, and TG at the late stages than those at the early stages of the ovarian cycle, while those in AG exhibited insignificant change. Taken together, there is a correlation between changes in neuroanatomical distribution of MrNPF and stages of the ovarian cycle, implying that MrNPF may be an important neuropeptide that integrates sensory stimuli, including photo-, chemo-, and gustatory receptions, to control feeding and reproduction, particularly ovarian development, of this female prawn, <i>M. rosenbergii</i>.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Cancer as a homeostatic challenge: the role of the hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                The initiation, progression, and metastatic spread of cancer elicits diverse changes in systemic physiology. In this way, cancer represents a novel homeostatic challenge to the host system. Here, we discuss how the hypothalamus, a critical brain region involved in homeostasis senses, integrates and responds to cancer-induced changes in physiology. Through this lens, cancer-associated changes in behavior (e.g., sleep disruption) and physiology (e.g., glucocorticoid dysregulation) can be viewed as the result of an inability to re-establish homeostasis.

                Alexander et al. use multiplexed single-cell secretion analysis to disentangle TLR4-induced autocrine feedback loops. They show that IL-10 raises the threshold of inflammatory activation in macrophages while also negatively regulating highly activated cells. The restraining role of IL-10 is mediated by IFN-β signaling, while TNF-induced IL-10 likely mediates response resolution.

                The high-affinity calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) is implicated in many aspects of synaptic transmission. Weyrer et al. find that introducing Syt7 into climbing fibers (CFs), which do normally express Syt7, promotes synaptic facilitation without affecting two other processes associated with Syt7: recovery from depression and asynchronous release.

                Song et al. report that the extracellular glucose level impacts the protein level of DOT1L through hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and DOT1L O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAcylation increases DOT1L protein stability by interfering with its interaction with and ubiquitination by an E3 ligase, UBE3C. DOT1L O-GlcNAcylation promotes oncogene expression and cell proliferation in MLL-fusion leukemia.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A20 deficiency in myeloid cells protects mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance due to increased fatty acid metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Catrysse et al. show that absence of A20 in myeloid cells leads to protection against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. They speculate that this is caused by increased oxygen consumption and increased fatty acid metabolism of A20-deficient macrophages. These findings reveal a role for A20 in regulating macrophage immunometabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Gut microbiota-mediated secondary bile acids regulate dendritic cells to attenuate autoimmune uveitis through TGR5 signaling</a></h4>

              
                Hu et al. reveal that gut microbiota-related dysmetabolism of bile acids is involved in the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Secondary bile acids are reduced in the feces and serum of EAU mice. Secondary bile acids regulate function of dendritic cells via the TGR5-cAMP-PKA pathway in EAU mice.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Inappropriate use of antibiotics exacerbates inflammation through OMV-induced pyroptosis in MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae infection</a></h4>

              
                Ye et al. show that inappropriate use of antibiotics in the case of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) infection might cause severe inflammatory damage. Carbapenems enhance the secretion of OMVs with upregulated membrane presentation of GroEL, which promotes macrophages to take up OMVs, develop pyroptosis, and release proinflammatory cytokines.

                It is poorly understood why subtype C HIV-1 strains are most prevalent worldwide. Bosso et al. show that a characteristic additional NF-κB binding site in the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter allows clade C HIV-1 strains to evade restriction by interferon-inducible nuclear PYHIN proteins.

                Trypanosoma brucei are parasites that cause severe disease in mammals. De Niz et al. investigate how T. brucei interacts with blood vessels to preferentially traverse into certain organs, where they establish vast reservoirs. Selective removal of organ-specific vascular receptors ultimately alters parasite virulence and host survival.

                Pisano et al. use transsynaptic tracing and whole-brain light-sheet microscopy to quantitatively map cerebellar paths to and from the forebrain, including relatively dense projections to the prefrontal neocortex. Divergence of paths from single injection sites suggests that a single cerebellar region can influence multiple thalamic and neocortical targets at once.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of pathogen tolerance and emerging infections: A missing experimental paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Researchers worldwide are repeatedly warning us against future zoonotic diseases resulting from humankind’s insurgence into natural ecosystems. The same zoonotic pathogens that cause severe infections in a human host frequently fail to produce any disease outcome in their natural hosts. What precise features of the immune system enable natural reservoirs to carry these pathogens so efficiently? To understand these effects, we highlight the importance of tracing the evolutionary basis of pathogen tolerance in reservoir hosts, while drawing implications from their diverse physiological and life-history traits, and ecological contexts of host-pathogen interactions. Long-term co-evolution might allow reservoir hosts to modulate immunity and evolve tolerance to zoonotic pathogens, increasing their circulation and infectious period. Such processes can also create a genetically diverse pathogen pool by allowing more mutations and genetic exchanges between circulating strains, thereby harboring rare alive-on-arrival variants with extended infectivity to new hosts (i.e., spillover). Finally, we end by underscoring the indispensability of a large multidisciplinary empirical framework to explore the proposed link between evolved tolerance, pathogen prevalence, and spillover in the wild.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metformin alleviates stress-induced cellular senescence of aging human adipose stromal cells and the ensuing adipocyte dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with central fat redistribution and insulin resistance. To identify age-related adipose features, we evaluated the senescence and adipogenic potential of adipose-derived-stromal cells (ASCs) from abdominal subcutaneous fat obtained from healthy normal-weight young (&lt;25y) or older women (&gt;60y). Increased cell passages of young-donor ASCs (<i>in vitro</i> aging), resulted in senescence but not oxidative stress. ASC-derived adipocytes presented impaired adipogenesis but no early mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, aged-donor ASCs at early passages displayed oxidative stress and mild senescence. ASC-derived adipocytes exhibited oxidative stress, and early mitochondrial dysfunction but adipogenesis was preserved. <i>In vitro</i> aging of aged-donor ASCs resulted in further increased senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and severe adipocyte dysfunction. When <i>in vitro</i> aged young-donor ASCs were treated with metformin, no alteration was alleviated. Conversely, metformin treatment of aged-donor ASCs decreased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in decreased senescence. Metformin's prevention of oxidative stress and of the resulting senescence improved the cells' adipogenic capacity and insulin sensitivity. This effect was mediated by the activation of AMP-activated-protein-kinase as revealed by its specific inhibition and activation. Overall, aging ASC-derived adipocytes presented impaired adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. Targeting stress-induced senescence of ASCs with metformin may improve age-related adipose tissue dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Variation in human herpesvirus 6B telomeric integration, excision and transmission between tissues and individuals</a></h4>

              
                Human herpesviruses 6A and 6B (HHV-6A/6B) are ubiquitous pathogens that persist lifelong in latent form and can cause severe conditions upon reactivation. They are spread by community-acquired infection of free virus (acqHHV6A/6B) and by germline transmission of inherited chromosomally-integrated HHV-6A/6B (iciHHV-6A/6B) in telomeres. We exploited a hypervariable region of the HHV-6B genome to investigate the relationship between acquired and inherited virus and revealed predominantly maternal transmission of acqHHV-6B in families. Remarkably, we demonstrate that some copies of acqHHV-6B in saliva from healthy adults gained a telomere, indicative of integration and latency, and that the frequency of viral genome excision from telomeres in iciHHV-6B carriers is surprisingly high and varies between tissues. In addition, newly formed short telomeres generated by partial viral genome release are frequently lengthened, particularly in telomerase-expressing pluripotent cells. Consequently, iciHHV-6B carriers are mosaic for different iciHHV-6B structures, including circular extra-chromosomal forms that have the potential to reactivate. Finally, we show transmission of an HHV-6B strain from an iciHHV-6B mother to her non-iciHHV-6B son. Altogether we demonstrate that iciHHV-6B can readily transition between telomere-integrated and free virus forms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A prion accelerates proliferation at the expense of lifespan</a></h4>

              
                In fluctuating environments, switching between different growth strategies, such as those affecting cell size and proliferation, can be advantageous to an organism. Trade-offs arise, however. Mechanisms that aberrantly increase cell size or proliferation—such as mutations or chemicals that interfere with growth regulatory pathways—can also shorten lifespan. Here we report a natural example of how the interplay between growth and lifespan can be epigenetically controlled. We find that a highly conserved RNA-modifying enzyme, the pseudouridine synthase Pus4/TruB, can act as a prion, endowing yeast with greater proliferation rates at the cost of a shortened lifespan. Cells harboring the prion grow larger and exhibit altered protein synthesis. This epigenetic state, [<i>BIG</i><sup>+</sup>] (<i>b</i>etter <i>i</i>n <span class="underline"><i>g</i></span>rowth), allows cells to heritably yet reversibly alter their translational program, leading to the differential synthesis of dozens of proteins, including many that regulate proliferation and aging. Our data reveal a new role for prion-based control of an RNA-modifying enzyme in driving heritable epigenetic states that transform cell growth and survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The cell adhesion molecule Sdk1 shapes assembly of a retinal circuit that detects localized edges</a></h4>

              
                Nearly 50 different mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types sample the visual scene for distinct features. RGC feature selectivity arises from their synapses with a specific subset of amacrine (AC) and bipolar cell (BC) types, but how RGC dendrites arborize and collect input from these specific subsets remains poorly understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that RGCs employ molecular recognition systems to meet this challenge. By combining calcium imaging and type-specific histological stains we define a family of circuits that express the recognition molecule Sidekick 1 (Sdk1) which include a novel RGC type (S1-RGC) that responds to local edges. Genetic and physiological studies revealed that Sdk1 loss selectively disrupts S1-RGC visual responses which result from a loss of excitatory and inhibitory inputs and selective dendritic deficits on this neuron. We conclude that Sdk1 shapes dendrite growth and wiring to help S1-RGCs become feature selective.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fine-tuned repression of Drp1 driven mitochondrial fission primes a 'stem/progenitor-like state' to support neoplastic transformation</a></h4>

              
                Gene knockout of the master regulator of mitochondrial fission, Drp1, prevents neoplastic transformation. Also, mitochondrial fission and its opposing process of mitochondrial fusion are emerging as crucial regulators of stemness. Intriguingly, stem/progenitor cells maintaining repressed mitochondrial fission are primed for self-renewal and proliferation. Using our newly derived carcinogen transformed human cell model we demonstrate that fine-tuned Drp1 repression primes a slow cycling 'stem/progenitor-like state', which is characterized by small networks of fused mitochondria and a gene-expression profile with elevated functional stem/progenitor markers (Krt15, Sox2 etc) and their regulators (Cyclin E). Fine tuning Drp1 protein by reducing its activating phosphorylation sustains the neoplastic stem cell markers. Whereas, fine-tuned reduction of Drp1 protein maintains the characteristic mitochondrial shape and gene-expression of the primed 'stem/progenitor-like state' to accelerate neoplastic transformation, and more complete reduction of Drp1 protein prevents it. Therefore, our data highlights a 'goldilocks'; level of Drp1 repression supporting stem/progenitor state dependent neoplastic transformation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activity-dependent Golgi satellite formation in dendrites reshapes the neuronal surface glycoproteome</a></h4>

              
                Activity-driven changes in the neuronal surface glycoproteome are known to occur with synapse formation, plasticity and related diseases, but their mechanistic basis and significance are unclear. Here, we observed that <i>N</i>-glycans on surface glycoproteins of dendrites shift from immature to mature forms containing sialic acid in response to increased neuronal activation. In exploring the basis of these <i>N</i>-glycosylation alterations, we discovered they result from the growth and proliferation of Golgi satellites scattered throughout the dendrite. Golgi satellites that formed during neuronal excitation were in close association with ER exit sites and early endosomes and contained glycosylation machinery without the Golgi structural protein, GM130. They functioned as distal glycosylation stations in dendrites, terminally modifying sugars either on newly synthesized glycoproteins passing through the secretory pathway, or on surface glycoproteins taken up from the endocytic pathway. These activities led to major changes in the dendritic surface of excited neurons, impacting binding and uptake of lectins, as well as causing functional changes in neurotransmitter receptors such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Neural activity thus boosts the activity of the dendrite’s satellite micro-secretory system by redistributing Golgi enzymes involved in glycan modifications into peripheral Golgi satellites. This remodeling of the neuronal surface has potential significance for synaptic plasticity, addiction and disease.
