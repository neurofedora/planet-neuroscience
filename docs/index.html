                arXiv:2411.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Firing rate models are dynamical systems widely used in applied and theoretical neuroscience to describe local cortical dynamics in neuronal populations. By providing a macroscopic perspective of neuronal activity, these models are essential for investigating oscillatory phenomena, chaotic behavior, and associative memory processes. Despite their widespread use, the application of firing rate models to associative memory networks has received limited mathematical exploration, and most existing studies are focused on specific models. Conversely, well-established associative memory designs, such as Hopfield networks, lack key biologically-relevant features intrinsic to firing rate models, including positivity and interpretable synaptic matrices that reflect excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To address this gap, we propose a general framework that ensures the emergence of re-scaled memory patterns as stable equilibria in the firing rate dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which the memories are locally and globally asymptotically stable, providing insights into constructing biologically-plausible and robust systems for associative memory retrieval.

                arXiv:2307.10178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The no-supervenience theorem limits the capacity of physicalist theories to provide a comprehensive account of human consciousness. The proof of the theorem is difficult to formalize because it relies on both alethic and epistemic notions of possibility. This article outlines a formalizable proof using predicate modal logic in which the epistemic inferences are expressed in terms of an existing mathematical formalism, the inference device (Wolpert, 2008). The resulting proof shows definitely that any physicalist theory which describes a self-aware, intelligent system must be internally inconsistent.

                arXiv:2411.07243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neuropsychological approach to the explainability of artificial neural networks, which involves using concepts from human cognitive psychology as relevant heuristic references for developing synthetic explanatory frameworks that align with human modes of thought. The analogical concepts mobilized here, which are intended to create such an epistemological bridge, are those of categorization and similarity, as these notions are particularly suited to the categorical "nature" of the reconstructive information processing performed by artificial neural networks. Our study aims to reveal a unique process of synthetic cognition, that of the categorical convergence of highly activated tokens. We attempt to explain this process with the idea that the categorical segment created by a neuron is actually the result of a superposition of categorical sub-dimensions within its input vector space.

                arXiv:2411.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are powerful models of spatiotemporal computation and are well suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and neuromorphic hardware due to their low power consumption. Leveraging attention mechanisms similar to those found in their artificial neural network counterparts, recently emerged spiking transformers have showcased promising performance and efficiency by capitalizing on the binary nature of spiking operations. Recognizing the current lack of dedicated hardware support for spiking transformers, this paper presents the first work on 3D spiking transformer hardware architecture and design methodology. We present an architecture and physical design co-optimization approach tailored specifically for spiking transformers. Through memory-on-logic and logic-on-logic stacking enabled by 3D integration, we demonstrate significant energy and delay improvements compared to conventional 2D CMOS integration.

                arXiv:2411.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents innovative approaches to optimization problems, focusing on both Single-Objective Multi-Modal Optimization (SOMMOP) and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO). In SOMMOP, we integrate chaotic evolution with niching techniques, as well as Persistence-Based Clustering combined with Gaussian mutation. The proposed algorithms, Chaotic Evolution with Deterministic Crowding (CEDC) and Chaotic Evolution with Clustering Algorithm (CECA), utilize chaotic dynamics to enhance population diversity and improve search efficiency. For MOO, we extend these methods into a comprehensive framework that incorporates Uncertainty-Based Selection, Adaptive Parameter Tuning, and introduces a radius \( R \) concept in deterministic crowding, which enables clearer and more precise separation of populations at peak points. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform traditional methods, achieving superior optimization accuracy and robustness across a variety of benchmark functions.

                arXiv:2411.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scheduling problems pose significant challenges in resource, industry, and operational management. This paper addresses the Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (UPMS) with setup times and resources using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The study introduces the Reinforcement Learning environment and conducts empirical analyses, comparing MARL with Single-Agent algorithms. The experiments employ various deep neural network policies for single- and Multi-Agent approaches. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the Maskable extension of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in Single-Agent scenarios and the Multi-Agent PPO algorithm in Multi-Agent setups. While Single-Agent algorithms perform adequately in reduced scenarios, Multi-Agent approaches reveal challenges in cooperative learning but a scalable capacity. This research contributes insights into applying MARL techniques to scheduling optimization, emphasizing the need for algorithmic sophistication balanced with scalability for intelligent scheduling solutions.

To improve on these aspects, spiking neural network is leveraged, as a grid-edge intelligence tool to establish a talkative infrastructure, Spike Talk, expediting coordination in next-generation microgrids without the need of communication at all. This paper unravels the physics behind Spike Talk from the perspective of its distributed infrastructure, which aims to address the Von Neumann Bottleneck. Relying on inferring information via power flows in tie lines, Spike Talk allows adaptive and flexible control and coordination itself, and features in synaptic plasticity facilitating online and local training functionality. Preliminary case studies are demonstrated with results, while more extensive validations are to be included as future scopes of work.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07873">Diverse capability and scaling of diffusion and auto-regressive models when learning abstract rules</a></h4>

Abstract: Humans excel at discovering regular structures from limited samples and applying inferred rules to novel settings. We investigate whether modern generative models can similarly learn underlying rules from finite samples and perform reasoning through conditional sampling. Inspired by Raven's Progressive Matrices task, we designed GenRAVEN dataset, where each sample consists of three rows, and one of 40 relational rules governing the object position, number, or attributes applies to all rows. We trained generative models to learn the data distribution, where samples are encoded as integer arrays to focus on rule learning. We compared two generative model families: diffusion (EDM, DiT, SiT) and autoregressive models (GPT2, Mamba). We evaluated their ability to generate structurally consistent samples and perform panel completion via unconditional and conditional sampling. We found diffusion models excel at unconditional generation, producing more novel and consistent samples from scratch and memorizing less, but performing less well in panel completion, even with advanced conditional sampling methods. Conversely, autoregressive models excel at completing missing panels in a rule-consistent manner but generate less consistent samples unconditionally. We observe diverse data scaling behaviors: for both model families, rule learning emerges at a certain dataset size - around 1000s examples per rule. With more training data, diffusion models improve both their unconditional and conditional generation capabilities. However, for autoregressive models, while panel completion improves with more training data, unconditional generation consistency declines. Our findings highlight complementary capabilities and limitations of diffusion and autoregressive models in rule learning and reasoning tasks, suggesting avenues for further research into their mechanisms and potential for human-like reasoning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06909">Graph Agent Network: Empowering Nodes with Inference Capabilities for Adversarial Resilience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2306.06909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06236">Zero-Shot NAS via the Suppression of Local Entropy Decrease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.06236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.

	<p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a neuropsychiatric condition whose neurobiological characteristics include alterations in brain plasticity, modulated by Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). In animal models, environmental enrichment promotes neuroplasticity and reduces depressive-like behaviors. In humans, we proposed to assess the level of Enriched Environment (EE) using a questionnaire that includes different domains of the EE (cognitive, social, and physical), which we named the EE Indicator (EEI). Objective: To determine the relationship between the level of EE and serum BDNF in participants with MDD and healthy controls. Materials: Participants with MDD without antidepressant treatment and healthy controls were recruited, and their EE level and serum BDNF concentration were determined looking for correlations between their clinical characteristics and the cognitive, social, and physical activities according to the EEI. Results: A total of 25 participants were recruited, of which 6 participants with MDD and the same number of controls were selected in a paired manner. Although no differences were found in the concentration of BDNF between the groups, positive correlations were observed between cognitive EE and BDNF (r = 0.62, p = 0.035), as well as negative social EE and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.86, p = 0.001). The sum between cognitive and social EE showed a positive correlation with the serum concentration of BDNF (r = 0.34, p = 0.0451). Conclusions: The level of EE is potentially modulating the presence and severity of MDD at a clinical level, but it can also influence at a neuroplastic level through promoting or limiting the concentration of BDNF.</p>

                Appendicularians are planktonic tunicates abundant all over the world. Currently, only two complete annotated mitochondrial genome assemblies are available for appendicularians, both for cryptic species of Oikopleura dioica. This underrepresentation of available appendicularian mitochondrial genomes limits environmental DNA sequencing (eDNA) studies that rely on mitochondrial markers as a taxonomic barcode. We report the complete mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation of an unknown appendicularian species isolated from the Amami Oshima island, Kagoshima prefecture, Japan, that has significant sequence difference with other currently available assemblies and will serve as a useful resource for ecological studies and further mitochondrial studies of appendicularians.

                Through its wide-ranging effects on human physiology and behaviour, daily light exposure is an important environmental modulator of healthy ageing. Integrating mobile health (mHealth) technology with behaviour change strategies offers a promising approach to optimise light exposure and positively impact sleep, rest-wake cycles, cognitive function, and mood at scale. This study aims to develop the LightSPAN mHealth behaviour change intervention to optimise light exposure across the lifespan. Employing a co-design methodology, the study comprises two distinct workstreams. The first focuses on conceptualising the theoretical framework and implementation strategies through a comprehensive review of light exposure interventions, behaviour change theories, mHealth user personas, and recommendations for designing mHealth interventions for older adults. The second workstream centres on co-designing the intervention, involving consultation with community service providers and engagement with older adults at ageing community centres (≥60 years of age). Community service providers will be consulted through open-ended discussions (target n=5). Older adult participants (n=20) will engage in telephone interviews, focus group discussions and prototyping workshops to explore older adult participants’ characteristics, needs, preferences, and mHealth intervention design elements and co-design the LightSPAN mHealth behaviour change intervention. The insights generated in these co-design components will ensure that the intervention addresses the needs of its future users.

                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concomitant illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months after the ethics committee’s approval. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in early identification and prevention of DDIs, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

Despite advancements in understanding the structure and functions of the Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR), gaps persist in our knowledge of the specific functions of its residues. In this study, we used phylogeny-based techniques to identify functionally equivalent orthologs of CaSR, predict residue significance, and compute specificity-determining position (SDP) scores to understand its evolutionary basis. The analysis revealed exceptional conservation of the CaSR subfamily, emphasizing the critical role of residues with high SDP scores in receptor activation and pathogenicity. To further enhance the findings, gradient-boosting trees were applied to differentiate between gain- and loss-of-function mutations responsible for hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia. Lastly, we investigated the importance of these mutations in the context of receptor activation dynamics. In summary, through comprehensive exploration of the evolutionary history of the CaSR subfamily, coupled with innovative phylogenetic methodologies, we identified activating and inactivating residues, providing valuable insights into the regulation of calcium homeostasis and its connections to associated disorders.

                <p>by Marta Kryven, Suhyoun Yu, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Tomer Ullman, Joshua Tenenbaum</p>

How people plan is an active area of research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. However, tasks traditionally used to study planning in the laboratory tend to be constrained to artificial environments, such as Chess and bandit problems. To date there is still no agreed-on model of how people plan in realistic contexts, such as navigation and search, where values intuitively derive from interactions between perception and cognition. To address this gap and move towards a more naturalistic study of planning, we present a novel spatial Maze Search Task (MST) where the costs and rewards are physically situated as distances and locations. We used this task in two behavioral experiments to evaluate and contrast multiple distinct computational models of planning, including optimal expected utility planning, several one-step heuristics inspired by studies of information search, and a family of planners that deviate from optimal planning, in which action values are estimated by the interactions between perception and cognition. We found that people’s deviations from optimal expected utility are best explained by planners with a limited horizon, however our results do not exclude the possibility that in human planning action values may be also affected by cognitive mechanisms of numerosity and probability perception. This result makes a novel theoretical contribution in showing that limited planning horizon generalizes to spatial planning, and demonstrates the value of our multi-model approach for understanding cognition.

                <p>by Marte J. Sætra, Yoichiro Mori</p>

Most computational models of neurons assume constant ion concentrations, disregarding the effects of changing ion concentrations on neuronal activity. Among the models that do incorporate ion concentration dynamics, simplifications are often made that sacrifice biophysical consistency, such as neglecting the effects of ionic diffusion on electrical potentials or the effects of electric drift on ion concentrations. A subset of models with ion concentration dynamics, often referred to as electrodiffusive models, account for ion concentration dynamics in a way that ensures a biophysical consistent relationship between ion concentrations, electric charge, and electrical potentials. These models include compartmental single-cell models, geometrically explicit models, and domain-type models, but none that model neuronal network dynamics. To address this gap, we present an electrodiffusive network model with multicompartmental neurons and synaptic connections, which we believe is the first compartmentalized network model to account for intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics in a biophysically consistent way. The model comprises an arbitrary number of “units,” each divided into three domains representing a neuron, glia, and extracellular space. Each domain is further subdivided into a somatic and dendritic layer. Unlike conventional models which focus primarily on neuronal spiking patterns, our model predicts intra- and extracellular ion concentrations (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>), electrical potentials, and volume fractions. A unique feature of the model is that it captures ephaptic effects, both electric and ionic. In this paper, we show how this leads to interesting behavior in the network. First, we demonstrate how changing ion concentrations can affect the synaptic strengths. Then, we show how ionic ephaptic coupling can lead to spontaneous firing in neurons that do not receive any synaptic or external input. Lastly, we explore the effects of having glia in the network and demonstrate how a strongly coupled glial syncytium can prevent neuronal depolarization blocks.

H5 influenza is considered a potential pandemic threat. Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple nonhuman mammalian species. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here, we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind α2-6-linked sialic acids and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine virus, and we show that a mutation present in some recent H5 HAs causes a large antigenic change. Overall, the systematic nature of deep mutational scanning combined with the safety of pseudoviruses enables comprehensive measurements of the phenotypic effects of mutations that can inform real-time interpretation of viral variation observed during surveillance of H5 influenza.

                <p>by Yunlu Zhu, Hannah Gelnaw, Franziska Auer, Kyla R. Hamling, David E. Ehrlich, David Schoppik</p>

The sensation of gravity anchors our perception of the environment and is important for navigation. However, the neural circuits that transform gravity into commands for navigation are undefined. We first determined that larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) navigate vertically by maintaining a consistent heading across a series of upward climb or downward dive bouts. Gravity-blind mutant fish swim with more variable heading and excessive veering, leading to less effective vertical navigation. After targeted photoablation of ascending vestibular neurons and spinal projecting midbrain neurons, but not vestibulospinal neurons, vertical navigation was impaired. These data define a sensorimotor circuit that uses evolutionarily conserved brainstem architecture to transform gravitational signals into persistent heading for vertical navigation. The work lays a foundation to understand how vestibular inputs allow animals to move effectively through their environment.

                <p>by Guy Lhomond, Michael Schubert, Jenifer Croce</p>

Establishment of the 3 primordial germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) during early animal development represents an essential prerequisite for the emergence of properly patterned embryos. β-catenin is an ancient protein that is known to play essential roles in this process. However, these roles have chiefly been established through inhibition of β-catenin translation or function at the time of fertilization. Comprehensive analyses reporting the totality of functions played by nuclear β-catenin, during the early embryogenesis of a given animal, i.e., at different developmental stages and in different germ layers, are thus still lacking. In this study, we used an inducible, conditional knockdown system in the sea urchin to characterize all possible requirements of β-catenin for germ layer establishment and patterning. By blocking β-catenin protein production starting at 7 different time points of early development, between fertilization and 12 h post fertilization, we established a clear correlation between the position of a germ layer along the primary embryonic axis (the animal-vegetal axis) and its dependence on nuclear β-catenin activity. For example, in the vegetal hemisphere, we determined that the 3 germ layers (skeletogenic mesoderm, non-skeletogenic mesoderm, and endoderm) require distinct and highly specific durations of β-catenin production for their respective specification, with the most vegetal germ layer, the skeletogenic mesoderm, requiring the shortest duration. Likewise, for the 2 animal territories (ectoderm and anterior neuroectoderm), we established that their restriction, along the animal-vegetal axis, relies on different durations of β-catenin production, and that the longest duration is for the most animal territory, the anterior neuroectoderm. Moreover, we found that 2 of the vegetal germ layers, the non-skeletogenic mesoderm and the endoderm, further require a prolonged period of nuclear β-catenin activity, after their specification, to maintain their respective germ layer identities through time. Finally, we determined that restriction of the anterior neuroectoderm territory depends on at least 2 nuclear β-catenin-dependent inputs and a nuclear β-catenin-independent mechanism. Taken together, this work is the first to comprehensively define the spatiotemporal requirements of β-catenin during the early embryogenesis of a single animal, the sea urchin <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i>, thereby providing new experimental evidence for a better understanding of the roles played by this evolutionary conserved protein during animal development.

                <p>by Ariana S. Huffmyer, Jill Ashey, Emma Strand, Eric N. Chiles, Xiaoyang Su, Hollie M. Putnam</p>

Rising sea surface temperatures are increasingly causing breakdown in the nutritional relationship between corals and algal endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), threatening the basis of coral reef ecosystems and highlighting the critical role of coral reproduction in reef maintenance. The effects of thermal stress on metabolic exchange (i.e., transfer of fixed carbon photosynthates from symbiont to host) during sensitive early life stages, however, remains understudied. We exposed symbiotic <i>Montipora capitata</i> coral larvae in Hawaiʻi to high temperature (+2.5°C for 3 days), assessed rates of photosynthesis and respiration, and used stable isotope tracing (4 mM <sup>13</sup>C sodium bicarbonate; 4.5 h) to quantify metabolite exchange. While larvae did not show any signs of bleaching and did not experience declines in survival and settlement, metabolic depression was significant under high temperature, indicated by a 19% reduction in respiration rates, but with no change in photosynthesis. Larvae exposed to high temperature showed evidence for maintained translocation of a major photosynthate, glucose, from the symbiont, but there was reduced metabolism of glucose through central carbon metabolism (i.e., glycolysis). The larval host invested in nitrogen cycling by increasing ammonium assimilation, urea metabolism, and sequestration of nitrogen into dipeptides, a mechanism that may support the maintenance of glucose translocation under thermal stress. Host nitrogen assimilation via dipeptide synthesis appears to be used for nitrogen limitation to the Symbiodiniaceae, and we hypothesize that nitrogen limitation contributes to retention of fixed carbon by favoring photosynthate translocation to the host. Collectively, our findings indicate that although these larvae are susceptible to metabolic stress under high temperature, diverting energy to nitrogen assimilation to maintain symbiont population density, photosynthesis, and carbon translocation may allow larvae to avoid bleaching and highlights potential life stage specific metabolic responses to stress.

                Introduction This research is a systematic review aimed at synthesizing scientific evidence on the causes of university dropout, focusing on the subcategories of vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects between 2020 and June 2024. Methods Only articles addressing university dropout were considered, analyzing dimensions such as vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects. Articles published in indexed scientific journals with double-blind, double-blind peer, or open reviews between 2020 and June 2024 were included. The main databases used were Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. To assess the risk of bias in qualitative studies, the criteria from the article “Validity criteria for qualitative research: three epistemological strands for the same purpose” were used. For quantitative studies, the criteria from the article “Evaluating survey research in articles published in Library Science journals” were followed. For mixed-method studies, both sets of criteria were combined. Results A total of 23 studies were included: 15 quantitative (65.22%), 3 qualitative (13.04%), and 5 mixed-method (21.74%). All studies (100%) addressed the subcategories of socioeconomic status and institutional aspects. Regarding the academic performance subcategory, 86% of the studies addressed it, while the vocational guidance subcategory was covered by 73.91% of the studies. Conclusions Vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects are crucial for reducing university dropout. Providing adequate professional guidance, academic support, financial assistance, and strong institutional support is fundamental to improving student retention and academic success.

                Background Inflammatory idiopathic myopathies (IIM) are a heterogeneous group of complex connective tissue diseases (CTD), primarily characterized by inflammatory involvement of skeletal muscles. Several other organs may also be affected, including lungs, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and joints. Objective Describe the clinical and immunological characteristics of IIM among Tunisian patients. Method A retrospective study conducted in the internal medicine department at the Rabta Hospital over 22 years, including adult patients with IIM according to the ACR/EULAR classification criteria, and anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS) according to Connors’ criteria. Inclusion body myositis was excluded. Demographic, clinical, and immunological characteristics were analyzed. Results Ninety-seven patients were included (Male/female ratio= 0.36, mean age = 48.4 +- 13.8 years). The ACR/EULAR criteria enabled the inclusion of 88% of the patients. Dermatomyositis (DM) was the most frequent entity (47%), followed by Polymyositis (PM) (36%) and Amyotrophic dermatomyositis (ADM) (4%). Connors criteria allowed the inclusion and classification with ASS of 33 patients, including those excluded by the ACR/EULAR criteria (12%). Muscular involvement was present in 88% of patients, affecting locomotor (88%), gastrointestinal (43%), laryngeal (10%), cardiac (8%), and respiratory (1%) muscles. Myolysis was observed in 77% of patients, and histological evidence of myositis in 73%. ILD was reported across all subgroup: ASS (85%), PM (57%), DM (17%), and ADM (100%). NSIP was the most common radiologic pattern (59%). Skin involvement (85%), consistently present in DM and ADM, affected 91% of ASS patients. Joint involvement (48%) was predominantly polyarticular (68%). Myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) were detected in 52% of patients, with a predominance of anti-synthetase antibodies (ASAs). Another CTD was noted in 24% of patients and cancer in 17% of patients. Conclusion Our study underscored the clinical diversity among IIM patients and the systemic nature of these diseases, where muscular involvement is not always uniform.

                Introduction Dengue fever poses a significant public health threat, particularly in tropical regions like Malaysia. The rising incidence of dengue outbreaks challenges healthcare systems and highlights the urgent need for effective preventive measures. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns, is expected to worsen the dengue situation in the coming years. Methods . This is a cross-sectional study conducted among adult residents of low-cost housing apartments in an urban poor community in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia involving approximately 16,000 residents. A representative sample of 1,636 residents was calculated using the Krejcie and Morgan formula, and stratified random sampling was used to ensure proportional representation across the various floors of each PPR community apartment block. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from a validated Malay version. The questionnaire assessed respondents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to dengue prevention, categorising KAP scores as “Good” (≥80%) or “Poor” (<80%). Descriptive statistics summarized population characteristics and KAP scores, while logistic regression identified predictors of KAP levels, with significance set at p ≤ 0.05. Results In this community, 76.7% of participants exhibited poor knowledge and 83.1% had a negative attitude towards dengue, despite 66.7% demonstrating good preventive practices. The PPR location significantly predicts dengue knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices, with p-values of less than 0.001 for all domains. Marital status also predicts dengue knowledge (p = 0.007) and preventive practices (p = 0.023), while prior infection with dengue is a predictor of preventive practices (p = 0.047). Conclusion Despite the community’s good dengue prevention practices, likely influenced by environmental expectations, there remains a critical need for education to sustain and strengthen these efforts, as climate change continues to worsen in the coming years. It is crucial to help residents grasp the relevance of these practices, so they can apply them more effectively as climate-driven risks intensify. Targeted interventions should de designed differently for each of the four PPR communities as their levels of knowledge, attitude and practices vary significantly, taking into account independent factors like marital status and prior dengue infection, which shape preventive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97696">Isoleucine gate blocks K+ conduction in C-type inactivation</a></h4>

              
                Many voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels display a time-dependent phenomenon called C-type inactivation, whereby prolonged activation by voltage leads to the inhibition of ionic conduction, a process that involves a conformational change at the selectivity filter toward a non-conductive state. Recently, a high-resolution structure of a strongly inactivated triple-mutant channel kv1.2-kv2.1-3m revealed a novel conformation of the selectivity filter that is dilated at its outer end, distinct from the well-characterized conductive state. While the experimental structure was interpreted as the elusive non-conductive state, our molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiological measurements show that the dilated filter of kv1.2-kv2.1-3m is conductive and, as such, cannot completely account for the inactivation of the channel observed in the structural experiments. The simulation shows that an additional conformational change, implicating isoleucine residues at position 398 along the pore lining segment S6, is required to effectively block ion conduction. The I398 residues from the four subunits act as a state-dependent hydrophobic gate located immediately beneath the selectivity filter. By mutating I398 to Asparagine, ion permeation can be resumed in the kv1.2-kv2.1-3m channel, which was not a reversion C-type inactivation, since AgTxII fails to block the ionic permeation of kv1.2-kv2.1-3m_I398N. As a critical piece of the C-type inactivation machinery, this structural feature is the potential target of a broad class of QA blockers and negatively charged activators thus opening new research directions towards the development of drugs that specifically modulate gating-states of Kv channels.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97674">Contributions of mirror-image hair cell orientation to mouse otolith organ and zebrafish neuromast function</a></h4>

              
                Otolith organs in the inner ear and neuromasts in the fish lateral-line harbor two populations of hair cells oriented to detect stimuli in opposing directions. The underlying mechanism is highly conserved: the transcription factor EMX2 is regionally expressed in just one hair cell population and acts through the receptor GPR156 to reverse cell orientation relative to the other population. In mouse and zebrafish, loss of Emx2 results in sensory organs that harbor only one hair cell orientation and are not innervated properly. In zebrafish, Emx2 also confers hair cells with reduced mechanosensory properties. Here, we leverage mouse and zebrafish models lacking GPR156 to determine how detecting stimuli of opposing directions serves vestibular function, and whether GPR156 has other roles besides orienting hair cells. We find that otolith organs in <i>Gpr156</i> mouse mutants have normal zonal organization and normal type I-II hair cell distribution and mechano-electrical transduction properties. In contrast, <i>gpr156</i> zebrafish mutants lack the smaller mechanically evoked signals that characterize Emx2-positive hair cells. Loss of GPR156 does not affect orientation-selectivity of afferents in mouse utricle or zebrafish neuromasts. Consistent with normal otolith organ anatomy and afferent selectivity, <i>Gpr156</i> mutant mice do not show overt vestibular dysfunction. Instead, performance on two tests that engage otolith organs is significantly altered – swimming and off-vertical-axis rotation. We conclude that GPR156 relays hair cell orientation and transduction information downstream of EMX2, but not selectivity for direction-specific afferents. These results clarify how molecular mechanisms that confer bi-directionality to sensory organs contribute to function, from single hair cell physiology to animal behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99575">Systematic genetic characterization of the human PKR kinase domain highlights its functional malleability to escape a poxvirus substrate mimic</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary arms races can arise at the contact surfaces between host and viral proteins, producing dynamic spaces in which genetic variants are continually pursued.  However, the sampling of genetic variation must be balanced with the need to maintain protein function. A striking case is given by protein kinase R (PKR), a member of the mammalian innate immune system. PKR detects viral replication within the host cell and halts protein synthesis to prevent viral replication by phosphorylating eIF2α, a component of the translation initiation machinery. PKR is targeted by many viral antagonists, including poxvirus pseudosubstrate antagonists that mimic the natural substrate, eIF2α, and inhibit PKR activity. Remarkably, PKR has several rapidly evolving residues at this interface, suggesting it is engaging in an evolutionary arms race, despite the surface’s critical role in phosphorylating eIF2α. To systematically explore the evolutionary opportunities available at this dynamic interface, we generated and characterized a library of 426 SNP-accessible nonsynonymous variants of human PKR for their ability to escape inhibition by the model pseudosubstrate inhibitor K3, encoded by the vaccinia virus gene <i>K3L</i>. We identified key sites in the PKR kinase domain that harbor K3-resistant variants, as well as critical sites where variation leads to loss of function. We find K3-resistant variants are readily available throughout the interface and are enriched at sites under positive selection. Moreover, variants beneficial against K3 were also beneficial against an enhanced variant of K3, indicating resilience to viral adaptation. Overall, we find that the eIF2α-binding surface of PKR is highly malleable, potentiating its evolutionary ability to combat viral inhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89724">Complete suspension culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells supplemented with suppressors of spontaneous differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising resources for producing various types of tissues in regenerative medicine; however, the improvement in a scalable culture system that can precisely control the cellular status of hiPSCs is needed. Utilizing suspension culture without microcarriers or special materials allows for massive production, automation, cost-effectiveness, and safety assurance in industrialized regenerative medicine. Here, we found that hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions with continuous agitation without microcarriers or extracellular matrix components were more prone to spontaneous differentiation than those cultured in conventional adherent conditions. Adding PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors in the suspension conditions suppressed the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs into ectoderm and mesendoderm, respectively. In these conditions, we successfully completed the culture processes of hiPSCs, including the generation of hiPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the expansion of bulk population and single-cell sorted clones, long-term culture with robust self-renewal characteristics, single-cell cloning, direct cryopreservation from suspension culture and their successful recovery, and efficient mass production of a clinical-grade hiPSC line. Our results demonstrate that precise control of the cellular status in suspension culture conditions paves the way for their stable and automated clinical application.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100282">Direct and indirect salt effects on homotypic phase separation</a></h4>

              
                The low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1 (A1-LCD) phase separates in a salt-dependent manner. Unlike many intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) whose phase separation is suppressed by increasing salt concentrations, the phase separation of A1-LCD is promoted by &gt;100 mM NaCl. To investigate the atypical salt effect on A1-LCD phase separation, we carried out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of systems comprising multiple A1-LCD chains at NaCl concentrations from 50 to 1000 mM NaCl. The ions occupy first shell as well as more distant sites around the IDP chains, with Arg sidechains and backbone carbonyls the favored partners of Cl<sup>–</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, respectively. They play two direct roles in driving A1-LCD condensation. The first is to neutralize the high net charge of the protein (+9) by an excess of bound Cl<sup>–</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup>; the second is to bridge between A1-LCD chains, thereby fortifying the intermolecular interaction networks in the dense phase. At high concentrations, NaCl also indirectly strengthens π–π, cation–π, and amino–π interactions, by drawing water away from the interaction partners. Therefore, at low salt, A1-LCD is prevented from phase separation by net charge repulsion; at intermediate concentrations, NaCl neutralizes enough of the net charge while also bridging IDP chains to drive phase separation. This drive becomes even stronger at high salt due to strengthened π-type interactions. Based on this understanding, four classes of salt dependence of IDP phase separation can be predicted from amino-acid composition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89606">Identification of ERAD-dependent degrons for the endoplasmic reticulum lumen</a></h4>

              
                Degrons are minimal protein features that are sufficient to target proteins for degradation. In most cases, degrons allow recognition by components of the cytosolic ubiquitin proteasome system. Currently, all of the identified degrons only function within the cytosol. Using <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we identified the first short linear sequences that function as degrons from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. We show that when these degrons are transferred to proteins, they facilitate proteasomal degradation through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) system. These degrons enable degradation of both luminal and integral membrane ER proteins, expanding the types of proteins that can be targeted for degradation in budding yeast and mammalian tissue culture. This discovery provides a framework to target proteins for degradation from the previously unreachable ER lumen and builds toward therapeutic approaches that exploit the highly conserved ERAD system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94908">A non-conducting role of the Cav1.4 Ca2+ channel drives homeostatic plasticity at the cone photoreceptor synapse</a></h4>

              
                In congenital stationary night blindness, type 2 (CSNB2)—a disorder involving the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (L-type) Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel—visual impairment is mild considering that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 mediates synaptic release from rod and cone photoreceptors. Here, we addressed this conundrum using a Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 knockout (KO) mouse and a knock-in (G369i KI) mouse expressing a non-conducting Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4. Surprisingly, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 (T-type) Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were detected in cones of G369i KI mice and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice but not in cones of wild-type mouse, ground squirrels, and macaque retina. Whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice are blind, G369i KI mice exhibit normal photopic (i.e. cone-mediated) visual behavior. Cone synapses, which fail to form in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, are present, albeit enlarged, and with some errors in postsynaptic wiring in G369i KI mice. While Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice lack evidence of cone synaptic responses, electrophysiological recordings in G369i KI mice revealed nominal transmission from cones to horizontal cells and bipolar cells. In CSNB2, we propose that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels maintain cone synaptic output provided that the nonconducting role of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in cone synaptogenesis remains intact. Our findings reveal an unexpected form of homeostatic plasticity that relies on a non-canonical role of an ion channel.

                Programmed cell death occurring during plant development (dPCD) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction. Here, we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus <i>Serendipita indica</i>, primarily in the differentiation zone. <i>smb-3</i> mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of <i>S. indica</i>-induced root-growth promotion. This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Additionally, reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that <i>BFN1</i> expression is downregulated during <i>S. indica</i> colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots.

">Prefrontal cortex encodes behavior states decoupled from movement</a></h4>

              
                Prefrontal cortex is often viewed as an extension of the motor system, but little is understood of how it relates to natural motor behavior. We therefore tracked the kinematics of freely moving rats performing minimally structured tasks and measured which aspects of behavior were read out in prefrontal neural populations. Naturalistic behaviors such as rearing or chasing a bait were each encoded by unique neural ensembles, but the behavioral representations were not anchored to posture or movement. Rather, the coding of kinematic features depended on their relevance to the animals' current behavior or which task the animal performed. Behavior-specific ensembles often preceded and outlasted physical actions and, accordingly, prefrontal population activity evolved at slower timescales than in motor cortex. These findings argue that prefrontal coding of behavior is not locked to motor output, and may instead reflect motivations to perform certain actions rather than the actions themselves.

">Melanin concentrating hormone projections to the nucleus accumbens enhance the reward value of food consumption and do not induce feeding or REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of food intake and energy balance is critical to survival. Hunger develops as a response to energy deficit and drives food-seeking and consumption. However, motivations to eat are varied in nature, and promoted by factors other than energy deficit. When dysregulated, non-homeostatic drives to consume can contribute to disorders of food intake, adding to the increasing prevalence of restrictive eating disorders and obesity. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons have been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior, in addition to a number of other fundamental behaviors including sleep, anxiety, and maternal behavior. Several studies suggest that MCH peptide increases food consumption, while studies of MCH neurons show effects only on cued feeding, and others show no effect of MCH neuron manipulation on feeding. MCH neurons have widespread projections to diverse downstream brain regions yet few studies have investigated the function of specific projections or differentiated the behaviors they regulate. Here we use optogenetics, in combination with different behavioral paradigms, to elucidate the role of MCH projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in sleep and feeding behavior. We show that MCH neurons projecting to the NAc do not induce changes in baseline feeding or REM sleep, but do enhance the preference for a food paired with optogenetic stimulation. Furthermore, this effect is diminished in female mice relative to males, in line with previous results suggesting sex differences in the functional role of MCH neurons. These results suggest that MCH projections to the NAc can enhance the rewarding value of consumed food.

">The Interaction Of Diet-Induced Obesity And Chronic Stress In A Mouse Model Of Menopause</a></h4>

              
                Menopause is characterized by the cessation of ovarian hormone production. During postmenopause, cisgender women face increased risks of obesity, cognitive decline, and mood disorder. Mood disorders are associated with exposure to chronic stress. We investigated the combined effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) and chronic stress exposure in a mouse model of menopause using 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), a selective ovotoxicant that gradually depletes ovarian follicles and hormones. Starting at 6 months, 82 female WT C57BL/6J mice received saline or VCD (130 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days per week for 3 weeks. One month after injection, mice were fed either low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD for 8 weeks followed by 6 weeks of chronic variable mild stress (CVMS). Post-CVMS, mice were either processed for gene expression of the anterodorsal BNST or behavior tests to assess cognitive and anxiety-related behaviors. Plasma samples were collected to analyze metabolic hormones and corticosterone levels. VCD-treated HFD-fed mice had higher fat and body mass, and elevated fasting glucose levels compared to controls and more pronounced avoidance behaviors and cognitive impairments. LFD-fed, VCD-treated mice exhibited less exploration of novel objects and open spaces compared to OIL and HFD counterparts. VCD elevated corticosterone levels on LFD and increased BNST Pacap gene expression on HFD. These findings highlight cognitive repercussions of estrogen deficiency and suggest a potential protective effect of a HFD against some of the adverse outcomes associated with menopause. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering dietary and hormonal interactions in the development of therapeutic strategies.

">Functional segregation of cortical hand and speech areas by frequency detuning of an intrinsic motor rhythm.</a></h4>

              
                Many decades after Penfield's (1937) classic depiction of the motor homunculus, it remains unclear how spatially contiguous and interconnected representations within human sensorimotor cortex might separate their activities to achieve the directed and precise control of distinct body regions evident in activities as different as typing and speaking. One long-standing but relatively neglected explanation draws from models of simple physical systems (like swinging pendulums) to posit that small differences in the oscillatory properties of neuronal populations (termed 'frequency detuning') can result in highly effective segregation of their activities and outputs. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the peak frequencies of beta-band (13-30 Hz) motor rhythms measured in a magnetoencephalographic neuroimaging study of finger and speech movements in a group of healthy adults and a group of typically developing children. Our results confirm a peak frequency task difference of about 1.5 Hz in the beta motor rhythms of both left and right hemispheres in adults. A comparable task difference was obtained in children for the left but not for the right hemisphere. These results provide novel support for the role of frequency detuning in the functional organisation of the brain and suggest that this mechanism should play a more prominent role in current models of bodily representations and their development within the sensorimotor cortex.

">Human single-neuron activity is modulated by intracranial theta burst stimulation of the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a highly connected cluster of nuclei with input from multiple sensory modalities, particularly the ventral visual stream, and vast projections to distributed cortical and subcortical regions involved in autonomic regulation and cognition. Numerous studies have described the amygdala's capacity to facilitate the encoding of long-lasting emotional memories. Recently, direct electrical stimulation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) in humans revealed a more generalized ability to enhance declarative memory irrespective of the emotional valence, likely by promoting synaptic plasticity-related processes underlying memory consolidation in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. These effects were achieved with rhythmic theta-burst stimulation (TBS), which is known to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a key mechanism in memory formation. Emerging evidence suggests that intracranial TBS may also enhance memory specificity, evoke theta-frequency oscillations, and facilitate short-term plasticity in local field potential recordings. However, how amygdalar TBS modulates activity at the single-cell level and to what extent this modulation is associated with memory performance remains poorly understood. Here, we address this knowledge gap by conducting simultaneous microelectrode recordings from prefrontal and medial temporal structures during a memory task in which intracranial TBS was applied to the BLA. We observed a subset of neurons whose firing rate was modulated by TBS and exhibited highly heterogeneous responses with respect to onset latency, duration, and direction of effect. Notably, location and baseline activity predicted which neurons were most susceptible to modulation. These findings provide direct empirical support for stimulation-evoked modulation of single-neuron activity in humans, which has implications for the development and refinement of neuromodulatory therapies.

">Modeling neuron-astrocyte interactions in neural networks using distributed simulation</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes engage in local interactions with neurons, synapses, other glial cell types, and the vasculature through intricate cellular and molecular processes, playing an important role in brain information processing, plasticity, cognition, and behavior. This study aims to enhance computational modeling of local interactions between neurons and astrocytes to better understand how these interactions influence the activity regimes in neuron-astrocyte networks and overall brain function. We develop new algorithms for representing astrocytes and neuron-astrocyte interactions in distributed simulation code for large-scale spiking neuronal networks. These include an astrocyte model with calcium dynamics, an extension of a standard neuron model to receive calcium-dependent signals from astrocytes, connections that deliver these signals to neurons, and a connectivity concept that efficiently establishes interactions between groups of three elements (pre- and postsynaptic neurons and astrocytes) in large neuron-astrocyte populations. The latter extends the conventional concept of binary connectivity in neuronal circuits. We verify the efficiency of our reference implementation through a series of benchmarks that vary in computing resources and neuron-astrocyte network model sizes. Using the new technology, we reproduce experimental data on astrocytic effects on neuronal synchronization. Our in silico experiments demonstrate that astrocytes consistently induce local synchronization in groups of neurons across various connectivity schemes and global activity regimes. Changing only the efficiency of neuron-astrocyte interactions switches the global activity regime from asynchronous to network-wide synchronization. Our contribution supports reproducible and collaborative large-scale modeling projects of neuron-astrocyte circuits, addressing the growing interest in developing these models within the computational neuroscience community.

">The organization of high-level visual cortex is aligned with visual rather than abstract linguistic information</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies show that linguistic representations predict the response of high-level visual cortex to images, suggesting an alignment between visual and linguistic information. Here, using iEEG, we tested the hypothesis that such alignment is limited to textual descriptions of the visual content of the image and would not appear for their abstract textual descriptions. We generated two types of textual descriptions for images of famous people and places: visual-text, describing the visual content of the image, and abstract-text, based on their Wikipedia definitions, and extracted their relational-structure representations from a large language model. We used these linguistic representations, along with visual representation of the images based on deep neural network, to predict the iEEG responses to images. Neural relational-structures in high-level visual cortex were similarly predicted by visual-images and visual-text, but not abstract-text representations. These results demonstrate that visual-language alignment in high-level visual cortex is limited to visually grounded language.

">Nimodipine reduces microglial activation in vitro as evidenced by morphological phenotype, phagocytic activity and next generation RNA sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nimodipine, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, achieves vasorelaxation by suppressing Ca2+-dependent activation of cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells and is used to prevent delayed ischemic deficit following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our preclinical drug repurposing studies raised the possibility that nimodipine may attenuate the pro-inflammatory shift in microglial function in response to brain injury. We analyzed the effects of nimodipine on activated microglia at the level of morphological and functional phenotypes, as well as their transcriptomic profile. Methods: Live brain slice preparations from C57BL/6 mice and primary microglia cultures from the cortex of neonatal Sprague Dawley rats were used. Brain slices were subjected to ischemia, and microglial cultures were activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 ng/ml). Both preparations were treated with nimodipine (5-10-20 M). The degree of arborization was evaluated in Iba1-stained microglia and expressed as a transformation index (TI). Phagocytic activity of cultured microglia was visualized using fluorescent microbeads. TNF levels in the cultures were measured with ELISA. Total RNA was isolated from microglia and processed for next generation RNA sequencing to determine differentially expressed genes. Results: Nimodipine suppressed the ameboid morphological transformation and increased phagocytosis triggered by ischemia in brain slices and LPS in microglia cultures. At the transcriptional level, LPS resulted in a pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype, affecting the expression of cytokines, the complement system and phagocytosis-related genes. Focusing on the role of calcium in microglial activation, LPS increased RNA transcription of ionotropic purinergic and some TRP channels but decreased the expression of voltage- and ligand-gated calcium channels. In the endoplasmic reticulum, LPS downregulated gene expression of Ryr and IP3 receptors and increased transcription of the SERCA calcium pump gene. Nimodipine co-administered with LPS altered the expression of 110 genes in the opposite direction to LPS activation, of which at least 20 were associated with microglial immune response, 7 with cell adhesion and 2 with autophagy regulation. Conclusion: The effect of nimodipine goes beyond cerebral vasorelaxation. Nimodipine attenuates microglial activation by modulating Ca2+-dependent gene expression involved in intracellular signaling cascades to drive microglial immune responses. Consideration should be given to expanding the medical field of indication of nimodipine.

">SIMPL: Scalable and hassle-free optimization of neural representations from behaviour</a></h4>

              
                High-dimensional neural activity in the brain is known to encode low-dimensional, time-evolving, behaviour-related variables. A fundamental goal of neural data analysis consists of identifying such variables and their mapping to neural activity. The canonical approach is to assume the latent variables are behaviour and visualize the subsequent tuning curves. However, significant mismatches between behaviour and the encoded variables may still exist --- the agent may be thinking of another location, or be uncertain of its own --- distorting the tuning curves and decreasing their interpretability. To address this issue a variety of methods have been proposed to learn this latent variable in an unsupervised manner; these techniques are typically expensive to train, come with many hyperparameters or scale poorly to large datasets complicating their adoption in practice. To solve these issues we propose SIMPL (Scalable Iterative Maximization of Population-coded Latents), an EM-style algorithm which iteratively optimizes latent variables and tuning curves. SIMPL is fast, scalable and exploits behaviour as an initial condition to further improve convergence and identifiability. We show SIMPL accurately recovers latent variables in biologically-inspired spatial and non-spatial tasks. When applied to a large rodent hippocampal dataset SIMPL efficiently finds a modified latent space with smaller, more numerous, and more uniformly-sized place fields than those based on behaviour, suggesting the brain may encode space with greater resolution than previously thought.

">Latent encoding of movement in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are classically thought to encode spatial features of visual stimuli through simple population codes: each neuron exhibits a preferred orientation and preferred spatial frequency that are invariant to other aspects of the visual stimulus. Here, we show that this simple rule does not apply to the representation of major features of stimulus motion, including stimulus direction and temporal frequency (TF). We collected an extensive dataset of cat V1 responses to stimuli covarying in orientation, direction, spatial frequency, and TF to assess the extent of motion selectivity. In over half of V1, we found that the preferred direction changed with stimulus TF, revealing four distinct map motifs embedded within V1's functional architecture. Additionally, preferred TF was mostly uniform across the cortical surface. Despite the lack of spatial modulation for the preferred TF map and the lack of invariance for the preferred direction map, we found using convolutional neural networks that direction, TF and stimulus speed can be accurately decoded from V1 responses at all cortical locations. These findings suggest that subtle modulations of V1 activity may convey fine information about stimulus motion, pointing to a novel primary sensory encoding mechanism despite complex co-variation of responses to multiple attributes across V1 neurons.

">Spectrum of gamma-Secretase dysfunction as a unifying predictor of ADAD age at onset across PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP causal genes</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (ADAD), caused by mutations in Presenilins (PSEN1/2) and Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) genes, typically manifests before age 65. Age at symptom onset (AAO) is relatively consistent among carriers of the same PSEN1 mutation, but more variable for PSEN2 and APP variants, with these mutations associated with later AAOs than PSEN1. Understanding this clinical variability is crucial for developing predictive models and tailored interventions in ADAD. Biochemical in vitro assessment of gamma-secretase function is valuable in evaluating PSEN1 variant pathogenicity, disease onset and progression. Here, we examined Abeta profiles' relationships to AAO across causal genes. Our analysis showed linear correlations between mutation-induced shifts in Abeta profiles and AAO for PSEN2 and APP mutations. Integration with PSEN1 data revealed parallel but shifted correlations, indicating a common pathogenic mechanism with gene-specific onset timing shifts. Our data support a unified model of ADAD pathogenesis wherein gamma-secretase dysfunction and shifts in Abeta profiles define disease onset. This biochemical analysis of ADAD causality and established quantitative relationships deepen our understanding of ADAD pathogenesis, offering potential for predictive AAO modelling with implications for clinical practice, genetic research and development of therapeutic strategies modulating gamma-secretase across ADAD forms and potentially more broadly in AD.

">Hippocampal OLM interneurons regulate CA1 place cell plasticity and remapping</a></h4>

              
                OLM interneurons selectively target inhibition to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus but the role of this unique morphology in controlling place cell physiology remains a mystery. Here we show that OLM activity prevents associative synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells by inhibiting dendritic Ca2+ signalling initiated by entorhinal synaptic inputs. Furthermore, we find that OLM activity is reduced in novel environments suggesting that reducing OLM activity and thereby enhancing excitatory synaptic plasticity is important for the formation of new place cell representations. Supporting this, we show that selectively increasing OLM activity in novel environments enhances place cell stability and reduces remapping of newly formed place cells whilst increasing OLM activity in familiar environments led only to a transient silencing of place cells. Our results therefore demonstrate a critical role for distal dendrite targeting interneurons in regulating plasticity of neuronal representations.

">Relationships between migraine and interoception: normal accuracy but altered sensibility and behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Background: Migraine is typically precipitated by unaccustomed changes in one's internal state and/or external environment. Migraine symptoms largely involve increased, noxious, awareness of bodily changes and external stimuli. Links have been proposed between migraine and interoception (sensing and interpreting internal states), but direct evidence is limited. Methods: Unmedicated, otherwise healthy, age-matched female participants were grouped by migraine tendency: control (no unprovoked headaches, n=19); low-frequency (<=3 migraines/month, n=20); high-frequency (>=4 migraines/month, n=19). Interoception was assessed, interictally, with standardised questionnaires such as MAIA-2 and a widely used heartbeat counting task. Results: The notable significant questionnaire-based difference was in the 'noticing', 'not distracting' domain of the MAIA-2; controls were least likely to continue activities despite experiencing physical discomfort, and high-frequency migraineurs most likely. Follow-up questioning clarified that this behaviour related predominantly to migraine-related symptoms. The heartbeat task found no differences in accuracy, but lower confidence in the low-frequency migraine group than the control and high-frequency groups. Conclusions: We suggest that low interoceptive confidence is a risk factor for migraine, whilst amplification of interoceptive signals caused by migraine restores this confidence, but at the price of migraine's disabling symptoms. Self-reported tendency to deliberately ignore physical discomfort, including that caused by migraine, may result in more migraine attacks.

                While sounds are essential for human development, existing research primarily emphasizes visual and spatial memory and speech in relation to auditory processes, with a lack of a cohesive understanding of memory mechanisms for non-verbal sounds. This systematic review and coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings aims to comprehensively organize the literature for identifying the key brain mechanisms involved in short-term memory, working memory, and long-term memory for non-verbal auditory information. Additionally, we aimed to identify whether and how individual differences in neural memory processes related to auditory expertise (musicianship), aging or auditory impairments such as amusia are explored in the literature. Our review included ninety studies meeting the selection criteria, with only thirteen studies containing brain coordinates could be included in the meta-analysis. The coordinate-based meta-analysis identified a frontal hub for non-verbal auditory memory encompassing the medial frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus and superior frontal gyrus.

	<p>Background: Intracranial AVMs are a highly heterogeneous group of lesions that, while not very common, can pose significant risks. The therapeutic management of AVMs is complicated by ambiguous guidelines, particularly regarding which Spetzler&amp;amp;ndash;Martin grades should dictate specific treatment options. This study analyzed the clinical presentations and treatment approaches of 128 brain AVM cases managed between 2014 and 2022 at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurovascular Diseases in Bucharest, Romania. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patient demographics, clinical symptoms, Spetzler&amp;amp;ndash;Martin categorization, nidus localization, therapeutic management, and outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed using Python 3.10. Results: In our cohort of patients, the median age was 45 years, with a slight male predominance (67 males, 61 females). At admission, 51.5% presented with elevated blood pressure. The majority of patients had a Spetzler&amp;amp;ndash;Martin score of 2 (37.5%), followed by scores of 3 (31.3%) and 1 (20.3%). Treatment strategies included microsurgical resection in 32% of cases, conservative management in 31.2%, Gamma Knife radiosurgery in 22.6%, and endovascular embolization in 13.3%. Notably, open surgery was predominantly chosen for Grade II AVMs. The functional outcomes were favorable, with 69.5% achieving a good recovery score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Only four in-hospital deaths occurred, all in patients who underwent open surgery, and no deaths were recorded during the two-year follow-up. Conclusions: AVMs within the same Spetzler&amp;amp;ndash;Martin grade display considerable complexity, necessitating personalized treatment strategies. Our findings highlight the limitations of open surgery for Grade I cases but affirm its effectiveness for Grade II AVMs.</p>

	<p>Objectives. Brain&amp;amp;ndash;behavior connections are a new means to evaluate sports performance. This electroencephalogram (EEG) study aims to estimate endurance exercise performance by investigating eigenvalue trends and comparing their sensitivity and linearity. Methods. Twenty-three cross-country skiers completed endurance cycling tasks. Twenty-four-channel full-brain EEG signals were recorded in the motor phase and recovery phase continuously. Eighteen EEG eigenvalues calculation methods were collected, commonly used in previous research. Time-frequency, band power, and nonlinear analyses were used to calculate the EEG eigenvalues. Their regression coefficients and correlation coefficients were calculated and compared, with the linear regression method. Results. The time-frequency eigenvalues shift slightly throughout the test. The power eigenvalues changed significantly before and after motor and recovery, but the linearity was not satisfactory. The sensitivity and linearity of the nonlinear eigenvalues were stronger than the other eigenvalues. Of all eigenvalues, Shannon entropy showed completely non-overlapping distribution intervals in the regression coefficients of the two phases, which were &amp;amp;minus;0.1474 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.0806 s&amp;amp;minus;1 in the motor phase and 0.2560 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.1365 s&amp;amp;minus;1 in the recovery phase. Shannon entropy amplitude decreased more in the F region of the brain than in the other regions. Additionally, the higher the level of sport, the slower the decline in Shannon entropy of the athlete. Conclusions. The Shannon entropy method provided more accurate estimations for endurance exercise performance compared to other eigenvalues.</p>

                Spigelian hernia is an uncommon form of ventral hernia, with an incidence ranging from 0.1% to 2%. This case report describes a 72-year-old female who presented with an obstructed right Spigelian hernia, a left Spigelian hernia, and an uncomplicated Meckel’s diverticulum, along with the management approach. The patient had experienced intermittent tenderness in the right iliac fossa for the last two months, which had worsened to severe pain over the previous two days, accompanied by a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an obstructed right Spigelian hernia containing dilated proximal small bowel, and a left uncomplicated spigelian hernia. The patient experienced worsening abdominal pain and vomiting. Emergency laparotomy was performed, revealing a right Spigelian hernia with viable small bowel loops, a non-complicated Meckel’s diverticulum located 20 cm from the ileocecal valve, and a small left Spigelian hernia. The right Spigelian hernia was repaired using intraperitoneal sublay mesh, while the left hernia was treated with primary repair. No bowel resection was performed at the site of the Meckel’s diverticulum, as it was non-inflamed, to prevent contamination of the mesh with bowel flora. Bilateral Spigelian hernias accompanied by Meckel’s diverticulum present a challenging clinical scenario. Although rare, this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain due to the potential for serious complications.

                <p>This study aims to elucidate the methodology and compare the accuracy of different blood biomarkers for diagnosing ischemic stroke (IS). We reviewed 29 articles retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus with Full Text. Among these, 23 articles involving 3,494 participants were suitable for meta-analysis. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) of all studies for meta-analysis was 0.89. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 (0.74&ndash;0.78) and 0.84 (0.83&ndash;0.86), respectively. Blood biomarkers from noninpatient settings demonstrated better diagnostic performance than those in inpatient settings (AUC 0.91 vs 0.88). Smaller sample sizes (&lt;100) showed better performance than larger ones (&ge;100; AUC 0.92 vs 0.86). Blood biomarkers from acute IS (AIS) patients showed higher diagnostic values than those from IS and other stroke types (AUC 0.91 vs 0.87). The diagnostic performance of multiple blood biomarkers was superior to that of a single biomarker (AUC 0.91 vs 0.88). The diagnostic value of blood biomarkers from Caucasians was higher than that from Asians and Africans (AUC 0.90 vs 0.89, 0.75). Blood biomarkers from those with comorbidities (AUC 0.92) showed a better diagnostic performance than those not reporting comorbidities (AUC 0.84). All the subgroups analyzed, including setting, sample size, target IS population, blood biomarker profiling, ethnicity, and comorbidities could lead to heterogeneity. Blood biomarkers have demonstrated sufficient diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing IS and hold promise for integration into routine clinical practice. However, further research is recommended to refine the optimal model for utilizing blood biomarkers in IS diagnosis.</p>

                Background COVID-19 pandemics increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk during hospitalization, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Limited radiological diagnosis in pandemic requires a guided protocol for anticoagulant adjustment. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center as part of a quality improvement program evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation protocols. The study focused on implementing a guideline for anticoagulant dosing protocol based on dynamic changes in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The dosing guideline allowed for dose escalation from standard prophylactic levels to escalated prophylactic or therapeutic levels, depending on the patient's risk profile for VTE. The primary endpoints included in-hospital survival comparing between fix and dynamic adjustment treatment groups. Secondary endpoints encompassed major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events, incidence of breakthrough thrombosis, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, days of mechanical ventilator use, and survival duration. Findings Among the 260 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020. The patients received fixed anticoagulant dosage in 188, 72.3%) patients, while 72 (27.7%) were up-titrated according to the protocol. In-hospital survival at 30 days demonstrated superiority among patients whose anticoagulation was up-titrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (80.2%) compared to receiving fixed anticoagulant dosage (51.3%) (p=0.01). Bleeding events were significantly higher in up-titrate group (12.5%) compared to fixed anticoagulant dosage group (2.13%). Most of them are CRNMB. Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer-based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 holds promise in improving in-hospital mortality rates without a significant increase in fatal bleeding events.

                Background Technology enhances teaching and learning quality, yet when educators lack tech proficiency, it hinders effective education and leads to frustration, lower confidence, and self-doubt. This study aims to investigate the experiences of university faculty members in relation to the impact of technology on their mental well-being. Methods Using a qualitative approach (grounded theory), ten university faculty members were selected for in-depth interviews based on criteria such as teaching experience, tenure, specific courses or subjects taught, and active engagement during the research period. The guiding research question, “What are the experiences and perceptions of university faculty members concerning techno-stress?” directed the study’s focus. The instrument (interview guide) that measured techno-stress consisted of 12 items and was administered virtually. Data were analyzed thematically to uncover common stressors, adaptive strategies, and institutional challenges faced by faculty in adapting to technology’s demands and work overload. Additionally, the study identified four subcategories: work overload, social and emotional interaction, adaption to new technologies, and expectations and teaching quality. Results Techno-stress is a composite of emotional and physical reactions triggered by the improper use of technology. Faculty members’ encounters with techno-stress have substantial implications for their quality of life. Conclusions This research highlights technology’s positive impact on higher education but notes faculty struggles with techno-stress, emphasizing the need for training, support, and boundaries to maintain work-life balance and enhance educational quality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-958/v3?src=rss">The macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries: A panel data analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Background Fenugreek, or Trigonella foenum-graecum L, is an edible and medicinal plant of the Fabaceae family. Fenugreek seeds contain a variety of phytochemicals, including proteins, lipids, amino acids, vitamins, flavonoids, steroidal saponins, coumarin, and alkaloids. Trigonelline TG is a bioactive plant alkaloid initially extracted from fenugreek seeds. A substantial portion of fenugreek’s health benefits may rely on the presence of TG. This study addresses the research gap for a fast, green, and economical method for quantifying trigonelline (TG) in fenugreek. Methods Fenugreek seeds from various origins were extracted using three green solvents: acetone (ACt), ethanol (EtOH), and water (H2O). The UPLCMSMS method was developed and validated using a green mobile phase of H2O: EtOH, and an r2-value of 0.999 in the linearity range of 0.1-500 ppb was adopted. The method was validated with an accuracy of 98.6% for trace analysis of TG using a small amount (10 mg) of fenugreek samples from five different origins. Results The average extract yield (±SD) was 5.36±6.3, with the highest extract yield observed in H2O. The ESI (+ve) of the UPLCMSMS resulted in the fragmentation pattern (m/z) 138→94.10→92.05→78.20. The TG quantification revealed an average TG concentration of 181.4, with the highest amount of TG in H2O extract (392.7±132.4 ppb), followed by EtOH (91.9±83.3 ppb) and ACt (59.5±30.9 ppb). The TG amount observed in the validation step substantiated the efficiency and reproducibility of the developed method. Conclusions The method may be used as an effective tool for a green, rapid, economical, and eco-friendly extraction and quantification of TG in diverse matrices of pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, herbal, and food products.

                <p>by Sven B. Gould, Jonas Magiera, Carolina García García, Parth K. Raval</p>

Mitochondria and plastids import thousands of proteins. Their experimental localisation remains a frequent task, but can be resource-intensive and sometimes impossible. Hence, hundreds of studies make use of algorithms that predict a localisation based on a protein’s sequence. Their reliability across evolutionary diverse species is unknown. Here, we evaluate the performance of common algorithms (TargetP, Localizer and WoLFPSORT) for four photosynthetic eukaryotes (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Zea mays</i>, <i>Physcomitrium patens</i>, and <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) for which experimental plastid and mitochondrial proteome data is available, and 171 eukaryotes using orthology inferences. The match between predictions and experimental data ranges from 75% to as low as 2%. Results worsen as the evolutionary distance between training and query species increases, especially for plant mitochondria for which performance borders on random sampling. Specificity, sensitivity and precision analyses highlight cross-organelle errors and uncover the evolutionary divergence of organelles as the main driver of current performance issues. The results encourage to train the next generation of neural networks on an evolutionary more diverse set of organelle proteins for optimizing performance and reliability.

Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool that compares perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles. Typically a sample is represented by averaging across cells, but this fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. We introduce CytoSummaryNet: a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30–68% in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework, providing an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies. Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells. The approach requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets. CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets.

                <p>by Andrew J. Anderson, Chris Davis, Edmund C. Lalor</p>

To transform continuous speech into words, the human brain must resolve variability across utterances in intonation, speech rate, volume, accents and so on. A promising approach to explaining this process has been to model electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain responses to speech. Contemporary models typically invoke context invariant speech categories (e.g. phonemes) as an intermediary representational stage between sounds and words. However, such models may not capture the complete picture because they do not model the brain mechanism that categorizes sounds and consequently may overlook associated neural representations. By providing end-to-end accounts of speech-to-text transformation, new deep-learning systems could enable more complete brain models. We model EEG recordings of audiobook comprehension with the deep-learning speech recognition system Whisper. We find that (1) Whisper provides a self-contained EEG model of an intermediary representational stage that reflects elements of prelexical and lexical representation and prediction; (2) EEG modeling is more accurate when informed by 5-10s of speech context, which traditional context invariant categorical models do not encode; (3) Deep Whisper layers encoding linguistic structure were more accurate EEG models of selectively attended speech in two-speaker “cocktail party” listening conditions than early layers encoding acoustics. No such layer depth advantage was observed for unattended speech, consistent with a more superficial level of linguistic processing in the brain.

                <p>by Toshihito Umegaki, Hisashi Moriizumi, Fumiko Ogushi, Mutsuhiro Takekawa, Takashi Suzuki</p>

The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition (contact inhibition) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics (MD) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages. The source codes are freely available.

                <p>by Ciara Judge, Timothy Vaughan, Timothy Russell, Sam Abbott, Louis du Plessis, Tanja Stadler, Oliver Brady, Sarah Hill</p>

Accurately estimating the effective reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) of a circulating pathogen is a fundamental challenge in the study of infectious disease. The fields of epidemiology and pathogen phylodynamics both share this goal, but to date, methodologies and data employed by each remain largely distinct. Here we present EpiFusion: a joint approach that can be used to harness the complementary strengths of each field to improve estimation of outbreak dynamics for large and poorly sampled epidemics, such as arboviral or respiratory virus outbreaks, and validate it for retrospective analysis. We propose a model of R<sub>t</sub> that estimates outbreak trajectories conditional upon both phylodynamic (time-scaled trees estimated from genetic sequences) and epidemiological (case incidence) data. We simulate stochastic outbreak trajectories that are weighted according to epidemiological and phylodynamic observation models and fit using particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo. To assess performance, we test EpiFusion on simulated outbreaks in which transmission and/or surveillance rapidly changes and find that using EpiFusion to combine epidemiological and phylodynamic data maintains accuracy and increases certainty in trajectory and R<sub>t</sub> estimates, compared to when each data type is used alone. We benchmark EpiFusion’s performance against existing methods to estimate R<sub>t</sub> and demonstrate advances in speed and accuracy. Importantly, our approach scales efficiently with dataset size. Finally, we apply our model to estimate R<sub>t</sub> during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. EpiFusion is designed to accommodate future extensions that will improve its utility, such as explicitly modelling population structure, accommodations for phylogenetic uncertainty, and the ability to weight the contributions of genomic or case incidence to the inference.

Modeling the network topology of the human brain within the mesoscale has become an increasing focus within the neuroscientific community due to its variation across diverse cognitive processes, in the presence of neuropsychiatric disease or injury, and over the lifespan. Much research has been done on the creation of algorithms to detect these mesoscopic structures, called communities or modules, but less has been done to conduct inference on these structures. The literature on analysis of these community detection algorithms has focused on comparing them within the same subject. These approaches, however, either do not accomodate a more general association between community structure and an outcome or cannot accommodate additional covariates that may confound the association of interest. We propose a semiparametric kernel machine regression model for either a continuous or binary outcome, where covariate effects are modeled parametrically and brain connectivity measures are measured nonparametrically. By incorporating notions of similarity between network community structures into a kernel distance function, the high-dimensional feature space of brain networks, defined on input pairs, can be generalized to non-linear spaces, allowing for a wider class of distance-based algorithms. We evaluate our proposed methodology on both simulated and real datasets.

Neoantigen immunogenicity prediction is a highly challenging problem in the development of personalised medicines. Low reactivity rates in called neoantigens result in a difficult prediction scenario with limited training datasets. Here we describe ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach to immunogenicity prediction for CD8+ reactive epitopes. ImmugenX comprises of a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module and a set of context specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. Compared with state-of-the-art models for each task, ImmugenX’s encoding module performs comparably or better on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction and stability tasks. ImmugenX outperforms all compared models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.619, average precision: 0.514), with a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model. ImmugenX shows further improved performance on immunogenicity prediction with the integration of TCR context information. ImmugenX performance is further analysed for interpretability, which locates areas of weakness found across existing immunogenicity models and highlight possible biases in public datasets.

                <p>by Martina Bukač, Sunčica Čanić, Boris Muha, Yifan Wang</p>

We develop a computational algorithm based on a diffuse interface approach to study the design of bioartificial organ scaffold architectures. These scaffolds, composed of poroelastic hydrogels housing transplanted cells, are linked to the patient’s blood circulation via an anastomosis graft. Before entering the scaffold, the blood flow passes through a filter, and the resulting filtered blood plasma transports oxygen and nutrients to sustain the viability of transplanted cells over the long term. A key issue in maintaining cell viability is the design of ultrafiltrate channels within the hydrogel scaffold to facilitate advection-enhanced oxygen supply ensuring oxygen levels remain above a critical threshold to prevent hypoxia. In this manuscript, we develop a computational algorithm to analyze the plasma flow and oxygen concentration within hydrogels featuring various channel geometries. Our objective is to identify the optimal hydrogel channel architecture that sustains oxygen concentration throughout the scaffold above the critical hypoxic threshold.
The computational algorithm we introduce here employs a diffuse interface approach to solve a multi-physics problem. The corresponding model couples the time-dependent Stokes equations, governing blood plasma flow through the channel network, with the time-dependent Biot equations, characterizing Darcy velocity, pressure, and displacement within the poroelastic hydrogel containing the transplanted cells. Subsequently, the calculated plasma velocity is utilized to determine oxygen concentration within the scaffold using a diffuse interface advection-reaction-diffusion model. Our investigation yields a scaffold architecture featuring a hexagonal network geometry that meets the desired oxygen concentration criteria. Unlike classical sharp interface approaches, the diffuse interface approach we employ is particularly adept at addressing problems with intricate interface geometries, such as those encountered in bioartificial organ scaffold design. This study is significant because recent developments in hydrogel fabrication make it now possible to control hydrogel rheology and utilize computational results to generate optimized scaffold architectures.

                <p>by Christian Jarvers, Heiko Neumann</p>

Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system. One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision. Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape, deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture. While this problem has been widely documented, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We design simple, artificial image datasets in which shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict the image class. By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features. We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision.

                <p>by Jyoti Tanwar, Kriti Ahuja, Akshay Sharma, Paras Sehgal, Gyan Ranjan, Farina Sultan, Anushka Agrawal, Donato D’Angelo, Anshu Priya, Vamsi K. Yenamandra, Archana Singh, Anna Raffaello, Muniswamy Madesh, Rosario Rizzuto, Sridhar Sivasubbu, Rajender K. Motiani</p>

Mitochondria regulate several physiological functions through mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. However, role of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in melanosome biology remains unknown. Here, we show that pigmentation requires mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. In vitro gain and loss of function studies demonstrate that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) is crucial for melanogenesis while MCU rheostat, MCUb negatively control melanogenesis. Zebrafish, MCU<sup>+/-</sup> and MCUb<sup>-/-</sup> mice models show that MCU complex drives pigmentation in vivo. Mechanistically, MCU silencing activates transcription factor NFAT2 to induce expression of keratin (5, 7, and 8) filaments. Interestingly, keratin5 in turn augments mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and potentiates melanogenesis by regulating melanosome biogenesis and maturation. Hence this signaling module acts as a negative feedback loop that fine-tunes both mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and pigmentation. Notably, mitoxantrone, an FDA approved drug that inhibits MCU, reduces pigmentation thereby highlighting therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake for clinical management of pigmentary disorders. Taken together, we reveal an MCU-NFAT2-Keratin5 driven signaling axis that acts as a critical determinant of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and pigmentation. Given the vital role of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and keratin filaments in cellular physiology, this feedback loop could be operational in a variety of other patho-physiological processes.

                <p>by Chelsea A. Simpson, Zach R. Celentano, Nicholas W. Haas, James B. McKinlay, Carey D. Nadell, Julia C. van Kessel</p>

Bacteria sense population density via the cell–cell communication system called quorum sensing (QS). The evolution of QS and its maintenance or loss in mixed bacterial communities is highly relevant to understanding how cell–cell signaling impacts bacterial fitness and competition, particularly under varying environmental conditions such as nutrient availability. We uncovered a phenomenon in which <i>Vibrio</i> cells grown in minimal medium optimize expression of the methionine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthesis genes via QS. Strains that are genetically “locked” at high cell density grow slowly in minimal glucose media and suppressor mutants accumulate via inactivating-mutations in <i>metF</i> (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) and <i>luxR</i> (the master QS transcriptional regulator). In mixed cultures, QS mutant strains initially coexist with wild type, but as glucose is depleted, wild type outcompetes the QS mutants. Thus, QS regulation of methionine/THF synthesis is a fitness benefit that links nutrient availability and cell density, preventing accumulation of QS-defective mutants.

                <p>by David Richter, Tim C. Kietzmann, Floris P. de Lange</p>

Perception is shaped by both incoming sensory input and expectations derived from our prior knowledge. Numerous studies have shown stronger neural activity for surprising inputs, suggestive of predictive processing. However, it is largely unclear what predictions are made across the cortical hierarchy, and therefore what kind of surprise drives this up-regulation of activity. Here, we leveraged fMRI in human volunteers and deep neural network (DNN) models to arbitrate between 2 hypotheses: prediction errors may signal a local mismatch between input and expectation at each level of the cortical hierarchy, or prediction errors may be computed at higher levels and the resulting surprise signal is broadcast to earlier areas in the cortical hierarchy. Our results align with the latter hypothesis. Prediction errors in both low- and high-level visual cortex responded to high-level, but not low-level, visual surprise. This scaling with high-level surprise in early visual cortex strongly diverged from feedforward tuning. Combined, our results suggest that high-level predictions constrain sensory processing in earlier areas, thereby aiding perceptual inference.

                Background A holistic architectural education is the culmination of learning knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values, which eventually reflects in the quality of graduates. Even though different schools of thought have made various kinds of qualitative contributions towards the evolution of architectural education in India, it has largely been dominated by the quantitative and technical aspects of its regulating framework. Architects engage with the demanding contradictions between responsibilities of an ethical nature, the dynamic challenges of practice, and the intricacies of architectural imagination. The aesthetical and imaginative foundations of the field make it incumbent upon the architects to possess a balance of ecumenical proficiencies for accountability and personalization. The purpose of the study is to identify relevant attributes of Competency Based Education (CBE) that can be adopted for architectural education in India. Methods This research follows a narrative review approach and a descriptive-analytic method to broadly understand the attributes of CBE and its potential relevance to architectural education in India. 323 articles were searched on various search strings based on their relevance to the inquiry. 76 documents written in English language were included and appraised through the Scale of the Assessment for Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tool to avoid any risk of bias. The PRISMA 2020 checklist and flow diagram has been used to report the findings of this narrative review. Result The study identifies eight critical parameters of CBE with respect to its definitions, origins, transitions, regulatory environment, characteristics, approaches and implications on teaching-learning, frameworks and models of assessment; and challenges, which makes a case for the relevance of CBE for architectural education in India, which hasn’t been explored yet. Conclusion The broader expectations of ‘being competent’ can be addressed through a conscious adoption of strategies of relevant attributes of CBE which can encourage building attitudes and temperament for life-long learning.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Dental fluorosis, a condition characterized by enamel hypoplasia caused by excessive fluoride intake, can potentially affect the adhesion of dental materials. This systematic review aimed to assess the influence of dental fluorosis on shear bond strength (SBS) and to provide clinical recommendations. A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted, followed by a rigorous selection process to include relevant in vitro studies. The quality of the included studies was assessed and data were extracted for analysis. Based on these findings, it is recommended to consider alternative bonding techniques or to use specific dental materials for fluorosis-affected teeth. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the potential impact of dental fluorosis on shear bond strength and develop more targeted clinical strategies.

                Background Ethiopia’s potato seed system is currently hindered by a disjointed regulatory framework, insufficient quality assurance processes, and a lack of collaboration among stakeholders, which collectively impede agricultural productivity and food security. The regulatory environment is characterized by inconsistent seed certification practices and a dependence on informal seed sources, negatively affecting the quality of potato seeds available to farmers. Although potatoes play a crucial role in global food security by providing high yields compared to other staple crops, the sector grapples with significant challenges due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, limited technical expertise, and the widespread presence of counterfeit seeds throughout the value chain. Methods To tackle these challenges, this mini-review outlines potential improvements, stressing the necessity for a unified regulatory framework tailored to the unique issues of vegetatively propagated crops. For this reason, we have used different literature source from web of science, Pubmed, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and other scientific websites. We have documented the most relevant information focusing on potato seed system, regulatory frameworks, quality assurance bottlenecks and pathways for improvement across the seed value chain. Results our paper highlights key recommendations that includes enhancing training for regulatory staff, investing in research for disease-resistant varieties, and bolstering public-private partnerships to encourage innovation and resource sharing. Furthermore, improving traceability in the seed supply chain is essential for maintaining seed quality and integrity. Conclusions This review calls for a comprehensive strategy that fosters stakeholder engagement and promotes sustainable practices to rejuvenate Ethiopia’s potato seed system, thereby supporting the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers and strengthening national food security through integrated seed sector development and capacity improvement of the seed regulatory body as well as smallholder farmers.

                Background Current health recommender systems lack interactivity that relates to the current situation. Methods We designed and implemented an intervention study for obese patients that incorporates context information obtained from smartphone and smartwatch sensors, gamification, as well as joint goal management of patients and health coaches. We developed a health behaviour recommendation system comprising of a smartphone application, cloud platform for data management, and a data dashboard for coaches. Results We conducted a three months long study and analysed data from eight patients, focusing on system function, patient adherence, satisfaction and overall impact of the proposed system on changing health-related habits. Along with data analysis, we also provide patient feedback collected during interview round after the end of the study. Conclusion Patients could successfully implement the goals using the EghiFit app. Challenges regarding the data collection, recommendation synthesis, and patient engagement persist. Furthermore, reliable sensor data processing on current smartphone platforms is difficult due to system restrictions. Future research should further integrate sensor data, gaming, and health behaviour intervention design using smart devices.

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials and Gen Z”. Narcissism refers to a personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behavior, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of assessing correlations between perceived health, perceived oral health, selfie-taking behavior, narcissism and oral health behavior in an adolescent population. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque using DMFT index and Plaque index. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form. Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                Background Chromatin loops play a critical role in gene regulation by connecting regulatory loci and gene promoters. The identification of changes in chromatin looping between cell types or biological conditions is an important task for understanding gene regulation; however, the manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization of data sets describing 3D chromatin structure is challenging due to the large and complex nature of the relevant data sets. Methods Here, we describe a workflow for identifying and visualizing differential chromatin loops from Hi-C data from two biological conditions using the ‘mariner’, ‘DESeq2’ and ‘plotgardener’ Bioconductor/R packages. The workflow assumes that Hi-C data has been processed into ‘.hic’ or ‘.cool’ files and that loops have been identified using an existing loop-calling algorithm. Results First, the ‘mariner’ package is used to merge redundant loop calls and extract interaction frequency counts. Next, ‘DESeq2’ is used to identify loops that exhibit differential contact frequencies between conditions. Finally, ‘plotgardener’ is used to visualize differential loops. Conclusion Chromatin interaction data is an important modality for understanding the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. The workflow presented here outlines the use of ‘mariner’ as a tool to manipulate, extract, and aggregate chromatin interaction data, ‘DESeq2’ to perform differential analysis of these data across conditions, samples, and replicates, and ‘plotgardener’ to explore and visualize the results.

                Across species, social behaviors are shaped and maintained through positive reinforcement of affiliative social interactions. As with nonsocial rewards, the reinforcing properties of social interactions have been shown to involve interplay between various brain regions and the mesolimbic reward system. In this review, we summarize findings from rodent research on the neural circuits that encode and mediate different components of social reward-seeking behavior. We explore methods to parse and study social reward-related behaviors using available behavioral paradigms. We also compare the neural mechanisms that support social versus nonsocial reward-seeking. Finally, we discuss how internal state and neuromodulatory systems affect reward-seeking behavior and the neural circuits that underlie social reward.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98169">Derivation and internal validation of prediction models for pulmonary hypertension risk assessment in a cohort inhabiting Tibet, China</a></h4>

              
                Individuals residing in plateau regions are susceptible to pulmonary hypertension (PH) and there is an urgent need for a prediction nomogram to assess the risk of PH in this population. A total of 6603 subjects were randomly divided into a derivation set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Optimal predictive features were identified through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression technique, and nomograms were constructed using multivariate logistic regression. The performance of these nomograms was evaluated and validated using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, and decision curve analysis. Comparisons between nomograms were conducted using the net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) indices. Nomogram<sup>I</sup> was established based on independent risk factors, including gender, Tibetan ethnicity, age, incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB), atrial fibrillation (AF), sinus tachycardia (ST), and T wave changes (TC). The AUCs for Nomogram<sup>I</sup> were 0.716 in the derivation set and 0.718 in the validation set. Nomogram<sup>II</sup> was established based on independent risk factors, including Tibetan ethnicity, age, right axis deviation, high voltage in the right ventricle, IRBBB, AF, pulmonary P waves, ST, and TC. The AUCs for Nomogram<sup>II</sup> were 0.844 in the derivation set and 0.801 in the validation set. Both nomograms demonstrated satisfactory clinical consistency. The IDI and NRI indices confirmed that Nomogram<sup>II</sup> outperformed Nomogram<sup>I</sup>. Therefore, the online dynamic Nomogram<sup>II</sup> was established to predict the risks of PH in the plateau population.

                Animals navigate by learning the spatial layout of their environment. We investigated spatial learning of mice in an open maze where food was hidden in one of a hundred holes. Mice leaving from a stable entrance learned to efficiently navigate to the food without the need for landmarks. We developed a quantitative framework to reveal how the mice estimate the food location based on analyses of trajectories and active hole checks. After learning, the computed ‘target estimation vector’ (TEV) closely approximated the mice’s route and its hole check distribution. The TEV required learning both the direction and distance of the start to food vector, and our data suggests that different learning dynamics underlie these estimates. We propose that the TEV can be precisely connected to the properties of hippocampal place cells. Finally, we provide the first demonstration that, after learning the location of two food sites, the mice took a shortcut between the sites, demonstrating that they had generated a cognitive map.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94657">The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF220 maintains hindbrain Hox expression patterns through regulation of WDR5 stability</a></h4>

              
                The spatial and temporal linear expression of <i>Hox</i> genes establishes a regional <i>Hox</i> code, which is crucial for the antero-posterior (A-P) patterning, segmentation, and neuronal circuit development of the hindbrain. RNF220, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is widely involved in neural development via targeting of multiple substrates. Here, we found that the expression of <i>Hox</i> genes in the pons was markedly up-regulated at the late developmental stage (post-embryonic day E15.5) in <i>Rnf220<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mouse embryos. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed different <i>Hox</i> de-repression profiles in different groups of neurons, including the pontine nuclei (PN). The <i>Hox</i> pattern was disrupted and the neural circuits were affected in the PN of <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice. We showed that this phenomenon was mediated by WDR5, a key component of the TrxG complex, which can be polyubiquitinated and degraded by RNF220. Intrauterine injection of WDR5 inhibitor (WDR5-IN-4) and genetic ablation of <i>Wdr5</i> in <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice largely recovered the de-repressed <i>Hox</i> expression pattern in the hindbrain. In P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, the retinoic acid-induced <i>Hox</i> expression was further stimulated by <i>Rnf220</i> knockdown, which can also be rescued by <i>Wdr5</i> knockdown. In short, our data suggest a new role of RNF220/WDR5 in <i>Hox</i> pattern maintenance and pons development in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95595">Large-scale characterization of drug mechanism of action using proteome-wide thermal shift assays</a></h4>

              
                In response to an ever-increasing demand of new small molecules therapeutics, numerous chemical and genetic tools have been developed to interrogate compound mechanism of action. Owing to its ability to approximate compound-dependent changes in thermal stability, the proteome-wide thermal shift assay has emerged as a powerful tool in this arsenal. The most recent iterations have drastically improved the overall efficiency of these assays, providing an opportunity to screen compounds at a previously unprecedented rate. Taking advantage of this advance, we quantified more than one million thermal stability measurements in response to multiple classes of therapeutic and tool compounds (96 compounds in living cells and 70 compounds in lysates). When interrogating the dataset as a whole, approximately 80% of compounds (with quantifiable targets) caused a significant change in the thermal stability of an annotated target. There was also a wealth of evidence portending off-target engagement despite the extensive use of the compounds in the laboratory and/or clinic. Finally, the combined application of cell- and lysate-based assays, aided in the classification of primary (direct ligand binding) and secondary (indirect) changes in thermal stability. Overall, this study highlights the value of these assays in the drug development process by affording an unbiased and reliable assessment of compound mechanism of action.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87962">A distributed brain response predicting the facial expression of acute nociceptive pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain is a private experience observable through various verbal and non-verbal behavioural manifestations, each of which may relate to different pain-related functions. Despite the importance of understanding the cerebral mechanisms underlying those manifestations, there is currently limited knowledge of the neural correlates of the facial expression of pain. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, noxious heat stimulation was applied in healthy volunteers and we tested if previously published brain signatures of pain were sensitive to pain expression. We then applied a multivariate pattern analysis to the fMRI data to predict the facial expression of pain. Results revealed the inability of previously developed pain neurosignatures to predict the facial expression of pain. We thus propose a facial expression of pain signature (FEPS) conveying distinctive information about the brain response to nociceptive stimulations with minimal or no overlap with other pain-relevant brain signatures associated with nociception, pain ratings, thermal pain aversiveness, or pain valuation. The FEPS may provide a distinctive functional characterization of the distributed cerebral response to nociceptive pain associated with the socio-communicative role of non-verbal pain expression. This underscores the complexity of pain phenomenology by reinforcing the view that neurosignatures conceived as biomarkers must be interpreted in relation to the specific pain manifestation(s) predicted and their underlying function(s). Future studies should explore other pain-relevant manifestations and assess the specificity of the FEPS against simulated pain expressions and other types of aversive or emotional states.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96470">Exposure to live saprophytic Leptospira before challenge with a pathogenic serovar prevents severe leptospirosis and promotes kidney homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies demonstrated that <i>Leptospira biflexa</i>, a saprophytic species, triggers innate immune responses in the host during early infection. This raised the question of whether these responses could suppress a subsequent challenge with pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i>. We inoculated C3H/HeJ mice with a single or a double dose of <i>L. biflexa</i> before challenge with a pathogenic serovar, <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> serovar Copenhageni FioCruz (LIC). Pre-challenge exposure to <i>L. biflexa</i> did not prevent LIC dissemination and colonization of the kidney. However, it rescued weight loss and mouse survival thereby mitigating disease severity. Unexpectedly, there was correlation between rescue of overall health (weight gain, higher survival, lower kidney fibrosis marker ColA1) and higher shedding of LIC in urine. This stood in contrast to the <i>L. biflexa</i> unexposed LIC challenged control. Immune responses were dominated by increased frequency of effector T helper (CD4+) cells in spleen, as well as significant increases in serologic IgG2a. Our findings suggest that exposure to live saprophytic <i>Leptospira</i> primes the host to develop Th1 biased immune responses that prevent severe disease induced by a subsequent challenge with a pathogenic species. Thus, mice exposed to live saprophytic <i>Leptospira</i> before facing a pathogenic serovar may withstand infection with far better outcomes. Furthermore, a status of homeostasis may have been reached after kidney colonization that helps LIC complete its enzootic cycle.

                General anesthesia (GA) is an indispensable procedure necessary for safely and compassionately administering a significant number of surgical procedures and invasive diagnostic tests. However, the undesired stress response associated with GA causes delayed recovery and even increased morbidity in the clinic. Here, a core hypothalamic ensemble, corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons), is discovered to play a role in regulating sevoflurane GA. Chemogenetic activation of these neurons delay the induction of and accelerated emergence from sevoflurane GA, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons accelerates induction and delays awakening. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons induce rapid cortical activation during both the steady and deep sevoflurane GA state with burst-suppression oscillations. Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons relieve the sevoflurane GA-elicited stress response (e.g., excessive self-grooming and elevated corticosterone level). These ﬁndings identify PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons modulate states of anesthesia in sevoflurane GA, being a part of anesthesia regulatory network of sevoflurane.

                Organisms require dietary macronutrients in specific ratios to maximize performance, and variation in macronutrient requirements plays a central role in niche determination. Although it is well recognized that development and body size can have strong and predictable effects on many aspects of organismal function, we lack a predictive understanding of ontogenetic or scaling effects on macronutrient intake. We determined protein and carbohydrate intake throughout development on lab populations of locusts and compared to late instars of field populations. Self-selected protein:carbohydrate targets declined dramatically through ontogeny, due primarily to declines in mass-specific protein consumption rates which were highly correlated with declines in specific growth rates. Lab results for protein consumption rates partly matched results from field-collected locusts. However, field locusts consumed nearly double the carbohydrate, likely due to higher activity and metabolic rates. Combining our results with the available data for animals, both across species and during ontogeny, protein consumption scaled predictably and hypometrically, demonstrating a new scaling rule key for understanding nutritional ecology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96962">Functional identification of soluble uric acid as an endogenous inhibitor of CD38</a></h4>

              
                Excessive elevation or reduction of soluble uric acid (sUA) levels has been linked to some of pathological states, raising another subject that sUA at physiological levels may be essential for the maintenance of health. Yet, the fundamental physiological functions and molecular targets of sUA remain largely unknown. Using enzyme assays and in vitro and in vivo metabolic assays, we demonstrate that sUA directly inhibits the hydrolase and cyclase activities of CD38 via a reversible non-competitive mechanism, thereby limiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) degradation. CD38 inhibition is restricted to sUA in purine metabolism, and a structural comparison using methyl analogs of sUA such as caffeine metabolites shows that 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one is the main functional group. Moreover, sUA at physiological levels prevents crude lipopolysaccharide (cLPS)-induced systemic inflammation and monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced peritonitis in mice by interacting with CD38. Together, this study unveils an unexpected physiological role for sUA in controlling NAD<sup>+</sup> availability and innate immunity through CD38 inhibition, providing a new perspective on sUA homeostasis and purine metabolism.

">Excitatory Cortical Neurons from CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder Patient-Derived Organoids Show Early Hyperexcitability Not Identified in Neurogenin2 Induced Neurons</a></h4>

              
                CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathy resulting from variants in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) that lead to impaired kinase activity or loss of function. CDD is one of the most common genetic etiologies identified in epilepsy cohorts. To study how CDKL5 variants impact human neuronal activity, gene expression and morphology, CDD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and their isogenic controls were differentiated into excitatory neurons using either an NGN2 induction protocol or a guided cortical organoid differentiation. Patient-derived neurons from both differentiation paradigms had decreased phosphorylated EB2, a known molecular target of CDKL5. Induced neurons showed no detectable differences between cases and isogenic controls in network activity using a multielectrode array, or in MAP2+ neurite length, and only two genes were differentially expressed. However, patient-derived neurons from the organoid differentiation showed increased synchrony and weighted mean firing rate on the multielectrode array within the first month of network maturation. CDD patient-derived cortical neurons had lower expression of CDKL5 and HS3ST1, which may change the extracellular matrix around the synapse and contribute to hyperexcitability. Similar to the induced neurons, there were no differences in neurite length across or within patient-control cell lines. Induced neurons have poor cortical specification while the organoid derived neurons expressed cortical markers, suggesting that the changes in neuronal excitability and gene expression are specific to cortical excitatory neurons. Examining molecular mechanisms of early hyperexcitability in cortical neurons is a promising avenue for identification of CDD therapeutics.

">Asymmetric neuromodulation in the respiratory network contributes to rhythm and pattern generation</a></h4>

              
                Like other brain circuits, the brainstem respiratory network is continually modulated by neurotransmitters that activate slow metabotropic receptors. In many cases, activation of these receptors only subtly modulates the respiratory motor pattern. However, activation of some receptor types evokes the arrest of the respiratory motor pattern as can occur following the activation of mu-opioid receptors. We propose that the varied effects of neuromodulation on the respiratory motor pattern depend on the pattern of neuromodulator receptor expression and their influence on the excitability of their post-synaptic targets. Because a comprehensive characterization of these cellular properties across the respiratory network remains challenging, we test our hypothesis by combining computational modelling with ensemble electrophysiologic recording in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) using high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEA). Our computational model encapsulates the hypothesis that neuromodulatory transmission is organized asymmetrically across the respiratory network to promote rhythm and pattern generation. To test this hypothesis, we increased the strength of neuromodulatory connections in the model and used selective agonists in situ while monitoring pre-BotC ensemble activities. The model predictions of increasing slow inhibition were consistent with experiments examining the effect of systemic administration of the 5HT1aR agonist 8-OH-DPAT. Similarly, the predicted effects of increasing slow excitation in the model were experimentally confirmed in pre-BotC ensemble activities before and after systemic administration of the mu-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl. We conclude that asymmetric neuromodulation can contribute to respiratory rhythm and pattern generation and accounts for its varied effects on breathing.

                The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the connection between anxiety brought on by social stressors and the negative impact on relationship formation have remained elusive. In order to address this question, we used the social defeat model in the socially monogamous prairie vole to investigate the impact of this stress on pair bond formation. Social defeat experience inhibited partner preference formation in males but promoted preference in females. Furthermore, pair bonding increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in male prairie voles, while defeat experience increased BNST CRH expression in females. Chemogenetic excitation of BNST CRH neurons during a short cohabitation with a new partner promoted a partner preference in stress-naive prairie voles. Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of BNST CRH neurons during cohabitation with a new partner blocked partner preference in stress-naive males but promoted preference in defeated males. Inhibition of BNST CRH neurons also blocked partner preference in stress-naive females but did not alter preference behavior in defeated females. This study revealed sexual dimorphism in not only the impact of social defeat on pair bond formation, but also in the role BNST CRHergic neurons play in regulating changes in pair bonding following social conflict.

">Hunger modulates exploration through suppression of dopamine signaling in the tail of striatum</a></h4>

              
                Caloric depletion leads to behavioral changes that help an animal find food and restore its homeostatic balance. Hunger increases exploration and risk-taking behavior, allowing an animal to forage for food despite risks; however, the neural circuitry underlying this change is unknown. Here, we characterize how hunger restructures an animal's spontaneous behavior as well as its directed exploration of a novel object. We show that hunger-induced changes in exploration are accompanied by and result from modulation of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TOS). Dopamine signaling in the TOS is modulated by internal hunger state through the activity of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, putative "hunger neurons" in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These AgRP neurons are poly-synaptically connected to TOS-projecting dopaminergic neurons through the lateral hypothalamus, the central amygdala, and the periaqueductal grey. We thus delineate a hypothalamic-midbrain circuit that coordinates changes in exploration behavior in the hungry state.

">Generation of morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes from human iPSCs reveals a link between glial shape, function and reactivity</a></h4>

              
                Astrocyte morphology in vivo is heterogeneous across different subtypes and dynamically changes in response to various stimuli. However, several questions on the mechanistic links between shape and function remain unanswered. Here, we developed an efficient protocol to generate pure populations of morphologically distinct human astrocytes in vitro, which we used for a systematic analysis of shape-function relationships. We performed a structural, molecular, and functional characterization of these populations and highlighted how their distinct morphologies mirror distinct functional and transcriptional patterns at the population level. We were also able to both correlate gene expression profiles of these morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes with in vivo astrocytes in the human brain, and to validate our findings with primary isolated murine astrocytes in vitro. Moreover, we show that the observed morphological differences are correlated with changes in key cytoskeletal proteins, which offers a potential link to the observed functional differences. Finally, we demonstrated that different morphological subtypes of astrocytes have distinct reactivity responses to a common stimulus. This study offers a glimpse into the shape-function dynamics of human astrocytes, highlighting potential mechanistic links between cytoskeletal usage and astrocyte function, while also providing tools and datasets that will be useful for further studies into human glial biology in health and disease.

">A Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 Model for Investigating Post-acute Sequelae of COVID infection</a></h4>

              
                The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a major health issue after nearly 7 millions of death toll in the last four years. As the world is recovering with improving vaccines and antiviral treatments, the alarming rate of long-COVID, or Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), calls for further investigations. Among a list of symptoms associated with multi-organ dysfunctions, the neurological complications are particularly intriguing, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. With the recently developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 stain, we are now able to model the mild COVID infection in C57BL/6 mice and study the chronic immune responses and subsequent damages in different organs long after the viruses are clearly naturally in the body. More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.

">Polystyrene nanoplastics promote neurodegeneration by catalyzing TDP43 hyperphosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                The ubiquity of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in our environment raises substantial concerns about their potential impact on human health. Recent studies have shown that PS-NPs cross the blood-brain-barrier and accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS), raising the concerns on the causal role of PS-NP exposure and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we utilized human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to examine the effects of PS-NPs on neuronal function and health. Our results revealed that PS-NPs penetrate neuronal cells in a size-dependent manner, and are bound by various cellular proteins, including TDP43, a key protein implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interestingly, CK1 and GSK3beta kinases that are known to phosphorylate TDP-43 were found to be associated with PS-NPs. This observation suggests that PS-NPs may play a role in facilitating conditions that lead to TDP43 phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that exposure to healthy motor neurons with PS-NPs resulted in ALS-like phenotypes, characterized by hyperphosphorylated TDP-43, disrupted neuronal morphology, impaired mitochondrial respiration, and accelerated motor neuron death. These findings suggest that PS-NPs contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and highlight the urgent need for strategies to limit human exposure to nanoplastics.

">Continuous sensorimotor transformation enhances robustness of neural dynamics to perturbation in macaque motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the motor cortex dynamically evolves to plan and generate movement. How motor cortex adapts to dynamic environments or perturbations remains to be fully explored. In this study, we investigated whether dynamic nature of targets in a reach task requires distinct preparatory dynamics in motor cortex and result in varying levels of robustness against disruptions. Two monkeys were trained to perform delayed center-out reaches either to a static target (static condition) or a rotating target that needed to be intercepted (moving condition). Despite nearly identical hand kinematics in both two conditions, responses to the perturbation of intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) differed. In the static condition, ICMS led to prolonged reaction times, particularly when delivered shortly before movement onset and at anterior sites in PMd, aligning with previous findings. Unexpectedly, ICMS reduced reaction times in the moving condition. Furthermore, neural firing rates differed between the static and the moving conditions, with population activity in the latter exhibiting more rapid changes post-perturbation. Spatio-temporal sensorimotor transformation dominated throughout the preparation in the moving condition, while the static condition showed less stable motor intention representation, particularly during the late delay period. An input-driven model replicated the differences in RT-prolonging effect by assuming distinct input control strategy for the static and the moving condition. These findings suggest that input from a moving target to motor cortex can counteract ICMS effects, enabling the motor network to generate appropriate commands more quickly. Lastly, we propose that ICMS may facilitate go cue recognition, providing a potential explanation for the shortened reaction times in the moving condition.

">More with less: Simulation-based inference enables accurate diffusion-weighted MRI with minimal acquisition time</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dw-MRI) is an essential tool in neuroimaging, providing non-invasive insights into brain microstructure. However, obtaining reproducible and accurate maps requires lengthy acquisition due to the need to massively oversample the parameter space. This means that tensor-based dw-MRI accessibility is still relatively low in daily practice, and more advanced approaches with increased sensitivity and specificity to microstructure are seldom applied in research and clinical contexts. Motivated by recent advances in simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, this work uses neural networks to model the posterior distribution of key diffusion parameters when provided experimental data, allowing accurate estimation with fewer measurements and without the need to train on real data. We find that SBI outperforms standard non-linear least squares fitting under noisy and sparse data conditions in both diffusion tensor and kurtosis imaging, reducing imaging time by 90% while maintaining high accuracy and robustness. Demonstrated on simulated and real data in healthy and pathological brains, this approach can substantially impact radiology by: i) increasing dw-MRI access to more patients, including those unable to undergo long exams; ii) promoting advanced dw-MRI protocols for greater microstructure sensitivity; and iii) rescuing older data where noise hindered analysis. Combining SBI with dw-MRI could greatly improve clinical MRI workflows by reducing patient discomfort, enhancing scan efficiency, and enabling advanced imaging approaches in a data and privacy friendly way.

">Oscillatory coupling between thalamus, cerebellum and motor cortex in essential tremor</a></h4>

              
                Background Essential tremor is hypothesized to emerge from synchronized oscillatory activity within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. However, this hypothesis has not yet been tested using local field potentials directly recorded from the thalamus alongside signals from both the cortex and cerebellum, leaving a gap in the understanding of essential tremor. Objectives To clarify the importance of cerebello-thalamo-cortical oscillatory coupling for essential tremor. Methods We investigated oscillatory coupling between thalamic local field potentials and simultaneously recorded magnetoencephalography in 19 essential tremor patients with externalized deep brain stimulation electrodes. Brain activity was measured while patients repeatedly adopted a tremor-provoking posture and while pouring rice from one cup to another. In a whole-brain analysis of coherence between the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus and cortex, we contrasted epochs containing tremor and epochs lacking tremor. Results Both postural and kinetic tremor were associated with an increase of thalamic power and thalamo-cortex coherence at individual tremor frequency in the bilateral cerebellum and primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to tremor. These areas also exhibited an increase in corticomuscular coherence in the presence of tremor. The coupling of motor cortex to both thalamus and muscle correlated with tremor amplitude during postural tremor. Conclusions These results demonstrate that essential tremor is indeed associated with increased oscillatory coupling at tremor frequency within a cerebello-thalamo-cortical network, with coupling strength directly reflecting tremor severity.

">Spatially mismatched cerebral blood flow and neuronal activity by intracortical microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                Intracortial microstimulation (ICMS) is widely used in brain-machine interface for neuroprosthetics, particularly with aims of restoring lost sensory and motor functions. However, it remains poorly understood whether neuronal and blood flow responses by ICMS are spatially and temporally matched, as well as their underlying mechanism. Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the process by which neuronal activity regulates blood flow in the brain to meet local metabolic demands. A hypothetically suboptimal NVC by ICMS may exacerbate the neuronal survival near electrode, contributing to neurodegeneration. In this study, we used wide-field imaging, laser speckle imaging and two-photon imaging in transgenic mice expressing calcium fluorescent indicators in neurons or vascular mural cells to examine this hypothesis. Our results showed blood flow responses are delayed at peak time and prolonged in duration compared with neuronal responses. By varying the stimulation amplitudes, we found that low stimulation intensity lower than 50A preserved NVC. In contrast, high intensity stimulation caused spatially mismatched NVC, i.e. in the adjacent range within 200~400 m from electrode tip, elicited blood flow compromises but neuronal activities increase. Ca2+ is the key regulator of contractile tone of vascular mural cells. Our results showed that Ca2+ sensitivity at vascular mural cells, i.e. vessel diameter change per unit of Ca2+ change, was decreased in the adjacent region of electrode, which partially explained the compromised and mismatched NVC, and which likely further lead to ischemia and neurodegeneration. This study offers a new insight into ICMS-associated neuronal and vascular physiology, and provides an important implication towards optimal design of ICMS: low intensities is more neuroprotective than high intensities by preserving NVC and preventing ischemia. Our discoveries pave the way for new research consideration and contribute to the development of more advanced brain-machine interface.

">Beyond Letters: Optimal Transport as a Model for Sub-Letter Orthographic Processing</a></h4>

              
                Letter processing plays a key role in visual word recognition. However, word recognition models typically overlook or greatly simplify early perceptual processes of letter recognition. We suggest that optimal transport theory may provide a computational framework for describing letter shape processing. We use representational similarity analysis to show that optimal transport cost (Wasserstein distance) between pairs of letters aligns with neural activity elicited by visually presented letters <225 ms after stimulus onset, outperforming an existing approach based on shape overlap. We additionally show that optimal transport can capture the emergence of geometric invariances (e.g., to position or size) observed in letter perception. Finally, we demonstrate that Wasserstein distance predicts neural activity similarly well to features from artificial networks trained to classify images and letters. However, whereas representations in artificial neural networks emerge in a computationally unconstrained manner, our proposal provides a computationally explicit route to modeling the earliest orthographic processes.

">Free water elimination tractometry for aging brains</a></h4>

              
                Tractometry of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) non-invasively quantifies tissue properties of brain connections. It is widely used in aging studies but could be less reliable in aging brains due to increased white matter free water. We demonstrate that computational free water elimination (FWE) increases reliability and accuracy of tractometry in a large (n = 339) cohort of older adults (66 - 103 y.o.). We found substantial (up to ~37%) improvements in reliability in a split-half comparison at every stage of the pipeline: estimation of voxel-level fiber orientation distribution functions, delineation of major pathway trajectories, and assessment of tissue properties along the pathways. FWE also improves inferences from tractometry, producing more accurate cross-validated predictions of clinician Fazekas scores. By sub-sampling a multi-b-value dataset, we demonstrated that these findings generalize to both single-b-value data, which is important for many datasets where only one b-value may be available. Overall, the results highlight the importance of accounting for free water in tractometry studies, especially in aging brains. We provide open-source software for free-water elimination that can be applied to a wide range of clinical and research datasets (https://github.com/nrdg/fwe)

">Long-Read RNA-sequencing reveals transcript-specific regulation in human-derived cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Long-read RNA sequencing has transformed transcriptome analysis by enabling comprehensive mapping of full-length transcripts, providing an unprecedented resolution of transcript diversity, alternative splicing, and transcript-specific regulation. In this study, we employed nanopore long-read RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of human fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells, and stem cell-derived cortical neurons, identifying extensive transcript diversity with 15,072 transcripts in stem cell-derived cortical neurons, 13,048 in fibroblasts, and 12,759 in induced pluripotent stem cells. Our analyses uncovered 35,519 differential transcript expression events and 5,135 differential transcript usage events, underscoring the complexity of transcriptomic regulation across these cell types. Importantly, by integrating differential transcript expression and usage analyses, we gained deeper insights into transcript dynamics that are not captured by gene-level expression analysis alone. Notably, differential transcript usage analysis highlighted transcript-specific changes in disease-relevant genes such as APP, KIF2A, and BSCL2, associated with Alzheimer's disease, neuronal migration disorders, and degenerative axonopathies, respectively. This added resolution emphasizes the significance of transcript-level variations that often remain hidden in traditional differential gene expression analyses. Overall, our work provides a framework for understanding transcript diversity in both pluripotent and specialized cell types, which can be used to investigate transcriptomic changes in disease states. Additionally, this study underscores the utility of differential transcript usage analysis in advancing our understanding of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, paving the way for identifying transcript-specific therapeutic targets.

">Processing reliant on granule cells is essential for motor learning but dispensable for many cerebellar-dependent behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar dysfunction leads to motor, learning, emotional, and social deficits. It is assumed that these deficits arise from impaired processing of mossy fiber inputs that activate granule cells (GCs) that in turn excite Purkinje cells (PCs). However, high-frequency spontaneous PC firing might also influence behaviors. To clarify how the cerebellum regulates behaviors, we compared the effects of disrupting either GC signaling, which selectively perturbs cerebellar processing, or PC signaling, which disrupts cerebellar processing and spontaneous PC firing. We find that both GC and PC signaling are required for eyeblink conditioning and vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) learning. However, disrupting PC signaling impairs baseline VOR, anxiety, and social behaviors, but abolishing GC signaling does not. This establishes that cerebellar processing is essential for motor learning, but is not required for many cerebellum-dependent behaviors. This suggests that such behaviors could be rescued by elevating firing in downstream targets, as shown previously for social deficits.

	<p>Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a therapeutic assessment protocol for the Screening and Support of Youth (SASY). SASY provides brief but comprehensive community-based screening and support for diverse youth in the community. Methods: SASY screening evaluates symptoms, functioning and clinical risk. The Kiddie Computerized Adaptive Test was used to evaluate seven different diagnoses and symptom severity. The Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Self was used to measure functional impairment. Measures were scored according to nationally developed norms. An algorithm was developed to aggregate symptom and function ratings into an overall score for clinical risk. The results are discussed with participants in a motivational interview designed to promote insight, followed by the opportunity for the participant to engage in an online intervention. Protocol changes necessitated by social distancing during the pandemic led to innovative methods including the use of a QR code for recruitment, integration of both online and offline participation, and expansion from in-person recruitment within the schools to virtual engagement with youth throughout the community. The final sample included disproportionately more Black or African American and Hispanic youth as compared to school and community statistics, suggesting that optimization of online and offline methods in research may facilitate the recruitment of diverse populations. Qualitative interviews indicated that the screening and feedback raised youth awareness of their wellbeing and/or distress, its impact on their functioning, and engagement with options for improved wellbeing. Conclusions: The emergence of innovative methods optimizing the advantages of both online and offline methods, developed as a necessity during the pandemic, proved advantageous to the feasibility and acceptability of community-based recruitment of at-risk, minoritized youth.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Unlike enriched environments for rodents, human-built environments often hinder neuroplasticity through sedentary lifestyles, to which exercise can merely overcome its adverse effects. This paper introduces &amp;quot;environmental affordance for physical activity&amp;quot; to quantify the potential of spatial layout designs to stimulate activity and sustain neuroplasticity, mainly hippocampal neurogenesis. Methods: A novel framework links metabolic equivalents (METs) that can be afforded by the spatial layout of the built environment to its role in increasing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)&amp;amp;mdash;a biomarker that promotes and sustains adult hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Equations are developed to assess the built environment&amp;amp;rsquo;s affordance for physical activity through BDNF changes measurable after brief exposure to the built environment for 20&amp;amp;ndash;35 min. Results: The developed equations are evidenced to be feasible to cause BDNF release through low- to moderate-intensity physical activity. This model provides a feasible assessment tool to test the built environment&amp;amp;rsquo;s effectiveness towards neurosustainability. Conclusions: By sustaining neurogenesis, the environmental affordance for physical activity holds promise for improving mental health and preventing cognitive decline.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation is thought to reduce ataxia severity in individuals with hereditary cerebellar ataxia (HCA). This multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial aimed to examine the efficacy of a 30-week goal-directed rehabilitation program compared with 30 weeks of standard care on function, ataxia, health-related quality of life, and balance in individuals with an HCA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with an autosomal dominant or recessive ataxia (aged ≥15 years) were enrolled at 5 sites in Australia. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive rehabilitation (6 weeks of outpatient physiotherapy followed by a 24-week home exercise program) (n = 39) or continued their usual activity (n = 37). The primary outcome measure was the motor domain of the Functional Independence Measure (mFIM) at 7 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and the SF-36v2, assessed at 7, 18, and 30 weeks. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seventy-one participants (rehabilitation, 37; standard-care, 34) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At 7 weeks, mFIM (mean difference 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26 to 4.26, <i>p</i> = 0.028) and SARA (−1.21, 95% CI: −2.32 to −0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.032) scores improved after rehabilitation compared with standard care. Compared with standard care, rehabilitation improved SARA scores at 30 weeks (mean difference −1.51, 95% CI: −2.76 to −0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.017), but not mFIM scores (1.74, 95% CI: −0.32 to 3.81, <i>p</i> = 0.098). Frequent adverse events in both groups were fatigue, pain, and falls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Goal-directed rehabilitation improved function at 7 weeks, with improvement in ataxia and health-related quality of life maintained at 30 weeks in individuals with HCA, beyond that of standard care. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>TDP-43 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that plays a central role in neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as TDP-43 proteinopathies. Under physiological conditions, TDP-43 is primarily localized to the nucleus, but in its pathological form it aggregates in the cytoplasm, contributing to neuronal death. Given its association with numerous diseases, particularly ALS and FTLD, the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 aggregation and its impact on neuronal function have been extensively investigated. However, little is still known about the spreading of this pathology from cell to cell. Recent research has unveiled the possibility that TDP-43 may possess prion-like properties. Specifically, misfolded TDP-43 aggregates can act as templates inducing conformational changes in native TDP-43 molecules and propagating the misfolded state across neural networks. This review summarizes the mounting and most recent evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies supporting the prion-like hypothesis and its underlying mechanisms. The prion-like behavior of TDP-43 has significant implications for diagnostics and therapeutics. Importantly, emerging strategies such as small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies, and gene therapies targeting TDP-43 propagation offer promising avenues for developing effective treatments. By elucidating the mechanisms of TDP-43 spreading, we therefore aim to pave the way for novel therapies for TDP-43-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <p>Successful behavior depends on the attentional state and other factors related to decision-making, which may modulate neuronal activity differently. Here, we investigated whether attentional state and behavioral outcome (i.e., whether a target is detected or missed) are distinguishable using the power and phase of local field potential recorded bilaterally from area V4 of two male rhesus monkeys performing a cued visual attention task. To link each trial's outcome to pairwise measures of attention that are typically averaged across trials, we used several methods to obtain single-trial estimates of spike count correlation and phase consistency. Surprisingly, while attentional location was best discriminated using gamma and high-gamma power, behavioral outcome was best discriminated by alpha power and steady-state visually evoked potential. Power outperformed absolute phase in attentional/behavioral discriminability, although single-trial gamma phase consistency provided reasonably high attentional discriminability. Our results suggest a dissociation between the neuronal mechanisms that regulate attentional focus and behavioral outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/11/ENEURO.0512-23.2024?rss=1">A Stochastic Dynamic Operator Framework That Improves the Precision of Analysis and Prediction Relative to the Classical Spike-Triggered Average Method, Extending the Toolkit</a></h4>

              
                <p>Here we test the stochastic dynamic operator (SDO) as a new framework for describing physiological signal dynamics relative to spiking or stimulus events. The SDO is a natural extension of existing spike-triggered average (STA) or stimulus-triggered average techniques currently used in neural analysis. It extends the classic STA to cover state-dependent and probabilistic responses where STA may fail. In simulated data, SDO methods were more sensitive and specific than the STA for identifying state-dependent relationships. We have tested SDO analysis for interactions between electrophysiological recordings of spinal interneurons, single motor units, and aggregate muscle electromyograms (EMG) of major muscles in the spinal frog hindlimb. When predicting target signal behavior relative to spiking events, the SDO framework outperformed or matched classical spike-triggered averaging methods. SDO analysis permits more complicated spike&ndash;signal relationships to be captured, analyzed, and interpreted visually and intuitively. SDO methods can be applied at different scales of interest where spike-triggered averaging methods are currently employed, and beyond, from single neurons to gross motor behaviors. SDOs may be readily generated and analyzed using the provided <I>SDO Analysis Toolkit</I>. We anticipate this method will be broadly useful for describing dynamical signal behavior and uncovering state-dependent relationships of stochastic signals relative to discrete event times.</p>

                Migration and displacement are pivotal determinants of urban health, influencing both direct and indirect health outcomes. Migrants may face unique health risks, often exacerbated by economic, social, and environmental factors encountered during transit or upon resettlement. As migration patterns shift due to geopolitical, climatic, and economic pressures, they reshape the global and urban policy landscapes in unpredictable ways, presenting challenges that will continue to evolve in the coming decades. Current legal frameworks, in many cases, do not adequately account for migrant populations, hindering policy responses and complicating the protection of migrant health. Therefore, effective urban health interventions must be inclusive of migrant populations and expand beyond healthcare services. A systems-thinking approach that recognizes the broader determinants of health—including housing, employment, social services, and urban infrastructure—is essential to address the intersecting challenges migrants face. Despite these challenges, migration remains crucial to the functioning of urban environments. Migrant workers consistently contribute to the healthy operation of cities, underpinning key infrastructure and services. However, to optimize policy responses and improve urban health outcomes, more robust data and evidence on the health risks and outcomes of migrants, as well as the structural drivers of migration, are needed. Moreover, macro factors such as climate change, future pandemics, and geopolitical shifts are likely to influence both migration dynamics and migrant health. To anticipate and respond to these evolving challenges, a systems-informed and holistic vision of urban health is required—one that integrates migration into the broader urban policy and planning frameworks to foster healthier, more resilient cities.

                Background This study aimed to determine the relationships between hematological parameters- hemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Counts (TLC), platelet counts, Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), Absolute Lymphocyte Counts (ALC), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII), Neutrophil Monocyte Ratio (NMR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and the severity of COVID-19 disease and their use in predicting severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods and Material This was a prospective, observational, single-center study of 573 symptomatic adult inpatients of COVID 19 admitted to our tertiary care center. Statistical analysis used The above-mentioned hematological parameter levels were noted and compared between the two categories of COVID-19 disease, namely non-severe and severe COVID-19 using logistic regression methods. Their cut-off values were detected using the ROC curve. Results The median TLC, ANC, NLR, SII, NMR, PLR were notably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that NMR (OR=1.029, p=0.006) and ALC (OR=0.999, p=0.002) were statistically significant independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Conclusions The hematological parameters mentioned, can be used for predicting severe COVID-19 disease at admission. ALC and NMR levels could be used as hematological markers to predict severity of COVID-19 in adult patients with their cut off values being < 1105 cells/cubic millimeter and > 10.434 respectively.

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data (secondary dataset) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011–2012 and NHANES 2013–2014 cycles, relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.’s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates (demographical characteristics) impacting periodontal disease were considered, and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health’s impact on periodontal disease. Results Among the 2764 Participants, more than a quarter (29.1%) were aged over 60 years, 52% were females. Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried Participants affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between Participants with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Our findings suggest trends in periodontal disease prevalence linked to mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance. However, the absence of statistically significant findings calls for caution in interpreting these relationships. We recommend that future studies further investigate these potential associations to provide a clearer understanding.

                Introduction The social media landscape has undergone radical changes and has revolutionized consumer perspectives, purchasing habits, and behaviors. Amidst this emerging trend is the rise of influencer marketing and its impact on the purchase intentions of followers. The objective is to explore the characteristics of influencers that contribute to their credibility. This research aims to explore the role of consumers’ attitude toward brands on their intention to adopt brands endorsed by influencers. Methods This cross-sectional research was undertaken among GenZ in the urban landscape of India. Data collected was analyzed using SmartPLS4 software. Findings Trust, expertise, and similarity were the significant antecedents of the formation of influencer credibility. Attractiveness did not have a significant influence on influencer credibility. A complementary partial mediation of Attitude towards a brand is observed in the association between influencer credibility and the purchase intention of followers. Attitude towards the video also had a significant positive influence on purchase intention. Conclusion The study found that Gen Z places little importance on an influencer’s attractiveness, as it has no significant impact on credibility. However, attitude toward the brand strongly influenced purchase intention and partially mediated the relationship between influencer credibility and purchase intention.

Autism is a developmental disability. Research demonstrated that children with autism benefit from early diagnosis and early intervention. Genetic factors are considered major contributors to the development of autism. Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), has been evaluated in phenotype prediction, but this method has been limited in its application to autism. We developed a DL model, the Separate Translated Autism Research Neural Network (STAR-NN) model to predict autism status. The model was trained and tested using whole exome sequencing data from 43,203 individuals (16,809 individuals with autism and 26,394 non-autistic controls). Polygenic scores from common variants and the aggregated count of rare variants on genes were used as input. In STAR-NN, protein truncating variants, possibly damaging missense variants and mild effect missense variants on the same gene were separated at the input level and merged to one gene node. In this way, rare variants with different level of pathogenic effects were treated separately. We further validated the performance of STAR-NN using an independent dataset, including 13,827 individuals with autism and 14,052 non-autistic controls. STAR-NN achieved a modest ROC-AUC of 0.7319 on the testing dataset and 0.7302 on the independent dataset. STAR-NN outperformed other traditional ML models. Gene Ontology analysis on the selected gene features showed an enrichment for potentially informative pathways including potassium ion transport.

Shoot stem cells, harbored in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), play key roles during post-embryonic development of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and function as the origin of plant aerial tissues. Multiple transcription factors are involved in the sophisticated transcriptional regulation of stem cell homeostasis, with the <i>WUSCHEL</i> (<i>WUS</i>)/<i>CLAVATA3</i> (<i>CLV3</i>) negative feedback loop playing a central role. WUS acts as a master regulator in maintaining stem cells through its transcriptional regulatory activity including repressive and activating abilities. Although the interaction between WUS and TOPLESS confers the repressive activity of WUS in transcriptional control, the mechanism by which WUS activates gene expression remains elusive. Here, we showed that DORNRÖSCHEN competitively interacts with WUS and disturbs the WUS homodimer, which recruits BRAHMA to activate <i>CLV3</i> expression via nucleosome depletion for maintaining the stem cell pool.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dopamine (DA) signaling is evoked by both food and drugs that humans come to abuse. Moreover, physiological state (e.g., hunger versus satiety) can modulate the response. However, there is great heterogeneity among DA neurons. Limited studies have been performed that could resolve the interaction between physiological state and drug responsivity across groups of DA neurons. Here, we measured the activity of neurons in transgenic Tg (th2:GCaMP7s) zebrafish larva that expresses a calcium indicator (GCaMP7s) in A11 (posterior tuberculum) and a part of A14 (caudal hypothalamus and intermediate hypothalamus) DA populations located in the hypothalamus of the larval zebrafish. Fish were recorded in one of two physiological states: ad-libitum fed (AL) and food deprived (FD) and before and after acute exposure to different doses of the stimulant drug amphetamine (0, 0.7, and 1.5 μM). We quantified fluorescence change, activity duration, peak rise/fall time, and latency in the calcium spikes of the DA neurons. Our results show that baseline DA neuron activity amplitude, spike duration, and correlation between inter- and intra-DA neurons were higher in the FD than in the AL state. Dose-dependent AMPH treatment further increased the intensity of these parameters in the neuron spikes but only in the FD state. The DA activity correlation relatively increased in AL state post-AMPH treatment. Given that hunger increases drug reactivity and the probability of relapse to drug seeking, the results support populations of DA neurons as potential critical mediators of the interaction between physiological state and drug reinforcement.</p>

                Background Projects enable the resolution of problems and alter societal realities, assuming they represent the optimal choices to modify living conditions positively. If projects are deemed intelligent solutions to problems, why do they fail? This question will be addressed in this article through bibliometric analysis. Methods A bibliometric analysis was conducted on the success or failure factors influencing social investment projects, through a descriptive study with search equations, utilizing a comparative matrix to analyze 32 articles from Scopus and 22 from Web of Science. Results As a result, the number of publications, the themes addressed, and their origins between 2018 and 2023 were identified. The VOSviewer software allowed for identifying keywords and their relationships; with this input, a review of scientific production was conducted to subsequently identify the factors influencing projects and how they have been addressed within their contexts. Conclusions In conclusion, it was found that both the factors influencing success or failure in projects are permeated by the environment and the impact of political, social, and economic factors, in addition to the interaction of elements related to soft and hard skills.

                Endometriosis is a common chronic non curable neuro-inflammatory condition, which can cause endometriosis-related pelvic pain (ERPP). Sufferers may struggle with side effects and/or risks from conventional medical and surgical treatments, or not get pain relief. Increasing numbers of endometriosis patients wish to explore holistic management with fewer side effects, however it is important that medical professionals maintain an evidence-based practice for recommended treatments. We present up-to-date evidence of holistic strategies used for managing ERPP including nutrition, body and mind therapies, acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the use of adjunct devices such as phallus length reducers and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Recent findings: Nutrition: Gluten-free, low-nickel and high intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids diets improve ERPP. Low FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols), plant-based diet and antioxidant vitamin supplementation is helpful including those with concurrent irritable bowel syndrome. Body and Mind: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is beneficial in postoperative pain reduction, whilst mindfulness has been shown to reduce pain scores and dyschezia. Progressive muscle relaxation therapy and regular yoga sessions improve ERPP and Quality of life. Acupuncture: Acupuncture and moxibustion show improved pain scores compared to conventional therapies alone. Adjunct devices: TENS improves deep dyspareunia and reduces the number of days pain is experienced. Summary: Holistic management strategies for ERPP should be incorporated into routine counselling when discussing conservative, medical and or surgical treatments for endometriosis. The growing evidence presented for the use of holistic management strategies gives hope to those patients who cannot have, or don’t respond to conventional approaches and as an adjunct alongside standard treatments. These findings should be incorporated into the routine counselling when seeing patients in the gynaecology outpatient setting presenting with chronic pelvic pain.

                The psychosocial well-being of every individual is as important as the well-being of long-distance voyages, especially that they have to spend longer hours and days travelling to their destinations with all the experiences of adventure and adversities characterizing the journey. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the psychosocial well-being of long-distance seafarers on board shipping vessels to gain an understanding of their psychological and social well-being with the objective of ameliorating the adversities associated with these travels. A systematic review will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (2020) statement. The databases to be searched for the data will be limited to Scopus, Web of Science, and Advanced Google Scholar using keywords selected by the reviewers. Meta-analysis, narrative synthesis, or both will be used depending on the extent of heterogeneity across eligible observational studies included in the review. Some specific countries will be selected for data extraction, and only data published in English will be included. It is expected that the findings from this review will bring to bear if these categories of seafarers are prone to risks that affect their psychosocial wellbeing and if so discovered. This protocol was registered with the PROSPERO. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024517277(08/03/2024)

                Background Humanity faces dual existential crises of biodiversity loss and global warming. Acknowledging the environmental impact of sports, the United Nations is calling on the sports sector to take the lead in fighting climate change and adopting climate-neutral practices. Research on the greenhouse gas emissions of amateur league play is evolving but to date there are few studies that have described the travel patterns for large samples of teams and explored ways to reduce travel. Methods Travel distances for the 2022/23 season were calculated for 339 amateur football and handball teams playing in different leagues in Bavaria. The program Gurobi was utilised to optimise the grouping of teams in order to reduce travel by car. Results The study showed that playing in a higher amateur league most often resulted in longer travel distances for both women’s and men’s sports. Some amateur teams had to travel up to 2,958 kilometres for one season of play. All 339 teams combined travelled a total of 474,231 km (1398.9 per team in average) for away matches in the 2022/23 season of play. Optimising the groups in which teams play can reduce total travel distances by up to 19.7% while keeping the number of games played constant. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel distances in amateur football and handball, despite being shorter than those of professional teams, contribute significantly to carbon emissions. Due to the greater number of amateur teams and the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is crucial to explore ways of reducing travel in amateur sports. This touches on ethical issues regarding how much travel that causes greenhouse gas emissions is justified in amateur play. Algorithm based optimisation of which teams play against each other appears to be a straightforward, cost-effective, and scalable method for reducing travel emissions in amateur sports.

                Objective The shift to online learning during COVID-19 led to increased musculoskeletal discomforts and impacted students’ quality of life. Neck pain (NP), once a minor issue, has become more prevalent due to prolonged electronic device use in new learning methods. This study aims to measure the prevalence of NP among University of Sharjah (UOS) students during the COVID-19 online learning period and to investigate the factors that provoked it. Methods This study focused on young adult students aged 17-26 and did not consider gender or athletic status due to the university’s demographics and pandemic restrictions. Demographic data, Neck Disability Index (NDI) assessments, and pain management information were gathered and analyzed using SPSS 24 through univariate and bivariate methods. Results The prevalence of NP during COVID-19, among 325 UOS students was found to be 62.7%, 64.41% of which had NP at the time of doing the survey. NDI scores were found to be skewed. The median was 16% which indicates mild NP while the interquartile range was 19.11. Most participants reported experiencing posterior neck pain (38.77%), primarily attributed to prolonged sitting (81.23%). Factors such as lifting, personal care, and emotional well-being were found to have a significant impact on NDI. Participants who did not seek medical attention exhibited significantly higher levels of neck pain disability, as measured by the NDI. The median NDI score for this group was 20, with an interquartile range of 16.89 while, those who sought medical attention had a higher median NDI score of 34 with interquartile range of 22. Conclusion This study highlights the prevalence of neck pain among UOS students, emphasizing the need for postural improvements and further research on prevention strategies in the UAE.

                Passive acoustic monitoring of soundscapes and biodiversity produces vast amounts of audio recordings, but the management and analyses of these raw data present technical challenges. A multitude of software solutions exist, but none can fulfil all purposes required for the management, processing, navigation, and analysis of acoustic data. The field of ecoacoustics needs a software tool that is free, evolving, and accessible. We take a step in that direction and present ecoSound-web: an open-source, online platform for ecoacoustics designed and built by ecologists and software engineers. ecoSound-web can be used for storing, re-sampling, organising, analysing, and sharing soundscape recording or metadata projects. Specifically, it allows manual annotation of soniferous animals and soundscape components, automatic annotation with deep-learning models for all birds and for UK bat species, peer-reviewing annotations, analysing audio in time and frequency dimensions, computing alpha acoustic indices, and providing reference sound libraries for different taxa. We present ecoSound-web’s structure and features, and describe its operation for typical use cases such as sampling bird and bat communities, using a primate call library, and the analysis of soundscape components and acoustic indices. ecoSound-web is available from: https://github.com/ecomontec/ecoSound-web

                Background Nanoparticles (NPs) hold promise as alternatives to antibiotics in the fight against multi-drug-resistant bacteria. However, concerns about their cytotoxicity, particularly their effects on mammalian cells, must be thoroughly addressed to ensure therapeutic safety. Amphiphilic Janus NPs, which have segregated hydrophobic and polycationic ligands on two hemispheres, have previously been shown to exhibit potent antibacterial activity. Methods In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of amphiphilic Janus NPs in immune and cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity assays were performed to assess the effects of Janus NPs on cell viability and membrane integrity, with a particular focus on how internalization of the nanoparticles influenced cellular responses. Results The results revealed that both immune and cancer cells exhibited negligible cytotoxic effects when exposed to Janus NPs. However, phagocytic immune cells demonstrated greater susceptibility to membrane damage and viability loss, suggesting that internalization plays a significant role in nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity. Conclusions Amphiphilic Janus NPs show great potential as highly effective antibacterial agents with minimal cytotoxicity. While immune cells may be more vulnerable to nanoparticle-induced damage due to their internalization capacity, these findings support the further investigation of Janus NPs for clinical applications.

     alt="Enhancement of Glutamate Uptake as Novel Antiseizure Approach: Preclinical Proof of Concept"/>
<p>Allosteric activation of glutamate uptake as novel antiseizure approach.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excitotoxicity is a common hallmark of epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Thus, here, we studied the protective effects of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b>, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of glutamate uptake in epilepsy models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> was evaluated in a range of acute and chronic seizure models, while its adverse effect profile was assessed in a panel of standard tests in rodents. The effect of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on glutamate uptake was assessed in COS-7 cells expressing the transporter. WAY 213613, a selective competitive EAAT2 inhibitor, was used to probe the reversal of the enhanced glutamate uptake in the same transporter expression system. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses were used to study a potential influence of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on GLT-1 expression in mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> showed robust protection in a panel of animal models of seizures and epilepsy, including the maximal electroshock- and 6 Hz-induced seizures, corneal kindling, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindling, as well as seizures induced by pilocarpine or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Importantly, <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> displayed a favorable adverse effect profile in the rotarod, the minimal motor impairment, and the Irwin tests. <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> enhanced glutamate uptake in vitro and this effect was abolished by WAY 213613, while no influence on GLT-1 expression in vivo was observed after repeated treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, our results show that <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> has favorable tolerability and provides robust preclinical efficacy against seizures. Thus, allosteric enhancement of EAAT2 function could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity.

                Anionic lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood, as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR. Here, we visualized both EGFR and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy. The EGFR and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ, the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Artificial reduction in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. Thus, EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101221">FABP4-mediated lipid accumulation and lipolysis in tumor-associated macrophages promote breast cancer metastasis</a></h4>

              
                A high density of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is associated with poorer prognosis and survival in breast cancer patients. Recent studies have shown that lipid accumulation in TAMs can promote tumor growth and metastasis in various models. However, the specific molecular mechanisms that drive lipid accumulation and tumor progression in TAMs remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), unlike saturated ones, are more likely to form lipid droplets in murine macrophages. Specifically, unsaturated FAs, including linoleic acids (LA), activate the FABP4/CEBPα pathway, leading to triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet formation. Furthermore, FABP4 enhances lipolysis and FA utilization by breast cancer cell lines, which promotes cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Notably, a deficiency of FABP4 in murine macrophages significantly reduces LA-induced lipid metabolism. Therefore, our findings suggest FABP4 as a crucial lipid messenger that facilitates unsaturated FA-mediated lipid accumulation and lipolysis in TAMs, thus contributing to the metastasis of breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98366">Unveiling the influence of tumor and immune signatures on immune checkpoint therapy in advanced lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the variability among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in their responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Recognizing that patients with advanced-stage NSCLC rarely qualify for surgical interventions, it becomes crucial to identify biomarkers that influence responses to ICI therapy. We conducted an analysis of single-cell transcriptomes from 33 lung cancer biopsy samples, with a particular focus on 14 core samples taken before the initiation of palliative ICI treatment. Our objective was to link tumor and immune cell profiles with patient responses to ICI. We discovered that ICI non-responders exhibited a higher presence of CD4+ regulatory T cells, resident memory T cells, and TH17 cells. This contrasts with the diverse activated CD8+ T cells found in responders. Furthermore, tumor cells in non-responders frequently showed heightened transcriptional activity in the NF-kB and STAT3 pathways, suggesting a potential inherent resistance to ICI therapy. Through the integration of immune cell profiles and tumor molecular signatures, we achieved an discriminative power (area under the curve [AUC]) exceeding 95% in identifying patient responses to ICI treatment. These results underscore the crucial importance of the interplay between tumor and immune microenvironment, including within metastatic sites, in affecting the effectiveness of ICIs in NSCLC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99000">Heparan sulphate binding controls in vivo half-life of the HpARI protein family</a></h4>

              
                The parasitic nematode <i>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</i> secretes the HpARI family, which bind to IL-33, either suppressing (HpARI1 and HpARI2) or enhancing (HpARI3) responses to the cytokine. We previously showed that HpARI2 also bound to DNA via its first complement control protein (CCP1) domain. Here, we find that HpARI1 can also bind DNA, while HpARI3 cannot. Through the production of HpARI2/HpARI3 CCP1 domain-swapped chimeras, DNA-binding ability can be transferred, and correlates with in vivo half-life of administered proteins. We found that HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) also binds to the extracellular matrix component heparan sulphate (HS), and structural modelling showed a basic charged patch in the CCP1 domain of HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) which could facilitate these interactions. Finally, a mutant of HpARI2 was produced which lacked DNA and HS binding, and was also shown to have a short half-life in vivo. Therefore, we propose that during infection the suppressive HpARI1 and HpARI2 proteins have long-lasting effects at the site of deposition due to DNA and/or extracellular matrix interactions, while HpARI3 has a shorter half-life due to a lack of these interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90695">Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia integrate into mouse retina and recapitulate features of endogenous microglia</a></h4>

              
                Microglia exhibit both maladaptive and adaptive roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and have emerged as a cellular target for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including those affecting the retina. Replacing maladaptive microglia, such as those impacted by aging or over-activation, with exogenous microglia that can enable adaptive functions has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate microglia replacement as an approach for retinal diseases, we first employed a protocol to efficiently generate human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia in quantities sufficient for in vivo transplantation. These cells demonstrated expression of microglia-enriched genes and showed typical microglial functions such as LPS-induced responses and phagocytosis. We then performed xenotransplantation of these hiPSC-derived microglia into the subretinal space of adult mice whose endogenous retinal microglia have been pharmacologically depleted. Long-term analysis post-transplantation demonstrated that transplanted hiPSC-derived microglia successfully integrated into the neuroretina as ramified cells, occupying positions previously filled by the endogenous microglia and expressed microglia homeostatic markers such as P2ry12 and Tmem119. Furthermore, these cells were found juxtaposed alongside residual endogenous murine microglia for up to 8 months in the retina, indicating their ability to establish a stable homeostatic state in vivo. Following retinal pigment epithelial cell injury, transplanted microglia demonstrated responses typical of endogenous microglia, including migration, proliferation, and phagocytosis. Our findings indicate the feasibility of microglial transplantation and integration in the retina and suggest that modulating microglia through replacement may be a therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative retinal diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97033">Visualization of endogenous G proteins on endosomes and other organelles</a></h4>

              
                Classical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling takes place in response to extracellular stimuli and involves receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins located at the plasma membrane. It has recently been established that GPCR signaling can also take place from intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes that contain internalized receptors and ligands. While the mechanisms of GPCR endocytosis are well understood, it is not clear how well internalized receptors are supplied with G proteins. To address this gap, we use gene editing, confocal microscopy, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer to study the distribution and trafficking of endogenous G proteins. We show here that constitutive endocytosis is sufficient to supply newly internalized endocytic vesicles with 20–30% of the G protein density found at the plasma membrane. We find that G proteins are present on early, late, and recycling endosomes, are abundant on lysosomes, but are virtually undetectable on the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the medial-trans Golgi apparatus. Receptor activation does not change heterotrimer abundance on endosomes. Our findings provide a subcellular map of endogenous G protein distribution, suggest that G proteins may be partially excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles, and are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes and other intracellular compartments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97298">Neuropeptide Bursicon and its receptor-mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form of Cacopsylla chinensis</a></h4>

              
                Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. <i>Cacopsylla chinensis</i> exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor <i>CcTRPM</i> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <i>C. chinensis</i> by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <i>C. chinensis</i>. Firstly, we identified <i>CcBurs-α</i> and <i>CcBurs-β</i> as two typical subunits of Bursicon in <i>C. chinensis</i>, which were regulated by low temperature (10 °C) and <i>CcTRPM</i>. Subsequently, <i>CcBurs-α</i> and <i>CcBurs-β</i> formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>CcBurs-R</i> acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets <i>CcBurs-R</i>, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of <i>C. chinensis</i>. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87668">Foxtrot migration and dynamic over-wintering range of an Arctic raptor</a></h4>

              
                Advances in tracking technologies have revealed the diverse migration patterns of birds, which are critical for range mapping and population estimation. Population trends are usually estimated in breeding ranges where birds remain stationary, but for species that breed in remote areas like the Arctic, these trends are often assessed in over-wintering ranges. Assessing population trends during the wintering season is challenging due to the extensive movements of birds in these ranges, which requires a deep understanding of the movement dynamics. However, these movements remain understudied, particularly in the mid-latitudes, where many Arctic breeders overwinter, increasing uncertainty in their ranges and numbers. Here, we show that the Arctic breeding raptor Rough-legged buzzard, which overwinters in the mid-latitudes, has a specific wintering strategy. After migrating ca. 1500 km from the Arctic to mid-latitudes, the birds continue to move throughout the entire over-wintering period, traveling another 1000 km southwest and then back northeast as the snowline advances. This continuous movement makes their wintering range dynamic throughout the season. In essence, this movement represents an extension of the quick migration process, albeit at a slower pace, and we have termed this migration pattern ‘foxtrot migration’, drawing an analogy to the alternating fast and slow movements of the foxtrot dance. These results highlight the potential errors in range mapping from single mid-winter surveys and emphasize the importance of this migration pattern in assessing the conservation status of bird species. Understanding this migration pattern could help to correctly estimate bird populations in over-wintering ranges, which is especially important for species that nest in hard-to-reach regions such as the Arctic.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89815">Archaic introgression contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and cardiovascular traits in human high-altitude populations from the Himalayas</a></h4>

              
                It is well established that several <i>Homo sapiens</i> populations experienced admixture with extinct human species during their evolutionary history. Sometimes, such a gene flow could have played a role in modulating their capability to cope with a variety of selective pressures, thus resulting in archaic adaptive introgression events. A paradigmatic example of this evolutionary mechanism is offered by the <i>EPAS1</i> gene, whose most frequent haplotype in Himalayan highlanders was proved to reduce their susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness and to be introduced in the gene pool of their ancestors by admixture with Denisovans. In this study, we aimed at further expanding the investigation of the impact of archaic introgression on more complex adaptive responses to hypobaric hypoxia evolved by populations of Tibetan/Sherpa ancestry, which have been plausibly mediated by soft selective sweeps and/or polygenic adaptations rather than by hard selective sweeps. For this purpose, we used a combination of composite-likelihood and gene network-based methods to detect adaptive loci in introgressed chromosomal segments from Tibetan WGS data and to shortlist those presenting Denisovan-like derived alleles that participate to the same functional pathways and are absent in populations of African ancestry, which are supposed to do not have experienced Denisovan admixture. According to this approach, we identified multiple genes putatively involved in archaic introgression events and that, especially as regards <i>TBC1D1</i>, <i>RASGRF2</i>, <i>PRKAG2</i>, and <i>KRAS</i>, have plausibly contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and of certain cardiovascular traits in high-altitude Himalayan peoples. These findings provided unprecedented evidence about the complexity of the adaptive phenotype evolved by these human groups to cope with challenges imposed by hypobaric hypoxia, offering new insights into the tangled interplay of genetic determinants that mediates the physiological adjustments crucial for human adaptation to the high-altitude environment.

	<p>The vestibular function is in synergism with the oculomotor vergence. Vertigo may be related to vergence disorders and conversely, vestibular pathologies may affect vergence. To consolidate this hypothesis, we conducted a study at the vestibular orthoptic clinic of the Bastogne Hospital. Fourteen patients with vertigo history appearing 2 weeks to 8 years ago, aged 30 to 65 years were studied; at the moment of the eye movement study, no patient had acute attack of vertigo. The origin of vertigo varied (Meniere&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, organic pathology, sensitivity to visual movement). An assessment with objective measurement of vergence (single-step protocol) was carried out with the REMOBI technology coupled with binocular video-oculography in sitting and standing positions. Four neuro-rehabilitation sessions of vergence eye movements were performed with the double-step in-depth protocol, alternating sitting and standing positions to involve different postural and vestibular functions. An assessment of vergence was done again 1 to 2 months later. The initial assessment revealed problems of magnitude and/or speed or variability of vergence for 11 of the patients relative to controls (published by the group in previous studies). After neuro-rehabilitation, an improvement was observed in eight patients. Patients reported a clear improvement of their self confidence in moving in the space. Posture measures done before rehabilitation comparing eyes fixating or closed or while making near&amp;amp;ndash;far vergence eye movements indicated lower medio-lateral acceleration when doing vergence eye movements in patients with vertigo history of functional origin. The results are in favor of the hypothesis of a symbiosis between vergence and vestibular function and the interest of diagnosis and rehabilitation of the vergence disorder in patients with vertigo history in the absence of acute vertigo attack.</p>
