              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11027">Functional Emotion Modeling in Biomimetic Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a functionalist approach to emotion by employing an ansatz -- an initial set of assumptions -- that a hypothetical concept generation model incorporates unproven but biologically plausible traits. From these traits, we mathematically construct a theoretical reinforcement learning framework grounded in functionalist principles and examine how the resulting utility function aligns with emotional valence in biological systems. Our focus is on structuring the functionalist perspective through a conceptual network, particularly emphasizing the construction of the utility function, not to provide an exhaustive explanation of emotions. The primary emphasis is not of planning or action execution, but such factors are addressed when pertinent. Finally, we apply the framework to psychological phenomena such as humor, psychopathy, and advertising, demonstrating its breadth of explanatory power.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11531">Langevin Flows for Modeling Neural Latent Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.11531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural populations exhibit latent dynamical structures that drive time-evolving spiking activities, motivating the search for models that capture both intrinsic network dynamics and external unobserved influences. In this work, we introduce LangevinFlow, a sequential Variational Auto-Encoder where the time evolution of latent variables is governed by the underdamped Langevin equation. Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia, damping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent both autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the potential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled oscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors observed in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent encoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent space. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching ground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model achieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward prediction accuracy across four challenging datasets. It also matches or surpasses alternative methods in decoding behavioral metrics such as hand velocity. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, physics-inspired, high-performing framework for modeling complex neural population dynamics and their unobserved influences.

                arXiv:2504.16920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we make sense of large-scale recordings of neural activity across learning? Theories of neural network learning with their origins in statistical physics offer a potential answer: for a given task, there are often a small set of summary statistics that are sufficient to predict performance as the network learns. Here, we review recent advances in how summary statistics can be used to build theoretical understanding of neural network learning. We then argue for how this perspective can inform the analysis of neural data, enabling better understanding of learning in biological and artificial neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00258">Possible Principles for Aligned Structure Learning Agents</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.00258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a roadmap for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10722">Bridging Brains and Machines: A Unified Frontier in Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, and Neuromorphic Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.10722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position and survey paper identifies the emerging convergence of neuroscience, artificial general intelligence (AGI), and neuromorphic computing toward a unified research paradigm. Using a framework grounded in brain physiology, we highlight how synaptic plasticity, sparse spike-based communication, and multimodal association provide design principles for next-generation AGI systems that potentially combine both human and machine intelligences. The review traces this evolution from early connectionist models to state-of-the-art large language models, demonstrating how key innovations like transformer attention, foundation-model pre-training, and multi-agent architectures mirror neurobiological processes like cortical mechanisms, working memory, and episodic consolidation. We then discuss emerging physical substrates capable of breaking the von Neumann bottleneck to achieve brain-scale efficiency in silicon: memristive crossbars, in-memory compute arrays, and emerging quantum and photonic devices. There are four critical challenges at this intersection: 1) integrating spiking dynamics with foundation models, 2) maintaining lifelong plasticity without catastrophic forgetting, 3) unifying language with sensorimotor learning in embodied agents, and 4) enforcing ethical safeguards in advanced neuromorphic autonomous systems. This combined perspective across neuroscience, computation, and hardware offers an integrative agenda for in each of these fields.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10678">A Group Theoretic Analysis of the Symmetries Underlying Base Addition and Their Learnability by Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder, when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function, and that learning speed is closely correlated with carry function structure. We then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.

                arXiv:2507.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation functions are key to effective backpropagation and expressiveness in deep neural networks. This work introduces Tangma, a new activation function that combines the smooth shape of the hyperbolic tangent with two learnable parameters: $\alpha$, which shifts the curve's inflection point to adjust neuron activation, and $\gamma$, which adds linearity to preserve weak gradients and improve training stability. Tangma was evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using custom networks composed of convolutional and linear layers, and compared against ReLU, Swish, and GELU. On MNIST, Tangma achieved the highest validation accuracy of 99.09% and the lowest validation loss, demonstrating faster and more stable convergence than the baselines. On CIFAR-10, Tangma reached a top validation accuracy of 78.15%, outperforming all other activation functions while maintaining a competitive training loss. Tangma also showed improved training efficiency, with lower average epoch runtimes compared to Swish and GELU. These results suggest that Tangma performs well on standard vision tasks and enables reliable, efficient training. Its learnable design gives more control over activation behavior, which may benefit larger models in tasks such as image recognition or language modeling.

                arXiv:2507.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware accelerators are essential for achieving low-latency, energy-efficient inference in edge applications like image recognition. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are particularly promising due to their event-driven and temporally sparse nature, making them well-suited for low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based deployment. This paper explores using the open-source Spiker+ framework to generate optimized SNNs accelerators for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. Spiker+ enables high-level specification of network topologies, neuron models, and quantization, automatically generating deployable HDL. We evaluate multiple configurations and analyze trade-offs relevant to edge computing constraints.

                arXiv:2507.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing wastewater rates, achieving energy-neutral purification is challenging. We introduce a coral-reef-inspired Swarm Interaction Network for carbon-neutral wastewater treatment, combining morphogenetic abstraction with multi-task carbon awareness. Scalability stems from linear token complexity, mitigating the energy-removal problem. Compared with seven baselines, our approach achieves 96.7\% removal efficiency, 0.31~kWh~m$^{-3}$ energy consumption, and 14.2~g~m$^{-3}$ CO$_2$ emissions. Variance analysis demonstrates robustness under sensor drift. Field scenarios--insular lagoons, brewery spikes, and desert greenhouses--show potential diesel savings of up to 22\%. However, data-science staffing remains an impediment. Future work will integrate AutoML wrappers within the project scope, although governance restrictions pose interpretability challenges that require further visual analytics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10568">An Exact Gradient Framework for Training Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.10568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks inherently rely on the precise timing of discrete spike events for information processing. Incorporating additional bio-inspired degrees of freedom, such as trainable synaptic transmission delays and adaptive firing thresholds, is essential for fully leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs. Although recent methods have demonstrated the benefits of training synaptic weights and delays, both in terms of accuracy and temporal representation, these techniques typically rely on discrete-time simulations, surrogate gradient approximations, or full access to internal state variables such as membrane potentials. Such requirements limit training precision and efficiency and pose challenges for neuromorphic hardware implementation due to increased memory and I/O bandwidth demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical event-driven learning framework that computes exact loss gradients not only with respect to synaptic weights and transmission delays but also to adaptive neuronal firing thresholds. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant gains in accuracy (up to 7%), timing precision, and robustness compared to existing methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10708">Grammatical Structure and Grammatical Variations in Non-Metric Iranian Classical Music</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we introduce a symbolic dataset composed of non-metric Iranian classical music, and algorithms for structural parsing of this music, and generation of variations. The corpus comprises MIDI files and data sheets of Dastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah, the foundational repertoire of Iranian classical music. Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for parsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much Western music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric organisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing algorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and phrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and ethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced method of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an existing tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we generate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the original tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener. Additionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different representation setups for our parsing and generation algorithms. The overarching conclusion is that the system successfully produces acceptable variations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical music, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music.

                arXiv:2507.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete connectome of the Drosophila larva brain offers a unique opportunity to investigate whether biologically evolved circuits can support artificial intelligence. We convert this wiring diagram into a Biological Processing Unit (BPU), a fixed recurrent network derived directly from synaptic connectivity. Despite its modest size 3,000 neurons and 65,000 weights between them), the unmodified BPU achieves 98% accuracy on MNIST and 58% on CIFAR-10, surpassing size-matched MLPs. Scaling the BPU via structured connectome expansions further improves CIFAR-10 performance, while modality-specific ablations reveal the uneven contributions of different sensory subsystems. On the ChessBench dataset, a lightweight GNN-BPU model trained on only 10,000 games achieves 60% move accuracy, nearly 10x better than any size transformer. Moreover, CNN-BPU models with ~2M parameters outperform parameter-matched Transformers, and with a depth-6 minimax search at inference, reach 91.7% accuracy, exceeding even a 9M-parameter Transformer baseline. These results demonstrate the potential of biofidelic neural architectures to support complex cognitive tasks and motivate scaling to larger and more intelligent connectomes in future work.

                arXiv:2507.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' . Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.

                arXiv:2507.10574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function. This is a novel measure derived from the information theory. In comparison to the standard cross entropy loss function, the proposed one has an additional term that depends on the predicted probability of the true class. This feature serves to enhance the optimization process in classification tasks involving one-hot encoded class labels. The proposed one has been evaluated on a ResNet-based model using the CIFAR-100 dataset. Preliminary results show that the proposed one consistently outperforms the standard cross entropy loss function in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed one maintains simplicity, achieving practically the same efficiency to the traditional cross entropy loss. These findings suggest that our approach could broaden the scope for future research into loss function design.

                arXiv:2507.10589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pneumonia, particularly when induced by diseases like COVID-19, remains a critical global health challenge requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated pneumonia detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). We evaluate multiple methodologies, ranging from conventional machine learning techniques (PCA-based clustering, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classification) to advanced deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (Modified LeNet, DenseNet-121) and various Vision Transformer (ViT) implementations (Deep-ViT, Compact Convolutional Transformer, and Cross-ViT). Using a dataset of 5,856 pediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the Cross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and 99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that architectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size, with Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models. The study also addresses practical considerations including computational efficiency, training requirements, and the critical balance between precision and recall in medical diagnostics. Our findings suggest that Vision Transformers offer a promising direction for automated pneumonia detection, potentially enabling more rapid and accurate diagnosis during health crises.

                arXiv:2507.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of urban low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) economy poses new challenges for dynamic site selection of UAV landing points and supply stations. Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with 1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3 seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.

                arXiv:2507.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [ 1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially 19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar. Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune. The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only focused on generating new pitch sequences. The study is based on an Irish traditional tune dataset and a list of integers has been used to represent each tune's pitch values.

                arXiv:2507.11493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel parametric activation function based on Wendland radial basis functions (RBFs) for deep neural networks. Wendland RBFs, known for their compact support, smoothness, and positive definiteness in approximation theory, are adapted to address limitations of traditional activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. The proposed enhanced Wendland activation combines a standard Wendland component with linear and exponential terms, offering tunable locality, improved gradient propagation, and enhanced stability during training. Theoretical analysis highlights its mathematical properties, including smoothness and adaptability, while empirical experiments on synthetic tasks (e.g., sine wave approximation) and benchmark datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate competitive performance. Results show that the Wendland-based activation achieves superior accuracy in certain scenarios, particularly in regression tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. The study bridges classical RBF theory with modern deep learning, suggesting that Wendland activations can mitigate overfitting and improve generalization through localized, smooth transformations. Future directions include hybrid architectures and domain-specific adaptations.

Abstract: The paper explores the capability of continuous-time recurrent neural networks to store and recall precisely timed scores of spike trains. We show (by numerical experiments) that this is indeed possible: within some range of parameters, any random score of spike trains (for all neurons in the network) can be robustly memorized and autonomously reproduced with stable accurate relative timing of all spikes, with probability close to one. We also demonstrate associative recall under noisy conditions.
  In these experiments, the required synaptic weights are computed offline, to satisfy a template that encourages temporal stability.

Abstract: Biologically inspired neural networks offer alternative avenues to model data distributions. FlyVec is a recent example that draws inspiration from the fruit fly's olfactory circuit to tackle the task of learning word embeddings. Surprisingly, this model performs competitively even against deep learning approaches specifically designed to encode text, and it does so with the highest degree of computational efficiency. We pose the question of whether this performance can be improved further. For this, we introduce Comply. By incorporating positional information through complex weights, we enable a single-layer neural network to learn sequence representations. Our experiments show that Comply not only supersedes FlyVec but also performs on par with significantly larger state-of-the-art models. We achieve this without additional parameters. Comply yields sparse contextual representations of sentences that can be interpreted explicitly from the neuron weights.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Social behaviors in the African wild dog involve a range of complex movements, including biting, pushing, embracing, mounting, face and muzzle licking, paw placement, play fighting, and wrestling. In this study, we employ a range of architectural and immunohistochemical stains to provide a qualitative description of the motor system in the brain of one representative individual of the African wild dog. The appearance of the motor system in the African wild dog does not differ substantively to that reported in other carnivores and is neurochemically like that of the domestic dog; however, one significant difference was detected: the presence of a distinct fascicle of protoplasmic commissural dendrites at the rostral pole of the hypoglossal nucleus. The chemoarchitecture and complement of motor cortical areas and dorsal thalamus, striatopallidal complex and associated nuclei, cerebellum, red nucleus, descending motor pathways, inferior olivary nuclear complex, cranial nerve motor nuclei, and ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord of the African wild dog do not reveal qualitative differences to that observed in the domestic dog. At the rostral pole of the hypoglossal nucleus, protoplasmic commissural dendrites form a distinct fascicle, this fascicle being a feature that has not been reported in other mammals. The presence of this feature indicates complex neural control of the tongue and may facilitate vocalization control through the potential combination of lateralized aspects of vocalizations in a nucleus playing a major role in the production of vocalizations.</p>

                <p>Advances in in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using miniature microscopes have enabled researchers to study single-neuron activity in freely moving animals. Tools such as Minian and CalmAn have been developed to convert Ca<sup>2+</sup> visual signals to numerical data, collectively referred to as CalV2N. However, substantial challenges remain in analyzing the large datasets generated by CalV2N, particularly in integrating data streams, evaluating CalV2N output quality, and reliably and efficiently identifying Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. In this study, we introduce CalTrig, an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to address these challenges at the post-CalV2N stage of data processing collected from C57BL/6J mice. CalTrig integrates multiple data streams, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, neuronal footprints, Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces, and behavioral tracking, and offers capabilities for evaluating the quality of CalV2N outputs. It enables synchronized visualization and efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient identification. We evaluated four machine learning models (i.e., GRU, LSTM, Transformer, and Local Transformer) for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient detection. Our results indicate that the GRU model offers the highest predictability and computational efficiency, achieving stable performance across training sessions, different animals, and even among different brain regions. The integration of manual, parameter-based, and machine learning-based detection methods in CalTrig provides flexibility and accuracy for various research applications. The user-friendly interface and low computing demands of CalTrig make it accessible to neuroscientists without programming expertise. We further conclude that CalTrig enables deeper exploration of brain function, supports hypothesis generation about neuronal mechanisms, and opens new avenues for understanding neurological disorders and developing treatments.</p>

                <p>Animal behavior is crucial for understanding both normal brain function and dysfunction. To facilitate behavior analysis of mice within their home environments, we developed DeepEthoProfile, an open-source software powered by a deep convolutional neural network for efficient behavior classification. DeepEthoProfile requires no spatial cues for either training or processing and is designed to perform reliably under real laboratory conditions, tolerating variations in lighting and cage bedding. For data collection, we introduce EthoProfiler, a mobile cage rack system capable of simultaneously recording up to 10 singly housed mice. We used 36&nbsp;h of manually annotated video data sampled in 5&nbsp;min clips from a 48&nbsp;h video database of 10 mice. This published dataset provides a reference that can facilitate further research. DeepEthoProfile achieved an overall classification accuracy of over 83%, comparable with human-level accuracy. The model also performed on par with other state-of-the-art solutions on another published dataset (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B8">Jhuang et al., 2010</cross-ref>). Designed for long-term experiments, DeepEthoProfile is highly efficient&mdash;capable of annotating nearly 2,000 frames per second and can be customized for various research needs.</p>

                Background The empowerment of rural women is a key dimension for achieving gender equity and sustainable development. With this purpose, the present study analyzed the patterns and trends of scientific production on this topic using the Scopus database. Methodology A quantitative approach was employed through bibliometric and scientometric techniques, using a collection of 376 documents (1983–2024). Through Bibliometrix (R) and VOSviewer, we identified co-authorship networks, thematic clusters, conceptual evolution, and indicators of productivity and impact. Results Scientific production has shown sustained growth since 2015, driven by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the increasing visibility of structural inequalities. The findings highlight institutional dispersion and limited international collaboration. Authors such as Mudhara M and Aziz N stand out for their recent impact. Semantic analysis reveals the centrality of terms such as agency, gender equality, and rural development. The structural thematic map shows that concepts like women’s rights and economic factors drive the field, while categories such as empowerment and leadership require further theoretical consolidation. Publication year spectroscopy reveals historical roots in the foundational works of Freire, Boserup, and Kabeer, who introduced emancipatory, relational, and critical perspectives on empowerment—now reinterpreted through intersectional approaches. Conclusions The field has achieved conceptual maturity but still faces challenges related to methodological integration and global collaboration. It is recommended to broaden the analysis to other databases, strengthen scientific networks, and incorporate more integrative approaches into the contemporary rural agenda.

                <p>by Kyoko Yoshida, Elsje Pienaar, Shalanda A. Bynum, Naomi Chesler, Mitchel J. Colebank, Jessie Heneghan, Nadra Tyus, Jasmine Miller-Kleinhenz, Bruce Y. Lee</p>

Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in which people live, work, and play, and the wider set of factors (e.g., social and economic systems and policies) that shape a person’s daily life. SDOH can differ significantly across communities and populations, having positive impacts for some and negative impacts for others. Ultimately, this results in differences in health and disease distribution, that are known as health disparities. Despite the known impacts of SDOH and calls to characterize, address, reduce, and eliminate health disparities, they persist and, in some cases, have worsened. To address this challenge, a session at the Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group Multiscale Modeling Meeting held on the National Institutes of Health campus from June 28th to 29th, 2023, considered potential ways that multiscale modeling can help characterize adverse SDOH and resulting health disparities. This perspective summarizes and synthesizes the session discussions as a call to action to promote and strengthen interdisciplinary science that merges the unique perspectives, experiences, and expertise of the SDOH and multiscale modeling scientific communities in the pursuit of knowledge to improve population health. Specifically, we identify current challenges and ways in which multiscale modeling is uniquely suited to address the challenges, as well as identify what is necessary to facilitate the successful application of multiscale modeling in SDOH research. We conclude with a discussion on the future of multiscale modeling in SDOH and health disparities research.

                <p>by Rui Wang, Tamar Schlick</p>

Identifying novel and functional RNA structures remains a significant challenge in RNA motif design and is crucial for developing RNA-based therapeutics. Here we introduce a computational topology-based approach with unsupervised machine-learning algorithms to estimate the database size and content of RNA-like graph topologies. Specifically, we apply graph theory enumeration to generate all 110,667 possible 2D dual graphs for vertex numbers ranging from 2 to 9. Among them, only 0.11% (121 dual graphs) correspond to approximately 200,000 known RNA atomic fragments/substructures (collected in 2021) using the RNA-as-Graphs (RAG) framework. The remaining 99.89% of the dual graphs may be RNA-like or non-RNA-like. To determine which dual graphs in the 99.89% hypothetical set are more likely to be associated with RNA structures, we apply computational topology descriptors using the Persistent Spectral Graphs (PSG) method to characterize each graph using 19 PSG-based features and use clustering algorithms that partition all possible dual graphs into two clusters. The cluster with the higher percentage of known dual graphs for RNA is defined as the “RNA-like" cluster, while the other is considered as “non-RNA-like". The distance between each dual graph and the center of the RNA-like cluster represents the likelihood of it belonging to RNA structures. From validation, our PSG-based RNA-like cluster includes 97.3% of the 121 known RNA dual graphs, suggesting good performance. Furthermore, 46.017% of the hypothetical RNAs are predicted to be RNA-like. Among the top 15 graphs identified as high-likelihood candidates for novel RNA motifs, 4 were confirmed from the RNA dataset collected in 2022. Significantly, we observe that all the top 15 RNA-like dual graphs can be separated into multiple subgraphs, whereas the top 15 non-RNA-like dual graphs tend not to have any subgraphs (subgraphs preserve pseudoknots and junctions). Moreover, a significant topological difference between top RNA-like and non-RNA-like graphs is evident when comparing their topological features (e.g., Betti-0 and Betti-1 numbers). These findings provide valuable insights into the size of the RNA motif universe and RNA design strategies, offering a novel framework for predicting RNA graph topologies and guiding the discovery of novel RNA motifs, perhaps anti-viral therapeutics by subgraph assembly.

                <p>by Sheera R. Rosenbaum, Kaiah M. Fields, Heide L. Ford</p>

One of the greatest challenges to cancer therapy is tumor cell plasticity. Cancer cells can rapidly alter their phenotype to promote survival and evade immune cell attack, while the plasticity of other cells in the tumor microenvironment (such as immune cells, which need to be able to respond to a diverse range of bodily threats) can be leveraged to further promote tumor growth and progression. This Essay discusses the mutual plasticity of cancer and immune cells, with a focus on epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity in tumor cells, and explores how this interplay contributes to tumor progression and can be targeted therapeutically.

                <p>by Syed Shan-e-Ali Zaidi, Sara Shakir, Hanne De Kort, Devang Mehta, Vu Nguyen, Ruben Gutzat, Hervé Vanderschuren</p>

Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) has been described in several eukaryotic species and has been shown to impact phenomena as diverse as cancer and herbicide tolerance. EccDNA is thought to arise mainly through transposable element (TE) mobilization. Because studies based on short-read sequencing cannot efficiently identify full-length eccDNA forms generated from TEs, we employed the CIDER-Seq pipeline based on long-read sequencing, to obtain full-length eccDNAs from <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The generated eccDNA datasets identified centromeric/pericentromeric regions as hotspots of eccDNAs with several eccDNA molecules originating from Helitron and LTR TEs. To investigate the role of epigenetic marks on TE-derived eccDNA biogenesis, we studied <i>Arabidopsis</i> methylation mutants <i>dcl3</i>, <i>rdr6</i>, <i>ros1</i>, and <i>ddm1</i>. Contrasting the TE-suppression previously reported in the hypermethylated <i>ros1</i> mutants, we identified activation of TEs in <i>ros1</i>, specifically of <i>LTR/Gypsy</i> TEs. An enrichment of <i>LTR/Copia</i> elements was identified in actively dividing calli and the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Uncharacterized “variable TEs” with high eccDNA and expression were identified in the SAM, including <i>ATCOPIA58</i>. Together, our study reveals the genomic origins of eccDNAs and delineates the link between epigenetic regulation, transposon mobilization, and eccDNA biogenesis.

                <p>by Bowen Xu, Alexander Hull, Olivia N. M. Hill, Naja Kobal, Enric Ureña, Linda Partridge, Nazif Alic</p>

Attenuating protein synthesis promotes longevity in multiple species. However, numerous studies indicate that aging drives a decrease in protein synthetic capacity. These observations hint at potential, unexplored benefits of stimulating protein synthesis in old age. In this work, we focus on Maf1, a repressor of protein synthesis genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase (Pol) III, such as the 5S rRNA and tRNAs, and its role in aging. We show that the knockdown of Maf1 extends lifespan in <i>Drosophila.</i> Maf1 limits longevity specifically from adult neurons in both female and male fruit flies. In older females, adult neuron-specific knockdown of Maf1 improves neuromuscular function as well as the function of a distal organ, the gut. We find that the extension of female lifespan upon Maf1 knockdown requires Pol III initiation on the 5S rRNA. Indeed, reducing neuronal Maf1 activity rescues the age-related decline in 5S expression and protein synthesis in the brain of female flies. Hence, our findings show that stimulating neuronal protein synthesis can promote healthy aging.

                <p>by Lei Zhang, Bernhard Ross, Yi Du, Claude Alain</p>

During cognitive tasks, older adults often show increased frontoparietal neural activity and functional connectivity. Cognitive reserve accrued from positive life choices like long-term musical training can provide additional neural resources to help cope with the effect of aging. However, the relationship between cognitive reserve and upregulated neural activity in older adults remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a speech-in-noise task and assessed whether cognitive reserve accumulated from long-term musical training bolsters or holds back age-related increase in neural activity. Older musicians exhibited less upregulation of task-induced functional connectivity than older non-musicians in auditory dorsal regions, which predicted better behavioral performance in older musicians. Furthermore, older musicians demonstrated more youth-like spatial patterns of functional connectivity, as compared to older non-musicians. Our findings show that cognitive reserve accrued through long-term music training holds back age-related neural recruitment during speech-in-noise perception and enlighten the intricate interplay between cognitive reserve and age-related upregulated activity during cognitive tasks.

                <p>by Matthew French, Rosa P. Migueles, Alexandra Neaverson, Aishani Chakraborty, Tom Pettini, Benjamin Steventon, Erik Clark, J. Kim Dale, Guillaume Blin, Valerie Wilson, Sally Lowell</p>

Patterning of cell fates is central to embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and disease. Quantitative analysis of patterning reveals the logic by which cell-cell interactions orchestrate changes in cell fate. However, it is challenging to quantify patterning when graded changes in identity occur over complex 4D trajectories, or where different cell states are intermingled. Furthermore, comparing patterns across multiple individual embryos, tissues, or organoids is difficult because these often vary in shape and size. This problem is further exacerbated when comparing patterning between species. Here we present a toolkit of computational approaches to tackle these problems. These strategies are based on measuring properties of each cell in relation to the properties of its neighbors to quantify patterning, and on using embryonic landmarks in order to compare these patterns between embryos. We perform detailed neighbor-analysis of the caudal lateral epiblast of E8.5 mouse embryos, revealing local patterning in emergence of early mesoderm cells that is sensitive to inhibition of Notch activity. We extend this toolkit to compare mouse and chick embryos, revealing conserved 3D patterning of the caudal-lateral epiblast that scales across an order of magnitude difference in size between these two species. We also examine 3D patterning of gene expression boundaries across the length of <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. We present a flexible approach to examine the reproducibility of patterning between individuals, to measure phenotypic changes in patterning after experimental manipulation, and to compare of patterning across different scales and tissue architectures.

                <p>by Anton Amrhein, Mingxiao Zhang, Stéphane Hacquard, Anna Heintz-Buschart, Kathrin Wippel</p>

The plant root microbiota is crucial for nutrient acquisition, development, and disease suppression. Although commensal bacteria display host preference, their beneficial impact on their cognate host and mechanisms of species selection by the plant are still unclear. We use bacterial culture collections derived from the two model species <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<i>At</i>) and <i>Lotus japonicus</i> (<i>Lj</i>) to design synthetic communities (SynComs) and test their protective function upon exposure of <i>At</i> Col-0 to the detrimental root-colonizing <i>At</i>-derived <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolate R401. <i>Lj</i>-derived SynComs were fully protective, whereas <i>At</i>-derived SynComs displayed full protective activity only towards a R401 mutant impaired in the production of inhibitory exometabolites. The protective phenotypes were associated with a reduced titer of the R401 opportunistic pathogen. In vitro antagonist assays, <i>in planta</i> and in vitro bacterial community profiling, as well as strain-swapping and strain-dropout experiments revealed that competition among commensal <i>Pseudomonas</i> strains and R401 determines the success of the opportunist, independent of the original host or the phylogeny of the commensals. Furthermore, we determine the carbon utilization potential of these isolates, which may explain the competition with the detrimental strain and the role of host-secreted compounds. Our results provide evidence that intra-genus interactions within SynComs modulate plant health and disease, and that an individual beneficial strain can be sufficient to outcompete an opportunistic relative. This has implications for the successful development of beneficial microbial consortia for agriculture.

                Objective Diet is a key modulator of gut microbiota composition, and dietary inflammation may significantly influence metabolic disorders such as diabetes. In this study, we explored the relationship between the Food Inflammatory Index (FII) and gut microbiota composition in 234 type 2 diabetic patients from Saudi Arabia. Method A total of 234 Participants were divided into quartiles according to their FII scores, which increased progressively, effectively distinguishing varying levels of dietary inflammatory potential. Results Microbiome sequencing revealed that while overall alpha diversity remained stable, beta diversity analysis indicated subtle yet statistically significant differences in microbial community structure (PERMANOVA p = 0.001, R2 = 2.14%). At the phylum level, the dominant taxa Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, exhibited significant shifts, with a non-linear ratio of Bacteroidota to Firmicutes observed across FII quartiles. Genus-level analysis revealed significant variations in Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Prevotella_9, with pairwise comparisons highlighting marked differences between the lowest and highest FII quartiles. Conclusions These compositional changes suggest that increased dietary inflammation is linked to a shift toward a dysbiotic gut microbiota, which may exacerbate metabolic dysregulation in diabetes. These findings pave the way for future studies to investigate whether targeted, FII-guided dietary interventions can modulate gut microbial communities and enhance metabolic health in diabetic populations.

                This paper introduces a novel pseudo-random number generation algorithm incorporating modulo arithmetic, XORShift, and entropy modulation. The method is designed to enhance randomness and unpredictability by utilizing bitwise manipulations and dynamic entropy modulation. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm’s performance across various test sets. The algorithm seeks to resolve two of the most common problems of common PRNGs, which are the quality of randomness with selection of an arbitrary seed and the presence of periodic cycles. The findings suggest potential applications in cryptography and statistical simulations.

                Efferocytosis, the phagocytic removal of dead cells by microglia and macrophages, was recently recognized as a critical process in the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair following ischemic stroke. In this review, we examine the pathways involved in efferocytosis after stroke, including the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells and the modulation of inflammatory responses. We elaborate on the pathways regulating efferocytosis and discuss how dysregulated efferocytosis can contribute to secondary injury and neurological deficits. Furthermore, we explore valuable mechanisms gleaned from retinopathy, a condition with parallels to ischemic stroke in terms of cellular death and immune responses. We then discuss phagocytosis assays used in brain and retina research. Finally, we highlight future perspectives on, and outstanding questions related to, efferocytosis in stroke.

                Norris et al. demonstrate the detrimental role of intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) on muscle regeneration. Following injury, IMAT inhibition enhances muscle regeneration by increasing myofiber density and size. Mechanistically, IMAT restricts the formation and subsequent hypertrophic growth of nascent myofibers, highlighting IMAT as an important therapeutic target.

                Barata et al. show that the Alzheimer’s risk gene BIN1 is critical for the stability of inhibitory synapses. BIN1 deficiency accelerates the synaptic vesicle endocytic cycle, leading to synapse loss and neuronal hyperexcitability, a phenotype reversed by the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam.

                Lai et al. report that the knockout of the autism-risk gene, MOESIN, from male mice leads to social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Mechanistic studies suggest the possible involvement of microglial hyperactivation and synaptic phagocytosis, impairing cortical transmission.

                Olfactory receptor (OR) expression is refined from multiple to one OR, enabling axon targeting to an OR-specific glomerulus. Polygenic OR translation during differentiation would disrupt precise axonal targeting. We show that Mex3a, an RNA binding and ubiquitin ligase protein, represses ORs in immature neurons preventing axon mistargeting in mature neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104048">Human formin FHOD3-mediated actin elongation is required for sarcomere integrity in cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                Contractility and cell motility depend on accurately controlled assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Formins are a large group of actin assembly proteins that nucleate and elongate new actin filaments. Some formins may cap filaments while others sever or bundle filaments. The formin homology domain-containing protein (FHOD) family of formins is critical to the formation of the fundamental contractile unit in muscle, the sarcomere. Specifically, mammalian FHOD3L plays an essential role in cardiomyocytes. Despite our knowledge of FHOD3L’s importance in cardiomyocytes, its biochemical and cellular activities remain poorly understood. It was proposed that FHOD-family formins act by capping and bundling, as opposed to assembling new filaments. Here, we demonstrate that human FHOD3L nucleates actin and rapidly but briefly elongates filaments after temporarily pausing elongation. We designed function-separating mutants that enabled us to distinguish which biochemical roles are required in the cell. We found that FHOD3L’s elongation activity, but not its nucleation, capping, or bundling activity, is necessary for proper sarcomere formation and contractile function in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The results of this work provide new insight into the mechanisms by which formins build specific structures and will contribute to knowledge regarding how cardiomyopathies arise from defects in sarcomere formation and maintenance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105696">Differential roles of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 in neocortical pyramidal cell excitability</a></h4>

              
                Mature neocortical pyramidal cells functionally express two sodium channel (Na<sub>V</sub>) isoforms: Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. These isoforms are differentially localized to pyramidal cell compartments, and as such are thought to contribute to different aspects of neuronal excitability. But determining their precise roles in pyramidal cell excitability has been hampered by a lack of tools that allow for selective, acute block of each isoform individually. Here, we leveraged aryl sulfonamide-based molecule (ASC) inhibitors of Na<sub>V</sub> channels that exhibit state-dependent block of both Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, along with knock-in mice with changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 structure that prevents ASC binding. This allowed for acute, potent, and reversible block of individual isoforms that permitted dissection of the unique contributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in pyramidal cell excitability. Remarkably, block of each isoform had contrasting—and in some situations, opposing—effects on neuronal action potential output, with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 block decreasing and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 block increasing output. Thus, Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms have unique roles in regulating different aspects of pyramidal cell excitability, and our work may help guide the development of therapeutics designed to temper hyperexcitability through selective Na<sub>V</sub> isoform blockade.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104367">Opposing regulation of TNF responses by IFN-γ and a PGE2-cAMP axis that is apparent in rheumatoid and immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced arthritis human IL-1β+ macrophages</a></h4>

              
                IL-1β-expressing macrophages have been described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis (ICI-arthritis), and pancreatic cancer and proposed to be pathogenic. IL-1β+ macrophages express genes cooperatively induced by PGE2 and TNF signaling, but mechanisms that induce these cells are not known. We used an integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis in primary human monocytes to study PGE2-TNF crosstalk, and how it is regulated by IFN-γ, as occurs in RA synovial macrophages. We identified a TNF + PGE2 (TP) induced gene expression signature that is enriched in IL1β+ RA and ICI-arthritis monocytic subsets, and includes genes in pathogenic IL-1, Notch and neutrophil chemokine pathways. ICI-arthritis myeloid cells mapped primarily onto four previously defined RA synovial monocytic clusters, and TP genes were expressed in a manner suggestive of a new functional monocyte subset. TP signature genes are distinct from canonical inflammatory NF-κB target genes such as <i>TNF</i>, <i>IL6</i> and <i>IL12B</i> and are activated by cooperation of PGE2-induced AP-1, CEBP and NR4A family transcription factors with TNF-induced NF-κB activity. Unexpectedly, IFN-γ suppressed induction of AP-1, CEBP and NR4A activity to ablate induction of IL-1, Notch and neutrophil chemokine genes, while promoting expression of distinct inflammatory genes such as <i>TNF</i> and T cell chemokines like CXCL10. The opposing cross-regulation of PGE2 and IFN signaling in vitro was reflected in vivo in mutually exclusive expression of TP and IFN signatures in different cell clusters in RA and ICI-arthritis monocytes. These results reveal the basis for synergistic induction of inflammatory genes by PGE2 and TNF, and a novel regulatory axis whereby IFN-γ and PGE2 oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs relevant for RA and ICI-arthritis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100193">A mathematical model for ketosis-prone diabetes suggests the existence of multiple pancreatic β-cell inactivation mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus (KPD) is a subtype of type 2 diabetes, which presents much like type 1 diabetes, with dramatic hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Although KPD patients are initially insulin-dependent, after a few months of insulin treatment, roughly 70% undergo near-normoglycemia remission and can maintain blood glucose without insulin, as in early type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. Here, we propose that these phenomena can be explained by the existence of a fast, reversible glucotoxicity process, which may exist in all people but be more pronounced in those susceptible to KPD. We develop a simple mathematical model of the pathogenesis of KPD, which incorporates this assumption, and show that it reproduces the phenomenology of KPD, including variations in the ability for patients to achieve and sustain remission. These results suggest that a variation of our model may be able to quantitatively describe variations in the course of remission among individuals with KPD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95324">EPHA4 signaling dysregulation links abnormal locomotion and the development of idiopathic scoliosis</a></h4>

              
                Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common form of spinal deformity with unclear pathogenesis. In this study, we first reanalyzed the loci associated with IS, drawing upon previous studies. Subsequently, we mapped these loci to candidate genes using either location-based or function-based strategies. To further substantiate our findings, we verified the enrichment of variants within these candidate genes across several large IS cohorts encompassing Chinese, East Asian, and European populations. Consequently, we identified variants in the <i>EPHA4</i> gene as compelling candidates for IS. To confirm their pathogenicity, we generated zebrafish mutants of <i>epha4a</i>. Remarkably, the zebrafish <i>epha4a</i> mutants exhibited pronounced scoliosis during later stages of development, effectively recapitulating the IS phenotype. We observed that the <i>epha4a</i> mutants displayed defects in left-right coordination during locomotion, which arose from disorganized neural activation in these mutants. Our subsequent experiments indicated that the disruption of the central pattern generator (CPG) network, characterized by abnormal axon guidance of spinal cord interneurons, contributed to the disorganization observed in the mutants. Moreover, when knocked down <i>efnb3b</i>, the ligand for Epha4a, we observed similar CPG defects and disrupted left-right locomotion. These findings suggested that ephrin B3-Epha4 signaling is vital for the proper functioning of CPGs, and defects in this pathway could lead to scoliosis in zebrafish. Furthermore, we identified two cases of IS in <i>NGEF</i>, a downstream molecule in the EPHA4 pathway. Collectively, our data provide compelling evidence that neural patterning impairments and disruptions in CPGs may underlie the pathogenesis of IS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105411">Old age variably impacts chimpanzee engagement and efficiency in stone tool use</a></h4>

              
                We know vanishingly little about how long-lived apes experience senescence in the wild, particularly with respect to their foraging behaviors. Chimpanzees use tools during foraging, and given the cognitive and physical challenges presented by tool use, tool-use behaviors are potentially at a heightened risk of senescence, though this has never been investigated in wild individuals. Accordingly, we sampled data from a longitudinal video archive that contained footage of wild chimpanzees using stone hammers and anvils to crack hard-shelled nuts (<i>nut cracking</i>) at an ‘outdoor laboratory’ over a 17-year period (with focal chimpanzees aging from approximately 39–44 to 56–61 years across this period). Over time, elderly chimpanzees began attending experimental nut-cracking sites less frequently than younger individuals. Several elderly chimpanzees exhibited reductions in efficiency across multiple stages of nut cracking, including taking longer to both select stone tools prior to use and use tools to crack open nuts and consume the associated pieces of kernel. Two chimpanzees began using less streamlined behavioral sequences to crack nuts, including a greater number of actions (such as more numerous hammer strikes). Notably, we report interindividual variability in the extent to which elderly chimpanzees’ tool-use behaviors changed during our sample period – ranging from small to profound reductions in engagement and efficiency – as well as differences in the specific aspects of nut cracking that changed for each individual. We discuss the possible causes of these changes – and recommendations for future research – with reference to literature surrounding the senescence of captive and wild primates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103828">Female-germline specific protein Sakura interacts with Otu and is crucial for germline stem cell renewal and differentiation and oogenesis</a></h4>

              
                During oogenesis, self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells (GSCs) must be tightly regulated. The <i>Drosophila</i> female germline serves as an excellent model for studying these regulatory mechanisms. Here, we report that a previously uncharacterized gene <i>CG14545</i>, which we named <i>sakura</i>, is essential for oogenesis and female fertility in <i>Drosophila</i>. Sakura is predominantly expressed in the ovaries, particularly in the germline cells, including GSCs. sakura null mutant female flies display rudimentary ovaries with germline-less and tumorous phenotypes, fail to produce eggs, and are completely sterile. The germline-specific depletion of sakura impairs Dpp/BMP signaling, leading to aberrant <i>bag-of-marbles</i> (<i>bam</i>) expression, resulting in faulty differentiation and loss of GSCs. sakura is also necessary for normal levels of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) levels and for female-specific splicing of <i>sex-lethal</i> (<i>sxl</i>), a master regulator of sex identity determination. We identified Ovarian Tumor (Otu) as a protein binding partner of Sakura and found that loss of <i>otu</i> phenocopies loss of <i>sakura</i> in ovaries. Thus, we identify Sakura as a crucial factor for GSC renewal and differentiation and oogenesis, and propose that Sakura and Otu function together in these processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101670">Malnutrition drives infection susceptibility and dysregulated myelopoiesis that persists after refeeding intervention</a></h4>

              
                Undernutrition remains a major global health crisis, with nearly 1 billion people experiencing severe food insecurity. Malnourished individuals are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for this population. Despite the known link between undernutrition and infection susceptibility, the mechanisms remain poorly understood, and it is unclear whether refeeding can reverse nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency. Here, we investigate how malnutrition leads to immune dysfunction and the ability of refeeding to repair it. Malnourished mice show an inability to control sublethal <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection, reduced immune cell function and expansion, and early contraction before pathogen clearance. Myelopoiesis is particularly affected, with fewer neutrophils and monocytes present both before and after infection in malnourished mice. While refeeding restores body mass, lymphoid organ cellularity, and T cell responses, refed mice remain susceptible to <i>Listeria</i> infection, revealing that recovery from lymphoid atrophy alone is not sufficient to restore protective immunity. Accordingly, peripheral neutrophils and monocytes fail to fully recover, and emergency myelopoiesis remains impaired in refed animals. Altogether, this work identifies dysregulated myelopoiesis as a link between prior nutritional state and immunocompetency, indicating that food scarcity is an immunologic risk factor, even after nutritional recovery.

">Altered Decision-Making Across Acute and Chronic Pain States: A Bias Towards Context-Dependent Valuations</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain has been linked to changes in learning and decision-making, but the underlying cognitive mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, 239 participants with either chronic, acute, or no pain completed a reinforcement learning task designed to dissociate choices based on global expected value from those driven by context-specific reinforcement history. While learning performance was comparable across groups, individuals with chronic pain relied more on recent reinforcement history and less on integrated value representations during decision-making. Computational modeling confirmed that a mixture model best captured behavior across groups, with the chronic pain group assigning significantly less weight to global expected values. The acute pain group showed an intermediate pattern, suggesting a potential transitional phenotype. This shift in valuation strategy was associated with the duration of pain rather than its intensity, suggesting that prolonged exposure to pain may gradually alter decision-making processes. These findings indicate a shift in valuation strategy associated with chronic pain, which may contribute to the persistence of maladaptive behaviors and offer a cognitive marker for pain chronification.

                The brain is sustained by an intricate vascular network that provides a continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen essential for its function. Understanding the structural variability and region-specific function of this neurovascular system is essential for interpreting neurological alterations in disease models. Leveraging the spatial mRNA-guided generative model Tera-MIND, we propose to predict the spatial organization of brain vasculature by the co-expression patterns of Cldn5 and Acta2 genes and their learned attention map at cell-level resolution. These findings showcase the modeling capability of generative AI trained on single cell spatial mRNA data for higher order structures and underscores its potential for high-throughput investigation of critical vascular functions and their dysregulation in neurological disorders.

">Aberrant medial prefrontal cortex activity and flexible behavior in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive deficits, including deficits in the ability to shift behavior following negative consequences, often precede the accumulation of canonical neuropathological markers (Abeta plaques, and tauopathy) and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The Tg-F344-AD rat model exhibits age-dependent AD pathology and memory deficits that recapitulate AD However, it is unknown how medial prefrontal cortex activity is altered in awake and behaving AD rats during learning and/or flexible behavior. Here we determine the ability of in 6-7month-old TgF344-AD rats to learn reward predictive cues and to shift behavior away from reward-predictive cues following outcome devaluation while recording mPFC neurons. Specifically, AD rats (n=17) and wild-type littermates (n=17) were presented with two distinct cues as conditioned stimuli (CS+) predicting distinct outcomes. A conditioned taste aversion to one outcome was induced, after which the rats were tested post-devaluation to evaluate their ability to avoid the CS+ associated with the devalued outcome. We found a loss of motivated behavior during learning and a loss of flexible behavior during testing in 6-7-month-old AD rats relative to WT littermate controls. In addition, there was differential aberrant mPFC encoding of cue-outcome associations in AD rats during conditioning and following outcome devaluation. Specifically, AD animals show fewer neurons during conditioning that encode both the cue and the outcome than WT animals. Also, AD animals showed a greater proportion of neurons that exhibited an excited response to reward predictive cues following outcome devaluation. Together, these data contribute to our understanding of alterations in mPFC that may underlie prodromal AD behavioral deficits to inform future treatments.

">Local Dendritic Landscape of Mouse V1</a></h4>

              
                The principles that govern where excitatory synapses form on cortical pyramidal neurons remain unclear. A long-standing hypothesis is that connectivity mirrors neuronal geometry with apical dendrites dominating in layer 1 and basal dendrites in deeper layers. Leveraging the MiCRONS cubic-millimetre serial electron-microscopy dataset [1,2], we mapped 4968 synapses onto reconstructed apical and basal arbors across layers 1-6 of mouse visual cortex. Contrary to a simple gradient model, synaptic targeting is overwhelmingly biased toward basal dendrites in layers 2/3 to 6, even where apical shafts are abundant. Layer 1 is the sole exception, exhibiting the expected apical bias. Basal predominance scales with local soma density and the relative arbor length available for contact, such that 66% (61101/92445) of all synapses land within 130 microns of the soma, placing most excitatory drive near the cell body. Axonal analysis revealed specificity beyond mere geometric opportunity: individual axon segments preferentially innervated either basal or apical compartments far more often than predicted by chance, indicating compartment-selective wiring rules. Together, our results show that cortical connectivity is shaped by both neuronal geometry and axon-level targeting preferences, redefining how pyramidal cells integrate information across layers and apical and basal dendrites.

">A Canonical Microcircuit for Estimating Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) Balance</a></h4>

              
                Excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance is crucial for maintaining healthy brain function and can be disrupted in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite its importance, there are few tools to study E/I balance non-invasively in humans. Here, we propose a canonical microcircuit model to estimate E/I balance from non-invasive magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) recordings by parameterising global pyramidal and inhibitory cell excitability. We first establish that E/I parameters are identifiable and recoverable. We then explore the effects of these new parameters and their interaction with other parameters in a series of simulations. To highlight the clinical relevance of this new model, we simulate changes in E/I balance and their impact on event-related potentials (ERPs) derived from paired-click, passive and active oddball paradigms, which are among the most robust clinical biomarkers of schizophrenia. Our simulations show that a loss of pyramidal cell excitability can explain reduced ERP amplitudes across all three paradigms, mirroring empirical findings in schizophrenia. This method may serve as a computational assay for estimating synaptopathy and E/I balance from non-invasive M/EEG recordings across various clinical conditions thereby advancing efforts to develop personalised interventions to restore E/I balance.

">Optogenetic stimulation of nigral astrocytes is neuroprotective in a 6-OHDA model of neurodegeneration.</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Glial-glial crosstalk is essential for maintaining the regional milieu and appears to be particularly important in modulating neuroinflammation and many aspects of neurodegeneration. In particular, astrocytes are critical for maintaining dopamine neuronal integrity and survival, and astroglial dysfunction is prominent in Parkinson disease. As such, astrocytes represent a potentially critical therapeutic target in neurodegeneration. In this study, in vivo optogenetics were used to selectively stimulate astrocytes in the substantia nigra following a striatal 6-OHDA lesion. Remarkably, a single bout of optogenetic stimulation was sufficient to attenuate motor deficits and dopamine neuron loss induced by the neurotoxin. Furthermore, bulk RNAseq and snRNAseq analysis of the substantia nigra revealed extensive changes in both microglia and oligodendrocytes, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of stimulating astrocytes may be mediated through alterations in glia-glia crosstalk. Altogether, this work demonstrates the importance of understanding glia-glia interactions in neurodegeneration.

">A 3D iPSC retina model reveals non-cell-autonomous and non-neuronal mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration in a lysosomal storage disorder.</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) interface with loss of photoreceptor outer segments (POSs) in the retina is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative and retinal diseases including lysosomal storage disorders like CLN3 disease. However, the retina is a functional composite in vivo; and in vitro stem cell models of retina that enable investigation of the photoreceptor-RPE interface in healthy and diseased retina are lacking. Here, we developed a 3D human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived retina model to investigate the photoreceptor-RPE interface in healthy and disease tissue. Using this 3D hPSC retina model, we demonstrated that the most common disease causing CLN3 mutation (CLN3{Delta}ex7-8) leads to reduced levels of acid ceramidase (AC) and consequently altered sphingolipid metabolism and signaling and POS loss in CLN3 disease. Consistent with the 3D hPSC retina model, altered sphingolipid metabolism and signaling coincided with POS loss in a large animal model of CLN3 disease, CLN3 miniswine. Therapeutically, recombinant human acid ceramidase (rhAC) targeted both altered sphingolipid metabolism and retina degeneration in the CLN3 hPSC retina model and the CLN3 miniswine eye. These findings demonstrate a proof-of-concept that rhAC can rescue disease phenotype in a large animal model of CLN3 disease and suggest that rhAC could be a therapeutic approach for CLN3 disease.

">Inactivation of NMDAR and CaMKII signaling within the prelimbic cortex blocks incubated cocaine- and sucrose-craving</a></h4>

              
                The incubation of craving is a term coined to characterize the behavioral phenomenon wherein cue-elicited craving strengthens over a period of abstinence. Incubated cocaine-craving is mediated, at least in part, by increased glutamate release within the prelimbic cortex (PL) . We hypothesized that this glutamate release stimulates NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) leading to calcium-dependent activation of CaMKII signaling that drives incubated craving. To test this hypothesis, adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer either IV cocaine or sucrose pellets (6h/day x10 days) and tested for cue-elicited cocaine- or sucrose-craving in early versus later (i.e. after incubation) withdrawal. Incubated cocaine-seeking was associated with increased CaMKII activity in the PL, but no change in NMDAR subunits. In contrast, incubated sucrose-craving was associated with many sex-dependent changes in both NMDAR subunit expression and CaMKII activation that were subregion-selective. An intra-PL infusion of the NMDA antagonist D-AP5 (2.5 or 7.5 {micro}/side) or the CaMKII inhibitor myr-AIP (10 pg/side) blocked both incubated cocaine- and sucrose-craving, with no effects detected in early withdrawal. Co-infusion of both D-AP5 and myr-AIP exerted an additive effect on incubated cocaine-craving that was larger than either antagonist alone. These data corroborate earlier evidence for distinct biochemical correlates within mPFC between incubated cocaine- and sucrose-craving and, for the first time, demonstrate that NMDARs and CaMKII activation within the PL are common drivers of incubated craving that operate via independent signaling pathways suggesting combined pharmacological treatments may have greater efficacy in managing addiction.

">Using EEG to Detect Lapses in Sustained Attention to Moving Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Sustaining attention is effortful but crucial for daily life. Despite this, attentional lapses are common and can have fatal consequences (e.g., when driving). The spontaneous nature of these lapses make studying their underlying phenomena elusive. As such, methods capable of determining when lapses have occurred may be fruitful research tools, with the potential to save lives if implemented within real world settings. Here, we capitalised on a recent hierarchical classification method, which uses multivariate decoding to index how well human observers sustain their attention within a dynamic visual environment. We asked whether this method could be used to anticipate behavioural errors based on neural activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG). We first decoded patterns of EEG activity that systematically correlated with critical aspects of a Multiple Object Monitoring (MOM) task. The extent to which we could decode this information depended on whether a stimulus was relevant for behaviour, which was lower before participants failed to detect (or "missed") target stimuli, presumably due to attentional lapses. Here, we exploited this drop in neural decodability to predict whether errors were about to occur on each trial. The results form a foundation for sensitive and specific methods to objectively detect lapses in sustained attention based on patterns of brain activity.

">The role of attention in the generation of anticipatory potentials to affective stimuli: an ERP and source analysis study</a></h4>

              
                Anticipatory EEG signals are characterised by the occurrence of negative slow cortical potentials. This negativity is posed to be enhanced when expecting highly emotional stimuli; however, the specific role attention plays in its generation is unclear, as emotional content is more salient and arousing, and thus recruits higher attentional resources. Here, affective anticipation signals were recorded in 35 participants with EEG, and their brain sources elucidated using multiple sparse priors algorithm. Using a cued-paradigm, the category of a sound being negatively valenced or neutral could be predicted with a 68% accuracy. To shift attentional resources away from the emotional content, participants were instructed to listen and respond to a burst of white noise that occurred on 9% of trials. Results showed slower reaction times following the aversive cue, yet no difference in EEG amplitude between aversive and neutral anticipation. Response times positively correlated with EEG amplitude - participants with stronger negativity were faster to respond. EEG source reconstruction demonstrated no differences between conditions, and showed activation of areas within the salience network including insula, somatosensory cortex, and thalamus. The current results suggest that anticipatory EEG negativity is an index of attentional resource-allocation during the anticipation period and does not reflect the emotional content of upcoming stimuli.

">Novel reactivity phenotype mediates long-term consequences of cocaine exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in novelty seeking behavior often predict locomotor responses to psychomotor stimulants, an effect that may have a lasting impact throughout adolescence. The present study examined the role of novel reactivity phenotype on locomotor responses to repeated cocaine exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male rats. Prior to drug exposure, reactivity to a novel object was measured and animals were separated into low responders (LR) and high responders (HR). Cocaine was administered daily (0 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) for 12 consecutive days, and behavior recorded on days 1, 6, and 12. After 28 days without drug, rats were challenged with cocaine (20 mg/kg) and behavior was assessed. Novel reactivity phenotype had a dramatic role in adolescents acute responsiveness to cocaine. HR adolescents exhibited a robust increase in sensitivity to acute administration of 20 mg/kg cocaine. However, following repeated cocaine exposure, both LR and HR adults displayed a marked increase in cocaine-induced locomotor activity, whereas the change in behavioral responsiveness in LR and HR adolescents was not as dramatic. During the cocaine challenge trial, LR that were exposed to 20 mg/kg cocaine during adolescence showed the highest cocaine-induced responsiveness compared to their saline-exposed and adult-exposed counterparts. Overall, these data indicate that novel reactivity phenotype and age of initial cocaine exposure are intricately involved in the long-term behavioral effects of cocaine. Thus, novel reactivity phenotype may predispose cocaine-using adolescents to continue drug-seeking behavior and potential abuse.

">MrgD Receptor Modulates Neurotransmission in the Nigrostriatal Pathway</a></h4>

              
                The Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D (MrgD) is primarily known for its role in peripheral nociception and, more recently, as a receptor for alamandine, influencing cardiovascular function and exhibiting antidepressant-like effects. However, its function within the central nervous system, particularly in motor and reward-related circuits, remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the role of MrgD in the nigrostriatal pathway using proteomic approaches focused on post-translational modifications in MrgD-knockout (KO) mice. Integrated proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and N-glycoproteomic analyses revealed significant alterations in synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, pointing to impaired neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal system of KO mice. These molecular findings were supported by neurotransmitter quantification and functional assays demonstrating impaired synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Pharmacodynamic analyses showed that MrgD modulates synaptic exocytosis in an agonist-selective manner, being responsive to alamandine but not {beta}-alanine. Furthermore, behavioral analyses revealed increased locomotor activity and compulsive-like behavior in MrgD-deficient mice, without impairments in short- or long-term memory. Together, these findings uncover a new role for MrgD beyond its involvement in nociception in central nervous system, highlighting this receptor as a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders involving motor hyperactivity and compulsivity.

">GABA neurons in the sublaterodorsal tegmental (SLD) nucleus suppress wakefulness in wild-type and narcoleptic mice</a></h4>

              
                The sleep-wake cycle is generated by competing neural circuits that control the oscillation between wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep. While the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD) is recognized for its role in REM sleep generation, the functional contribution of its GABAergic neurons (SLDGABA) to sleep-wake regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we found that SLDGABA neurons function as a suppressor of wakefulness in both wild-type and narcoleptic mice. Optogenetic silencing of SLDGABA neurons rapidly induced robust wakefulness, while enhancing cortical and motor activity. Conversely, optogenetic activation of these neurons suppressed wakefulness and promoted NREM sleep. We found that SLDGABA neurons project extensively to wake-promoting brain regions, providing an anatomical basis for their wake-suppressing effects. Importantly, we discovered that SLDGABA neurons play a pathological role in narcolepsy: their activation in orexin-deficient mice triggered characteristic sleep attacks--rapid intrusions of NREM sleep during active wakefulness--while silencing these neurons rescued animals from both sleep attacks and cataplexy. Collectively, these findings establish SLDGABA neurons as a key regulator of arousal state transitions and identify them as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of narcolepsy.

">Dynamic competition between selective attention and spatial prediction during visual search</a></h4>

              
                During visual search, we rely on both selective attention and spatial predictions to guide our behavior. However, whether and how these mechanisms interact is largely unclear. Using a contextual cueing paradigm, we investigated whether learning and exploitation of spatial predictive context can occur outside attentional focus. Repeating search scenes enabled distractor context to serve as a contextual cue predicting target location. Participants searched for a target among distractors in two colors: the same as the target-to-be-searched (attended context) or a different color (ignored context). Halfway through the experiments, we changed the target color, thereby altering the attentional status of distractor contexts while maintaining their spatial predictiveness. In Experiment 1, where participants regularly switched between target colors, we found exploitation of spatial predictive context both within and outside attentional focus. However, in Experiment 2, where attention was more stably focused on one target color, only the attended predictive context was exploited before transfer. Intriguingly, after transfer, previously ignored predictive context showed immediate benefits, revealing latent learning. These findings demonstrate a dynamic competition between selective attention and spatial predictions: while learning occurs independently of attention, exploitation may require attentional selection. Our results suggest that selective attention gates the influence of spatial predictions on behavior, with gating strength determined by the stability of attentional control.

">Distinct resting-state connectomes for face and scene perception predict individual task performance</a></h4>

              
                Face and scene perception rely on distinct neural networks centered on the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA). However, how these regions interact with broader brain networks remains unclear. Using resting-state fMRI and MEG data, we mapped the spatial and frequency-specific functional connectivity of the FFA and PPA. We found that the FFA showed predominant fMRI connectivity with lateral occipitotemporal, inferior temporal, and temporoparietal regions, while the PPA connected more strongly with ventral medial visual, posterior cingulate, and entorhinal-perirhinal areas. MEG analyses further revealed this network segregation was reflected in beta and gamma bands. Importantly, connectome-based predictive modeling showed that the strength of these intrinsic fMRI connectivity patterns predicted individual reaction times on corresponding face and scene perception tasks. Our findings demonstrate that the FFA and PPA anchor distinct intrinsic networks with unique spatio-temporal profiles that provide a functional architecture supporting their specialized roles in face and scene perception.

">Auditory-cognitive determinants of speech-in-noise perception: structural equation modelling of a large sample</a></h4>

              
                Problems understanding speech-in-noise (SIN) are commonly associated with peripheral hearing loss. But pure tone audiometry (PTA) alone fails to fully explain SIN ability. This is because SIN perception is based on complex interactions between peripheral hearing, central auditory processing (CAP) and other cognitive abilities. We assessed interaction between these factors and age using a multivariate approach that allows the modelling of directional effects on theoretical constructs: structural equation modelling. We created a model to explain SIN using latent constructs for sound segregation, auditory (working) memory, and SIN perception, as well as PTA, age and measures of non-verbal reasoning. In a sample of 207 participants aged 18-81 years old, age was the biggest determinant of SIN ability, followed by auditory memory. PTA did not contribute to SIN directly, although it modified sound segregation ability, which covaried with auditory memory. A second model, using a CAP latent structure formed by measures of sound segregation, auditory memory, and temporal processing, revealed CAP to be the largest determinant of SIN ahead of age. Furthermore, we demonstrated the impact of PTA and non-verbal reasoning on SIN are mediated by their influence on CAP. Our results highlight the importance of central auditory processing in speech-in-noise perception.

">Biological profits of irrational computations in the orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Making good decisions is essential for survival and success, yet humans and animals often exhibit perplexing irrational decision-making whose biological origin remains poorly understood. Recent theoretical work suggests that some forms of irrational decisions may arise from limited coding precision or metabolic budget in individual orbitofrontal neurons. Here, we consider the alternative possibility that systematic errors in decision-relevant computations are the inevitable consequence of the internal connectivity structure within orbitofrontal networks, which was molded under more distal biological constraints. We first trained cohorts of artificial neural networks to perform rational decision-relevant computations. Remarkably, they exhibited most electrophysiological coding properties of orbitofrontal neurons recorded in monkeys engaged in a preference-based decision task. We then distorted their internal connectivity to reproduce monkeys' irrational choices. This induced systematic interferences in decision-relevant computations that generalize across individuals, at both the behavioral and neural level. Importantly, irrational networks also display enhanced behavioral resilience to neural loss when compared to their rational counterparts. This suggests that irrational behavior may be the incidental outcome of distal evolutionary pressure on the tolerance to orbitofrontal circuit's damage.

">Deep neural networks trained for estimating albedo and illumination achieve lightness constancy differently than human observers.</a></h4>

              
                Lightness constancy, the ability to create perceptual representations that are strongly correlated with surface albedo despite variations in lighting and context, is a challenging computational problem. Indeed, it has proven difficult to develop image-computable models of how human vision achieves a substantial degree of lightness constancy in complex scenes. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed that are proficient at estimating albedo, but little is known about how they achieve this, or whether they are good models of human vision. We examined this question by training a CNN to estimate albedo and illumination in a computer-rendered virtual world, and evaluating both the CNN and human observers in a lightness matching task. In several conditions, we eliminated cues potentially supporting lightness constancy: local contrast, shading, shadows, and all contextual cues. We found that the network achieved a high degree of lightness constancy, outperforming three classic models, and substantially outperforming human observers as well. However, we also found that eliminating cues affected the CNN and humans very differently. Humans had much worse constancy when local contrast cues were made uninformative, but were minimally affected by elimination of shading or shadows. The CNN was unaffected by local contrast, but relied on shading and shadows. These results suggest that the CNN followed an effective strategy of integrating global image cues, whereas humans used a more local strategy. In a follow-up experiment, we found that the CNN could learn to exploit noise artifacts that were correlated with illuminance in ray-traced scenes, whereas humans did not. We conclude that CNNs can learn an effective, global strategy of estimating lightness, which is closer to an optimal strategy for the ensemble of scenes we studied than the computation used by human vision.

">Mapping Dendritic Spines Using 2D Two-Photon Laser Scanning</a></h4>

              
                Neurons transform complex spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic input into structured sequences of action potentials that relay meaningful information. Excitatory inputs converging onto dendrites engage or interact with local non-linear regenerative events, adding a computational layer that expands the variety and complexity of input-output transformations. In conjunction with non-linear conductance-mediated mechanisms, the spatial arrangement of active synapses along dendrites strategically shapes this local computation. Mapping synaptic input organization is thus critical to fully uncover neuronal input-output function. Spine calcium imaging offers a direct functional readout of the location of active contacts, but such mapping requires access to spines distributed on intricate three-dimensional dendritic trees. We present a modular software pipeline for targeted imaging and analysis of dendrites using sequential two-dimensional scanning on standard two-photon microscopes. Designed to work with conventional two-photon microscopy setups, the method is fully compatible with ScanImage. It includes a pre-acquisition tool (ROIpy) and a post-acquisition analysis suite (Spyne). ROIpy generates dendrite-aligned region-of-interests for scattered depth-specific acquisition of neuronal arborizations. Spyne includes deep-learning modules for spine identification (using DeepD3) and within-spine calcium events detection (via a custom- classifier). This method is compatible with a range of experimental designs, including simultaneous two-photon imaging and patch-clamp recordings, as well as fully optical setups. The acquisition pipeline supports plane-by-plane imaging of the whole-arbor, targeted to specific compartments or to user-defined branches of interest. Our work provides a versatile strategy for targeted dendritic imaging using two-dimensional scanning multiphoton microscopy. While ROIpy allows adaptation to diverse experimental goals beyond synaptic mapping, Spyne provides an analysis strategy for functional mapping of active synapses at single-cell resolution, offering a basis for modeling how the spatial organization of synaptic inputs shapes dendritic integration.

">Role of chrna5 in multi-substance preference and phenotypes comorbid with the development of substance dependence</a></h4>

              
                Addiction to nicotine and alcohol continues to be a leading cause of death and loss of productivity as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Polymorphisms in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit 5 (CHRNA5) have been identified as risk factors associated with nicotine dependence in human genetic studies and rodent models. Whether the chrna5 function is also important for phenotypes associated with comorbid disorders independently is a question of interest. We generated a stable mutant line in zebrafish using the CRISPR/Cas-9 technique. We found that the chrna5 mutant fish exhibit an increased acute preference to both nicotine and alcohol in the Self-Administration Zebrafish Assay (SAZA). When subjected to multi-day exposures to either, chrna5 mutants exhibited greater behavioural change, but reduced transcriptomic changes compared to wild type siblings, suggesting an impaired homeostatic regulation following drug exposure. Further, chrna5 mutants exhibited drug-independent changes in appetite and circadian rhythms, suggesting a genetic predisposition to disorders often comorbid with substance dependence. We expect these results to give new insights into the operation of genes whose normal function modulates vulnerability to multi-substance use and comorbid disorders.

">Beta burst waveform extraction using novel 4He-OPMs</a></h4>

              
                Studying the electrophysiology of motor preparation and execution is challenging due to the restrictions often placed on the experimental paradigm by the imaging modality. MEG is well suited to track temporal brain dynamics while offering good spatial resolution, but requires an absence of head motion due to the fixed helmet and associated cryogenic cooling system. Here we used novel, room temperature, wearable optically pumped magnetometers using Helium to measure the MEG in a motor preparation and execution task and compare this with 'classic' SQUID-MEG. Beta band activity (13-30Hz) is widely associated with motor activity, and it has become widely accepted that beta activity occurs in bursts rather than sustained activity. Here we used a novel beta burst extraction pipeline to look at not only the occurrence of the beta bursts across the timecourse of motor preparation and execution, but at the specific waveforms of the beta burst that evolve over time. Results show that specific beta burst waveforms show strong task relevant modulations of burst rate. Beta burst waveforms extracted using Helium-OPMs were very similar to those extracted using SQUID-MEG, with comparable modulations of burst rate over time for specific waveforms. This shows a promising step to obtaining high quality electrophysiological data in less restricted paradigms.

">Fishexplorer: A multimodal cellular atlas platform for neuronal circuit dissection in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural circuits give rise to behavior requires comprehensive knowledge of neuronal morphology, connectivity, and function. Atlas platforms play a critical role in enabling the visualization, exploration, and dissemination of such information. Here, we present FishExplorer, an interactive and expandable community platform designed to integrate and analyze multimodal brain data from larval zebrafish. FishExplorer supports datasets acquired through light microscopy (LM), electron microscopy (EM), and X-ray imaging, all co-registered within a unified spatial coordinate system which enables seamless comparison of neuronal morphologies and synaptic connections. To further assist circuit analysis, FishExplorer includes a suite of tools for querying and visualizing connectivity at the whole-brain scale. By integrating data from recent large-scale EM reconstructions (presented in companion studies), FishExplorer enables researchers to validate circuit models, explore wiring principles, and generate new hypotheses. As a continuously evolving resource, FishExplorer is designed to facilitate collaborative discovery and serve the growing needs of the teleost neuroscience community.

">Fever induces long-term synaptic enhancement and protects learning in an accelerated aging model</a></h4>

              
                Physiological impact of fever in the brain remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that induction of fever by yeast injection in rats (N=9) and by whole-body hyperthermia in mice (N=7) triggers structural synaptic enhancement in the prefrontal cortex involving AMPA-type glutamate receptor signalling and protein translation (N=6). Repeated fever induction in juvenile rats (N=9) results in synaptic strengthening that persists into adulthood, mitigating learning deficits and synaptic loss in a D-galactose model of accelerated aging (N=11). Our results show how common environmental conditions may shape brain function in the long-term via synaptic plasticity, warranting further exploration of thermal treatment for cognitive protection in aging.

">Role of the 5HT2C receptor in anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio)</a></h4>

              
                The present study aims to describe the acute effects of 5-HT2C receptor agonists and antagonists in behavioral tests related to anxiety in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, three groups of fish (n = 12/group) were used: a group treated with the drug MK-212 (2 mg/kg), a 5- HT2C receptor agonist; another group treated with the drug RS-102221 (2 mg/kg), a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist; and a third group, the control group, using a vehicle solution. The three groups were exposed to two behavioral tests: novel tank test (NTT) and light-dark preference (LDT). MK-212 produced no effects on the NTT, while RS-102221 decreased geotaxis (d = 0.99, 95%CI[0.3, 1.7]) and erratic swimming (d = 0.87, 95%CI[0.18, 1.56]) in this test; these effects are consistent with a tonic facilitation of defensive behavior in the NTT. Conversely, in the LDT, MK-212 increased scototaxis (d = 0.96, 95%CI[0.25, 1.65]), risk assessment (d = -1.31, 95%CI[-2.02, -0.59]), and thigmotaxis (d = -1.48, 95%CI[-2.21, -0.75]), consistent with an anxiogenic-like effect of this drug. Thus, tonic and phasic effects of the activation of this receptor are observed depending on the type of behavioral test used.

">Emotion Regulation in the Gradient Framework: Large-Scale Brain Organization Shapes Individual Differences in Reappraisal Success</a></h4>

              
                Emotion regulation is essential for well-being and mental health, yet individuals vary widely in their emotion regulation success. Why? Traditional neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation often focus on localized neural activity or isolated networks, overlooking how large-scale brain organization may shape the integration of distributed systems and sub-processes supporting regulatory success. Here, we applied a novel system-level framework based on spatial gradients of macroscale brain organization to study variance in emotion regulation success. Using two large fMRI datasets (n=358, n=263), we projected global activation patterns from a laboratory emotion regulation task onto principal gradients derived from independent resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. These gradients capture low-dimensional patterns of neural variation, providing a topographical framework within which complex mental phenomena, such as emotion regulation, emerge. In both datasets, individual differences in regulation success were predicted by systematic reconfiguration along Gradient 1, a principal axis differentiating unimodal and heteromodal brain areas. This gradient-based neural reconfiguration also predicted lower negative affect in daily life, as measured via smartphone-based experience sampling in a subset of participants (n=55). Meta-analytic decoding via Neurosynth revealed that Gradient 1 and regulation success align with multiple psychological processes, including social cognition, memory, attention, and negative emotion, suggesting this gradient reflects diverse, integrative demands during effective emotion regulation. These findings advance a network-level account of regulatory success, offering a biologically grounded, ecologically valid framework for understanding adaptive emotional functioning. Such gradient-based dynamics may serve as predictive biomarkers of regulatory success and inform targeted interventions in clinical populations.

">Frequency-dependent communication of information innetworks of non-oscillatory neurons in response to oscillatory inputs</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neuronal networks process oscillatory inputs is key for deciphering the brain's information processing dynamics. Neuronal filters describe the frequency-dependent relationship of neuronal outputs (e.g., membrane potential amplitude, firing rate) and their inputs for the level of neuronal organization (e.g., cellular, network) considered. Band-pass filters are associated to the notion of resonance and reflect the system's ability to respond maximally to inputs at a nonzero (resonant) frequency or a limited (resonant) frequency band. The complementary notion of phasonance refers to the ability of a system to exhibit a zero-phase response for a nonzero (phasonant) input frequency. The biophysical and dynamic mechanisms that shape neuronal filters and give raise to preferred frequency responses to oscillatory inputs are poorly understood beyond single cells. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the frequency-dependent communication of information across cells in a network remain unclear. Here, we use mathematical modeling, analytical calculations, computational simulations and dynamical systems tools to investigate how the complex and nonlinear interaction of the systems's biophysical properties and interacting time scales shape neuronal filters in minimal network models receiving oscillatory inputs with frequencies () within some range. The minimal networks consist of one directly stimulated cell (cell 1) connected to another (not directly stimulated) cell (cell 2) via graded chemical synapses. Individual cells are either passive or resonators and chemical synapses are either excitatory or inhibitory. The network outputs consist of the voltage peak envelopes and the impedance amplitude and phase profiles (as a function of ) for the two cells. We introduce the frequency-dependent amplitude () and phase {Delta}{Phi}() communication coefficients, defined as the ratio of the amplitude responses of the indirectly and directly stimulated cells and the phase difference between these two cells, respectively. Extending previous work, we also introduce the -curve, parametrized by , in the phase-space diagram for the voltage variables of the two participating cells. This curve joins the peak voltage values of the two cells in response to the oscillatory inputs and is a geometric representation of the communication coefficient. It allows to interpret the results and explain the dependence of the properties of the communication coefficient in terms of the biophysical and dynamic properties of the participating cells and synaptic connectivity when analytical calculations are not possible. We describe the conditions under which one or the two cells in the network exhibit resonance and phasonance and the conditions under which the network exhibits -resonance and {Delta}{Phi}-phasonance and more complex network responses depending as the complexity of the participating cells increases. For linear networks (linear nodes and linear connectivity),  is proportional to the impedance of the indirectly activated cell 2 and {Delta}{Phi} is equal to the phase of the indirectly stimulated cell 2, independent of the directly stimulated cell 1 in both cases. We show that the presence of nonlinear connectivity in the network creates (nonlinear) interactions between the two cells that give rise to -resonance, {Delta}{Phi}-phasonance and more complex responses that are absent in the corresponding linear networks. The results and methods developed in this paper have implications for the processing of information in more complex networks.

">Statistically valid explainable black-box machine learning: applications in sex classification across species using brain imaging</a></h4>

              
                Sex classification using neuroimaging data has the potential to revolutionize personalized diagnostics by revealing subtle structural brain differences that underlie sex-specific disease risks. Despite the promise of machine learning, traditional methods often fall short in providing both high classification accuracy and interpretable, statistically validated feature importance scores for high-dimensional imaging data. This gap is particularly evident when conventional techniques such as random forests, LIME, and SHAP are applied, as they struggle with complex feature interactions and managing noise in large datasets. We address this challenge by developing an integrated framework that combines Oblique Random Forests (ORFs) with a novel, permutation-based feature importance testing algorithm. ORFs extend traditional random forests by employing oblique decision boundaries through linear combinations of features, thereby capturing intricate interactions inherent in neuroimaging data. Our feature importance testing method, NEOFIT, rigorously quantifies the significance of each feature by generating null distributions and corrected p-values. We first validate our approach using simulated datasets, establishing its robustness and scalability under controlled conditions. We then apply our method to classify sex from both voxel-wise structural MRI and cortical thickness data in humans and macaques, facilitating direct cross-species comparisons. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances classification performance but also provides clear, interpretable insights into the neuroanatomical features that distinguish sexes. These methodological advancements pave the way for improved diagnostic tools and contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary basis of sex differences in brain structure.

">Mechanistic Modeling of Sleep-Wake Transitions via Circadian-Modulated Threshold Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Human sleep-wake cycles emerge from complex interactions between homeostatic sleep pressure and circadian rhythms. In this study, we extend the Phillips-Robinson model by introducing circadian-dependent dynamic thresholds for sleep and wake transitions, yielding a more physiologically grounded framework for sleep regulation. Using bifurcation analysis, we show that the transition from sustained wakefulness to rhythmic sleep-wake cycles is governed by a saddle-node on invariant circle (SNIC) bifurcation, and that these oscillations become entrained to external 24 h light-dark cues. We analytically derive circadian-modulated sleep and wake thresholds, revealing how the interaction between circadian and homeostatic drives governs sleep-wake transitions. Our model captures key physiological phenomena, including: (1) the onset and entrainment of sleep-wake rhythms, (2) immediate sleep onset and partial rebound following sleep deprivation, and (3) sleep fragmentation under shift work-like conditions. These results offer new mechanistic insights into how circadian misalignment alters sleep timing and quality. Together, our findings establish an updated theoretical framework for modeling sleep-wake regulation in both natural and disrupted environments, with implications for shift work management, sleep disorder interventions, and personalized chronotherapy.

">Scalable human neuronal models of tauopathy producing endogenous seed-competent 4R tau</a></h4>

              
                Pathological accumulation of four-repeat (4R) tau is central to several frontotemporal dementia (FTD) subtypes but human neuronal models amenable to high-throughput screening of 4R tau-targeting therapies remain limited. To address this gap, we developed iPSC-derived i3Neuron (i3N) lines expressing >75% 4R tau, driven by FTD splice-shifting mutations (S305N or S305N/IVS10+3). These neurons develop hyperphosphorylated tau and demonstrate somatodendritic mis-localisation. Unlike any other stem cell model of 4R tauopathy, these i3N neurons develop endogenous seed-competent tau and present pFTAA-positive tau assemblies after 28 days in culture. For scalable screening, we CRISPR-engineered a HiBiT luminescence tag at the endogenous MAPT locus into the S305N/IVS10+3 iPSC line, enabling precise quantification of tau levels and pharmacological responses. The model responded predictably to compounds affecting tau clearance, demonstrating its suitability for drug discovery. Overall, this i3N platform recapitulates key features of 4R tauopathy and provides a robust system to identify therapeutic modulators of pathological tau.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Understanding the factors underlying brain activity fluctuation is important to understand the flexible nature of the brain and cognition. Growing evidence indicates that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity travels as waves around global signal peaks following a unimodal–transmodal gradient. This may explain the organization of brain activity into functional networks, but why the strength of integration between networks fluctuates is uncertain. Given that arousal-related neuromodulatory systems affect network integration and that traveling waves are modulated by arousal, we aimed to assess the hypothesis that an increase in neuromodulatory tone can affect network integration by modulating the speed of propagation of traveling waves. We tested this hypothesis using pharmacological fMRI/pupil measurements during rest and tasks. Atomoxetine, which increases extracellular catecholamine levels, was associated with faster traveling waves, and faster traveling waves correlated with more network integration. We also examined temporal variations in pupil size, a signature of transient changes in neuromodulatory activity, and found that the periods of traveling waves were characterized by larger pupil size. Our results suggest that neuromodulatory tone affects traveling wave propagation, and that this arousal-modulated propagation shapes integrated functional connectivity features, highlighting specific effects of prolonged and transient neuromodulatory influences on slow brain dynamics.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous brain research on phonetic learning of foreign speech sounds has focused on learning outcomes, mostly neglecting the dynamical neural changes during learning. In the present study, Finnish-speaking participants listened passively to a repeated presentation of vowel /a/ with infrequent changes in Mandarin tone for 2 h per day for 4 consecutive days while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography. While our previous study has reported the brain activity changes from test recordings conducted before and after the sound exposure, we here analyzed the data recorded during the exposure. We investigated learning dynamics across daily exposure sessions using event-related potentials and multivariate pattern analysis and within sessions using a sliding average across trials. Both mismatch negativity and P3a—markers of change detection and preattentive attention shifts—exhibited learning-related changes in both the event-related potential analysis and multivariate pattern analysis. Changes in multivariate pattern analysis were evident after the first 2-h training session, while event-related potential–based effects emerged later. During the daily exposure sessions, the mismatch negativity amplitude gradually decreased over the first 3 d, whereas the P3a amplitude exhibited an opposite trend, showing a significant increase, and only on day 1. These findings demonstrate dynamic neural changes driven by passive exposure and pave the way for investigating learning processes across multiple levels of analysis, including event-related potential, single-trial dynamics, and machine learning–based methods.</span>

Previous studies show that both fairness perception and generosity involve balancing behaviors and motivations in social interactions. However, their relationship remains underexplored, limiting our understanding of the complex psychological processes underlying social behavior. Using a social discounting task, we assessed individual generosity, while an Ultimatum Game task with concurrent electroencephalogram recording allowed us to quantify inequity aversion and fairness perception by manipulating social distance and inequity levels. We found that both generosity and fairness perception decrease with increasing social distance, whereas inequity aversion increases. Modeling the decay of generosity across social distances, we found that decayed generosity was positively associated with inequity aversion in the friend condition and negatively correlated with the attenuation of fairness perception. These results suggest that the decay of generosity with social distance is linked to reduced sensitivity to inequity toward friends and heightened neural differences in fairness perception across social relationships. Our study provides electrophysiological evidence of individual variability in generosity and inequity aversion influenced by social distance, expanding inequity aversion theory.</span>

                Shade selection is a crucial factor influencing patient satisfaction with dental prostheses and the overall success of treatment. Conventional visual methods of shade selection are inherently subjective, regardless of the availability of dental records or photographs. This study aims to assess the prevalence, satisfaction, and preference of tooth shades in a cross-section of the local Indian population and to evaluate their correlation with age, gender, and skin color in a diverse sample of 120 participants visiting the outpatient department of this Institution. Methods A total of 120 participants, comprising 60 males and 60 females across four age groups (20-30, 30-40, 40-50, and 50-60 years), were visually evaluated using the VITA 3D Master shade guide. Participants also indicated their satisfaction with their current tooth shade and their preferred shade. Results Value 2 was the most prevalent existing shade (52.5%) and the most preferred across all groups, especially among individuals aged 41-50 years (p < 0.001). Satisfaction was highest among males aged 41–50 years. No significant association was found between skin color and tooth shade preference or satisfaction. Conclusions The results suggest that shades in the Value 2 category are universally preferred, offering a useful reference for shade selection in clinical practice.

                Background This study examines the types of organizational structures in privately chartered universities in Western Uganda and how these structures impact academic staff performance. Grounded in Henri Fayol’s Administrative Management Theory and Vroom’s Expectancy Theory, this study integrates structural and motivational perspectives to explore the impact of institutional design on academic operations. Method A concurrent triangulation research design was employed to combine quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data were collected from 186 academic staff members using structured questionnaires and 10 academic deans through in-depth interviews. Results Quantitative findings revealed that functional and hierarchical structures were the most common, with 55.4% of respondents reporting highly centralized decision-making and 42.5% reporting poor communication flow. A significant positive correlation was observed between organizational structure and academic staff performance (r = 0.512, p < 0.01). Regression analysis showed that organizational structure explained 26.2% of the variance in academic staff performance (R2 = 0.262, F (1, 184) = 65.46, p < 0.001). Qualitative data supported these results, with participants highlighting that rigid and bureaucratic structures limit flexibility, innovation, and collaboration, whereas excessive centralization undermines academic autonomy (Yusoff & Isa, 2021). Conclusion The study concludes that, while traditional structures dominate private chartered universities, they often hinder academic performance. To enhance staff effectiveness, universities should adopt adaptive and participatory structures (Berkowitz, 2023). Aligning Fayol’s principles of work specialization, centralization, and communication flow with Vroom’s motivational framework offers a strategic path for organizational improvement.

                This correspondence discusses the BLING III study by Dulhunty and colleagues, which reported no difference in 90-day mortality between continuous and intermittent infusions of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis. Both this study and subsequent meta-analysis are in favor of continuous infusions for the potential benefits of secondary endpoints though the primary endpoints is not significant. We elaborate that continuous infusion of time-dependent antimicrobials might result in treatment failure as well as the emergence of antimicrobial resistance if the steady state concentration is below the desired target. That might be a potential explanation of the negative results observed in BLING III and other studies. In our opinion, extended or prolonged infusion of β-lactams (over 3 hours) might provide a better target attainment, even without therapeutic drug monitoring.

                Aims To study the association between AIM2 gene polymorphisms and the tendency for periodontal infection and coronary heart disease, and to determine whether males or females are more susceptible to these diseases. Additionally, we examined its association with the features of periodontal disease. Methods 140 patients were enrolled in this study, and those who took part were divided into four groups as follows: healthy (c), periodontal disease (P), coronary heart disease with intact periodontium (AS-C), and coronary heart disease with periodontal disease (AS-P). Information on entrants, including age ranging from 40 to 70 years old, sex of both males and females who fulfilled the study’s criteria, body mass index with ordinary rang less than 30 kg/m2, socioeconomic status, tooth brushing frequency at least two times per- day, and indicators of periodontal disease severity, was documented. Blood samples were collected, and AIM2 gene polymorphisms were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction test, gel phase, and sequences. Results Genetic analysis of AIM2 G/T (rs2793845) revealed a high frequency of the (T) allele and (GT and TT) genotypes that were detected in the periodontal disease and coronary heart disease groups in males. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of alleles and genotypes did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the study groups. Gene polymorphisms were also significantly (p ≤ 0.05) correlated with indicators of periodontal disease severity. Conclusion High frequenting of (T) alleles and (GT, TT) genotypes in AIM2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were associated with an increased tendency to develop periodontal disease and coronary heart disease. It can be supposed that it has a causative function in the pathophysiology of both disorders, and the validity of SNP as a potential genomic factor for the risk of both disorders in Iraqi males.

Computational multi-scale pandemic modelling remains a major and timely challenge. Here we identify specific requirements for a new class of models simulating pandemics across three scales: (1) pathogen evolution, often punctuated by the rapid emergence of new variants, (2) human interactions within a heterogeneous population, and (3) public health responses which constrain individual actions to control the disease transmission. We then present a pandemic modelling framework satisfying these requirements and capable of simulating feedback loops between dynamics unfolding at these different scales. The developed framework comprises a stochastic agent-based model of pandemic spread, coupled with a phylodynamic model that incorporates within-host pathogen evolution. It is validated with a case study, modelling the punctuated evolution of SARS-CoV-2, based on global and contemporary genomic surveillance data, which captures a large heterogeneous population. We demonstrate that the model replicates the essential features of the COVID-19 pandemic and virus evolution, while retaining computational tractability and scalability.

                <p>by Jinsu Kim, Christine Sütterlin, Ming Tan, German Enciso</p>

<i>Chlamydia</i> is an intracellular bacterium that reproduces via an unusual developmental cycle that only occurs within a eukaryotic host cell. A replicating form of the bacterium (RB) repeatedly divides to produce about a thousand progeny, which convert in a delayed and asynchronous manner into the infectious form (EB). The regulatory mechanisms that control this developmental switch are unknown, but they could potentially include extrinsic signals from the host cell or other chlamydiae, or an intrinsic signal such as chlamydial cell size. In this paper, we investigated the regulation of RB-to-EB conversion by developing and analyzing three mathematical models, each based on a different regulatory mechanism. To test these models, we derived statistical evidence from parameters, including number, size and location of RBs and EBs, obtained from experimental measurements and model fitting. All three models successfully reproduced the experimentally measured timing of RB-to-EB conversion and growth curves of the developmental forms in an infected cell. However, only the size control model, which postulates that RB size is an intrinsic signal that regulates the timing of RB-to-EB conversion, reproduced two additional statistical properties of the intracellular infection. These properties are a positive correlation between the number of RBs and EBs throughout the developmental cycle and the monotonic evolution of the coefficient of variation of EB number. This analysis thus provides support for the size control model.

                <p>by Tarun Mahajan, Sergei Maslov</p>

Many microbial communities in nature are complex, with hundreds of coexisting strains and the resources they consume. We currently lack the ability to assemble and manipulate such communities in a predictable manner in the lab. Here, we take a first step in this direction by introducing and studying a simplified consumer resource model of such complex communities in serial dilution experiments. The main assumption of our model is that during the growth phase of the cycle, strains share resources and produce metabolic byproducts in proportion to their average abundances and strain-specific consumption/production fluxes. We fit the model to describe serial dilution experiments in hCom2, a defined synthetic human gut microbiome with a steady-state diversity of 63 species growing on a rich media, using consumption and production fluxes inferred from metabolomics experiments. The model predicts serial dilution dynamics reasonably well, with a correlation coefficient between predicted and observed strain abundances as high as 0.8. We applied our model to: (i) calculate steady-state abundances of leave-one-out communities and use these results to infer the interaction network between strains; (ii) explore direct and indirect interactions between strains and resources by increasing concentrations of individual resources and monitoring changes in strain abundances; (iii) construct a resource supplementation protocol to maximally equalize steady-state strain abundances.

                <p>by Fengshuo Liu, Xiang H.-F. Zhang</p>

Metastasis is the predominant cause of cancer mortality, primarily driven by complex tumor–host interactions within specialized metastatic niches. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have provided unprecedented insights into metastatic niche formation, evolution and function, including how primary tumors precondition distant organs for metastases and how disseminated tumor cells dynamically interact with host cells to modulate their environments. Integrated single-cell studies across multiple cancer types have also revealed divergent and convergent metastatic adaptation strategies. These findings collectively highlight metastasis as a dynamic, cooperative process shaped by intricate tumor–host interactions, and provide a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies targeting components of the metastatic microenvironment.

                <p>by Yajing Qiu, Yihan Xu, Xinyuan Ding, Congcong Zhao, Hongcheng Cheng, Guideng Li</p>

Cancer cells and T cells engage in dynamic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME), shaping tumor progression and anti-tumor immunity. While cancer cells reprogram metabolism to support growth and immune evasion, T cells must adapt their metabolic states to maintain effector functions. Tumor-driven metabolic perturbations, such as nutrient depletion and accumulation of immunosuppressive metabolites, profoundly impair T cell function and fate. Conversely, metabolically reprogrammed T cells can modulate the TME and influence tumor growth. This reciprocal metabolic crosstalk represents both metabolic competition and intercellular communication, offering promising therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003282">Mutation bias alters the distribution of fitness effects of mutations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mrudula Sane, Shazia Parveen, Deepa Agashe</p>

Mutation bias is an important factor determining the diversity of genetic variants available for selection. As adaptation proceeds and some beneficial mutations are fixed, new beneficial mutations become rare, limiting further adaptation. The depletion of beneficial mutations is especially stark within the mutational class favored by the existing mutation bias. Recent theoretical work predicts that this problem may be alleviated by a change in the direction of mutation bias (i.e., a bias reversal). If populations sample previously underexplored types of mutations, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations should shift towards more beneficial mutations. Here, we test this prediction using <i>Escherichia coli</i>, which has a transition mutation bias, with ~54% single-nucleotide mutations being transitions compared to the unbiased expectation of ~33% transitions. We generated mutant strains with a wide range of mutation biases, from 97% transitions to 98% transversions, either reinforcing or reversing the wild-type transition bias. Quantifying DFEs of ~100 single mutations obtained from mutation accumulation experiments for each strain, we find strong support for the theoretical prediction. Strains that oppose the ancestral bias (i.e., with a strong transversion bias) have DFEs with the highest proportion of beneficial mutations, whereas strains that exacerbate the ancestral transition bias have up to 10-fold fewer beneficial mutations. Such dramatic differences in the DFE should drive large variation in the rate and outcome of adaptation, suggesting an important and generalized evolutionary role for mutation bias shifts.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003273">Sensory and motor contents are prioritized dynamically in working memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Irene Echeverria-Altuna, Sage E. P. Boettcher, Freek van Ede, Anna C. Nobre</p>

Internal selective attention prioritizes both sensory and motor contents in working memory to guide prospective behavior. Prior research has shown how attention modulation of sensory contents is flexible and temporally tuned depending on access requirements, but whether the prioritization of motor contents follows similar flexible dynamics remains elusive. Also uncharted is the degree of co-dependence of sensory and motor modulation, which gets at the nature of both working-memory representations and internal attention functions. To address these questions, we independently tracked the prioritization of sensory and motor working-memory contents as a function of dynamically evolving temporal expectations in human participants. The design orthogonally manipulated when an item location (left versus right side) and associated prospective action (left versus right hand) would be relevant. Contralateral-vs-ipsilateral modulation of posterior alpha (8–12 Hz) activity in electroencephalography (EEG) tracked prioritization of the item location, while contralateral-vs-ipsilateral modulation of central mu/beta (8–30 Hz) activity tracked response prioritization. Proactive and dynamic alpha and mu/beta modulation confirmed the flexible and temporally structured prioritization of sensory and motor contents alike. Intriguingly, the prioritization of sensory and motor contents was temporally uncoupled, showing dissociable patterns of modulation. The findings reveal multiple modulatory functions of internal attention operating in tandem to prepare relevant aspects of internal representations for adaptive behavior.

An essential function of memory is to guide behavior for better survival and adaptation. While memory formation has been extensively studied, far less is understood about how memory retrieval influences behaviors. In the auditory Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm using C57BL/6J mice, retrieving a conditioned threat memory is associated with spiking in two dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neurons with transient (T-neurons) and sustained (S-neurons) patterns. We show here that T-neurons and S-neurons are two distinct neuronal populations with different neuronal and synaptic properties and mRNA profiles. S-neuron spiking matches freezing behavior and is required for freezing. This sustained activity in S-neurons requires auditory inputs and the release of norepinephrine (NE) in the dmPFC. The activation of the locus coeruleus (LC) is initiated by dmPFC T-neuron inputs, sustained by auditory inputs, and is required for the transition to freezing by enhancing S-neuron activity. Interestingly, LC activation precipitates a brief period during which nonconditioned cues also induce freezing. Our findings highlight the critical contribution of the LC/NE system in the transition from memory to behavior, which coordinates the effective integration of memory, sensory inputs and emotional state for optimal adaptation.

When wild plants defend themselves from pathogens, this often comes with a trade-off: the same genes that protect a plant from disease can also reduce its growth and fecundity in the absence of pathogens. One protein implicated in a major growth-defense trade-off is ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6), an ion channel that modulates salicylic acid (SA) synthesis to potentiate a wide range of defenses. Wild <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> populations maintain significant functional variation at the <i>ACD6</i> locus, with some alleles making the protein hyperactive. In the greenhouse, plants with hyperactive <i>ACD6</i> alleles are resistant to diverse pathogens, yet they are of smaller stature, their leaves senesce earlier, and they set fewer seeds compared to plants with the standard allele. We hypothesized that <i>ACD6</i> hyperactivity would not only affect the growth of microbial pathogens but also more generally change leaf microbiome assembly. To test this in an ecologically meaningful context, we compared plants with hyperactive, standard, and defective <i>ACD6</i> alleles in the same field-collected soil, both outdoors and in naturally lit and climate-controlled indoor conditions, taking advantage of near-isogenic lines as well as a natural accession and a CRISPR-edited derivative. We surveyed visual phenotypes, gene expression, hormone levels, seed production, and the microbiome in each environment. The genetic precision of CRISPR-edited plants allowed us to conclude that <i>ACD6</i> genotype had no effect on mature field plants in our setting, despite reproducibly dramatic effects on greenhouse plants. We conclude that additional abiotic and/or microbial signals present outdoors—but not in the greenhouse—greatly modulate <i>ACD6</i> activity. This raises the possibility that the fitness costs of other commonly studied immune system genes may be grossly misjudged without field studies.

                Background Previous research has shown that popular names have become less popular over time. Simultaneously, accumulated evidence has indicated that names have become more diverse. However, the association between these two phenomena was unclear. This association should be revealed for a better understanding of names and naming practices. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the popularity and diversity of names. Methods I analyzed the data provided in a previous study in the U.K., which included complete records of all live births between 1996 and 2016 (N = 12,985,140). Results I found that the correlations between diversity and popularity indicators were highly negative, showing that they are conceptually strongly related. This means that when diversity is high, popularity is low. Conclusions Based on this study, we can predict one indicator from the other indicator. Because raw data on names are generally difficult to collect, this prediction is useful for understanding names and naming practices.

     alt="Connectivity of a Conspicuous Layered Structure in the Dorsal Telencephalon of the Peacock Gudgeon, Tateurndina ocellicauda"/>
<p>Tract tracing experiments of a layered structure in the dorsal telencephalon (Dx) in a gobiiform fish revealed intratelencephalic projections and projections from nuclei of the preglomerular complex. Injections into the dorsomedial (Dm) and dorsolateral (dDl) telencephalon showed that Dx and Dm are two distinct zones with their own connectivity profiles. Dx and dDl projections show some overlap and different areas of the preglomerular complex project to distinct dorsal telencephalic target zones.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Within the mammalian pallium, layered structures, such as the six-layered isocortex and the three-layered hippocampal formation, are crucial for integrating sensory cues from the environment and for forming and recalling memories. Similar layered pallial systems have also been shown in avian and non-avian reptiles. Despite sharing similar needs for processing external information and remembering important sites, teleosts have generally not evolved such defined layered organizations in their dorsal telencephalon. One exception is gobiiform fishes in which a subregion of the dorsal telencephalon is organized into several fiber-rich and soma-dense layered subregions. We investigated the connectivity of these layered subregions (referred to as the dorsal telencephalic area X, Dx), as well as the connectivity of the medial (Dm) and dorsolateral (dDl) parts of the dorsal telencephalon through tracer injections. We found that extratelencephalic projections reach Dm, Dx, and dDl from different regions within the preglomerular complex (PG): Dm receives input from different PG regions: PG region 1 (PG1), PG region 2 (PG2), and the commissural PG (PGc), but not from the nucleus prethalamicus (PTh). In contrast, both Dx and dDl receive projections from the lateral PTh (PTh-l) and the medial PTh (PTh-m). We find that projections to dDl come from more ventral regions of PTh-m than those that project to Dx. The majority of ascending connections could be found within the telencephalon itself, with each of the telencephalic zones receiving its own distinct pattern of intratelencephalic afferent connectivity. From our results, we conclude that Dm and Dx constitute two distinct zones of the dorsal telencephalon.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00729-6?rss=yes">Time is encoded by methylation changes at clustered CpG sites</a></h4>

              
                Ochana et al. profiled DNA methylation across clustered CpG sites in blood from over 300 healthy individuals. They identified two distinct modes of age-related change—stochastic and block-like—and developed a deep learning methylation clock that predicts chronological age from just two genomic loci with a median accuracy of 1.36 years.

                Aloisi et al. identified RCoR2 as an exclusively expressed marker of adrenergic neuroblastomas. While CoREST family members are traditionally repressors, RCoR2 uniquely facilitates enhancer-promoter interactions of genes controlled by the core regulatory transcription factors, sustaining oncogenic programs and tumor cell survival, establishing it as a pivotal neuroblastoma vulnerability.

                Transcriptional programs are strictly regulated during normal development, in a balance between activators and repressors. In this issue, Aloisi et al. demonstrate a non-canonical role of the corepressor RCoR2 that turned out to play an activating role in adrenergic neuroblastoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104076">PRDM16 functions as a co-repressor in the BMP pathway to suppress neural stem cell proliferation</a></h4>

              
                BMP signaling acts as an instructive cue in various developmental processes such as tissue patterning, stem cell proliferation, and differentiation. However, it is not fully understood how this signaling pathway generates different cell-specific outputs. Here, we have identified PRDM16 as a key co-factor for BMP signaling in the mouse brain. PRDM16 contributes to a repressive role of BMP signaling on neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation. We demonstrate that PRDM16 regulates the genomic distribution of BMP pathway transcription factors, the SMAD4/pSMAD complex, preventing the activation of cell proliferation genes. When <i>Prdm16</i> is lost, the SMAD complex relocates to nearby genomic regions, leading to abnormal upregulation of BMP target genes. This function of PRDM16 is also required for the specification of choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells. Through a single-cell resolution fluorescent in situ approach, we have observed that genes co-repressed by SMAD and PRDM16, such as <i>Wnt7b</i> and several cell cycle regulators, become overexpressed in <i>Prdm16</i> mutant ChP. Our findings elucidate a mechanism through which SMAD4 and pSMAD1/5/8 repress gene expression. Moreover, our study suggests a regulatory circuit composed of BMP and Wnt signaling, along with PRDM16, in controlling stem cell behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105461">Polyphosphate discriminates protein conformational ensembles more efficiently than DNA promoting diverse assembly and maturation behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Disordered proteins and domains often assemble into condensates with polyanionic nucleic acids, primarily via charge complementarity, regulating numerous cellular functions. However, the assembly mechanisms associated with the other abundant and ubiquitous, anionic, stress–response regulating polymer, polyphosphate (polyP), are less understood. Here, we employ the intrinsically disordered DNA-binding domain (DBD) of cytidine repressor (CytR) from <i>E. coli</i> to study the nature of assembly processes with polyP and DNA. CytR forms metastable liquid-like condensates with polyP and DNA, while undergoing liquid-to-solid transition in the former and dissolving in the latter. On mutationally engineering the ensemble to exhibit more or less structure and dimensions than the WT, the assembly process with polyP is directed to either condensates with partial time-dependent dissolution or spontaneous aggregation, respectively. On the other hand, the CytR variants form <i>only</i> liquid-like but metastable droplets with DNA which dissolve within a few hours. Polyphosphate induces large secondary-structure changes, with two of the mutants adopting polyproline II-like structures within droplets, while DNA has only minimal structural effects. Our findings reveal how polyphosphate can more efficiently discern conformational heterogeneity in the starting protein ensemble, its structure, and compactness, with broad implications in assembly mechanisms involving polyP and stress response in bacterial systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104008">Self-other generalisation shapes social interaction and is disrupted in borderline personality disorder</a></h4>

              
                Generalising information from ourselves to others, and others to ourselves allows for both a dependable source of navigation and adaptability in interpersonal exchange. Disturbances to social development in sensitive periods can cause enduring and distressing damage to lasting healthy relationships. However, identifying the mechanisms of healthy exchange has been difficult. We introduce a theory of self-other generalisation tested with data from a three-phase social value orientation task – the Intentions Game. We involved humans with (<i>n</i>=50) and without (<i>n</i>=53) a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and assessed whether infractions to self-other generalisation may explain prior findings of disrupted social learning and instability. Healthy controls initially used their preferences to predict others and were influenced by their partners, leading to self-other convergence. In contrast, individuals with borderline personality disorder maintained distinct self-other representations when learning about others. This allowed for equal predictive performance compared to controls despite reduced updating sensitivity. Furthermore, we explored theory-driven individual differences underpinning contagion. Overall, the findings provide a clear explanation of how self-other generalisation constrains and assists learning, and how childhood adversity is associated with separation of internalised beliefs. Our model makes clear predictions about the mechanisms of social information generalisation concerning both joint and individual reward.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101731">S100a4+ alveolar macrophages accelerate the progression of precancerous atypical adenomatous hyperplasia by promoting the angiogenic function regulated by fatty acid metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Lung cancer is preceded by premalignant lesions, and what factors drive this transformation and the potential regulatory mode in the context of tumor initiation remain to be elucidated. In the course of precancerous lesions in mice, we found a phasic shift in metabolic patterns. Macrophages are a heterogeneous cell population with high plasticity in the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell interaction and metabolic analyses highlighted a cellular state, <i>S100a4</i><sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages, which exhibited distinct fatty acid metabolic activity, such as palmitic acid metabolism, at the atypical adenomatous hyperplasia stage, accompanied by an angiogenic-promoting function in a pre-neoplastic setting of mice. These findings were reproducible in human single-cell transcriptomes and had been confirmed by histopathological staining and in vitro cell coculture assays. Taken together, the results from this study demonstrated that the <i>S100a4</i><sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophage subset contributes to tumorigenesis by altering its metabolic state, suggesting that metabolic interventions targeting this cell state in the early stage of disease may delay neoplastic transformation of the lung epithelium.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104901">Harnessing AlphaFold to reveal hERG channel conformational state secrets</a></h4>

              
                To design safe, selective, and effective new therapies, there must be a deep understanding of the structure and function of the drug target. One of the most difficult problems to solve has been the resolution of discrete conformational states of transmembrane ion channel proteins. An example is K<sub>V</sub>11.1 (hERG), comprising the primary cardiac repolarizing current, <i>I</i><sub>kr</sub>. hERG is a notorious drug anti-target against which all promising drugs are screened to determine potential for arrhythmia. Drug interactions with the hERG inactivated state are linked to elevated arrhythmia risk, and drugs may become trapped during channel closure. While prior studies have applied AlphaFold to predict alternative protein conformations, we show that the inclusion of carefully chosen structural templates can guide these predictions toward distinct functional states. This targeted modeling approach is validated through comparisons with experimental data, including proposed state-dependent structural features, drug interactions from molecular docking, and ion conduction properties from molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, AlphaFold not only predicts inactivation mechanisms of the hERG channel that prevent ion conduction but also uncovers novel molecular features explaining enhanced drug binding observed during inactivation, offering a deeper understanding of hERG channel function and pharmacology. Furthermore, leveraging AlphaFold-derived states enhances computational screening by significantly improving agreement with experimental drug affinities, an important advance for hERG as a key drug safety target where traditional single-state models miss critical state-dependent effects. By mapping protein residue interaction networks across closed, open, and inactivated states, we identified critical residues driving state transitions validated by prior mutagenesis studies. This innovative methodology sets a new benchmark for integrating deep learning-based protein structure prediction with experimental validation. It also offers a broadly applicable approach using AlphaFold to predict discrete protein conformations, reconcile disparate data, and uncover novel structure–function relationships, ultimately advancing drug safety screening and enabling the design of safer therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100258">Normative evidence weighing and accumulation in correlated environments</a></h4>

              
                The brain forms certain deliberative decisions following normative principles related to how sensory observations are weighed and accumulated over time. Previously we showed that these principles can account for how people adapt their decisions to the temporal dynamics of the observations (Glaze et al., 2015). Here, we show that this adaptability extends to accounting for correlations in the observations, which can have a dramatic impact on the weight of evidence provided by those observations. We tested online human participants on a novel visual-discrimination task with pairwise-correlated observations. With minimal training, the participants adapted to uncued, trial-by-trial changes in the correlations and produced decisions based on an approximately normative weighing and accumulation of evidence. The results highlight the robustness of our brain’s ability to process sensory observations with respect to not just their physical features but also the weight of evidence they provide for a given decision.

     alt="Piano Training Induces Dynamic Neuroplasticity of Bimanual Coordination but Not Auditory Processing in Young Adults"/>
<p>Twenty-six weeks of piano training result in adaptations in the activation of the motor but not the auditory networks. The changes in brain activation in the motor system are task-demand dependent, and cannot be fully explained by a single model of brain plasticity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Piano training enables the study of the interplay between the auditory and motor domains in the acquisition of complex skill. Here, we uniquely combine longitudinal and cross-sectional designs to show how the motor and auditory brain systems respond in novice pianists over a 6-month training period. In the auditory domain, we found no differences in brain activation between novice pianists and a passive control group. In a specially designed piano task on an MRI-compatible keyboard, we demonstrate that the time course of neuroplastic reorganization in the cortical and subcortical regions reflects the shift from spatial attention to automated movements, but depends on task demands related to bimanual coordination. Importantly, no single model of brain plasticity can fully explain the observed dynamic time courses of functional changes. Finally, we demonstrate that the increased activation in the dorsal premotor and parietal cortices in novice pianists compared to skilled musicians while performing the motor task vanishes within the first 6 months of training. These results present converging evidence that the dynamic musical-training-related plasticity is highly contextual, and underscore the importance of ecological designs in research on skill acquisition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27307?af=R">Mapping Postictal Aphasia through Signal Complexity: A Stereo‐Electroencephalography Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The postictal period provides an opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology underlying aphasia and recovery following epileptic seizures. This study examines postictal aphasia in stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)-explored patients to identify brain regions associated with task-specific language deficits using signal complexity analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated video-SEEG-recorded focal seizures with and without postictal aphasia in patients with SEEG-confirmed hemispheric language dominance. SEEG traces were analyzed using permutation entropy (PE), with the postictal period quantified by a PE-based metric, the Postictal Alteration Time (PAT). Brain region PAT was correlated with language function recovery (eg, repetition). Electro-clinical recuperation was also assessed within the dorsal-ventral language stream framework. Additionally, a bedside testing battery was developed to evaluate postictal aphasia severity and task-specific deficits.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 322 seizures from 98 patients were analyzed. Seizures with postictal aphasia had longer PAT than those without. Task-specific language recovery correlated with regional PAT (eg, naming – middle temporal gyrus). Moreover, the dorsal stream recovered faster than the ventral stream. Additionally, the Postictal Aphasia Scale (PAS) was developed, evaluating naming, reading, repetition, and comprehension (verbal and written) and automatic speech. Higher PAS scores (indicating milder deficits) correlated with faster regional complexity recovery. At 5 and 10 minutes postictally, PAS revealed a global aphasia pattern, with comprehension deficits gradually resolving. By 15 minutes, aphasia was primarily production-related, particularly affecting naming.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of postictal aphasia and introduces PAS as a tool for assessing postictal aphasia severity and domain-specific deficits, aiding surgical planning and rehabilitation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate how sex and age at menopause influence the interplay between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) neuropathologies, and their associations with cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from: (1) three Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (i.e., the Religious Orders Study, Rush Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study), and (2) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology Data Set. Neuropathological evaluation assessed LBD (neocortical/limbic-type vs none) and AD, including neuritic plaques (β-amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites) and neurofibrillary tangles. In each dataset, we tested interactive associations between LBD and sex on neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline. Additionally, in the Rush dataset, we tested whether age at spontaneous menopause modified the associations of LBD with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline in women.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the Rush dataset, we included 1,277 women and 579 men. In the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we included 3,283 women and 3,563 men. Across both datasets, men were more likely to have LBD, whereas women showed greater neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burdens. Sex modified the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangles (but not neuritic plaques), whereby LBD was more strongly associated with greater neurofibrillary tangle burden in women than men. Men showed faster LBD-related cognitive decline, whereas women showed faster neurofibrillary tangle-related decline, after adjusting for copathologies (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and LBD, as appropriate). In women, earlier age at menopause exacerbated the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangle burden and episodic memory decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex may influence AD and LBD neuropathologies, highlighting the need for precision approaches to dementia prevention and intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder with a high social burden. Identification of quantitative biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the diagnosis process. This study aims to explore a routine to gain such biomarkers using quantitative analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Previous studies suggest that EEG data can be used to differentiate schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects. Various EEG features were used for such diagnostics using machine learning (ML) algorithms, but selecting the optimal EEG features and the classifiers is still insufficient. We propose an automatic selection of ML parameters using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software. Using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis’s “Supervised Attribute Selection” tool, we identified attributes that allow the identification of schizophrenia patients with a high accuracy of 93%. The attributes identified were EEG signals enriched for alpha and gamma frequencies from specific brain areas (frontal right, central, parietal, and occipital). This proposed strategy can effectively identify schizophrenia patients with high accuracy. It could be used as an ML tool to support diagnosis and potentially provide insights into the underlying disease mechanism of schizophrenia.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite its efficacy, its neuro-mechanisms remain unclear. Brain entropy (BEN), a measure of the irregularity and complexity of brain activity, has been shown to reflect the effects of high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS). However, it remains unknown whether BEN is sensitive to low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS), as well as to target-specific effects.Eighteen healthy adult participants underwent continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC), and 23 healthy adult participants underwent LF-rTMS targeting the L-DLPFC, left temporoparietal junction (L-TPJ), and left occipital cortex (L-OCC). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed pre- and post-stimulation, and BEN maps were calculated from the preprocessed functional images.Results showed that cTBS over L-DLPFC increased BEN in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC), while L-DLPFC LF-rTMS increased BEN in the MOFC, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and putamen. LF-rTMS at the L-TPJ increased BEN in the right TPJ, while LF-rTMS at the L-OCC decreased BEN in the posterior cingulate cortex. These findings demonstrate BEN remains sensitive to LF-rTMS and exhibits target-specific effects. Furthermore, this work advances BEN as a promising biomarker for rTMS effects beyond motor cortex paradigms.</span>

                <p>by Nathanael Larigaldie, Tim Yates, Ulrik R. Beierholm</p>

Perception is dependent on the ability to separate stimuli from different objects and causes in order to perform inference and further processing. We have models of how the human brain can perform such causal inference for simple binary stimuli (e.g., auditory and visual), but the complexity of the models increases dramatically with more than two stimuli. To characterize human perception with more complex stimuli, we developed a Bayesian inference model that takes into account a potentially unlimited number of stimulus sources: it is general enough to factor in any discrete sequential cues from any modality. Because the model employs a non-parametric prior, increased signal complexity does not necessitate the addition of more parameters. The model not only predicts the number of possible sources, but also specifies the source with which each signal is associated. As a test case, we demonstrate that such a model can explain several phenomena in the auditory stream perception literature, that it provides an excellent fit to experimental data, and that it makes novel predictions that we experimentally confirm. These findings have implications not just for human auditory temporal perception, but for a wide range of perceptual phenomena across unisensory and multisensory stimuli.
