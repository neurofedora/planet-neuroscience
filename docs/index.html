	<p>The effectiveness of carmustine (BCNU) wafers on local recurrence of glioblastoma (GBM) remains contentious. We investigated the accumulating high-dose effects of BCNU released from the wafers on the survival of GBM patients by measuring BCNU concentration in the resection cavity of GBM over time. BCNU wafers (Gliadel&amp;amp;reg;) were implanted with an Ommaya device in 15 patients, including 12 patients with GBM. BCNU concentrations in the tumor resection cavity were measured for 30 days postoperatively. The area under the curve (AUC)all was calculated from BCNU concentration curves, and the relationships between AUCall and survival, tumor phenotypes on MRI, and recurrence patterns were analyzed. The BCNU concentration was maximal 1 h postoperatively, rapidly decreased within 24 h, and remained relatively high for 7 days. GBM patients were classified into two groups: early recurrence (ER) and late or no recurrence (LN), using median progression-free survival as the cut-off. AUCall tended to be lower in the ER group than in the LN group, but the difference was not significant. MRI revealed that all patients in the ER group had highly invasive GBMs, whereas all patients in the LN group had less-invasive GBMs. A total of 9 patients experienced recurrence, with 6 local, 2 diffuse, and 1 disseminated patterns. No differences in AUCall were seen between local and non-local recurrence groups. Total BCNU concentrations did not correlate with tumor progression or survival. However, a high concentration of BCNU may have potential to provide some survival benefit for less-invasive type GBM.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid and Gentle Immunopurification of Brain Synaptic Vesicles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current methods to isolate synaptic vesicles (SVs), the organellar quanta of synaptic transmission, require highly specialized materials and up to 24 h. These technical obstacles have thus far limited the study of SVs in models of synaptic function and pathophysiology. Here, we describe techniques for the rapid isolation of SVs by immunoprecipitation with widely available antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads. We report that the inexpensive rho1D4 monoclonal antibody binds SVs and show that elution with the 1D4 peptide yields native vesicles that are &ge; 10-fold purer than those obtained with classical techniques. These methods substantially widen the accessibility of SVs, enabling their purification in 60&ndash;90 min for downstream analyses including mass spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy. Immunopurified SV preparations from mouse brain contained apolipoprotein E, the LDL receptor Lrp1, and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting that SVs may play direct roles in lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein trafficking at the nerve terminal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> SVs are small organelles that form and recycle at nerve terminals to enable synaptic transmission. Much remains unknown about the processes that enable the formation and function of SVs. Moreover, nerve terminals appear to be particularly vulnerable to pathophysiologic processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia. Although techniques to purify synaptic vesicles thus have the potential to yield significant insights into physiology and pathophysiology of nerve terminals, current methods rely on either esoteric materials or expression of transgenes. This article addresses these problems by establishing robust, efficient methods for SV purification using widely available materials, and it highlights several promising areas of future study arising from proteomic analyses of immunopurified SVs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneously Recycling Synaptic Vesicles Constitute Readily Releasable Vesicles in Intact Neuromuscular Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emerging evidence shows that spontaneous synaptic transmission plays crucial roles on neuronal functions through presynaptic molecular mechanisms distinct from that of action potential (AP)-evoked transmission. However, whether the synaptic vesicle (SV) population undergoing the two forms of transmission is segregated remains controversial due in part to the conflicting results observed in cultured neurons. Here we address this issue in intact neuromuscular synapses using transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing two different indicators targeted in the SVs: a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, pHluorin, and a tag protein, HaloTag. By establishing a quantitative measure of recycled SV fractions, we found that ~85% of SVs were mobilized by high-frequency AP firings. In contrast, spontaneously recycling SVs were mobilized only from &lt;8% of SVs with a time constant of 45 min at 25&deg;C, although prolonged AP inhibition mobilized an additional population with a delayed onset. The mobilization of the early-onset population was less temperature-sensitive and resistant to tetanus toxin, whereas that of the late-onset population was more sensitive to temperature and was inhibited by tetanus toxin, indicating that prolonged AP inhibition activated a distinct molecular machinery for spontaneous SV fusion. Therefore, the early-onset population limited to &lt;8% was likely the only source of spontaneous release that occurred physiologically. We further showed that this limited population was independent from those reluctant to fuse during AP firing and was used in both the hypertonic stimulation and the immediate phase of AP-evoked releases, thereby matching the characteristics of the readily releasable pool.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are divided into functionally distinct pools depending on how they respond to action potential (AP) firing. The origin of SVs used for spontaneous fusion remains enigmatic despite intensive studies in cultured preparations. We addressed this question in intact neuromuscular synapses and provided two findings. First, prolonged AP inhibition activated a distinct population of fusion, which needs to be distinguished from genuine spontaneous fusion arising from a highly limited fraction. Second, the limited fraction observed early in the AP inhibition period exhibited the characteristics of readily releasable pool in the subsequent round of stimulation. Our study revealed that the origin of spontaneous SV fusion is restricted to the readily releasable pool among the SV pools involved in AP-evoked fusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Arrestin Facilitates Rhodopsin Dephosphorylation in Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deactivation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involves multiple phosphorylations followed by arrestin binding, which uncouples the GPCR from G-protein activation. Some GPCRs, such as rhodopsin, are reused many times. Arrestin dissociation and GPCR dephosphorylation are key steps in the recycling process. <I>In vitro</I> evidence suggests that visual arrestin (ARR1) binding to light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin hinders dephosphorylation. Whether ARR1 binding also affects rhodopsin dephosphorylation <I>in vivo</I> is not known. We investigated this using both male and female mice lacking ARR1. Mice were exposed to bright light and placed in darkness for different periods of time, and differently phosphorylated species of rhodopsin were assayed by isoelectric focusing. For WT mice, rhodopsin dephosphorylation was nearly complete by 1 h in darkness. Surprisingly, we observed that, in the <I>Arr1</I> KO rods, rhodopsin remained phosphorylated even after 3 h. Delayed dephosphorylation in <I>Arr1</I> KO rods cannot be explained by cell stress induced by persistent signaling, since it is not prevented by the removal of transducin, the visual G-protein, nor can it be explained by downregulation of protein phosphatase 2A, the putative rhodopsin phosphatase. We further show that cone arrestin (ARR4), which binds light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin poorly, had little effect in enhancing rhodopsin dephosphorylation, whereas mice expressing binding-competent mutant ARR1-3A showed a similar time course of rhodopsin dephosphorylation as WT. Together, these results reveal a novel role of ARR1 in facilitating rhodopsin dephosphorylation <I>in vivo</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins used by cells to receive and respond to a broad range of extracellular signals that include neurotransmitters, hormones, odorants, and light (photons). GPCR signaling is terminated by two sequential steps: phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Both steps must be reversed when GPCRs are recycled and reused. Dephosphorylation, which is required for recycling, is an understudied process. Using rhodopsin as a prototypical GPCR, we discovered that arrestin facilitated rhodopsin dephosphorylation in living mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Development of Receptive Field Tuning Properties in Mouse Binocular Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mouse primary visual cortex is a model system for understanding the relationship between cortical structure, function, and behavior (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B46">Seabrook et al., 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B8">Chaplin and Margrie, 2020</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B19">Hooks and Chen, 2020</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B39">Saleem, 2020</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B12">Flossmann and Rochefort, 2021</cross-ref>). Binocular neurons in V1 are the cellular basis of binocular vision, which is required for predation (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B43">Scholl et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">Hoy et al., 2016</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B26">La Chioma et al., 2020</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Berson, 2021</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B24">Johnson et al., 2021</cross-ref>). The normal development of binocular responses, however, has not been systematically measured. Here, we measure tuning properties of neurons to either eye in awake mice of either sex from eye opening to the closure of the critical period. At eye opening, we find an adult-like fraction of neurons responding to the contralateral-eye stimulation, which are selective for orientation and spatial frequency; few neurons respond to ipsilateral eye, and their tuning is immature. Fraction of ipsilateral-eye responses increases rapidly in the first few days after eye opening and more slowly thereafter, reaching adult levels by critical period closure. Tuning of these responses improves with a similar time course. The development and tuning of binocular responses parallel that of ipsilateral-eye responses. Four days after eye opening, monocular neurons respond to a full range of orientations but become more biased to cardinal orientations. Binocular responses, by contrast, lose their cardinal bias with age. Together, these data provide an in-depth accounting of the development of monocular and binocular responses in the binocular region of mouse V1 using a consistent set of visual stimuli and measurements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this manuscript, we present a full accounting of the emergence and refinement of monocular and binocular receptive field tuning properties of thousands of pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex. Our data reveal new features of monocular and binocular development that revise current models on the emergence of cortical binocularity. Given the recent interest in visually guided behaviors in mice that require binocular vision (e.g., predation), our measures will provide the basis for studies on the emergence of the neural circuitry guiding these behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Environmental Enrichment Mitigates the Long-Lasting Sequelae of Perinatal Fentanyl Exposure in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The opioid epidemic is a rapidly evolving societal issue driven, in part, by a surge in synthetic opioid use. A rise in fentanyl use among pregnant women has led to a 40-fold increase in the number of perinatally-exposed infants in the past decade. These children are more likely to develop mood-related and somatosensory-related conditions later in life, suggesting that fentanyl may permanently alter neural development. Here, we examined the behavioral and synaptic consequences of perinatal fentanyl exposure in adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice and assessed the therapeutic potential of environmental enrichment to mitigate these effects. Dams were given <I>ad libitum</I> access to fentanyl (10 &micro;g/ml, per os) across pregnancy and until weaning [postnatal day (PD)21]. Perinatally-exposed adolescent mice displayed hyperactivity (PD45), enhanced sensitivity to anxiogenic environments (PD46), and sensory maladaptation (PD47), sustained behavioral effects that were completely normalized by environmental enrichment (PD21&ndash;PD45). Additionally, environmental enrichment normalized the fentanyl-induced changes in the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) of layer 2/3 neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We also demonstrate that fentanyl impairs short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in S1 layer 2/3 neurons, which, instead, exhibit a sustained depression of synaptic transmission that is restored by environmental enrichment. On its own, environmental enrichment suppressed long-term depression (LTD) of control S1 neurons from vehicle-treated mice subjected to standard housing conditions. These results demonstrate that the lasting effects of fentanyl can be ameliorated with a noninvasive intervention introduced during early development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Illicit use of fentanyl accounts for a large proportion of opioid-related overdose deaths. Children exposed to opioids during development have a higher risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders later in life. Here, we employ a preclinical model of perinatal fentanyl exposure that recapitulates these long-term impairments and show, for the first time, that environmental enrichment can reverse deficits in somatosensory circuit function and behavior. These findings have the potential to directly inform and guide ongoing efforts to mitigate the consequences of perinatal opioid exposure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activity of Spinal Interneurons during Forward and Backward Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Higher vertebrates are capable not only of forward but also backward and sideways locomotion. Also, single steps in different directions are generated for postural corrections. While the networks responsible for the control of forward walking (FW) have been studied in considerable detail, the networks controlling steps in other directions are mostly unknown. Here, to characterize the operation of the spinal locomotor network during FW and backward walking (BW), we recorded the activity of individual spinal interneurons from L4 to L6 during both FW and BW evoked by epidural stimulation (ES) of the spinal cord at L5&ndash;L6 in decerebrate cats of either sex. Three groups of neurons were revealed. Group 1 (45%) had a similar phase of modulation during both FW and BW. Group 2 (27%) changed the phase of modulation in the locomotor cycle depending on the direction of locomotion. Group 3 neurons were modulated during FW only (Group 3a, 21%) or during BW only (Group 3b, 7%). We suggest that Group 1 neurons belong to the network generating the vertical component of steps (the limb elevation and lowering) because it should operate similarly during locomotion in any direction, while Groups 2 and 3 neurons belong to the networks controlling the direction of stepping. Results of this study provide new insights into the organization of the spinal locomotor circuits, advance our understanding of ES therapeutic effects, and can potentially be used for the development of novel strategies for recuperation of impaired balance control, which requires the generation of corrective steps in different directions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animals and humans can perform locomotion in different directions in relation to the body axis (forward, backward, sideways). While the networks that control forward walking have been studied in considerable detail, the networks controlling steps in other directions are unknown. Here, by recording the activity of the same spinal neurons during forward and backward walking, we revealed three groups of neurons forming, respectively, the network operating similarly during stepping in different directions, the network changing its operation with a change in the direction of stepping, and the network operating only during locomotion in a specific direction. These networks presumably control different aspects of the step. The obtained results provide new insights into the organization of the spinal locomotor networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presynaptic Interactions between Trigeminal and Cervical Nociceptive Afferents Supplying Upper Cervical Lamina I Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cervical and trigeminal afferents innervate neighboring cranial territories, and their convergence on upper cervical dorsal horn neurons provides a potential substrate for pain referral in primary headache syndromes. Lamina I neurons are central to this mechanism, as they relay convergent nociceptive input to supraspinal pain centers. Unfortunately, little is known about the interactions between trigeminal and cervical afferents supplying Lamina I neurons. Here, we used rats of both sexes to show that cervical and trigeminal afferents interact via presynaptic inhibition, where monosynaptic inputs to Lamina I neurons undergo unidirectional as well as reciprocal presynaptic control. This means that afferent-driven presynaptic inhibition shapes the way trigeminal and cervical A-fiber and C-fiber input reaches Lamina I projection neurons (PNs) and local-circuit neurons (LCNs). We propose that this inhibition provides a feedforward control of excitatory drive to Lamina I neurons that regulates their convergent and cervical-specific or trigeminal-specific processing modes. As a consequence, disruption of the trigeminal and cervical afferent-driven presynaptic inhibition may contribute to development of primary headache syndromes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Callosal Fiber Length Scales with Brain Size According to Functional Lateralization, Evolution, and Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain size significantly impacts the organization of white matter fibers. Fiber length scaling, the degree to which fiber length varies according to brain size, was overlooked. We investigated how fiber lengths within the corpus callosum, the most prominent white matter tract, vary according to brain size. The results showed substantial variation in length scaling among callosal fibers, replicated in two large healthy cohorts (~2000 human subjects, including both sexes). The underscaled callosal fibers mainly connected the precentral gyrus and parietal cortices, whereas the overscaled callosal fibers mainly connected the prefrontal cortices. The variation in such length scaling was biologically meaningful: larger scaling corresponded to larger neurite density index but smaller fractional anisotropy values; cortical regions connected by the callosal fibers with larger scaling were more lateralized functionally as well as phylogenetically and ontogenetically more recent than their counterparts. These findings highlight an interaction between interhemispheric communication and organizational and adaptive principles underlying brain development and evolution.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain size varies across evolution, development, and individuals. Relative to small brains, the neural fiber length in large brains is inevitably increased, but the degree of such increase may differ between fiber tracts. Such a difference, if it exists, is valuable for understanding adaptive neural principles in large versus small brains during evolution and development. The present study showed a substantial difference in the length increase between the callosal fibers that connect the two hemispheres, replicated in two large healthy cohorts. Together, our study demonstrates that reorganization of interhemispheric fibers length according to brain size is intrinsically related to fiber composition, functional lateralization, cortical myelin content, and evolutionary and developmental expansion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reading and Modulating Cortical {beta} Bursts from Motor Unit Spiking Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>&beta; Oscillations (13&ndash;30 Hz) are ubiquitous in the human motor nervous system. Yet, their origins and roles are unknown. Traditionally, &beta; activity has been treated as a stationary signal. However, recent studies observed that cortical &beta; occurs in "bursting events," which are transmitted to muscles. This short-lived nature of &beta; events makes it possible to study the main mechanism of &beta; activity found in the muscles in relation to cortical &beta;. Here, we assessed whether muscle &beta; activity mainly results from cortical projections. We ran two experiments in healthy humans of both sexes (<I>N</I> = 15 and <I>N</I> = 13, respectively) to characterize &beta; activity at the cortical and motor unit (MU) levels during isometric contractions of the tibialis anterior muscle. We found that &beta; rhythms observed at the cortical and MU levels are indeed in bursts. These bursts appeared to be time-locked and had comparable average durations (40&ndash;80 ms) and rates (approximately three to four bursts per second). To further confirm that cortical and MU &beta; have the same source, we used a novel operant conditioning framework to allow subjects to volitionally modulate MU &beta;. We showed that volitional modulation of &beta; activity at the MU level was possible with minimal subject learning and was paralleled by similar changes in cortical &beta; activity. These results support the hypothesis that MU &beta; mainly results from cortical projections. Moreover, they demonstrate the possibility to decode cortical &beta; activity from MU recordings, with a potential translation to future neural interfaces that use peripheral information to identify and modulate activity in the central nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show for the first time that &beta; activity in motor unit (MU) populations occurs in bursting events. These bursts observed in the output of the spinal cord appear to be time-locked and share similar characteristics of &beta; activity at the cortical level, such as the duration and rate at which they occur. Moreover, when subjects were exposed to a novel operant conditioning paradigm and modulated MU &beta; activity, cortical &beta; activity changed in a similar way as peripheral &beta;. These results provide evidence for a strong correspondence between cortical and peripheral &beta; activity, demonstrating the cortical origin of peripheral &beta; and opening the pathway for a new generation of neural interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Partially Overlapping Neural Correlates of Metacognitive Monitoring and Metacognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metacognition describes the process of monitoring one's own mental states, often for the purpose of cognitive control. Previous research has investigated how metacognitive signals are generated (metacognitive monitoring), for example, when people (both female/male) judge their confidence in their decisions and memories. Research has also investigated how metacognitive signals are used to influence behavior (metacognitive control), for example, setting a reminder (i.e., cognitive offloading) for something you are not confident you will remember. However, the mapping between metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control needs further study on a neural level. We used fMRI to investigate a delayed-intentions task with a reminder element, allowing human participants to use their metacognitive insight to engage metacognitive control. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that we could separately decode both monitoring and control, and, to a lesser extent, cross-classify between them. Therefore, brain patterns associated with monitoring and control are partially, but not fully, overlapping.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Models of metacognition commonly distinguish between monitoring (how metacognition is formed) and control (how metacognition is used for behavioral regulation). Research into these facets of metacognition has often happened in isolation. Here, we provide a study which directly investigates the mapping between metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control at a neural level. We applied multivariate pattern analysis to fMRI data from a novel task in which participants separately rated their confidence (metacognitive monitoring) and how much they would like to use a reminder (metacognitive control). We find support for the notion that the two aspects of metacognition overlap partially but not fully. We argue that future research should focus on how different metacognitive signals are selected for control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Neural Bases of Action-Outcome Learning in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>From an associative perspective the acquisition of new goal-directed actions requires the encoding of specific action-outcome (AO) associations and, therefore, sensitivity to the validity of an action as a predictor of a specific outcome relative to other events. Although competitive architectures have been proposed within associative learning theory to achieve this kind of identity-based selection, whether and how these architectures are implemented by the brain is still a matter of conjecture. To investigate this issue, we trained human participants to encode various AO associations while undergoing functional neuroimaging (fMRI). We then degraded one AO contingency by increasing the probability of the outcome in the absence of its associated action while keeping other AO contingencies intact. We found that this treatment selectively reduced performance of the degraded action. Furthermore, when a signal predicted the unpaired outcome, performance of the action was restored, suggesting that the degradation effect reflects competition between the action and the context for prediction of the specific outcome. We used a Kalman filter to model the contribution of different causal variables to AO learning and found that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) tracked changes in the association of the action and context, respectively, with regard to the specific outcome. Furthermore, we found the mPFC participated in a network with the striatum and posterior parietal cortex to segregate the influence of the various competing predictors to establish specific AO associations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans and other animals learn the consequences of their actions, allowing them to control their environment in a goal-directed manner. Nevertheless, it is unknown how we parse environmental causes from the effects of our own actions to establish these specific action-outcome (AO) relationships. Here, we show that the brain learns the causal structure of the environment by segregating the unique influence of actions from other causes in the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices and, through a network of structures, including the caudate nucleus and posterior parietal cortex, establishes the distinct causal relationships from which specific AO associations are formed.</p>

                <p>Speech perception in noise is a challenging everyday task with which many listeners have difficulty. Here, we report a case in which electrical brain stimulation of implanted intracranial electrodes in the left planum temporale (PT) of a neurosurgical patient significantly and reliably improved subjective quality (up to 50%) and objective intelligibility (up to 97%) of speech in noise perception. Stimulation resulted in a selective enhancement of speech sounds compared with the background noises. The receptive fields of the PT sites whose stimulation improved speech perception were tuned to spectrally broad and rapidly changing sounds. Corticocortical evoked potential analysis revealed that the PT sites were located between the sites in Heschl's gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. Moreover, the discriminability of speech from nonspeech sounds increased in population neural responses from Heschl's gyrus to the PT to the superior temporal gyrus sites. These findings causally implicate the PT in background noise suppression and may point to a novel potential neuroprosthetic solution to assist in the challenging task of speech perception in noise.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Speech perception in noise remains a challenging task for many individuals. Here, we present a case in which the electrical brain stimulation of intracranially implanted electrodes in the planum temporale of a neurosurgical patient significantly improved both the subjective quality (up to 50%) and objective intelligibility (up to 97%) of speech perception in noise.

Our local and network-level functional analyses placed the planum temporale sites in between the sites in the primary auditory areas in Heschl's gyrus and nonprimary auditory areas in the superior temporal gyrus. These findings causally implicate planum temporale in acoustic scene analysis and suggest potential neuroprosthetic applications to assist hearing in noise.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Thoracic VGluT2+ Spinal Interneurons Regulate Structural and Functional Plasticity of Sympathetic Networks after High-Level Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) above the major spinal sympathetic outflow (T6 level) disinhibits sympathetic neurons from supraspinal control, causing systems-wide "dysautonomia." We recently showed that remarkable structural remodeling and plasticity occurs within spinal sympathetic circuitry, creating abnormal sympathetic reflexes that exacerbate dysautonomia over time. As an example, thoracic VGluT2<sup>+</sup> spinal interneurons (SpINs) become structurally and functionally integrated with neurons that comprise the spinal&ndash;splenic sympathetic network and immunological dysfunction becomes progressively worse after SCI. To test whether the onset and progression of SCI-induced sympathetic plasticity is neuron activity dependent, we selectively inhibited (or excited) thoracic VGluT2<sup>+</sup> interneurons using chemogenetics. New data show that silencing VGluT2<sup>+</sup> interneurons in female and male mice with a T3 SCI, using hM4Di designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (G<SUB>i</SUB> DREADDs), blocks structural plasticity and the development of dysautonomia. Specifically, silencing VGluT2<sup>+</sup> interneurons prevents the structural remodeling of spinal sympathetic networks that project to lymphoid and endocrine organs, reduces the frequency of spontaneous autonomic dysreflexia (AD), and reduces the severity of experimentally induced AD. Features of SCI-induced structural plasticity can be recapitulated in the intact spinal cord by activating excitatory hM3Dq-DREADDs in VGluT2<sup>+</sup> interneurons. Collectively, these data implicate VGluT2<sup>+</sup> excitatory SpINs in the onset and propagation of SCI-induced structural plasticity and dysautonomia, and reveal the potential for neuromodulation to block or reduce dysautonomia after severe high-level SCI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In response to stress or dangerous stimuli, autonomic spinal neurons coordinate a "fight or flight" response marked by increased cardiac output and release of stress hormones. After a spinal cord injury (SCI), normally harmless stimuli like bladder filling can result in a "false" fight or flight response, causing pathological changes throughout the body. We show that progressive hypertension and immune suppression develop after SCI because thoracic excitatory VGluT2<sup>+</sup> spinal interneurons (SpINs) provoke structural remodeling in autonomic networks within below-lesion spinal levels. These pathological changes can be prevented in SCI mice or phenocopied in uninjured mice using chemogenetics to selectively manipulate activity in VGluT2<sup>+</sup> SpINs. Targeted neuromodulation of SpINs could prevent structural plasticity and subsequent autonomic dysfunction in people with SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perinatal Opioid Exposure Results in Persistent Hypoconnectivity of Excitatory Circuits and Reduced Activity Correlations in Mouse Primary Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opioid use by pregnant women results in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) and lifelong neurobehavioral deficits including language impairments. Animal models of NOWS show impaired performance in a two-tone auditory discrimination task, suggesting abnormalities in sensory processing in the auditory cortex. To investigate the consequences of perinatal opioid exposure on auditory cortex circuits, we administered fentanyl to mouse dams in their drinking water throughout gestation and until litters were weaned at postnatal day (P)21. We then used <I>in vivo</I> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in adult animals of both sexes to investigate how primary auditory cortex (A1) function was altered. Perinatally exposed animals showed fewer sound-responsive neurons in A1, and the remaining sound-responsive cells exhibited lower response amplitudes but normal frequency selectivity and stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). Populations of nearby layer 2/3 (L2/3) cells in exposed animals showed reduced correlated activity, suggesting a reduction of shared inputs. We then investigated A1 microcircuits to L2/3 cells by performing laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) combined with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from A1 L2/3 cells. L2/3 cells in exposed animals showed functional hypoconnectivity of excitatory circuits of ascending inputs from L4 and L5/6 to L2/3, while inhibitory connections were unchanged, leading to an altered excitatory/inhibitory balance. These results suggest a specific reduction in excitatory ascending interlaminar cortical circuits resulting in decreased activity correlations after fentanyl exposure. We speculate that these changes in cortical circuits contribute to the impaired auditory discrimination ability after perinatal opioid exposure.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first study to investigate the functional effects of perinatal fentanyl exposure on the auditory cortex. Experiments show that perinatal fentanyl exposure results in decreased excitatory functional circuits and altered population activity in primary sensory areas in adult mice. These circuit changes might underlie the observed language and cognitive deficits in infants exposed to opioids.</p>

                <p>by Cuiping Liang, Qince Li, Kuanquan Wang, Yimei Du, Wei Wang, Henggui Zhang</p>

Myocardial ischemia, injury and infarction (MI) are the three stages of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In the past two decades, a great number of studies focused on myocardial ischemia and MI individually, and showed that the occurrence of reentrant arrhythmias is often associated with myocardial ischemia or MI. However, arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the tissue with various degrees of remodeling in the ischemic heart have not been fully understood. In this study, biophysical detailed single-cell models of ischemia 1a, 1b, and MI were developed to mimic the electrophysiological remodeling at different stages of ACS. 2D tissue models with different distributions of ischemia and MI areas were constructed to investigate the mechanisms of the initiation of reentrant waves during the progression of ischemia. Simulation results in 2D tissues showed that the vulnerable windows (VWs) in simultaneous presence of multiple ischemic conditions were associated with the dynamics of wave propagation in the tissues with each single pathological condition. In the tissue with multiple pathological conditions, reentrant waves were mainly induced by two different mechanisms: one is the heterogeneity along the excitation wavefront, especially the abrupt variation in conduction velocity (CV) across the border of ischemia 1b and MI, and the other is the decreased safe factor (SF) for conduction at the edge of the tissue in MI region which is attributed to the increased excitation threshold of MI region. Finally, the reentrant wave was observed in a 3D model with a scar reconstructed from MRI images of a MI patient. These comprehensive findings provide novel insights for understanding the arrhythmic risk during the progression of myocardial ischemia and highlight the importance of the multiple pathological stages in designing medical therapies for arrhythmias in ischemia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Learning the rules of collective cell migration using deep attention networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julienne LaChance, Kevin Suh, Jens Clausen, Daniel J. Cohen</p>

Collective, coordinated cellular motions underpin key processes in all multicellular organisms, yet it has been difficult to simultaneously express the ‘rules’ behind these motions in clear, interpretable forms that effectively capture high-dimensional cell-cell interaction dynamics in a manner that is intuitive to the researcher. Here we apply deep attention networks to analyze several canonical living tissues systems and present the underlying collective migration rules for each tissue type using only cell migration trajectory data. We use these networks to learn the behaviors of key tissue types with distinct collective behaviors—epithelial, endothelial, and metastatic breast cancer cells—and show how the results complement traditional biophysical approaches. In particular, we present attention maps indicating the relative influence of neighboring cells to the learned turning decisions of a ‘focal cell’–the primary cell of interest in a collective setting. Colloquially, we refer to this learned relative influence as ‘attention’, as it serves as a proxy for the physical parameters modifying the focal cell’s future motion as a function of each neighbor cell. These attention networks reveal distinct patterns of influence and attention unique to each model tissue. Endothelial cells exhibit tightly focused attention on their immediate forward-most neighbors, while cells in more expansile epithelial tissues are more broadly influenced by neighbors in a relatively large forward sector. Attention maps of ensembles of more mesenchymal, metastatic cells reveal completely symmetric attention patterns, indicating the lack of any particular coordination or direction of interest. Moreover, we show how attention networks are capable of detecting and learning how these rules change based on biophysical context, such as location within the tissue and cellular crowding. That these results require only cellular trajectories and no modeling assumptions highlights the potential of attention networks for providing further biological insights into complex cellular systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Optineurin promotes myogenesis during muscle regeneration in mice by autophagic degradation of GSK3β</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiao Chen Shi, Bo Xia, Jian Feng Zhang, Rui Xin Zhang, Dan Yang Zhang, Huan Liu, Bao Cai Xie, Yong Liang Wang, Jiang Wei Wu</p>

Skeletal muscle regeneration is essential for maintaining muscle function in injury and muscular disease. Myogenesis plays key roles in forming new myofibers during the process. Here, through bioinformatic screen for the potential regulators of myogenesis from 5 independent microarray datasets, we identify an overlapping differentially expressed gene (DEG) optineurin (OPTN). <i>Optn</i> knockdown (KD) delays muscle regeneration in mice and impairs C2C12 myoblast differentiation without affecting their proliferation. Conversely, <i>Optn</i> overexpression (OE) promotes myoblast differentiation. Mechanistically, OPTN increases nuclear levels of β-catenin and enhances the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcription activity, suggesting activation of Wnt signaling pathway. The activation is accompanied by decreased protein levels of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a negative regulator of the pathway. We further show that OPTN physically interacts with and targets GSK3β for autophagic degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β rescues the impaired myogenesis induced by <i>Optn</i> KD during muscle regeneration and myoblast differentiation, corroborating that GSK3β is the downstream effector of OPTN-mediated myogenesis. Together, our study delineates the novel role of OPTN as a potential regulator of myogenesis and may open innovative therapeutic perspectives for muscle regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The X-linked splicing regulator MBNL3 has been co-opted to restrict placental growth in eutherians</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Spruce, Mireya Plass, André Gohr, Debashish Ray, María Martínez de Lagrán, Gregor Rot, Ana Nóvoa, Demian Burguera, Jon Permanyer, Marta Miret, Hong Zheng, Maurice S. Swanson, Quaid Morris, Moises Mallo, Mara Dierssen, Timothy R. Hughes, Barbara Pernaute, Manuel Irimia</p>

Understanding the regulatory interactions that control gene expression during the development of novel tissues is a key goal of evolutionary developmental biology. Here, we show that <i>Mbnl3</i> has undergone a striking process of evolutionary specialization in eutherian mammals resulting in the emergence of a novel placental function for the gene. <i>Mbnl3</i> belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins whose members regulate multiple aspects of RNA metabolism. We find that, in eutherians, while both <i>Mbnl3</i> and its paralog <i>Mbnl2</i> are strongly expressed in placenta, <i>Mbnl3</i> expression has been lost from nonplacental tissues in association with the evolution of a novel promoter. Moreover, <i>Mbnl3</i> has undergone accelerated protein sequence evolution leading to changes in its RNA-binding specificities and cellular localization. While <i>Mbnl2</i> and <i>Mbnl3</i> share partially redundant roles in regulating alternative splicing, polyadenylation site usage and, in turn, placenta maturation, <i>Mbnl3</i> has also acquired novel biological functions. Specifically, <i>Mbnl3</i> knockout (M3KO) alone results in increased placental growth associated with higher <i>Myc</i> expression. Furthermore, <i>Mbnl3</i> loss increases fetal resource allocation during limiting conditions, suggesting that location of <i>Mbnl3</i> on the X chromosome has led to its role in limiting placental growth, favoring the maternal side of the parental genetic conflict.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Homecoming of the estranged GluD channels</a></h4>

              
                A recent paper by Carrillo and colleagues demonstrates that GluD proteins form bona fide ligand-gated ion channels when their intrinsic flexibility is constrained by interactions with protein partners. Therefore, Delta receptors resemble all other members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family not only by sequence and structural homology, but also by functional dynamics.

                Influential theories implicate variations in the mechanisms supporting threat learning in the severity of anxiety symptoms. We use computational models of associative learning in conjunction with structural imaging to explicate links among the mechanisms underlying threat learning, their neuroanatomical substrates, and anxiety severity in humans. We recorded skin-conductance data during a threat-learning task from individuals with and without anxiety disorders (N=251; 8-50 years; 116 females). Reinforcement-learning model variants quantified processes hypothesized to relate to anxiety: threat conditioning, threat generalization, safety learning, and threat extinction. We identified the best-fitting models for these processes and tested associations among latent learning parameters, whole-brain anatomy, and anxiety severity. Results indicate that greater anxiety severity related specifically to slower safety learning and slower extinction of response to safe stimuli. Nucleus accumbens gray-matter volume moderated learning-anxiety associations. Using a modeling approach, we identify computational mechanisms linking threat learning and anxiety severity and their neuroanatomical substrates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dopaminergic regulation of vestibulo-cerebellar circuits through unipolar brush cells</a></h4>

              
                While multiple monoamines modulate cerebellar output, the mechanistic details of dopaminergic signaling in the cerebellum remain poorly understood. We show that Drd1 dopamine receptors are expressed in unipolar brush cells (UBCs) of the mouse cerebellar vermis. Drd1 activation increases UBC firing rate and postsynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated currents. Using anatomical tracing and <i>in situ</i> hybridization, we test three hypotheses about the source of cerebellar dopamine. We exclude midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive Purkinje cells as potential sources, supporting the possibility of dopaminergic co-release from locus coeruleus (LC) axons. Using an optical dopamine sensor GRAB<sub>DA</sub>, electrical stimulation, and optogenetic activation of LC fibers in the acute slice, we find evidence for monoamine release onto Drd1-expressing UBCs. Altogether, we propose that the LC regulates cerebellar cortex activity by co-releasing dopamine onto UBCs to modulate their response to cerebellar inputs. Purkinje neurons directly inhibit these Drd1-positive UBCs, forming a dopamine-sensitive recurrent vestibulo-cerebellar circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanical stimulation promotes enthesis injury repair by mobilizing Prrx1+ cells via ciliary TGF-β signaling</a></h4>

              
                Proper mechanical stimulation can improve rotator cuff enthesis injury repair. However, the underlying mechanism of mechanical stimulation promoting injury repair is still unknown. In this study, we found that <i>Prrx1</i><sup>+</sup> cell was essential for murine rotator cuff enthesis development identified by single-cell RNA sequence and involved in the injury repair. Proper mechanical stimulation could promote the migration of <i>Prrx1</i><sup>+</sup> cells to enhance enthesis injury repair. Meantime, TGF-β signaling and primary cilia played an essential role in mediating mechanical stimulation signaling transmission. Proper mechanical stimulation enhanced the release of active TGF-β1 to promote migration of <i>Prrx1</i><sup>+</sup> cells. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling eliminated the stimulatory effect of mechanical stimulation on <i>Prrx1</i><sup>+</sup> cell migration and enthesis injury repair. In addition, knockdown of <i>Pallidin</i> to inhibit TGF-βR2 translocation to the primary cilia or deletion of <i>Ift88</i> in <i>Prrx1</i><sup>+</sup> cells also restrained the mechanics-induced <i>Prrx1</i><sup>+</sup> cells migration. These findings suggested that mechanical stimulation could increase the release of active TGF-β1 and enhance the mobilization of <i>Prrx1</i><sup>+</sup> cells to promote enthesis injury repair via ciliary TGF-β signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Development and characterization of new tools for detecting poly(ADP-ribose) in vitro and in vivo</a></h4>

              
                ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation) is a reversible post-translation modification resulting in the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose (ADPR) moieties on substrate proteins. Naturally occurring protein motifs and domains, including WWEs, PBZs, and macrodomains, act as ‘readers’ for protein-linked ADPR. Although recombinant, antibody-like ADPR detection reagents containing these readers have facilitated the detection of ADPR, they are limited in their ability to capture the dynamic nature of ADPRylation. Herein, we describe and characterize a set of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) Trackers (PAR-Ts)—optimized dimerization-dependent or split-protein reassembly PAR sensors in which a naturally occurring PAR binding domain, WWE, was fused to both halves of dimerization-dependent GFP (ddGFP) or split Nano Luciferase (NanoLuc), respectively. We demonstrate that these new tools allow the detection and quantification of PAR levels in extracts, living cells, and living tissues with greater sensitivity, as well as temporal and spatial precision. Importantly, these sensors detect changes in cellular ADPR levels in response to physiological cues (e.g., hormone-dependent induction of adipogenesis without DNA damage), as well as xenograft tumor tissues in living mice. Our results indicate that PAR Trackers have broad utility for detecting ADPR in many different experimental and biological systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosulfakinin signaling modulates female sexual receptivity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Female sexual behavior as an innate behavior is of prominent biological importance for survival and reproduction. However, molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying female sexual behavior is not well understood. Here, we identify the Cholecystokinin-like peptide Drosulfakinin (DSK) to promote female sexual behavior in <i>Drosophila</i>. Loss of DSK function reduces female receptivity while overexpressing DSK enhances female receptivity. We identify two pairs of <i>Dsk</i>-expressing neurons in the central brain to promote female receptivity. We find that the DSK peptide acts through one of its receptors, CCKLR-17D3, to modulate female receptivity. Manipulation of CCKLR-17D3 and its expressing neurons alters female receptivity. We further reveal that the two pairs of <i>Dsk</i>-expressing neurons receive input signal from pC1 neurons that integrate sex-related cues and mating status. These results demonstrate how a neuropeptide pathway interacts with a central neural node in the female sex circuitry to modulate sexual receptivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The interferon-inducible GTPase MxB promotes capsid disassembly and genome release of herpesviruses</a></h4>

              
                Host proteins sense viral products and induce defence mechanisms, particularly in immune cells. Using cell-free assays and quantitative mass spectrometry, we determined the interactome of capsid-host protein complexes of herpes simplex virus and identified the large dynamin-like GTPase myxovirus resistance protein B (MxB) as an interferon-inducible protein interacting with capsids. Electron microscopy analyses showed that cytosols containing MxB had the remarkable capability to disassemble the icosahedral capsids of herpes simplex viruses and varicella zoster virus into flat sheets of connected triangular faces. In contrast, capsids remained intact in cytosols with MxB mutants unable to hydrolyse GTP or to dimerize. Our data suggest that MxB senses herpesviral capsids, mediates their disassembly, and thereby restricts the efficiency of nuclear targeting of incoming capsids and/or the assembly of progeny capsids. The resulting premature release of viral genomes from capsids may enhance the activation of DNA sensors, and thereby amplify the innate immune responses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reconstitution of surface lipoprotein translocation through the slam translocon</a></h4>

              
                Surface lipoproteins (SLPs) are peripherally attached to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in many Gram-negative bacteria, playing significant roles in nutrient acquisition and immune evasion in the host. While the factors that are involved in the synthesis and delivery of SLPs in the inner membrane are well characterized, the molecular machinery required for the movement of SLPs to the surface are still not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the translocation of a surface lipoprotein TbpB through a Slam1-dependent pathway. Using purified components, we developed an <i>in vitro</i> translocation assay where unfolded TbpB is transported through Slam1 containing proteoliposomes, confirming Slam1 as an outer membrane translocon. While looking to identify factors to increase translocation efficiency, we discovered the periplasmic chaperone Skp interacted with TbpB in the periplasm of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The presence of Skp was found to increase the translocation efficiency of TbpB in the reconstituted translocation assays. A knockout of Skp in <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> revealed that Skp is essential for functional translocation of TbpB to the bacterial surface. Taken together, we propose a pathway for surface destined lipoproteins, where Skp acts as a holdase for Slam-mediated TbpB translocation across the outer membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of V3 neurons in speed-dependent interlimb coordination during locomotion in mice</a></h4>

              
                Speed-dependent interlimb coordination allows animals to maintain stable locomotion under different circumstances. The V3 neurons are known to be involved in interlimb coordination. We previously modeled the locomotor spinal circuitry controlling interlimb coordination (Danner et al., 2017). This model included the local V3 neurons that mediate mutual excitation between left and right rhythm generators (RGs). Here, our focus was on V3 neurons involved in ascending long propriospinal interactions (aLPNs). Using retrograde tracing, we revealed a subpopulation of lumbar V3 aLPNs with contralateral cervical projections. V3<sup>OFF</sup> mice, in which all V3 neurons were silenced, had a significantly reduced maximal locomotor speed, were unable to move using stable trot, gallop, or bound, and predominantly used a lateral-sequence walk. To reproduce this data and understand the functional roles of V3 aLPNs, we extended our previous model by incorporating diagonal V3 aLPNs mediating inputs from each lumbar RG to the contralateral cervical RG. The extended model reproduces our experimental results and suggests that locally projecting V3 neurons, mediating left–right interactions within lumbar and cervical cords, promote left–right synchronization necessary for gallop and bound, whereas the V3 aLPNs promote synchronization between diagonal fore and hind RGs necessary for trot. The model proposes the organization of spinal circuits available for future experimental testing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allosteric cooperation in ß-lactam binding to a non-classical transpeptidase</a></h4>

              
                L,D-transpeptidase function predominates in atypical 3®3 transpeptide networking of peptidoglycan (PG) layer <i>in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Prior studies of L,D-transpeptidases have identified only the catalytic site that binds to peptide moiety of the PG substrate or ß-lactam antibiotics. This insight was leveraged to develop mechanism of its activity and inhibition by ß-lactams. Here we report identification of an allosteric site at a distance of 21 Å from the catalytic site that binds the sugar moiety of PG substrates (hereafter referred to as the S-pocket). This site also binds a second ß-lactam molecule and influences binding at the catalytic site. We provide evidence that two ß-lactam molecules bind co-operatively to this enzyme, one non-covalently at the S-pocket and one covalently at the catalytic site. This dual ß-lactam binding phenomenon is previously unknown and is an observation that may offer novel approaches for the structure-based design of new drugs against <i>M. tuberculosis./em&gt;.</i>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fear engrams and NPYergic circuit in the dorsal dentate gyrus determine remote fear memory generalization.</a></h4>

              
                Generalization is a critical feature of aversive memories and significantly contributes to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) pathogenesis. While fear memories over time tend to generalize across differences in the contextual background and even to novel contextual settings, this effect can be counteracted by exposure to controlled reminder sessions even at remote time points. Using Pavlovian fear conditioning in mice, we show that generalization to a novel context of remote memory is associated with a loss of cellular engram activation in the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) and can be effectively counteracted by a preceding contextual reminder session. In addition to engram cells activation in response to a novel context, the reminder session also leads to a recovery of neuropeptide Y (NPY) function in the dDG and dDG-CA3 neurotransmission. In line with a proposed role of NPY as a resilience factor, we found that chronic viral knockdown of NPY in the dDG and blockage of its activity-dependent expression in NPYergic dDG interneurons with dominant-negative CREBS133A both increase remote memory generalization. With chemogenetic silencing of these interneurons, we could localize their critical involvement to a time window during and immediately following the fear memory acquisition. Together, these findings suggest that NPYergic interneurons of the dDG, shaping the memory engram during fear learning and early consolidation, determine fear generalization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Implementation of Precise Temporal Patterns in Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                One of the most concerned problems in neuroscience is how neurons communicate and convey information through spikes. There is abundant evidence in sensory systems to support the use of precise timing of spikes to encode information. However, it remains unknown whether precise temporal patterns could be generated to drive output in the primary motor cortex (M1), a brain area containing ample recurrent connections that may destroy temporal fidelity. Here, we used a novel brain-machine interface (BMI) that mapped the temporal order and precision of motor cortex activity to the auditory cursor and reward to guide the generation of precise temporal patterns in M1. During the course of learning, rats performed the "temporal neuroprosthetics" in a goal-directed manner with increasing proficiency. Precisely timed spiking activity in M1 was volitionally and robustly produced under this "temporal neuroprosthetics", demonstrating the feasibility of M1 implementing temporal codes. Population analysis showed that the local network was coordinated in a fine time scale as the overall excitation heightened. Furthermore, we found that the directed connection between neurons assigned to directly control the output ("direct neurons") was strengthened throughout learning, as well as connections in the subnetwork that contains direct neurons. Network models revealed that excitatory gain and strengthening of subnetwork connectivity transitioned neural states to a more synchronous regime, which improved the sensitivity for coincidence detection and, thus, the precision of spike patterns. Therefore, our results suggested the recurrent connections facilitate the implementation of precise temporal patterns instead of impairing them, which provided new perspectives on the fine-timescale activity and dynamics of M1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A role for the circadian transcription factor NPAS2 in the progressive loss of non-rapid eye movement sleep and increased arousal during fentanyl withdrawal in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Synthetic opioids like fentanyl are contributing to the rise in rates of opioid use disorder and drug overdose deaths. Sleep dysfunction and circadian rhythm disruption may worsen during opioid withdrawal and persist during abstinence. Severe and persistent sleep and circadian alterations are putative factors in opioid craving and relapse. However, very little is known about the impact of fentanyl on sleep architecture and sleep-wake cycles, particularly opioid withdrawal. Further, circadian rhythms regulate sleep-wake cycles, and the circadian transcription factor, neuronal PAS domain 2 (NPAS2) is involved in the modulation of sleep architecture and drug reward. Here, we investigate the role of NPAS2 in fentanyl-induced sleep alterations. Objectives: To determine the effect of fentanyl administration and withdrawal on sleep architecture, and the role of NPAS2 as a factor in fentanyl-induced sleep changes. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) was used to measure non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) at baseline and following acute and chronic fentanyl administration in wild-type and NPAS2-deficient male mice. Results: Acute and chronic administration of fentanyl led to increased wake and arousal in both wild-type and NPAS2-deficient mice, an effect that was more pronounced in NPAS2-deficient mice. Chronic fentanyl administration led to decreased NREMS, which persisted during withdrawal, progressively decreasing from day 1 to 4 of withdrawal. The impact of fentanyl on NREMS and arousal was more pronounced in NPAS2-deficient mice. Conclusions: Chronic fentanyl disrupts NREMS, leading to a progressive loss of NREMS during subsequent days of withdrawal. Loss of NPAS2 exacerbates the impact of fentanyl on sleep and wake, revealing a potential role for the circadian transcription factor in opioid-induced sleep changes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic neural reconstructions of attended object location and features using EEG</a></h4>

              
                We live in a dynamic world and our environment contains far more stimuli than our brain can process at one time. Visual attention allows us to select relevant information and ignore irrelevant information. What happens when attention is shifted from one item to another? To answer this question, it is critical to have tools that can accurately recover neural representations of both feature and location information, and do so across shifts of attention with high temporal resolution. In the current study, we used human electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning methods to explore how neural representations of object features and locations update across dynamic shifts of attention. We demonstrate that EEG can be used to create simultaneous timecourses of the neural representations of attended features (timepoint-by-timepoint inverted encoding model reconstructions) and attended location (timepoint-by-timepoint decoding) during both stable periods and across dynamic spatial shifts of attention. On each trial two oriented gratings were presented that flickered at the same frequency but had different orientations; participants were cued to attend to one of them, and on half of the trials received a shift cue in the middle of the trial. We trained the models on a stable period from Hold attention trials, and then reconstructed/decoded the attended orientation/location information at each timepoint on Shift attention trials. Our results showed that both feature reconstructions and location decoding dynamically track the shift of attention, and that there may be timepoints during the shifting of attention when (1) feature and location representations become uncoupled, and (2) both the previously-attended and currently-attended orientations are represented with roughly equal strength. The results offer insight into our understanding of attentional shifts, and the noninvasive techniques developed in the current study lend themselves well to a wide variety of future applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms regulating the frequency of inhibition-based gamma oscillations in primate prefrontal and parietal cortices</a></h4>

              
                In primates, the dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) and posterior parietal (PPC) cortices are critical nodes in the network mediating cognitive functions including attention and working memory. Notably, during working memory tasks, gamma oscillations, usually prominent in layer 3 (L3), are induced in both DLPFC and PPC but exhibit higher frequency in DLPFC. These oscillation frequency differences might be crucial for working memory function, but the mechanisms producing different oscillation frequencies in monkey DLPFC and PPC remain poorly understood. To investigate the basis of the DLPFC-PPC differences in oscillation frequency we studied GABAAR-mediated inhibition, which plays a crucial role in gamma oscillation production, in L3 pyramidal neurons (L3 PNs) from the rhesus monkey DLPFC or PPC. Recordings of GABAAR-mediated synaptic currents from L3 PNs, while suggesting a contribution to network synchronization in both areas, revealed no DLPFC-PPC differences in the strength or kinetics of GABAAR-mediated inhibition. Likewise, the expression of GABAAR genes in L3 PNs did not differ between regions. In the absence of differences in inhibition, DLPFC L3 PNs showed greater dendritic spine density and higher expression of AMPAR and NMDAR subunit genes relative to PPC L3 PNs, suggesting that the excitatory synaptic drive onto L3 PNs could be stronger in the DLPFC. Simulations in computational models of the cortical microcircuit showed that, with constant synaptic inhibition, increasing the strength of recurrent excitatory synaptic drive increased the network oscillation frequency. Hence, the DLPFC-PPC differences in gamma oscillation frequency could depend on stronger recurrent excitation in the DLPFC relative to PPC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurofeedback training for improving motor performance in healthy adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Neurofeedback training (NFT) refers to a training where the participants voluntarily aim to manipulate their own brain activity using the sensory feedback abstracted from their brain activity. NFT has attracted attention in the field of motor learning for its potential to become an alternative or additional training method for general physical training. In this study, a systematic review of NFT studies for motor performance improvements in healthy adults and a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of NFT were conducted. To identify relevant studies published between January 1st, 1990 to August 3rd, 2021, a computerized search was performed using the databases, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, JDreamIII, and Ichushi-Web. Thirty-two studies were identified for the qualitative synthesis and 13 randomized controlled trials (286 subjects) for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed significant effects of NFT for motor performance improvement examined at the timing after the last NFT session (standardized mean difference = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.40 to 1.53), but with the existence of publication biases and substantial heterogeneity among the trials. Subsequent subgroup meta-analysis demonstrated reliable benefits when the NFT is performed longer than 1 week. The effectiveness of NFT for each motor performance measurement (e.g., speed, accuracy, and hand dexterity) remains unclear because of high heterogeneity or due to small sample size. Further accumulation of empirical NFT studies for motor performance improvement will be necessary to provide reliable evidence about the NFT effects on specific motor skills and to safely incorporate NFT into real-world scenarios.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Episodic memory retrieval affects the onset and dynamics of evidence accumulation during value-based decisions</a></h4>

              
                In neuroeconomics, there is much interest in understanding simple value-based choices where agents choose between visually presented goods, comparable to a shopping scenario in a supermarket. However, many everyday decisions are made in the physical absence of the considered goods, requiring agents to recall information about the goods from memory. Here, we asked whether and how this reliance on an internal memory representation affects the temporal dynamics of decision making on a cognitive and neural level. Participants performed a remember-and-decide task, in which they made simple purchasing decisions between money offers and snack items while undergoing EEG. Snack identity was presented either visually (value trials) or had to be recalled from memory (memory trials). Behavioral data indicated comparable choice consistency across both trial types, but considerably longer response times (RT) in memory trials. Drift-diffusion modeling suggested that this RT difference was due to longer non-decision time of decision processes as well as altered evidence accumulation dynamics (lower accumulation rate and higher decision threshold). The non-decision time effect was supported by a delayed onset of the lateralized readiness potential. These results show that both, decision and non-decision processes are prolonged when participants need to resort to internal memory representations during value-based decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fixational eye movements as active sensation for high visual acuity</a></h4>

              
                Perception and action are inherently entangled: our world view is shaped by how we explore and navigate our environment through complex and variable self-motion. Even when fixating on a stable stimulus, our eyes undergo small, involuntary movements. Fixational eye movements (FEM) render a stable world jittery on our retinae, which contributes noise to neural coding. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that FEM help rather than harm human perception of fine detail. Here, we elucidate this paradox by uncovering under which conditions FEM improve or impair retinal coding and human acuity. We combine theory and experiment: model accuracy is directly compared to that of healthy human subjects in a visual acuity task. Acuity is modeled by applying an ideal Bayesian classifier to simulations of retinal spiking activity in the presence of FEM. In addition, empirical FEM are monitored using high-resolution eye-tracking by an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. While FEM introduce noise, they also effectively pre-process visual inputs to facilitate retinal information encoding. Based on an interplay of these mechanisms, our model predicts a relation between visual acuity, FEM amplitude, and single-trial stimulus size that quantitatively accounts for experimental observations and captures the beneficial effect of FEM. Moreover, we observe that human subjects' FEM statistics vary with stimulus size, and our model suggests that changing eye motion amplitude, as the subjects indeed do, enhances acuity as compared to maintaining eye motion size constant. Overall, our findings indicate that perception benefits from action even at the fine and noise-dominated spatio-temporal scale of FEM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aquaporin 4 is differentially increased and depolarized in association with tau and amyloid-beta</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes and the glymphatic system play important roles in Alzheimers disease and have been mainly analyzed in amyloidogenic scenarios, with less known about their involvement in tauopathies. Here, we aimed to compare the association of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) with tau and amyloid-beta. Perfusion, susceptibility weighted imaging and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in P301L mouse model of 4-repeat tau (pR5 line), arcAb and nontransgenic littermates. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using antibodies against AQP4, CD31, astrogliosis (GFAP, s100b), amyloid-beta(6E10), and phospho-tau (AT-8) in brain tissue slices from P301L, arcAb and nontransgenic mice. P301L mice showed regional atrophy, preserved cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and reduced vessel density (CD31) compared to nontransgenic mice, while arcAb mice showed cerebral microbleeds and reduced vessel density. Increased AQP4 levels were detected in the cortex and hippocampus of P301L mice and were locally associated with Ab deposits in arcAb mice. Depolarization of AQP4 was detected in the hippocampus of P301L mice and the cortex of arcAb mice, indicating an association with regional pathology. Increased s100b and GFAP fluorescence intensities indicative of reactive astrocytes were detected around tau inclusions in P301L mice and Ab plaques in arcAb mice. In conclusion, we observed a divergent region-specific AQP4 increase and association with phospho-tau and Ab pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical response variability is driven by local excitability changes with somatotopic organization</a></h4>

              
                Identical sensory stimuli can lead to different neural responses depending on the instantaneous brain state. Specifically, neural excitability in sensory areas may shape the brain's response already from earliest cortical processing onwards. However, whether these dynamics affect sensory domains globally or occur on a spatially local level is largely unknown. We studied this in the somatosensory domain of 38 human participants with EEG, presenting stimuli to the median and tibial nerves alternatingly, and testing the co-variation of initial cortical responses in hand and foot areas, as well as their relation to pre-stimulus oscillatory states. We found that amplitude fluctuations of initial cortical responses to hand and foot stimulation - the N20 and P40 components of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), respectively - were not related, indicating local excitability changes in primary sensory regions. In addition, effects of pre-stimulus alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (18-23 Hz) band amplitude on hand-related responses showed a robust somatotopic organization, thus further strengthening the notion of local excitability fluctuations. However, for foot-related responses, the spatial specificity of pre-stimulus effects was less consistent across frequency bands, with beta appearing to be more foot-specific than alpha. Connectivity analyses in source space suggested this to be due to a somatosensory alpha rhythm that is primarily driven by activity in hand regions while beta frequencies may operate in a more hand-region-independent manner. Altogether, our findings suggest spatially distinct excitability dynamics within the primary somatosensory cortex, yet with the caveat that frequency-specific processes in one sub-region may not readily generalize to other sub-regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficacy and Specificity of Melanopsin Reporters for Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are specialized retinal output neurons that mediate behavioral, neuroendocrine, and developmental responses to environmental light. There are diverse molecular strategies for marking ipRGCs, especially in mice, making them among the best characterized retinal ganglion cells. With the development of more sensitive reporters, new subtypes of ipRGCs have emerged. We therefore tested high-sensitivity reporter systems to see whether we could reveal yet more. Substantial confusion remains about which of the available methods, if any, label all and only ipRGCs. Here, we compared many different methods for labeling of ipRGCs, including anti-melanopsin immunofluorescence, Opn4-GFP BAC transgenic mice, and Opn4cre mice crossed with three different Cre-specific reporters (Z/EG; Ai9; and Ai14) or injected with Cre-dependent (DIO) AAV2. We show that Opn4cre mice, when crossed with sensitive Cre-reporter mice, label numerous ganglion cell types that lack intrinsic photosensitivity. Though other methods label ipRGCs specifically, they do not label the entire population of ipRGCs. We conclude that no existing method labels all and only ipRGCs. We assess the appropriateness of each reporter for particular applications and integrate findings across reporters to estimate that the overall abundance of ipRGCs among mouse retinal ganglion cells may approach 11%.

                BACKGROUND: Sensory atypicalities are particularly common in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Nevertheless, our knowledge about the divergence of the underlying somatosensory region and its association with ASD phenotype features is limited. METHODS: We applied a data-driven approach to map the fine-grained variations in functional connectivity of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to the rest of the brain in 240 autistic and 164 neurotypical individuals from the EU-AIMS LEAP dataset, aged between 7 and 30. We estimated the S1 connection topography ('connectopy) during rest and during the emotional face-matching (Hariri) task, an established measure of emotion reactivity, and accessed its association with a set of clinical and behavioral variables. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the S1 connectopy is organized along a dorsoventral axis, mapping onto the somatotopic organization of S1. We found that its spatial characteristics were linked to the individuals' adaptive functioning skills, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, across the whole sample. Higher functional differentiation characterized the S1 connectopies of individuals with higher daily life adaptive skills. Notably, we detected significant differences between rest and the Hariri task in the S1 connectopies, as well as their projection maps onto the rest of the brain suggesting a task-modulating effect on S1 due to emotion processing. CONCLUSIONS: Variation of daily life adaptive skills appears to be reflected in the brain's mesoscale neural circuitry, as shown by the S1 connectivity profile, which is also differentially modulated during rest and emotional processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aperiodic brain activity and response to anesthesia vary in disorders of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                In the human electroencephalogram (EEG), oscillatory power peaks co-exist with non-oscillatory, aperiodic activity. Although EEG analysis has traditionally focused exclusively on oscillatory power, recent investigations have shown that the aperiodic EEG component can distinguish conscious wakefulness from sleep and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness (Lendner et al. 2020). This study investigates the aperiodic EEG component of individuals in a disorder of consciousness (DOC), and how it changes in response to exposure to anesthesia. High-density EEG was recorded from 43 individuals in a DOC. To measure the brains reaction to global perturbation, a subset of n = 16 were also exposed to a targeted infusion of propofol anesthesia. The aperiodic component was defined by the spectral slope and offset in the 1-45 Hz and 30-45 Hz range of the power spectral density. Brain network criticality and complexity were estimated using the pair correlation function (PCF) and Lempel-Ziv complexity, respectively. The level of responsiveness of all individuals in DOC was assessed using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). Recovery of consciousness was assessed three months post-EEG. At baseline, the EEG aperiodic component was more strongly correlated to the participants level of consciousness than the oscillatory component. Anesthesia caused a steepening of the spectral slope across participants. Importantly, the change in spectral slope positively correlated with the individual participants level of responsiveness. The spectral slope during exposure to anesthesia contained prognostic value for individuals with DOC. The anesthetic-induced change in aperiodic EEG was accompanied by loss of information-richness and a reduction in network criticality. The aperiodic EEG component in individuals with DOC has been historically neglected; this research highlights the importance of considering this measure for future research investigating brain mechanisms underlying consciousness.

                Deficits in axonal transport are one of the earliest pathological outcomes in several models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including SOD1G93A mice. Evidence suggests that rescuing these deficits prevents disease progression, stops denervation, and extends survival. Kinase inhibitors have been previously identified as transport enhancers, and are being investigated as potential therapies for ALS. For example, inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and insulin growth factor receptor 1 have been shown to rescue axonal transport deficits in vivo in symptomatic SOD1G93A mice. In this work, we investigated the impact of RET, the tyrosine kinase receptor for glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), as a modifier of axonal transport. We identified fundamental interplay between RET signalling and axonal transport in both wild type and SOD1G93A motor neurons in vitro. We demonstrated that blockade of RET signalling using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic knockdown enhances signalling endosome transport in wild type motor neurons and uncovered a divergence in the response of primary motor neurons to GDNF compared with cell lines. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of the GDNF-RET signalling axis rescues in vivo transport deficits in early symptomatic SOD1G93A mice, promoting RET as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of ALS.

	<p>As many distributional learning (DL) studies have shown, adult listeners can achieve discrimination of a difficult non-native contrast after a short repetitive exposure to tokens falling at the extremes of that contrast. Such studies have shown using behavioural methods that a short distributional training can induce perceptual learning of vowel and consonant contrasts. However, much less is known about the neurological correlates of DL, and few studies have examined non-native lexical tone contrasts. Here, Australian-English speakers underwent DL training on a Mandarin tone contrast using behavioural (discrimination, identification) and neural (oddball-EEG) tasks, with listeners hearing either a bimodal or a unimodal distribution. Behavioural results show that listeners learned to discriminate tones after both unimodal and bimodal training; while EEG responses revealed more learning for listeners exposed to the bimodal distribution. Thus, perceptual learning through exposure to brief sound distributions (a) extends to non-native tonal contrasts, and (b) is sensitive to task, phonetic distance, and acoustic cue-weighting. Our findings have implications for models of how auditory and phonetic constraints influence speech learning.</p>

	<p>Interdisciplinary research into the underlying neural processes of music therapy (MT) and subjective experiences of patients and therapists are largely lacking. The aim of the current study was to assess the feasibility of newly developed procedures (including electroencephalography/electrocardiography hyperscanning, synchronous audio&amp;amp;ndash;video monitoring, and qualitative interviews) to study the personal experiences and neuronal dynamics of moments of interest during MT with stroke survivors. The feasibility of our mobile setup and procedures as well as their clinical implementation in a rehabilitation centre and an acute hospital ward were tested with four phase C patients. Protocols and interviews were used for the documentation and analysis of the feasibility. Recruiting patients for MT sessions was feasible, although data collection on three consecutive weeks was not always possible due to organisational constraints, especially in the hospital with acute ward routines. Research procedures were successfully implemented, and according to interviews, none of the patients reported any burden, tiredness, or increased stress due to the research procedures, which lasted approx. 3 h (ranging from 135 min to 209 min) for each patient. Implementing the research procedures in a rehabilitation unit with stroke patients was feasible, and only small adaptations were made for further research.</p>

	<p>To perceive, identify and understand the action of others, it is essential to perceptually organize individual and local moving body parts (such as limbs) into the whole configuration of a human body in action. Configural processing&amp;amp;mdash;processing the relations among features or parts of a stimulus&amp;amp;mdash;is a fundamental ability in the perception of several important social stimuli, such as faces or biological motion. Despite this, we know very little about how human infants develop the ability to perceive and prefer configural relations in biological motion. We present two preferential looking experiments (one cross-sectional and one longitudinal) measuring infants&amp;amp;rsquo; preferential attention between a coherent motion configuration of a person walking vs. a scrambled point-light walker (i.e., a stimulus in which all configural relations were removed, thus, in which the perception of a person is impossible). We found that three-month-old infants prefer a coherent point-light walker in relation to a scrambled display, but both five- and seven-month-old infants do not show any preference. We discuss our findings in terms of the different perceptual, attentional, motor, and brain processes available at each age group, and how they dynamically interact with selective attention toward the coherent and socially relevant motion of a person walking during our first year of life.</p>

	<p>Negative affect facilitates conflict processing. Here we sought to assess whether symmetrically, its downregulation by means of reappraisal could lower it. To this end, 105 participants performed the confound-minimized Stroop task eliciting negative affect that was followed by a simple reward-related visual discrimination task. Conflict processing was induced with the former task. Half of them (experimental group) were instructed to use this second task to downregulate negative affect arising from the Stroop task. The other half (control group) did not receive these appraisal-related instructions. Group comparisons showed that negative affect and the conflict effect were similar for these two groups. However, when we added and modeled the subjective ratings related to emotion regulation, we found that conflict processing significantly improved for participants who reported using reappraisal spontaneously, and this gain occurred irrespective of negative affect. These results suggest that reappraisal can influence conflict processing but this change does not depend on negative affect.</p>

	<p> Bilingualism and socio-economic status (SES) differentially affect linguistic and cognitive development. However, less evidence has been collected regarding their impact on literacy trajectories. The present longitudinal study evaluated the literacy development of language minority bilingual children (LMBC) and monolingual peers with different SES. A group of LMBC with low-SES (n = 18) and monolingual peers with low (n = 18) or high (n = 14) SES were followed from 2nd to 5th grade through a set of tasks assessing decoding (words, nonwords, passage), reading, and listening comprehension, and spelling skills. The results showed that all groups achieved better performances over time in all measures, except listening comprehension. However, low-SES LMBC underperformed in spelling tasks compared to the monolingual groups. In reading comprehension, there was a time*group interaction that showed how low-SES LMBC reached similar performances of low-SES monolinguals in fifth grade, but both groups underperformed compared to the high SES monolingual group. The discussion is focused on the need for research and educational settings to consider the differential impact of bilingualism and SES. Bilingualism seems to be associated with a longer time in developing adequate spelling skills, whereas SES was the primary underpinning of the reading comprehension gap over time.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) i a non-invasive brain stimulation which is considered to have the potential to improve cognitive impairment in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). However, previous studies have been controversial on the therapeutic effect of tDCS. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of tDCS on cognitive impairment in patients with MCI and mild-to-moderate AD. Five databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library, were searched with relative terms to extract the cognitive function changes measured by an objective cognitive scale in the included studies. The meta-analysis results showed that, compared with sham tDCS treatment, the overall cognitive function of patients with AD and MCI was significantly improved (weighted mean difference = 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 1.66; p = 0.004) after tDCS treatment, but the behavioral symptoms, recognition memory function, attention and executive function were not significantly improved. The subgroup analysis showed that the treatment would be more efficacious if the temporal-lobe-related brain areas were stimulated, the number of stimulations was greater than or equal to 10 and the current density was 2.5 mA/cm2. Among them, AD patients benefited more than MCI patients. No cognitive improvement was observed in patients with MCI or AD at different follow-up times after treatment. Our meta-analysis provided important evidence for the cognitive enhancement of tDCS in patients with MCI and mild-to-moderate AD and discussed its underlying mechanisms.</p>

	<p>In this review, we evaluate the knowledge gained so far about the neural bases of multilingual language processing obtained mainly through imaging and electrical stimulation mapping (ESM). We attempt to answer some key questions about multilingualism in the light of recent literature evidence, such as the degree of anatomical&amp;amp;ndash;functional integration of two or more languages in a multilingual brain, how the age of L2-acquisition affects language organization in the human brain, or how the brain controls more than one language. Finally, we highlight the future trends in multilingual language mapping.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Interaction of Cue Type and Its Associated Behavioral Response Dissociates the Neural Activity between the Perirhinal and Postrhinal Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The perirhinal cortex (PER) and postrhinal cortex (POR) in the medial temporal lobe are commonly described as two distinct systems that process nonspatial and spatial information, respectively. Recent findings suggest that the two regions exhibit functional overlap when processing stimulus information, especially when associative responses are required in goal-directed behavior. However, we lack the neural correlates of this. In the current study, we recorded spiking activities for single units of the PER and POR as rats were required to choose a response associated with the identity of a visual object or scene stimulus. We found that similar proportions of cells fired selectively for either scene or object between the two regions. In the PER and POR, response-selective neurons showed higher contrast for different responses than stimulus-selective cells did for stimuli. More cells fired selectively for specific choice response in the POR than in the PER. The differential firing patterns of the PER and POR were best explained when the stimulus and response components were considered together: Stimulus-selective cells were modulated more by the response in the POR than in the PER, whereas response-selective cells in the PER were modulated more by object information than by scenes. Our results suggest that in a goal-directed memory task, the information processing in the PER and POR may be dynamically modulated not only by input stimulus information but also by the associated choice behavior and stimulus&ndash;response interaction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Drosophila Tet Is Required for Maintaining Glial Homeostasis in Developing and Adult Fly Brains</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are crucial epigenetic regulators highly conserved in multicellular organisms. TETs&rsquo; enzymatic function in demethylating 5-methyl cytosine in DNA is required for proper development and TETs are frequently mutated in cancer. Recently, <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> Tet (dTet) was shown to be highly expressed in developing fly brains and discovered to play an important role in brain and muscle development as well as fly behavior. Furthermore, dTet was shown to have different substrate specificity compared with mammals. However, the exact role dTet plays in glial cells and how ectopic TET expression in glial cells contributes to tumorigenesis and glioma is still not clear. Here, we report a novel role for dTet specifically in glial cell organization and number. We show that loss of dTet affects the organization of a specific glia population in the optic lobe, the "optic chiasm" glia. Additionally, we find irregularities in axon patterns in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) both, in the midline and longitudinal axons. These morphologic glia and axonal defects were accompanied by locomotor defects in developing larvae escalating to immobility in adult flies. Furthermore, glia homeostasis was disturbed in dTet-deficient brains manifesting in gain of glial cell numbers and increased proliferation. Finally, we establish a <I>Drosophila</I> model to understand the impact of human TET3 in glia and find that ectopic expression of hTET3 in dTet-expressing cells causes glia expansion in larval brains and affects sleep/rest behavior and the circadian clock in adult flies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Characterization of Hypothalamic MCH Neuron Development in a 3D Differentiation System of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons are important regulators of multiple physiological processes, such as sleep, feeding, and memory. Despite the increasing interest in their neuronal functions, the molecular mechanism underlying MCH neuron development remains poorly understood. We report that a three-dimensional culture of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can generate hypothalamic-like tissues containing MCH-positive neurons, which reproduce morphologic maturation, neuronal connectivity, and neuropeptide/neurotransmitter phenotype of native MCH neurons. Using this <I>in vitro</I> system, we demonstrate that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling serves to produce major neurochemical subtypes of MCH neurons characterized by the presence or absence of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). Without exogenous Hh signals, mESCs initially differentiated into dorsal hypothalamic/prethalamic progenitors and finally into MCH<sup>+</sup>CART<sup>+</sup> neurons through a specific intermediate progenitor state. Conversely, activation of the Hh pathway specified ventral hypothalamic progenitors that generate both MCH<sup>+</sup>CART<sup>&ndash;</sup> and MCH<sup>+</sup>CART<sup>+</sup> neurons. These results suggest that <I>in vivo</I> MCH neurons may originate from multiple cell lineages that arise through early dorsoventral patterning of the hypothalamus. Additionally, we found that Hh signaling supports the differentiation of mESCs into orexin/hypocretin neurons, a well-defined cell group intermingled with MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). The present study highlights and improves the utility of mESC culture in the analysis of the developmental programs of specific hypothalamic cell types.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">More Prominent Nonlinear Mixed Selectivity in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal than Posterior Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are activated by different cognitive tasks and respond differently to the same stimuli depending on task. The conjunctive representations of multiple tasks in nonlinear fashion in single neuron activity, is known as nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS). Here, we compared NMS in a working memory task in areas 8a and 46 of the dlPFC and 7a and lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) of the PPC in macaque monkeys. NMS neurons were more frequent in dlPFC than in PPC and this was attributed to more cells gaining selectivity in the course of a trial. Additionally, in our task, the subjects&rsquo; behavioral performance improved within a behavioral session as they learned the session-specific statistics of the task. The magnitude of NMS in the dlPFC also increased as a function of time within a single session. On the other hand, we observed minimal rotation of population responses and no appreciable differences in NMS between correct and error trials in either area. Our results provide direct evidence demonstrating a specialization in NMS between dlPFC and PPC and reveal mechanisms of neural selectivity in areas recruited in working memory tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Menopause status moderates sex differences in tau burden: a Framingham PET Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Women have a higher lifetime risk of AD than men. Among cognitively normal (CN) older adults, women exhibit elevated tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal compared with men. We explored whether menopause exacerbates sex differences in tau deposition in middle-aged adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>328 CN participants from the Framingham Study (mean age=57yrs(±10yrs), 161 women, of whom, 104 were post-menopausal) underwent tau and β-amyloid (Aβ)-PET neuroimaging. We examined global Aβ-PET, and tau-PET signal in five regions identified <i>a priori</i> as demonstrating significant sex differences in older adults (in temporal, inferior parietal, middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions). We examined sex and menopause status-related differences in each region-of-interest, using linear regressions, as well as interactions with Aβ and APOEε4 genotype.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Women exhibited higher tau-PET signal (<i>p</i>&lt;0.002), and global Aβ-PET (<i>p</i>=0.010), than men in inferior parietal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions. Compared with age-matched men, post-menopausal women showed significantly higher tau-PET signal in parieto-occipital regions (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001). By contrast, no differences in tau-PET signal existed between pre-menopausal women and men. Aβ-PET was not associated with menopausal status or age. Neither Aβ-PET nor APOEε4 status moderated sex or menopause associations with tau-PET.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Clear divergence in tauopathy between the sexes are apparent approximately 20 years earlier than previously reported. Menopause status moderated sex differences in Aβ and tau-PET burden, with tau first appearing post-menopause. Sex and menopause differences consistently appeared in middle frontal and parieto-occipital regions but were not moderated by Aβ burden or APOEε4, suggesting that menopause-related tau vulnerability may be independent of AD-related pathways.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human genomics established that pathogenic variation in diverse genes can underlie a single disorder. For example, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is associated with over 80 genes with frequently only few affected individuals described for each gene. Herein, we characterize a large cohort of individuals with biallelic variation in <i>ENTPD1</i>, a gene previously linked to spastic paraplegia 64 (MIM# 615683).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with biallelic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants were recruited worldwide. Deep phenotyping and molecular characterizations were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 27 individuals from 17 unrelated families were studied; additional phenotypic information was collected from published cases. Twelve novel pathogenic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants are described: c.398_399delinsAA; p.(Gly133Glu), c.540del; p.(Thr181Leufs<sup>*</sup>18), c.640del; p.(Gly216Glufs<sup>*</sup>75), c.185T&gt;G; p.(Leu62*), c.1531T&gt;C; p.(*511Glnext<sup>*</sup>100), c.967C&gt;T; p.(Gln323*), c.414-2_414-1del, and c.146 A&gt;G; p.(Tyr49Cys) including four recurrent variants c.1109T&gt;A; p.(Leu370<sup>*</sup>), c.574-6_574-3del, c.770_771del; p.(Gly257Glufs*18), and c.1041del; p.(Ile348Phefs*19). Shared disease traits include: childhood-onset, progressive spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability (ID), dysarthria, and white matter abnormalities. <i>In vitro</i> assays demonstrate that <i>ENTPD1</i> expression and function are impaired and that c.574-6_574-3del causes exon skipping. Global metabolomics demonstrates ENTPD1 deficiency leads to impaired nucleotide, lipid, and energy metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The <i>ENTPD1</i> locus trait consists of childhood disease-onset, ID, progressive spastic paraparesis, dysarthria, dysmorphisms, and white matter abnormalities with some individuals showing neurocognitive regression. Investigation of an allelic series of <i>ENTPD1</i>: i) expands previously described features of <i>ENTPD1</i>-related neurological disease, ii) highlights the importance of genotype-driven deep phenotyping, iii) documents the need for global collaborative efforts to characterize rare AR disease traits, and iv) provides insights into the disease trait neurobiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multi-targeting of K-Ras domains and mutations by peptide and small molecule inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mansour Poorebrahim, Mohammad Foad Abazari, Leila Moradi, Behzad Shahbazi, Reza Mahmoudi, Hourieh Kalhor, Hassan Askari, Ladan Teimoori-Toolabi</p>

K-Ras activating mutations are significantly associated with tumor progression and aggressive metastatic behavior in various human cancers including pancreatic cancer. So far, despite a large number of concerted efforts, targeting of mutant-type K-Ras has not been successful. In this regard, we aimed to target this oncogene by a combinational approach consisting of small peptide and small molecule inhibitors. Based on a comprehensive analysis of structural and physicochemical properties of predominantly K-Ras mutants, an anti-cancer peptide library and a small molecule library were screened to simultaneously target oncogenic mutations and functional domains of mutant-type K-Ras located in the P-loop, switch I, and switch II regions. The selected peptide and small molecule showed notable binding affinities to their corresponding binding sites, and hindered the growth of tumor cells carrying K-Ras<sup>G12D</sup> and K-Ras<sup>G12C</sup> mutations. Of note, the expression of K-Ras downstream genes (i.e., CTNNB1, CCND1) was diminished in the treated Kras-positive cells. In conclusion, our combinational platform signifies a new potential for blockade of oncogenic K-Ras and thereby prevention of tumor progression and metastasis. However, further validations are still required regarding the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> efficacy and safety of this approach.

<p>Rosy bitterling brain at 165 hours postfertilization. Tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT in this very early stage. Three-dimensional visualization with microCT scanning protocols is extremely useful for the study of the rosy bitterling and provides an updating of imaging modalities for morphological and anatomical analyses in this nonmodel organism.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bitterlings are carp-like teleost fish (Cypriniformes: Acheilanathidae) known for their specialized brood parasitic lifestyle. Bitterling embryos, in fact, develop inside the gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts. However, little is known about how their parasitic lifestyle affects brain development in comparison to nonparasitic species. Here, we document the development of the brain of the rosy bitterling, <i>Rhodeus ocellatus</i>, at four embryonic stages of 165, 185, 210, 235 hours postfertilization (hpf) using micro-computed tomography (microCT). Focusing on developmental regionalization and brain ventricular organization, we relate the development of the brain divisions to those described for zebrafish using the prosomeric model as a reference paradigm. Segmentation and three-dimensional visualization of the ventricular system allowed us to identify changes in the longitudinal brain axis as a result of cephalic flexure during development. The results show that during early embryonic and larval development, histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT. The results of this study visualized with differential CT profiles are broadly consistent with comparable histological studies, and with the genoarchitecture of teleosts like the zebrafish. Compared to the zebrafish, our study identifies distinct developmental heterochronies in the rosy bitterling, such as a precocious development of the inferior lobe.</p>

Furthermore, boosting spontaneous activity with optogenetics is sufficient to accelerate visual habituation. This reveals a direct role of spontaneous cortical activity in visual learning.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The basement membrane controls size and integrity of the Drosophila tracheal tubes</a></h4>

              
                Biological tubes are critical units of most organs in metazoans where they perform vital functions. Using the fruit fly tracheal system, Klußmann-Fricke et al. find that the basement membrane component laminin acts as a key regulator of the shaping, positioning, and maintenance of biological tubes.

                Fluck et al. investigate how the activity of TRPV5 is decreased by acidic pH environments and increased by PKA phosphorylation. Combining cryo-EM and electrophysiology, their results show that acidic environments cause channel closing and loss of PI(4,5)P2 binding, whereas PKA phosphorylation disrupts CaM inactivation.

                Using structural, biochemical, and sequencing analyses, Wang et al. demonstrate that RPAP2 stably associates with Pol II, disrupts Pol II-TFIIF interaction, and inhibits transcription initiation. This study suggests a transcription pre-initiation checkpoint, in which RPAP2 functions as a gatekeeper to inhibit pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly and transcription initiation.

                Combining single-molecule experimentation with computational modeling, Janissen et al. capture Escherichia coli RNAp-pausing dynamics on timescales from milliseconds to hours. They identify two long-lived pause states that compete with elongation and recover via nascent RNA cleavage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cohesin-dependence of neuronal gene expression relates to chromatin loop length</a></h4>

              
                Cohesin and CTCF are major drivers of 3D genome organization, but their role in neurons is still emerging. Here we show a prominent role for cohesin in the expression of genes that facilitate neuronal maturation and homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we observed two major classes of activity-regulated genes with distinct reliance on cohesin in mouse primary cortical neurons. Immediate early genes remained fully inducible by KCl and BDNF, and short-range enhancer-promoter contacts at the Immediate early gene <i>Fos</i> formed robustly in the absence of cohesin. In contrast, cohesin was required for full expression of a subset of secondary response genes characterised by long-range chromatin contacts. Cohesin-dependence of constitutive neuronal genes with key functions in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter signaling also scaled with chromatin loop length. Our data demonstrate that key genes required for the maturation and activation of primary cortical neurons depend on cohesin for their full expression, and that the degree to which these genes rely on cohesin scales with the genomic distance traversed by their chromatin contacts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microtubule assembly by soluble tau impairs vesicle endocytosis and excitatory neurotransmission via dynamin sequestration in Alzheimer's disease mice synapse model</a></h4>

              
                Elevation of soluble wild-type (WT) tau occurs in synaptic compartments in Alzheimer's disease. We addressed whether tau elevation affects synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held in slices from mice brainstem. Whole-cell loading of WT human tau (h-tau) in presynaptic terminals at 10-20 µM caused microtubule (MT) assembly and activity-dependent rundown of excitatory neurotransmission. Capacitance measurements revealed that the primary target of WT h-tau is vesicle endocytosis. Blocking MT assembly using nocodazole prevented tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. Immunofluorescence imaging analyses revealed that MT assembly by WT h-tau loading was associated with an increased MT-bound fraction of the endocytic protein dynamin. A synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to dynamin-1-pleckstrin-homology domain inhibited MT-dynamin interaction and rescued tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. We conclude that elevation of presynaptic WT tau induces <i>de novo</i> assembly of MTs, thereby sequestering free dynamins. As a result, endocytosis and subsequent vesicle replenishment are impaired, causing activity-dependent rundown of neurotransmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neutrophil extracellular traps arm DC vaccination against NPM-mutant myeloproliferation</a></h4>

              
                Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) are web-like chromatin structures composed by dsDNA and histones, decorated with anti-microbial proteins. Their interaction with dendritic cells (DC) allows DC activation and maturation toward presentation of NET-associated antigens. Differently from other types of cell death that imply protein denaturation, NETosis preserves the proteins localized onto the DNA threads for proper enzymatic activity and conformational status, including immunogenic epitopes. Besides neutrophils, leukemic cells can release extracellular traps displaying leukemia-associated antigens, prototypically mutant nucleophosmin (NPMc+) that upon mutation translocates from nucleolus to the cytoplasm localizing onto NET threads. We tested NPMc+ immunogenicity through a NET/DC vaccine to treat NPMc-driven myeloproliferation in transgenic and transplantable models. Vaccination with DC loaded with NPMc+ NET (NPMc+ NET/DC) reduced myeloproliferation in transgenic mice, favoring the development of antibodies to mutant NPMc and and the induction of a CD8+ T cell response. The efficacy of this vaccine was also tested in mixed NPMc/WT bone marrow chimeras in a competitive bone marrow transplantation setting, where the NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination impaired the expansion of NPMc+ in favor of WT myeloid compartment. NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination also achieved control of an aggressive leukemia transduced with mutant NPMc, effectively inducing an anti-leukemia CD8 T cell memory response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analysis of rod/cone gap junctions from the reconstruction of mouse photoreceptor terminals</a></h4>

              
                Electrical coupling, mediated by gap junctions, contributes to signal averaging, synchronization and noise reduction in neuronal circuits. In addition, gap junctions may also provide alternative neuronal pathways. However, because they are small and especially difficult to image, gap junctions are often ignored in large-scale 3D reconstructions. Here, we reconstruct gap junctions between photoreceptors in the mouse retina, using serial blockface-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and confocal microscopy for the gap junction protein Cx36. An exuberant spray of fine telodendria extends from each cone pedicle (including blue cones) to contact 40-50 nearby rod spherules at sites of Cx36 labeling, with approximately 50 Cx36 clusters per cone pedicle and 2-3 per rod spherule. We were unable to detect rod/rod or cone/cone coupling. Thus, rod/cone coupling accounts for nearly all gap junctions between photoreceptors. We estimate a mean of 86 Cx36 channels per rod/cone pair, which may provide a maximum conductance of ~ 1200 pS, if all gap junction channels were open. This is comparable to the maximum conductance previously measured between rod/cone pairs in the presence of a dopamine antagonist to activate Cx36, suggesting the open probability of gap junction channels can approach 100% under certain conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Opioid analgesia alters corticospinal coupling along the descending pain system in healthy participants</a></h4>

              
                Opioids are potent analgesic drugs with widespread cortical, subcortical, and spinal targets. In particular, the central pain system comprising ascending and descending pain pathways has high opioid receptor densities and is thus crucial for opioid analgesia. Here, we investigated the effects of the opioid remifentanil in a large sample (n = 78) of healthy male participants using combined corticospinal functional MRI. This approach offers the possibility to measure BOLD responses simultaneously in the brain and spinal cord, allowing us to investigate the role of corticospinal coupling in opioid analgesia. Our data show that opioids altered activity in regions involved in pain processing such as somatosensory regions, including the spinal cord and pain modulation such as prefrontal regions. Moreover, coupling strength along the descending pain system, that is, between the anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, and spinal cord, was stronger in participants who reported stronger analgesia during opioid treatment while participants that received saline showed reduced coupling when experiencing less pain. These results indicate that coupling along the descending pain pathway is a potential mechanism of opioid analgesia and can differentiate between opioid analgesia and unspecific reductions in pain such as habituation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A transcriptomic atlas of Aedes aegypti reveals detailed functional organization of major body parts and gut regional specializations in sugar-fed and blood-fed adult females</a></h4>

              
                Mosquito vectors transmit numerous pathogens, but large gaps remain in our understanding of their physiology. To facilitate future explorations of mosquito biology, with specific attention to the major vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, we have created Aegypti-Atlas (http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/), an online resource hosting RNAseq profiles of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> body parts (head, thorax, abdomen, gut, Malpighian tubules, and ovaries), gut regions (crop, proventriculus, anterior and posterior midgut, and hindgut), and a time course of blood meal digestion in the gut. Using Aegypti-Atlas, we provide new insights into the regionalization of gut function, blood feeding response, and immune defenses. We find that the anterior and posterior regions of the mosquito midgut possess clearly delineated digestive specializations which are preserved in the blood-fed state. Blood feeding initiates the sequential transcriptional induction and repression/depletion of multiple cohorts of peptidases throughout blood meal digestion. With respect to defense, immune signaling components, but not recognition or effector molecules, show enrichment in ovaries. Basal expression of antimicrobial peptides is dominated by two genes, holotricin and gambicin, that are expressed in the carcass and the digestive tissues, respectively, in a near mutually exclusive manner. In the midgut, gambicin and other immune effector genes are almost exclusively expressed in the anterior regions, while the posterior midgut exhibits the hallmarks of immune tolerance. Finally, in a cross-species comparison between the midguts of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> (<i>s.l.</i>), we observe that regional digestive and immune specializations are closely conserved, indicating that our data may yield inferences that are broadly relevant to multiple mosquito vector species. We further demonstrate that the expression of orthologous genes is highly correlated, with the exception of a ‘species signature’ comprising a small number of highly/disparately expressed genes. With this work, we show the potential of Aegypti-Atlas to unlock a more complete understanding of mosquito biology.
