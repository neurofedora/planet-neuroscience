                Genomic structural variants (SVs) can play important roles in adaptation and speciation. Yet the overall fitness effects of SVs are poorly understood, partly because accurate population-level identification of SVs requires multiple high-quality genome assemblies. Here, we use 31 chromosome-scale, haplotype-resolved genome assemblies of Theobroma cacao—an outcrossing, long-lived tree species that...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ventral pallidum (VP) is the major downstream nucleus of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Both VP and NAc neurons are responsive to reward-predictive stimuli and are critical drivers of reward-seeking behavior. The cue-evoked excitations and inhibitions of NAc neurons predict the vigor (latency and speed) of the cue-elicited locomotor approach response and encode the animal&rsquo;s proximity to the movement target, but do not encode more specific movement features such as turn direction. VP neurons also encode certain vigor parameters, but it remains unknown whether they also encode more specific movement features, and whether such encoding could account for vigor encoding. To address these questions, we recorded the firing of neurons in the VP of freely moving male rats performing a discriminative stimulus (DS) task. Similar to NAc neurons, VP neurons&rsquo; cue-evoked excitations were correlated with the speed of the upcoming approach movement and the animal&rsquo;s proximity to the movement target at cue onset. Unlike NAc neurons, VP neurons&rsquo; firing reflected the efficiency of the approach movement path but not the latency to initiate locomotion. VP cue-evoked excitations are unlikely to be directly influenced by NAc cue-evoked excitations because unilateral treatment of the NAc with a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, a manipulation that reduces NAc neurons&rsquo; cue-evoked excitations, did not alter ipsilateral VP cue-evoked excitations. These observations suggest that the two structures receive simultaneous activation by inputs conveying similar but not identical information, and work in parallel to set the vigor of the behavioral response.</p>

<p>Neurocognitive impairment is present in cirrhosis and may be more severe in cirrhosis with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). Liver transplantation (LT) can restore liver function, but how it reverses the impaired brain function is still unclear. MRI of resting-state functional connectivity can help reveal the underlying mechanisms that lead to these cognitive deficits and cognitive recovery. In this study, 64 patients with cirrhosis (28 with OHE; 36 without OHE) and 32 healthy control subjects were recruited for resting-state fMRI. The patients were scanned before and after LT. We evaluated presurgical and postsurgical neurocognitive performance in cirrhosis patients using psychomotor tests. Network-based statistics found significant disrupted connectivity in both groups of cirrhotic patients, with OHE and without OHE, compared with control subjects. However, the presurgical connectivity disruption in patients with OHE affected a greater number of connections than those without OHE. The decrease in functional connectivity for both OHE and non-OHE patient groups was reversed after LT to the level of control subjects. An additional hyperconnected network (i.e., higher connected than control subjects) was observed in OHE patients after LT. Regarding the neural&ndash;behavior relationship, the functional network that predicted cognitive performance in healthy individuals showed no correlation in presurgical cirrhotic patients. The impaired neural&ndash;behavior relationship was re-established after LT for non-OHE patients, but not for OHE patients. OHE patients displayed abnormal hyperconnectivity and a persistently impaired neural&ndash;behavior relationship after LT. Our results suggest that patients with OHE may undergo a different trajectory of postsurgical neurofunctional recovery compared with those without, which needs further clarification in future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Cre-Dependent CRISPR/dCas9 System for Gene Expression Regulation in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Site-specific genetic and epigenetic targeting of distinct cell populations is a central goal in molecular neuroscience and is crucial to understand the gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie complex phenotypes and behaviors. While recent technological advances have enabled unprecedented control over gene expression, many of these approaches are focused on selected model organisms and/or require labor-intensive customization for different applications. The simplicity and modularity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based systems have transformed genome editing and expanded the gene regulatory toolbox. However, there are few available tools for cell-selective CRISPR regulation in neurons. We designed, validated, and optimized CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) systems for Cre recombinase-dependent gene regulation. Unexpectedly, CRISPRa systems based on a traditional double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) strategy exhibited leaky target gene induction even without Cre. Therefore, we developed an intron-containing Cre-dependent CRISPRa system (SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR) that alleviated leaky gene induction and outperformed the traditional DIO system at endogenous genes in HEK293T cells and rat primary neuron cultures. Using gene-specific CRISPR sgRNAs, we demonstrate that SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR can activate numerous rat or human genes (<I>GRM2</I>, <I>Tent5b</I>, <I>Fos</I>, <I>Sstr2</I>, and <I>Gadd45b</I>) in a Cre-specific manner. To illustrate the versatility of this tool, we created a parallel CRISPRi construct that successfully inhibited expression from a luciferase reporter in HEK293T cells only in the presence of Cre. These results provide a robust framework for Cre-dependent CRISPR-dCas9 approaches across different model systems, and enable cell-specific targeting when combined with common Cre driver lines or Cre delivery via viral vectors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Expression Levels of Sox9 in Early Neocortical Radial Glial Cells Regulate the Decision between Stem Cell Maintenance and Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Radial glial progenitor cells (RGCs) in the dorsal telencephalon directly or indirectly produce excitatory projection neurons and macroglia of the neocortex. Recent evidence shows that the pool of RGCs is more heterogeneous than originally thought and that progenitor subpopulations can generate particular neuronal cell types. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we have studied gene expression patterns of RGCs with different neurogenic behavior at early stages of cortical development. At this early age, some RGCs rapidly produce postmitotic neurons, whereas others self-renew and undergo neurogenic divisions at a later age. We have identified candidate genes that are differentially expressed among these early RGC subpopulations, including the transcription factor Sox9. Using <I>in utero</I> electroporation in embryonic mice of either sex, we demonstrate that elevated Sox9 expression in progenitors affects RGC cell cycle duration and leads to the generation of upper layer cortical neurons. Our data thus reveal molecular differences between progenitor cells with different neurogenic behavior at early stages of corticogenesis and indicates that Sox9 is critical for the maintenance of RGCs to regulate the generation of upper layer neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The existence of heterogeneity in the pool of RGCs and its relationship with the generation of cellular diversity in the cerebral cortex has been an interesting topic of debate for many years. Here we describe the existence of RGCs with reduced neurogenic behavior at early embryonic ages presenting a particular molecular signature. This molecular signature consists of differential expression of some genes including the transcription factor Sox9, which has been found to be a specific regulator of this subpopulation of progenitor cells. Functional experiments perturbing expression levels of Sox9 reveal its instructive role in the regulation of the neurogenic behavior of RGCs and its relationship with the generation of upper layer projection neurons at later ages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Carboxypeptidase E Regulates Activity-Dependent TrkB Neuronal Surface Insertion and Hippocampal Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Activity-dependent insertion of the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor into the plasma membrane can explain, in part, the preferential effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on active neurons and synapses; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we report a novel function for carboxypeptidase E (CPE) in controlling chemical long-term potentiation stimuli-induced TrkB surface delivery in hippocampal neurons. Total internal reflection fluorescence assays and line plot assays showed that CPE facilitates TrkB transport from dendritic shafts to the plasma membrane. The Box2 domain in the juxtamembrane region of TrkB and the C terminus of CPE are critical for the activity-dependent plasma membrane insertion of TrkB. Moreover, the transactivator of transcription TAT-CPE<sup>452-466</sup>, which could block the association between CPE and TrkB, significantly inhibited neuronal activity-enhanced BDNF signaling and dendritic spine morphologic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons. Microinfusion of TAT-CPE<sup>452-466</sup> into the dorsal hippocampus of male C57BL/6 mice inhibited the endogenous interaction between TrkB and CPE and diminished fear-conditioning-induced TrkB phosphorylation, which might lead to an impairment in hippocampal memory acquisition and consolidation but not retrieval. These results suggest that CPE modulates activity-induced TrkB surface insertion and hippocampal-dependent memory and sheds light on our understanding of the role of CPE in TrkB-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory modulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that BDNF acts preferentially on active neurons; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of CPE could interact with TrkB and facilitate the neuronal activity-dependent movement of TrkB vesicles to the plasma membrane. Blocking the association between CPE and TrkB decreased fear-conditioning-induced TrkB phosphorylation and led to hippocampal memory deficits. These findings provide novel insights into the role of CPE in TrkB intracellular trafficking as well as in mediating BDNF/TrkB function in synaptic plasticity and hippocampal memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Ultrastructural Changes in the PSD and Surrounding Membrane after Induction of Structural LTP in Single Dendritic Spines</a></h4>

              
                <p>The structural plasticity of dendritic spines is considered to be an important basis of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Here, we induced input-specific structural LTP (sLTP) in single dendritic spines in organotypic hippocampal slices from mice of either sex and performed ultrastructural analyses of the spines using efficient correlative light and electron microscopy. We observed reorganization of the PSD nanostructure, such as perforation and segmentation, at 2&ndash;3, 20, and 120 min after sLTP induction. In addition, PSD and nonsynaptic axon&ndash;spine interface (nsASI) membrane expanded unevenly during sLTP. Specifically, the PSD area showed a transient increase at 2&ndash;3 min after sLTP induction. The PSD growth was to a degree less than spine volume growth at 2&ndash;3 min and 20 min after sLTP induction but became similar at 120 min. On the other hand, the nsASI area showed a profound and lasting expansion, to a degree similar to spine volume growth throughout the process. These rapid ultrastructural changes in PSD and surrounding membrane may contribute to rapid electrophysiological plasticity during sLTP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To understand the ultrastructural changes during synaptic plasticity, it is desired to efficiently image single dendritic spines that underwent structural plasticity in electron microscopy. We induced structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) in single dendritic spines by two-photon glutamate uncaging. We then identified the same spines at different phases of sLTP and performed ultrastructural analysis by using an efficient correlative light and electron microscopy method. We found that postsynaptic density undergoes dramatic modification in its structural complexity immediately after sLTP induction. Meanwhile, the nonsynaptic axon&ndash;spine interface area shows a rapid and sustained increase throughout sLTP. Our results indicate that the uneven modification of synaptic and nonsynaptic postsynaptic membrane might contribute to rapid electrophysiological plasticity during sLTP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Regional White Matter Scaling in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anatomical organization of the primate cortex varies as a function of total brain size, where possession of a larger brain is accompanied by disproportionate expansion of associative cortices alongside a relative contraction of sensorimotor systems. However, equivalent scaling maps are not yet available for regional white matter anatomy. Here, we use three large-scale neuroimaging datasets to examine how regional white matter volume (WMV) scales with interindividual variation in brain volume among typically developing humans (combined <I>N</I> = 2391: 1247 females, 1144 males). We show that WMV scaling is regionally heterogeneous: larger brains have relatively greater WMV in anterior and posterior regions of cortical white matter, as well as the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, but relatively less WMV in most subcortical regions. Furthermore, regions of positive WMV scaling tend to connect previously-defined regions of positive gray matter scaling in the cortex, revealing a coordinated coupling of regional gray and white matter organization with naturally occurring variations in human brain size. However, we also show that two commonly studied measures of white matter microstructure, fractional anisotropy (FA) and magnetization transfer (MT), scale negatively with brain size, and do so in a manner that is spatially unlike WMV scaling. Collectively, these findings provide a more complete view of anatomic scaling in the human brain, and offer new contexts for the interpretation of regional white matter variation in health and disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent work has shown that, in humans, regional cortical and subcortical anatomy show systematic changes as a function of brain size variation. Here, we show that regional white matter structures also show brain-size related changes in humans. Specifically, white matter regions connecting higher-order cortical systems are relatively expanded in larger human brains, while subcortical and cerebellar white matter tracts responsible for unimodal sensory or motor functions are relatively contracted. This regional scaling of white matter volume (WMV) is coordinated with regional scaling of cortical anatomy, but is distinct from scaling of white matter microstructure. These findings provide a more complete view of anatomic scaling of the human brain, with relevance for evolutionary, basic, and clinical neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disengagement of Motor Cortex during Long-Term Learning Tracks the Performance Level of Learned Movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>Not all movements require the motor cortex for execution. Intriguingly, dependence on motor cortex of a given movement is not fixed, but instead can dynamically change over the course of long-term learning. For instance, rodent forelimb movements that initially require motor cortex can become independent of the motor cortex after an extended period of training. However, it remains unclear whether long-term neural changes rendering the motor cortex dispensable are a simple function of the training length. To address this issue, we trained mice (both male and female) to perform two distinct forelimb movements, forward versus downward reaches with a joystick, concomitantly over several weeks, and then compared the involvement of the motor cortex between the two movements. Most mice achieved different levels of motor performance between the two movements after long-term training. Of the two movements, the one that achieved higher trial-to-trial consistency (i.e., consistent-direction movement) was significantly less affected by inactivation of motor cortex than the other (i.e., variable-direction movement). Two-photon calcium imaging of motor cortical neurons revealed that the consistent-direction movement activates fewer neurons, producing weaker and less consistent population activity than the variable-direction movement. Together, the motor cortex was less engaged and less necessary for learned movements that achieved higher levels of consistency. Thus, the long-term reorganization of neural circuits that frees the motor cortex from the learned movement is not a mere function of training length. Rather, this reorganization tracks the level of motor performance that the animal achieves during training.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long-term training of a movement reshapes motor circuits, disengaging motor cortex potentially for automatized execution of the learned movement. Acquiring new motor skills often involves learning of multiple movements (e.g., forehand and backhand strokes when learning tennis), but different movements do not always improve at the same time nor reach the same level of proficiency. Here we showed that the involvement of motor cortex after long-term training differs between similar yet distinct movements that reached different levels of expertise. Motor cortex was less engaged and less necessary for the more proficient movement. Thus, disengagement of motor cortex is not a simple function of training time, but instead tracks the level of expertise of a learned movement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sparse Coding in Temporal Association Cortex Improves Complex Sound Discriminability</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mouse auditory cortex is comprised of several auditory fields spanning the dorsoventral axis of the temporal lobe. The ventral most auditory field is the temporal association cortex (TeA), which remains largely unstudied. Using Neuropixels probes, we simultaneously recorded from primary auditory cortex (AUDp), secondary auditory cortex (AUDv), and TeA, characterizing neuronal responses to pure tones and frequency modulated (FM) sweeps in awake head-restrained female mice. As compared with AUDp and AUDv, single-unit (SU) responses to pure tones in TeA were sparser, delayed, and prolonged. Responses to FMs were also sparser. Population analysis showed that the sparser responses in TeA render it less sensitive to pure tones, yet more sensitive to FMs. When characterizing responses to pure tones under anesthesia, the distinct signature of TeA was changed considerably as compared with that in awake mice, implying that responses in TeA are strongly modulated by non-feedforward connections. Together, these findings provide a basic electrophysiological description of TeA as an integral part of sound processing along the cortical hierarchy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first comprehensive characterization of the auditory responses in the awake mouse auditory temporal association cortex (TeA). The study provides the foundations for further investigation of TeA and its involvement in auditory learning, plasticity, auditory driven behaviors etc. The study was conducted using state of the art data collection tools, allowing for simultaneous recording from multiple cortical regions and numerous neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rhythmic Modulation of Visual Perception by Continuous Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>At any given moment our sensory systems receive multiple, often rhythmic, inputs from the environment. Processing of temporally structured events in one sensory modality can guide both behavioral and neural processing of events in other sensory modalities, but whether this occurs remains unclear. Here, we used human electroencephalography (EEG) to test the cross-modal influences of a continuous auditory frequency-modulated (FM) sound on visual perception and visual cortical activity. We report systematic fluctuations in perceptual discrimination of brief visual stimuli in line with the phase of the FM-sound. We further show that this rhythmic modulation in visual perception is related to an accompanying rhythmic modulation of neural activity recorded over visual areas. Importantly, in our task, perceptual and neural visual modulations occurred without any abrupt and salient onsets in the energy of the auditory stimulation and without any rhythmic structure in the visual stimulus. As such, the results provide a critical validation for the existence and functional role of cross-modal entrainment and demonstrates its utility for organizing the perception of multisensory stimulation in the natural environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our sensory environment is filled with rhythmic structures that are often multi-sensory in nature. Here, we show that the alignment of neural activity to the phase of an auditory frequency-modulated (FM) sound has cross-modal consequences for vision: yielding systematic fluctuations in perceptual discrimination of brief visual stimuli that are mediated by accompanying rhythmic modulation of neural activity recorded over visual areas. These cross-modal effects on visual neural activity and perception occurred without any abrupt and salient onsets in the energy of the auditory stimulation and without any rhythmic structure in the visual stimulus. The current work shows that continuous auditory fluctuations in the natural environment can provide a pacing signal for neural activity and perception across the senses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Dynamics of Brain White Matter Plasticity in Sighted Subjects during Tactile Braille Learning: A Longitudinal Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>The white matter (WM) architecture of the human brain changes in response to training, though fine-grained temporal characteristics of training-induced white matter plasticity remain unexplored. We investigated white matter microstructural changes using diffusion tensor imaging at five different time points in 26 sighted female adults during 8 months of training on tactile braille reading. Our results show that training-induced white matter plasticity occurs both within and beyond the trained sensory modality, as reflected by fractional anisotropy (FA) increases in somatosensory and visual cortex, respectively. The observed changes followed distinct time courses, with gradual linear FA increase along the training in the somatosensory cortex and sudden visual cortex cross-modal plasticity occurring after braille input became linguistically meaningful. WM changes observed in these areas returned to baseline after the cessation of learning in line with the supply&ndash;demand model of plasticity. These results also indicate that the temporal dynamics of microstructural plasticity in different cortical regions might be modulated by the nature of computational demands. We provide additional evidence that observed FA training-induced changes are behaviorally relevant to tactile reading. Together, these results demonstrate that WM plasticity is a highly dynamic process modulated by the introduction of novel experiences.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Throughout the lifetime the human brain is shaped by various experiences. Training-induced reorganization in white matter (WM) microstructure has been reported, but we know little about its temporal dynamics. To fill this gap, we scanned sighted subjects five times during tactile braille reading training. We observed different dynamics of WM plasticity in the somatosensory and visual cortices implicated in braille reading. The former showed a continuous increase in WM tissue anisotropy along with tactile training, while microstructural changes in the latter were observed only after the participants learned to read braille words. Our results confirm the supply&ndash;demand model of brain plasticity and provide evidence that WM reorganization depends on distinct computational demands and functional roles of regions involved in the trained skill.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">G-Protein-Gated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium (Kir3/GIRK) Channels Govern Synaptic Plasticity That Supports Hippocampal-Dependent Cognitive Functions in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir3/GIRK) channel is the effector of many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Its dysfunction has been linked to the pathophysiology of Down syndrome, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, drug addiction, or alcoholism. In the hippocampus, GIRK channels decrease excitability of the cells and contribute to resting membrane potential and inhibitory neurotransmission. Here, to elucidate the role of GIRK channels activity in the maintenance of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions, their involvement in controlling neuronal excitability at different levels of complexity was examined in C57BL/6 male mice. For that purpose, GIRK activity in the dorsal hippocampus CA3&ndash;CA1 synapse was pharmacologically modulated by two drugs: ML297, a GIRK channel opener, and Tertiapin-Q (TQ), a GIRK channel blocker. <I>Ex vivo</I>, using dorsal hippocampal slices, we studied the effect of pharmacological GIRK modulation on synaptic plasticity processes induced in CA1 by Schaffer collateral stimulation. <I>In vivo</I>, we performed acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of the two GIRK modulators to study their contribution to electrophysiological properties and synaptic plasticity of dorsal hippocampal CA3&ndash;CA1 synapse, and to learning and memory capabilities during hippocampal-dependent tasks. We found that pharmacological disruption of GIRK channel activity by i.c.v. injections, causing either function gain or function loss, induced learning and memory deficits by a mechanism involving neural excitability impairments and alterations in the induction and maintenance of long-term synaptic plasticity processes. These results support the contention that an accurate control of GIRK activity must take place in the hippocampus to sustain cognitive functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive processes of learning and memory that rely on hippocampal synaptic plasticity processes are critically ruled by a finely tuned neural excitability. G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels play a key role in maintaining resting membrane potential, cell excitability and inhibitory neurotransmission. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of GIRK channels activity, causing either function gain or function loss, transforms high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) into long-term depression (LTD), inducing deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Together, our data show a crucial GIRK-activity-mediated mechanism that governs synaptic plasticity direction and modulates subsequent hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Untangling the Animacy Organization of Occipitotemporal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the most impressive functional specializations in the human brain are found in the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), where several areas exhibit selectivity for a small number of visual categories, such as faces and bodies, and spatially cluster based on stimulus animacy. Previous studies suggest this animacy organization reflects the representation of an intuitive taxonomic hierarchy, distinct from the presence of face- and body-selective areas in OTC. Using human functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the independent contribution of these two factors&mdash;the face-body division and taxonomic hierarchy&mdash;in accounting for the animacy organization of OTC and whether they might also be reflected in the architecture of several deep neural networks that have not been explicitly trained to differentiate taxonomic relations. We found that graded visual selectivity, based on animal resemblance to human faces and bodies, masquerades as an apparent animacy continuum, which suggests that taxonomy is not a separate factor underlying the organization of the ventral visual pathway.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Portions of the visual cortex are specialized to determine whether types of objects are animate in the sense of being capable of self-movement. Two factors have been proposed as accounting for this animacy organization: representations of faces and bodies and an intuitive taxonomic continuum of humans and animals. We performed an experiment to assess the independent contribution of both of these factors. We found that graded visual representations, based on animal resemblance to human faces and bodies, masquerade as an apparent animacy continuum, suggesting that taxonomy is not a separate factor underlying the organization of areas in the visual cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Strategic Distractor Suppression Improves Selective Control in Human Vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>Our visual environment is complicated, and our cognitive capacity is limited. As a result, we must strategically ignore some stimuli to prioritize others. Common sense suggests that foreknowledge of distractor characteristics, like location or color, might help us ignore these objects. But empirical studies have provided mixed evidence, often showing that knowing about a distractor before it appears counterintuitively leads to its attentional selection. What has looked like strategic distractor suppression in the past is now commonly explained as a product of prior experience and implicit statistical learning, and the long-standing notion the distractor suppression is reflected in &alpha; band oscillatory brain activity has been challenged by results appearing to link &alpha; to target resolution. Can we strategically, proactively suppress distractors? And, if so, does this involve &alpha;? Here, we use the concurrent recording of human EEG and eye movements in optimized experimental designs to identify behavior and brain activity associated with proactive distractor suppression. Results from three experiments show that knowing about distractors before they appear causes a reduction in electrophysiological indices of covert attentional selection of these objects and a reduction in the overt deployment of the eyes to the location of the objects. This control is established before the distractor appears and is predicted by the power of cue-elicited &alpha; activity over the visual cortex. Foreknowledge of distractor characteristics therefore leads to improved selective control, and &alpha; oscillations in visual cortex reflect the implementation of this strategic, proactive mechanism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To behave adaptively and achieve goals we often need to ignore visual distraction. Is it easier to ignore distracting objects when we know more about them? We recorded eye movements and electrical brain activity to determine whether foreknowledge of distractor characteristics can be used to limit processing of these objects. Results show that knowing the location or color of a distractor stops us from attentionally selecting it. A neural signature of this inhibition emerges in oscillatory alpha band brain activity, and when this signal is strong, selective processing of the distractor decreases. Knowing about the characteristics of task-irrelevant distractors therefore increases our ability to focus on task-relevant information, in this way gating information processing in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Modulation of the Primary Auditory Thalamus When Recognizing Speech with Background Noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recognizing speech in background noise is a strenuous daily activity, yet most humans can master it. An explanation of how the human brain deals with such sensory uncertainty during speech recognition is to-date missing. Previous work has shown that recognition of speech without background noise involves modulation of the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body; MGB): there are higher responses in left MGB for speech recognition tasks that require tracking of fast-varying stimulus properties in contrast to relatively constant stimulus properties (e.g., speaker identity tasks) despite the same stimulus input. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (1) this task-dependent modulation for speech recognition increases in parallel with the sensory uncertainty in the speech signal, i.e., the amount of background noise; and that (2) this increase is present in the ventral MGB, which corresponds to the primary sensory part of the auditory thalamus. In accordance with our hypothesis, we show, by using ultra-high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in male and female human participants, that the task-dependent modulation of the left ventral MGB (vMGB) for speech is particularly strong when recognizing speech in noisy listening conditions in contrast to situations where the speech signal is clear. The results imply that speech in noise recognition is supported by modifications at the level of the subcortical sensory pathway providing driving input to the auditory cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Speech recognition in noisy environments is a challenging everyday task. One reason why humans can master this task is the recruitment of additional cognitive resources as reflected in recruitment of non-language cerebral cortex areas. Here, we show that also modulation in the primary sensory pathway is specifically involved in speech in noise recognition. We found that the left primary sensory thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body; vMGB) is more involved when recognizing speech signals as opposed to a control task (speaker identity recognition) when heard in background noise versus when the noise was absent. This finding implies that the brain optimizes sensory processing in subcortical sensory pathway structures in a task-specific manner to deal with speech recognition in noisy environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Gliopeptide ODN, a Ligand for the Benzodiazepine Site of GABAA Receptors, Boosts Functional Recovery after Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following stroke, the survival of neurons and their ability to reestablish connections is critical to functional recovery. This is strongly influenced by the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. In the acute phase of experimental stroke, lethal hyperexcitability can be attenuated by positive allosteric modulation of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs). Conversely, in the late phase, negative allosteric modulation of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R can correct the suboptimal excitability and improves both sensory and motor recovery. Here, we hypothesized that octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), an endogenous allosteric modulator of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R synthesized by astrocytes, influences the outcome of ischemic brain tissue and subsequent functional recovery. We show that ODN boosts the excitability of cortical neurons, which makes it deleterious in the acute phase of stroke. However, if delivered after day 3, ODN is safe and improves motor recovery over the following month in two different paradigms of experimental stroke in mice. Furthermore, we bring evidence that, during the subacute period after stroke, the repairing cortex can be treated with ODN by means of a single hydrogel deposit into the stroke cavity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stroke remains a devastating clinical challenge because there is no efficient therapy to either minimize neuronal death with neuroprotective drugs or to enhance spontaneous recovery with neurorepair drugs. Around the brain damage, the peri-infarct cortex can be viewed as a reservoir of plasticity. However, the potential of wiring new circuits in these areas is restrained by a chronic excess of GABAergic inhibition. Here we show that an astrocyte-derived peptide, can be used as a delayed treatment, to safely correct cortical excitability and facilitate sensorimotor recovery after stroke.</p>

                The world is currently dealing with one of the most severe health, economic and social crises in recent memory, through coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Scholars are converging on the perspective that traditional means of addressing these crises have served their time. On the additional backdrop of a global political landscape in transition, realising a post-pandemic recovery will require new modes of international collaboration with scientific knowledge and expertise figuring more prominently. A smart approach to science diplomacy—to global resilience through knowledge-based cooperation—does not prescribe the content, but rather focuses on the process of science-based international exchange. The new Protocol for Science Diplomacy presented in this policy brief inspires the alignment of shared, cosmopolitan interests and their application to cross-border societal challenges. It comprises a set of 12 procedural and infrastructural principles with which actors can create a space for constructive and productive science diplomacy interactions. These principles are: sensitivity; inclusiveness; transparency; deliberation; reciprocity; complementarity & manoeuvrability; legitimacy; alignment; evaluation; capacities; capabilities; trust. Our Protocol for Science Diplomacy identifies ground rules for international scientific and policy collaboration that enable us, inter alia, to make meaningful steps towards tackling the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by their 2030 deadline. As such, it offers a roadmap for science diplomacy in the next decade and beyond.

                <p>by Indie C. Garwood, Sourish Chakravarty, Jacob Donoghue, Meredith Mahnke, Pegah Kahali, Shubham Chamadia, Oluwaseun Akeju, Earl K. Miller, Emery N. Brown</p>

Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist commonly used to maintain general anesthesia. At anesthetic doses, ketamine causes high power gamma (25-50 Hz) oscillations alternating with slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations. These dynamics are readily observed in local field potentials (LFPs) of non-human primates (NHPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from human subjects. However, a detailed statistical analysis of these dynamics has not been reported. We characterize ketamine’s neural dynamics using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM observations are sequences of spectral power in seven canonical frequency bands between 0 to 50 Hz, where power is averaged within each band and scaled between 0 and 1. We model the observations as realizations of multivariate beta probability distributions that depend on a discrete-valued latent state process whose state transitions obey Markov dynamics. Using an expectation-maximization algorithm, we fit this beta-HMM to LFP recordings from 2 NHPs, and separately, to EEG recordings from 9 human subjects who received anesthetic doses of ketamine. Our beta-HMM framework provides a useful tool for experimental data analysis. Together, the estimated beta-HMM parameters and optimal state trajectory revealed an alternating pattern of states characterized primarily by gamma and slow-delta activities. The mean duration of the gamma activity was 2.2s([1.7,2.8]s) and 1.2s([0.9,1.5]s) for the two NHPs, and 2.5s([1.7,3.6]s) for the human subjects. The mean duration of the slow-delta activity was 1.6s([1.2,2.0]s) and 1.0s([0.8,1.2]s) for the two NHPs, and 1.8s([1.3,2.4]s) for the human subjects. Our characterizations of the alternating gamma slow-delta activities revealed five sub-states that show regular sequential transitions. These quantitative insights can inform the development of rhythm-generating neuronal circuit models that give mechanistic insights into this phenomenon and how ketamine produces altered states of arousal.

                Background: Data sharing is now a mandatory prerequisite for several major funders and journals, where researchers are obligated to deposit the data resulting from their studies in an openly accessible repository. Biomedical open data are now widely available in almost all disciplines, where researchers can freely access and reuse these data in new studies. We aim to study the BioLINCC datasets, number of publications that used BioLINCC open access data, and the citations received by these publications. Methods: As of July 2019, there was a total of 194 datasets stored in BioLINCC repository and accessible through their portal. We requested the full list of publications that used these datasets from BioLINCC, and we also performed a supplementary PubMed search for other publications. We used Web of Science (WoS) to analyze the characteristics of publications and the citations they received, where WoS database index high quality articles. Results: 1,086 published articles used data from BioLINCC repository for 79 (40.72%) datasets, where 115 (59.28%) datasets did not have any publications associated with it. Of the total publications, 987 (90.88%) articles were WoS indexed. The number of publications has steadily increased since 2002 and peaked in 2018 with a total number of 138 publications on that year. The 987 open data publications (i.e., secondary publications) received a total of 34,181 citations up to 1 st October 2019. The average citation per item for the open data publications was 34.63. The total number of citations received by open data publications per year has increased from only 2 citations in 2002, peaking in 2018 with 2361 citations. Conclusion: Majority of BioLINCC datasets were not used in secondary publications. Despite that, the datasets used for secondary publications yielded publications in WoS indexed journals and are receiving an increasing number of citations.

                Background: Phacoemulsification is regarded as a type of refractive surgery by which it is possible to ‎reduce pre-existing corneal stigmatism.‎ This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of on-axis corneal incision with or without opposite clear corneal incisions (OCCI) to correct preoperative corneal astigmatism during uncomplicated phacoemulsification ‎surgeries.‎ Methods: A randomized, prospective, parallel two-arm interventional study, which included a ‎total 40 eyes from 40 patients, was conducted.‎ Patients were divided into two groups: 20 patients as controls underwent phacoemulsification with on-axis incision (CCI group), and 20 patients underwent phacoemulsification with OCCI (OCCI group). Results: Mean astigmatic correction was significantly higher in the OCCI group (0.665 vs 0.265 diopters, p-value <0.001), compared to the CCI group. Most of the parameters (surgical induced astigmatism, magnitude of error, and correction index) were significantly higher in the OCCI group compared to the CCI group (p-value <0.01). There were no ‎incision-related complications. Conclusions: Both incisional methods are useful methods for correction of preoperative corneal ‎astigmatism but OCCIs correct a higher amount of astigmatism than the on-axis clear ‎corneal incision.‎ Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04418986 (05/06/2020).

                Background: Battling with COVID-19 and providing essential services along the continuum of care could be challenging. This study will evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on utilization of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services in Nigeria and explore the barriers being experienced by women and their families in getting access to MNCH services, as well as other contextual factors that may have shaped the utilization of MNCH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and analysis: The study will adopt an observational mixed-methods study design involving 18 health care facilities delivering MNCH services in six selected states across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. We will retrieve longitudinal data on MNCH services from all selected hospitals six months before and after the first recorded case of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Qualitative data will be collected using in-depth interviews conducted via mobile phones or ZOOM meeting platforms among stakeholder participants (users of MNCH services, health workers and policymakers) to ascertain their perceptions on how COVID-19 has shaped the utilization of MNCH services. We will triangulate quantitative and qualitative data to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of MNCH services in Nigeria. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approvals have been obtained from the Health Research Ethics Committee of the tertiary hospitals involved in the study. Our findings will provide the first evidence from an African setting on the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of MNCH services using a mixed-methods study design for policy formulation towards sustained MNCH service delivery.

     alt="Single axonal morphology reveals high heterogeneity in spinocerebellar axons originating from the lumbar spinal cord in the mouse"/>
<p>The authors reconstructed 26 single lumbar spinocerebellar axons in mice and mapped axon terminals with zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex. The lumbar spinocerebellar axons showed high variations in the pathway patterns (contralateral vs. ipsilateral, dorsal vs. ventral in the spinal cord, medullary vs. pontine in the cerebellar entry), branching, and termination (mainly in cerebellar lobules II, III–V, VIII–IXa–b, cerebellar nuclei, CN, nucleus X, NX, lateral reticular nucleus, LRN). The axons were classified into three major groups (magenta, orange, and green), confirming the conventional main types of the lumbar spinocerebellar projections to an extent. However, the results also indicated highly heterogeneous axonal populations beyond these groups.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Among the spinocerebellar projections vital for sensorimotor coordination of limbs and the trunk, the morphology of spinocerebellar axons originating from the lumbar cord has not been well characterized compared to those from thoracic and sacral cords. We reconstructed 26 single spinocerebellar axons labeled by biotinylated dextran injections into the gray matter of the lumbar spinal cord in mice. Axon terminals were mapped with the zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex. Reconstructed axons were primarily classified into ipsilaterally and contralaterally ascending axons, arising mainly from the dorsal and ventral horns, respectively. The majority of ipsilateral and contralateral axons took the dorsal-medullary and ventral-pontine pathways, respectively. The axons of both groups terminated mainly in the vermal and medial paravermal areas of lobules II–V and VIII–IXa, often bilaterally but predominantly ipsilateral to the axonal origin, with a weak preference to particular portions of zebrin stripes. The ipsilateral axons originating from the medial dorsal horn in the upper lumbar cord (<i>n</i> = 3) had abundant (43–147) mossy fiber terminals and no medullary collaterals. The ipsilateral axons originating from the lateral dorsal horn in the lower lumbar cord (<i>n</i> = 9) and the contralateral axons (<i>n</i> = 14) showed remarkable morphology variations. The number of their mossy fiber terminals varied from 2 to 172. Their collaterals, observed in 17 axons out of 23, terminated mainly in the medial cerebellar nucleus, nucleus X, and lateral reticular nucleus in various degrees. The results indicated that the lumbar spinocerebellar projection contains highly heterogeneous axonal populations regarding their pathway, branching, and termination patterns.</p>

                <p>Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by JC virus (JCV), which occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Management of PML relies on restoration of immunity within the CNS. However, when this restoration cannot be readily achieved PML has a grim prognosis. Innovative strategies have shown promises in promoting anti-JCV immune responses, and include T cell adoptive transfer or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Conversely, management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, particularly in iatrogenic PML, remains a major challenge. In this paper, we review recent development in the treatment of PML.</p>

                DNA loop extrusion by condensins and decatenation by DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) are thought to drive mitotic chromosome compaction and individualization. Here, we reveal that the linker histone H1.8 antagonizes condensins and topo II to shape mitotic chromosome organization. <i>In vitro</i> chromatin reconstitution experiments demonstrate that H1.8 inhibits binding of condensins and topo II to nucleosome arrays. Accordingly, H1.8 depletion in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts increased condensins and topo II levels on mitotic chromatin. Chromosome morphology and Hi-C analyses suggest that H1.8 depletion makes chromosomes thinner and longer through shortening the average loop size and reducing the DNA amount in each layer of mitotic loops. Furthermore, excess loading of condensins and topo II to chromosomes by H1.8 depletion causes hyper-chromosome individualization and dispersion. We propose that condensins and topo II are essential for chromosome individualization, but their functions are tuned by the linker histone to keep chromosomes together until anaphase.

                Identifying individuals who are at high risk of cancer due to inherited germline mutations is critical for effective implementation of personalized prevention strategies. Most existing models focus on a few specific syndromes; however recent evidence from multi-gene panel testing shows that many syndromes are overlapping, motivating the development of models that incorporate family history on several cancers and predict mutations for a comprehensive panel of genes. We present PanelPRO, a new, open-source R package providing a fast, flexible back-end for multi-gene, multi-cancer risk modeling with pedigree data. It includes a customizable database with default parameter values estimated from published studies and allows users to select any combinations of genes and cancers for their models, including well-established single syndrome BayesMendel models (BRCAPRO and MMRPRO). This leads to more accurate risk predictions and ultimately has a high impact on prevention strategies for cancer and clinical decision making. The package is available for download for research purposes at https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/bayesmendel/panelpro.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Innate immune activation by checkpoint inhibition in human patient-derived lung cancer tissues</a></h4>

              
                Although Pembrolizumab-based immunotherapy has significantly improved lung cancer patient survival, many patients show variable efficacy and resistance development. A better understanding of the drug's action is needed to improve patient outcomes. Functional heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial to modulating drug resistance; understanding of individual patients' TME that impacts drug response is hampered by lack of appropriate models. Lung organotypic tissue slice cultures (OTC) with patients' native TME procured from primary and brain-metastasized (BM) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were treated with Pembrolizumab and/or beta-glucan (WGP, an innate immune activator). Metabolic tracing with<sup> 13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc/<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5,</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-Gln, multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), and digital spatial profiling (DSP) were employed to interrogate metabolic and functional responses to Pembrolizumab and/or WGP. Primary and BM PD-1<sup>+</sup> lung cancer OTC responded to Pembrolizumab and Pembrolizumab + WGP treatments, respectively. Pembrolizumab activated innate immune metabolism and functions in primary OTC, which were accompanied by tissue damage. DSP analysis indicated an overall decrease in immunosuppressive macrophages and T cells but revealed microheterogeneity in immune responses and tissue damage. Two TMEs with altered cancer cell properties showed resistance. Pembrolizumab or WGP alone had negligible effects on BM-lung cancer OTC but Pembrolizumab + WGP blocked central metabolism with increased pro-inflammatory effector release and tissue damage. In depth metabolic analysis and multiplex TME imaging of lung cancer OTC demonstrated overall innate immune activation by Pembrolizumab but heterogeneous responses in the native TME of a patient with primary NSCLC. Metabolic and functional analysis also revealed synergistic action of Pembrolizumab and WGP in OTC of metastatic NSCLC.

                Learning about positive and negative outcomes of actions is crucial for survival and underpinned by conserved circuits including the striatum. How associations between actions and outcomes are formed is not fully understood, particularly when the outcomes have mixed positive and negative features. We developed a novel foraging ('bandit') task requiring mice to maximize rewards while minimizing punishments. By 2-photon Ca++ imaging, we monitored activity of 5831 identified anterodorsal striatal striosomal and matrix neurons. Surprisingly, we found that action-outcome associations for reward and punishment were combinatorially encoded rather than being integrated as overall outcome value. Single neurons could, for one action, encode outcomes of opposing valence. Striosome compartments consistently exhibited stronger representations of reinforcement outcomes than matrix, especially for high reward or punishment prediction errors. These findings demonstrate a remarkable multiplexing of action-outcome contingencies by single identified striatal neurons and suggest that striosomal neurons are differentially important in action-outcome learning.

	<p>Mutations of the SPAST gene that encodes the microtubule-severing enzyme called spastin are the chief cause of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. Growing evidence indicates that pathogenic mutations functionally compromise the spastin protein and endow it with toxic gain-of-function properties. With each of these two factors potentially relevant to disease etiology, the present article discusses possible therapeutic strategies that may ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from SPAST-based Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, which is usually termed SPG4-HSP.</p>

	<p>Previous cross-sectional studies have related aerobic fitness to inhibitory control and white matter (WM) microstructure in young adults, but there is no longitudinal study to confirm whether these relationships exist. We carried out a longitudinal study comparing aerobic fitness, inhibitory control, and WM integrity across time points, before versus after completing an exercise intervention in young adults (18–20 years old) relative to a control group. The exercise group (n = 35) participated in a 9-week exercise protocol, while the control group (n = 24) did not receive any regular exercise training. Behavioral data and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected prior to and following the intervention. After the exercise intervention, aerobic fitness and inhibitory control performance were significantly improved for the exercise group, but not for the control group. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) of the DTI data demonstrated significantly increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right corticospinal tract and significantly decreased FA in the left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus in the exercise group after the intervention versus before. The enhanced aerobic fitness induced by exercise was associated with better inhibitory control performance in the incongruent condition and lower FA in the Left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFOF). Regression analysis of a mediation model did not support Left SFOF FA as a mediator of the relationship between improvements in aerobic fitness and inhibitory control. The present data provide new evidence of the relationship between exercise-induced changes in aerobic fitness, WM integrity, and inhibitory control in early adulthood. Longer-duration intervention studies with larger study cohorts are needed to confirm and further explore the findings obtained in this study.</p>

	<p>Surgical skill acquisition may be facilitated with a safe application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A preliminary meta-analysis of randomized control trials showed that tDCS was associated with significantly better improvement in surgical performance than the sham control; however, meta-analysis does not address the mechanistic understanding. It is known from skill learning studies that the hierarchy of cognitive control shows a rostrocaudal axis in the frontal lobe where a shift from posterior to anterior is postulated to mediate progressively abstract, higher-order control. Therefore, optimizing the transcranial electrical stimulation to target surgical task-related brain activation at different stages of motor learning may provide the causal link to the learning behavior. This comment paper presents the computational approach for neuroimaging guided tDCS based on open-source software pipelines and an open-data of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for complex motor tasks. We performed an fNIRS-based cortical activation analysis using AtlasViewer software that was used as the target for tDCS of the motor complexity-related brain regions using ROAST software. For future studies on surgical skill training, it is postulated that the higher complexity laparoscopic suturing with intracorporeal knot tying task may result in more robust activation of the motor complexity-related brain areas when compared to the lower complexity laparoscopic tasks.</p>

	<p>In the present study, we investigated the effects of a four-week working memory (WM) and attention training program using commercial brain training (Synaptikon GmbH, Berlin). Sixty young healthy adults were assigned to the experimental and active control training programs. The training was conducted in a naturalistic home-based setting, while the pre- and post-examinations were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting. Transfer effects to an untrained WM task and to an untrained episodic memory task were examined. Furthermore, possible influences of personality, i.e., the five-factor model (FFM) traits and need for cognition (NFC), on training outcomes were examined. Additionally, the direct relationship between improvement in single trained tasks and improvement in the transfer tasks was investigated. Our results showed that both training groups significantly increased performance in the WM task, but only the WM training group increased their performance in the episodic memory transfer task. One of the training tasks, a visuospatial WM task, was particularly associated with improvement in the episodic memory task. Neuroticism and conscientiousness showed differential effects on the improvement in training and transfer tasks. It needs to be further examined whether these effects represent training effects or, for example, retest/practice or motivation effects.</p>

	<p>Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) exert devastating effects on body awareness, leading to the disruption of the transmission of sensory and motor inputs. Researchers have attempted to improve perceived body awareness post-SCI by intervening at the multisensory level, with the integration of somatic sensory and motor signals. However, the contributions of interoceptive-visceral inputs, particularly the potential interaction of motor and interoceptive signals, remain largely unaddressed. The present perspective aims to shed light on the use of interoceptive signals as a significant resource for patients with SCI to experience a complete sense of body awareness. First, we describe interoceptive signals as a significant obstacle preventing such patients from experiencing body awareness. Second, we discuss the multi-level mechanisms associated with the homeostatic stability of the body, which creates a unified, coherent experience of one’s self and one’s body, including real-time updates. Body awareness can be enhanced by targeting the vagus nerve function by, for example, applying transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation. This perspective offers a potentially useful insight for researchers and healthcare professionals, allowing them to be better equipped in SCI therapy. This will lead to improved sensory motor and interoceptive signals, a decreased likelihood of developing deafferentation pain, and the successful implementation of modern robotic technologies.</p>

	<p>Functional cognitive disorders (FCD) have become a subject of increasing clinical interest in recent years, in part because of their high prevalence amongst patients attending dedicated memory clinics. Empirical understanding of FCD based on observational studies is growing, suggesting a relationship to other functional neurological disorders (FND) based on shared phenomenology. However, understanding of FCD at the theoretical level has been lacking. One suggestion has been that FCD are disorders of metacognition, most usually of metamemory. In this article, a brief overview of these constructs is presented along with existing evidence for their impairment in FCD. Previous adaptations of theoretical models of FND to accommodate FCD are reviewed. A novel application to FCD of Nelson and Narens’ monitoring and control model of metamemory is then attempted, positing an improper setting of the monitoring function, with examples of ecological relevance. Formulation of FCD in light of a metacognitive model of anosognosia is also considered. Although lacking mechanistic and neuroanatomical sophistication, this metacognitive formulation of FCD may give pointers for future hypothesis-driven research and a pragmatic basis for management strategies.</p>

	<p>(1) The effects of intensive mental training based on meditation on the functional and structural organization of the human brain have been addressed by several neuroscientific studies. However, how large-scale connectivity patterns are affected by long-term practice of the main forms of meditation, Focused Attention (FA) and Open Monitoring (OM), as well as by aging, has not yet been elucidated. (2) Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis, we investigated the impact of meditation expertise and age on functional connectivity patterns in large-scale brain networks during different meditation styles in long-term meditators. (3) The results show that fMRI connectivity patterns in multiple key brain networks can differentially predict the meditation expertise and age of long-term meditators. Expertise-predictive patterns are differently affected by FA and OM, while age-predictive patterns are not influenced by the meditation form. The FA meditation connectivity pattern modulated by expertise included nodes and connections implicated in focusing, sustaining and monitoring attention, while OM patterns included nodes associated with cognitive control and emotion regulation. (4) The study highlights a long-term effect of meditation practice on multivariate patterns of functional brain connectivity and suggests that meditation expertise is associated with specific neuroplastic changes in connectivity patterns within and between multiple brain networks.</p>

	<p>Maternal immune activation (MIA) increases the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Microbial dysbiosis is associated with ASD symptoms. However, the alterations in the brain–gut–microbiota axis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced MIA offspring remain unclear. Here, we examined the social behavior, anxiety-like and repetitive behavior, microbiota profile, and myelination levels in LPS-induced MIA rat offspring. Compared with control offspring, MIA male rat offspring spent less time in an active social interaction with stranger rats, displayed more anxiety-like and repetitive behavior, and had more hypomyelination in the prefrontal cortex and thalamic nucleus. A fecal microbiota analysis revealed that MIA offspring had a higher abundance of Alistipes, Fusobacterium, and Ruminococcus and a lower abundance of Coprococcus, Erysipelotrichaies, and Actinobacteria than control offspring, which is consistent with that of humans with ASD. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to determine the relative importance of the microbiota, which indicated that the abundance of Alistipes and Actinobacteria was the most relevant for the profile of defective social behavior, whereas Fusobacterium and Coprococcus was associated with anxiety-like and repetitive behavior. In summary, LPS-induced MIA offspring showed an abnormal brain–gut–microbiota axis with social behavior deficits, anxiety-like and repetitive behavior, hypomyelination, and an ASD-like microbiota profile.</p>

<p>The “paintbrush” axon terminals from neurons of the nucleus isthmi parvocellularis (Ipc) exert a powerful boosting effect upon the ascending visual transmission in the optic tectum of birds. Although classically considered a cholinergic nucleus, Ipc neurons in adult chicks express VGLUT2 instead of VAChT. Performing in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in chick embryos, the authors find that both vesicular transporters are strongly expressed in Ipc neurons throughout development, along with other cholinergic markers, but there is a marked decrease in VAChT expression before hatching. Ex vivo deposits of tracer crystals and intracellular fillings reveal that Ipc axons exhibit conspicuous morphological transformations until late in development, suggesting that the presumptive dual vesicular transmitter release might be related to the growing and remodeling of this complex axon.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons can change their classical neurotransmitters during ontogeny, sometimes going through stages of dual release. Here, we explored the development of the neurotransmitter identity of neurons of the avian nucleus isthmi parvocellularis (Ipc), whose axon terminals are retinotopically arranged in the optic tectum (TeO) and exert a focal gating effect upon the ascending transmission of retinal inputs. Although cholinergic and glutamatergic markers are both found in Ipc neurons and terminals of adult pigeons and chicks, the mRNA expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, VAChT, is weak or absent. To explore how the Ipc neurotransmitter identity is established during ontogeny, we analyzed the expression of mRNAs coding for cholinergic (ChAT, VAChT, and CHT) and glutamatergic (VGluT2 and VGluT3) markers in chick embryos at different developmental stages. We found that between E12 and E18, Ipc neurons expressed all cholinergic mRNAs and also VGluT2 mRNA; however, from E16 through posthatch stages, VAChT mRNA expression was specifically diminished. Our ex vivo deposits of tracer crystals and intracellular filling experiments revealed that Ipc axons exhibit a mature paintbrush morphology late in development, experiencing marked morphological transformations during the period of presumptive dual vesicular transmitter release. Additionally, although ChAT protein immunoassays increasingly label the growing Ipc axon, this labeling was consistently restricted to sparse portions of the terminal branches. Combined, these results suggest that the synthesis of glutamate and acetylcholine, and their vesicular release, is complexly linked to the developmental processes of branching, growing and remodeling of these unique axons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Distinct patterns of hippocampal activity associated with color and spatial source memory</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is known to be involved in source memory across a wide variety of stimuli and source types. Thus, source memory activity in the hippocampus is thought to be domain-general such that different types of source information are similarly processed in the hippocampus. However, there is some evidence of domain-specificity for spatial and temporal source information. The current fMRI study aimed to determine whether patterns of activity in the hippocampus differed for two types of visual source information: spatial location and background color. Participants completed three runs of a spatial memory task and three runs of a color memory task. During the study phase, 32 line drawings of common objects and animals were presented to either the left or right of fixation for the spatial memory task or on either a red or green background for the color memory task. During the test phase of both tasks, 48 object word labels were presented in the center of the screen and participants classified the corresponding item as old and previously on the “left”/on a “green” background, old and previously on the “right”/on a “red” background, or “new.” Two analysis methods were employed to assess whether hippocampal activity differed between the two source types: a general linear model analysis and a classification-based searchlight multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The searchlight MVPA revealed that activity associated with spatial memory and color memory could be classified with above-chance accuracy in a region of the right anterior hippocampus, and a follow-up analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of memory accuracy. These results indicate that different types of source memory are represented by distinct patterns of activity in the hippocampus.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The wide variety of cell types and their biophysical complexities pose a challenge in our ability to understand oscillatory activities produced by cellular-based computational network models. This challenge stems from their high-dimensional and multiparametric natures. To overcome this, we implement a solution by linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits that generate intrahippocampal (3–12 Hz) theta rhythms. We leverage insights from minimal models to guide explorations of more detailed models and obtain a cellular perspective of theta generation. Our findings distinguish the pyramidal cells as the theta rhythm initiators and reveal that their activity is regularized by the inhibitory cell populations, supporting a proposed hypothesis of an “inhibition-based tuning” mechanism. We find a strong correlation between input current to the pyramidal cells and the resulting local field potential theta frequency, indicating that intrinsic pyramidal cell properties underpin network frequency characteristics. This work provides a cellular-based foundation from which <i>in vivo</i> theta activities can be explored.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Nitrergic modulation of neuronal excitability in the mouse hippocampus is mediated via regulation of Kv2 and voltage‐gated sodium channels</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Regulation of neuronal activity is a necessity for communication and information transmission. Many regulatory processes which have been studied provide a complex picture of how neurons can respond to permanently changing functional requirements. One such activity-dependent mechanism involves signaling mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Within the brain, NO is generated in response to neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) activation but NO-dependent pathways regulating neuronal excitability in the hippocampus remain to be fully elucidated. This study was set out to systematically assess the effects of NO on ion channel activities and intrinsic excitabilities of pyramidal neurons within the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. We characterized whole-cell potassium and sodium currents, both involved in action potential (AP) shaping and propagation and determined NO-mediated changes in excitabilities and AP waveforms. Our data describe a novel signaling by which NO, in a cGMP-independent manner, suppresses voltage-gated Kv2 potassium and voltage-gated sodium channel activities, thereby widening AP waveforms and reducing depolarization-induced AP firing rates. Our data show that glutathione, which possesses denitrosylating activity, is sufficient to prevent the observed nitrergic effects on potassium and sodium channels, whereas inhibition of cGMP signaling is also sufficient to abolish NO modulation of sodium currents. We propose that NO suppresses both ion channel activities via redox signaling and that an additional cGMP-mediated component is required to exert effects on sodium currents. Both mechanisms result in a dampened excitability and firing ability providing new data on nitrergic activities in the context of activity-dependent regulation of neuronal function following nNOS activation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Evidence for a gradient within the medial temporal lobes for flexible retrieval under hierarchical task rules</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A fundamental question in memory research is how the hippocampus processes contextual cues to retrieve distinct mnemonic associations. Prior research has emphasized the importance of hippocampal–prefrontal interactions for context-dependent memory. Our fMRI study examined the human medial temporal lobes (MTL) and their prefrontal interactions when retrieving memories associated with hierarchically organized task contexts. Participants learned virtual object-location associations governed by subordinate and superordinate task rules, which could be independently cued to change. On each fMRI trial, participants retrieved the correct object for convergent rule and location contextual information. Results demonstrated that hippocampal activity and hippocampal–prefrontal functional interconnectivity distinguished retrieval under different levels of hierarchically organized task rules. In explicit contrast to the hippocampal tail, anterior (body and head) regions were recruited specifically for superordinate changes in the contextual hierarchy. The hippocampal body also differed in its functional connectivity with the prefrontal cortex for superordinate versus subordinate changes. Our findings demonstrate a gradient in MTL for associative retrieval under changing task rules, and advance understanding of hippocampal–prefrontal interactions that support flexible contextual memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Preferential frequency‐dependent induction of synaptic depression by the lateral perforant path and of synaptic potentiation by the medial perforant path inputs to the dentate gyrus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The encoding of spatial representations is enabled by synaptic plasticity. The entorhinal cortex sends information to the hippocampus via the lateral (LPP) and medial perforant (MPP) paths that transfer egocentric item-related and allocentric spatial information, respectively. To what extent LPP and MPP information-relay results in different homosynaptic synaptic plasticity responses is unclear. We examined the frequency dependency (at 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 Hz) of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at MPP and LPP synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving adult rats. We report that whereas the MPP–DG synapses exhibit a predisposition toward the expression of LTP, LPP–DG synapses prefer to express synaptic depression. The divergence of synaptic plasticity responses is most prominent at afferent frequencies of 5, 100, Hz and 200 Hz. Priming with 10 or 50 Hz significantly modified the subsequent plasticity response in a frequency-dependent manner, but failed to change the preferred direction of change in synaptic strength of MPP and LPP synapses. Evaluation of the expression of GluN1, GluN2A, or GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor revealed equivalent expression in the outer and middle thirds of the molecular layer where LPP and MPP inputs convene, respectively, thus excluding NMDA receptors as a substrate for the frequency-dependent differences in bidirectional plasticity. These findings demonstrate that the LPP and MPP inputs to the DG enable differentiated and distinct forms of synaptic plasticity in response to the same afferent frequencies. Effects are extremely robust and resilient to metaplastic priming. These properties may support the functional differentiation of allocentric and item information provided to the DG by the MPP and LPP, respectively, that has been proposed by others. We propose that allocentric spatial information, conveyed by the MPP is encoded through hippocampal LTP in a designated synaptic network. This network is refined and optimized to include egocentric contextual information through LTD triggered by LPP inputs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">NRSF deficiency leads to abnormal postnatal development of dentate gyrus and impairment of progenitors in subgranular zone of hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates expression of a diverse set of genes. However, NRSF function in brain development still remains elusive. In the present study, we generated NRSF-conditional knockout (NRSF-cKO) mice by <i>hGFAP-Cre/loxp</i> system to study the effect of NRSF deficiency on brain development. Results showed that NRSF conditional knockout caused a smaller hippocampus and a thinner granule cell layer (GCL) in mice. Moreover, the reduction and disarrangement of GFAP+ cells in subgranular zone (SGZ) of NRSF-cKO mice was accompanied with the decreased number of premature neurons, neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), as well as compromising the majority of mitotically active cells. The analysis of postnatal development of hippocampus indicated the existence of an abnormality at postnatal day (P) 8, rather than at P1, in NRSF-cKO mice, although the densities of Ki67+ cells with mitotic ability in dentate gyrus were relatively unaffected at P1 and P8. Meanwhile, NRSF deficiency led to abnormal organization of SGZ at P8 during postnatal development. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 79 deregulated genes in hippocampus of NRSF-cKO mice at P8, which were involved in p53 signal transduction, neuron migration and negative regulation of cell proliferation, etc. The deregulation of p53 pathway in NRSF-cKO mice at P1 and P8 was evidenced, of which p21/Cdkn1a was accumulated in a portion of NSCs and NPCs in hippocampus during postnatal development. Together, these results, for the first time, revealed that NRSF could significantly influence the postnatal development of hippocampus, especially the formation of SGZ.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Expertise Modulates Neural Stimulus-Tracking</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>How does the brain anticipate information in language? When people perceive speech, low-frequency (&lt;10 Hz) activity in the brain synchronizes with bursts of sound and visual motion. This phenomenon, called cortical stimulus-tracking, is thought to be one way that the brain predicts the timing of upcoming words, phrases, and syllables. In this study, we test whether stimulus-tracking depends on domain-general expertise or on language-specific prediction mechanisms. We go on to examine how the effects of expertise differ between frontal and sensory cortex. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from human participants who were experts in either sign language or ballet, and we compared stimulus-tracking between groups while participants watched videos of sign language or ballet. We measured stimulus-tracking by computing coherence between EEG recordings and visual motion in the videos. Results showed that stimulus-tracking depends on domain-general expertise, and not on language-specific prediction mechanisms. At frontal channels, fluent signers showed stronger coherence to sign language than to dance, whereas expert dancers showed stronger coherence to dance than to sign language. At occipital channels, however, the two groups of participants did not show different patterns of coherence. These results are difficult to explain by entrainment of endogenous oscillations, because neither sign language nor dance show any periodicity at the frequencies of significant expertise-dependent stimulus-tracking. These results suggest that the brain may rely on domain-general predictive mechanisms to optimize perception of temporally-predictable stimuli such as speech, sign language, and dance.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) is an orphan receptor that regulates energy homeostasis. We compared <I>Brs3</I> driver mice with constitutive or inducible Cre recombinase activity. The constitutive BRS3-Cre mice show a reporter signal (Cre-dependent tdTomato) in the adult brain because of lineage tracing in the dentate gyrus, striatal patches, and indusium griseum, in addition to sites previously identified in the inducible BRS3-Cre mice (including hypothalamic and amygdala subregions, and parabrachial nucleus). We detected <I>Brs3</I> reporter expression in the dentate gyrus at day 23 but not at postnatal day 1 or 5 months of age. Hypothalamic sites expressed reporter at all three time points, and striatal patches expressed <I>Brs3</I> reporter at 1 day but not 5 months. Parabrachial nucleus <I>Brs3</I> neurons project to the preoptic area, hypothalamus, amygdala, and thalamus. Both Cre recombinase insertions reduced <I>Brs3</I> mRNA levels and BRS3 function, causing obesity phenotypes of different severity. These results demonstrate that driver mice should be characterized phenotypically and illustrate the need for knock-in strategies with less effect on the endogenous gene.</p>

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly. Hospital acquired infections enhance local outbreaks, impacting the vulnerable populations. Infection prevention and control practices (IPC) refer to all the activities used to reduce the risk of infection spread.  This study aims to estimate the proportion of health care workers (HCWs) who acquired SARS-CoV2 infection, and evaluate their knowledge to IPC and suggest recommendations to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection.   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Egypt from June 8, 2020, till August 19, 2020. A purposive sample of 518 HCWs from different governorates was included in the study. HCWs filled a structured questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization on a Google Form and a printed copy. The questionnaire link was shared on social media forums including HCWs such as Facebook.   Results: The mean age of HCWs was 33±7 and 65% were males. The majority of health care workers were affiliated with the Ministry of Health and Population (62.5%), recruited from Cairo (52.4%), and were physicians (78.2%). About 11% of the HCWs had been infected with SARS-CoV2. Their mean knowledge percent score regarding IPC was 36.19 ± 11.26. The highest rate of infection was among those with little experience (p=0.002), and those worked inside Cairo (p=0.018). About 89% mentioned that the leading cause of infection with SARS-CoV2 was the shortage in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). About 42% recommended raising the awareness for the importance of IPC to decrease risk of infection.   Conclusions: HCWs had a low score of knowledge toward IPC. There was a considerable proportion of SARS-CoV2 infection among them. Lack of knowledge and shortage of PPE were the contributing factors. It is necessary to provide juniors with IPC training, and hospitals with sufficient PPE.

                Background: Modeling with the complex random phenomena that are frequently observed in reliability engineering, hydrology, ecology, medical science, and agricultural sciences was once thought to be an enigma. Scientists and practitioners agree that an appropriate but simple model is the best choice for this investigation. To address these issues, scientists have previously discussed a variety of bounded and unbounded, simple to complex lifetime models. Methods: We discussed a modified Lehmann type II (ML-II) model as a better approach to modeling bathtub-shaped and asymmetric random phenomena. A number of complementary mathematical and reliability measures were developed and discussed. Furthermore, explicit expressions for the moments, quantile function, and order statistics were developed. Then, we discussed the various shapes of the density and reliability functions over various model parameter choices. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method was used to estimate the unknown model parameters, and a simulation study was carried out to evaluate the MLEs' asymptotic behavior. Results: We demonstrated ML- II's dominance over well-known competitors by modeling anxiety in women and electronic data.

                Metagenomic sequencing allows large-scale identification and genomic characterization. Binning is the process of recovering genomes from complex mixtures of sequence fragments (metagenome contigs) of unknown bacteria and archaeal species. Assessing the quality of genomes recovered from metagenomes requires the use of complex pipelines involving many independent steps, often difficult to reproduce and maintain. A comprehensive, automated and easy-to-use computational workflow for the quality assessment of draft prokaryotic genomes, based on container technology, would greatly improve reproducibility and reusability of published results. We present metashot/prok-quality, a container-enabled Nextflow pipeline for quality assessment and genome dereplication.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cost-effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo for hand osteoarthritis: economic evaluation of the HERO trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An economic evaluation alongside the Hydroxychloroquine Effectiveness in Reducing symptoms of hand Osteoarthritis (HERO) trial was undertaken to assess the cost-effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo for symptomatic treatment of hand osteoarthritis for patients with at least moderate hand pain and inadequate response to current therapies. Methods: A trial-based cost–utility analysis was undertaken from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a 12-month time horizon, using evidence from 248 participants included in the HERO trial, conducted in England. Patient-level data were collected prospectively over a 12-month period, using participant-completed questionnaires and investigator forms, to collect healthcare utilisation, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using the EQ-5D-5L. The base-case analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis and used multiple imputation methods to deal with missing data. Results were presented in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (incremental cost per QALY) and net health benefit, with uncertainty surrounding the findings explored using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Results: The base-case analysis estimated slightly lower costs on average (−£11.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) −£15.60 to −£8.00) and marginally fewer QALYs (−0.0052; 95% CI −0.0057 to −0.0047) for participants in the hydroxychloroquine group versus placebo group at 12 months. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2,267 per QALY lost indicated that although costs were saved, health-related quality of life was lost. Even assuming symmetrical preferences regarding losses and gains for health benefits, the findings do not fall within the cost-effective region. Similar findings arose for analyses conducted from the societal perspective and using complete cases only. Conclusions: This economic evaluation indicates that hydroxychloroquine is unlikely to provide a cost-effective pain relief option for improving health-related quality of life in adult patients with moderate-to-severe hand osteoarthritis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modeling the impact of early interventions on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus infection [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A deterministic model is proposed to describe the transmission dynamics of coronavirus infection with early interventions. Epidemiological studies have employed modeling to unravel knowledge that transformed the lives of families, communities, nations and the entire globe. The study established the stability of both disease free and endemic equilibria. Stability occurs when the reproduction number, R0, is less than unity for both disease free and endemic equilibrium points. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium point of the model is established whenever the basic reproduction number R0 is less than or equal to unity. The reproduction number is also shown to be directly related to the transmission probability (β), rate at which latently infected individuals join the infected class (δ) and rate of recruitment (Λ). It is inversely related to natural death rate (μ), rate of early treatment (τ1), rate of hospitalization of infected individuals (θ) and Covid-induced death rate (σ). The analytical results established are confirmed by numerical simulation of the model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of microbial agents in tissue specimens of ocular and periocular sarcoidosis using a metagenomics approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metagenomic sequencing has the potential to identify a wide range of pathogens in human tissue samples. Sarcoidosis is a complex disorder whose etiology remains unknown and for which a variety of infectious causes have been hypothesized. We sought to conduct metagenomic sequencing on cases of ocular and periocular sarcoidosis, none of them with previously identified infectious causes. Methods: Archival tissue specimens of 16 subjects with biopsies of ocular and periocular tissues that were positive for non-caseating granulomas were used as cases. Four archival tissue specimens that did not demonstrate non-caseating granulomas were also included as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue sections. DNA libraries were generated from the extracted genomic DNA and the libraries underwent next-generation sequencing. Results: We generated between 4.8 and 20.7 million reads for each of the 16 cases plus four control samples. For eight of the cases, we identified microbial pathogens that were present well above the background, with one potential pathogen identified for seven of the cases and two possible pathogens for one of the cases. Five of the eight cases were associated with bacteria (Campylobacter concisus, Neisseria elongata, Streptococcus salivarius, Pseudopropionibacterium propionicum, and Paracoccus yeei), two cases with fungi (Exophiala oligosperma, Lomentospora prolificans and Aspergillus versicolor) and one case with a virus (Mupapillomavirus 1). Interestingly, four of the five bacterial species are also part of the human oral microbiome. Conclusions: Using a metagenomic sequencing we identified possible infectious causes in half of the ocular and periocular sarcoidosis cases analyzed. Our findings support the proposition that sarcoidosis could be an etiologically heterogenous disease. Because these are previously banked samples, direct follow-up in the respective patients is impossible, but these results suggest that sequencing may be a valuable tool in better understanding the etiopathogenesis of sarcoidosis and in diagnosing and treating this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The evolutionary history of topological variations in the CPA/AT transporters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Govindarajan Sudha, Claudio Bassot, John Lamb, Nanjiang Shu, Yan Huang, Arne Elofsson</p>

CPA/AT transporters are made up of scaffold and a core domain. The core domain contains two non-canonical helices (broken or reentrant) that mediate the transport of ions, amino acids or other charged compounds. During evolution, these transporters have undergone substantial changes in structure, topology and function. To shed light on these structural transitions, we create models for all families using an integrated topology annotation method. We find that the CPA/AT transporters can be classified into four fold-types based on their structure; (1) the CPA-broken fold-type, (2) the CPA-reentrant fold-type, (3) the BART fold-type, and (4) a previously not described fold-type, the Reentrant-Helix-Reentrant fold-type. Several topological transitions are identified, including the transition between a broken and reentrant helix, one transition between a loop and a reentrant helix, complete changes of orientation, and changes in the number of scaffold helices. These transitions are mainly caused by gene duplication and shuffling events. Structural models, topology information and other details are presented in a searchable database, CPAfold (cpafold.bioinfo.se).

                <p>Central nervous system demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) and subsequent axonal degeneration represents a major cause of clinical morbidity. Learning, salient experiences, and stimulation of neuronal activity induce new myelin formation in rodents and in animal models of demyelination, remyelination can be enhanced by via experience- and activity-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, preliminary studies in MS patients supports the use of neuromodulation and rehabilitation exercises for symptomatic improvement, suggesting that these interventions may represent non-pharmacological strategies for promoting remyelination. Here, we review the literature on myelin plasticity processes and assess the potential to leverage these mechanisms to develop remyelinating therapies.</p>

     alt="A comparative study of pre-alpha islands in the entorhinal cortex from selected primates and in lissencephaly"/>
<p>The drawing at the top show coronal sections through a gyrified human brain (at left) and a lissencephalic ('smooth', i.e., lacking normal convolutions) human brain (at right). The lower half of the image shows exemplary images of primate brains with a strongly gyrified cortex (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) versus a comparatively smooth brain surface (<i>Perodicticus potto</i>). Whereas the pre-alpha layer in <i>Pongo pygmaeus</i> (at left) displays cellular islands, these are lacking in the lissencephalic primate (at right). The images are identical to those shown in Figure 1.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the main interface between the sensory association areas of the neocortex and the hippocampus. It is crucial for the evaluation and processing of sensory data for long-term memory consolidation, and shows damage in many brain diseases, e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and developmental disorders.</p>
<p>The pre-alpha layer of the EC in humans (layer II) displays a remarkable distribution of neurons in islands. These cellular islands give rise to a portion of the perforant path – the major reciprocal data stream for neocortical information into the hippocampal formation. However, the functional relevance of the morphological appearance of the pre-alpha layer in cellular islands and the precise timing of their initial appearance during primate evolution are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a comparative study of the EC from 38 non-human primates and <i>Homo sapiens</i> and found a strong relationship between gyrification index (GI) and the presence of the pre-alpha cellular islands. The formation of cellular islands also correlated wih brain and body weight as well as neopallial volume. In the two human lissencephalic cases, the cellular islands in the pre-alpha layer were lacking. These findings emphasize the relationship between cortical folding and island formation in the entorhinal cortex from an evolutionary perspective, and suggest a role in the pathomechanism of developmental brain disorders.</p>

                Calpains are evolutionarily conserved and widely expressed Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases that act at neutral pH. The activity of calpains is tightly regulated, given that their abnormal activation can have deleterious effects leading to promiscuous cleavage of various targets. Genetic mutations in the genes encoding calpains are associated with human diseases, while abnormally elevated Ca2+ levels promote Ca2+-dependent calpain activation in pathologies associated with ischemic insults and neurodegeneration.

                Autophagy sustains cellular homeostasis and metabolism in numerous diseases. By regulating cancer metabolism, both tumor and microenvironmental autophagy promote tumor growth. However, autophagy can support cancer progression through other biological functions such as immune response regulation or cytokine/growth factor secretion. Moreover, autophagy is induced in numerous tumor types as a resistance mechanism following therapy, highlighting autophagy inhibition as a promising target for anti-cancer therapy. Thus, better understanding the mechanisms involved in tumor growth and resistance regulation through autophagy, which are not fully understood, will provide insights into patient treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Selective deletion of human leukocyte antigens protects stem cell-derived islets from immune rejection</a></h4>

              
                Parent et al. create immune-evasive human pluripotent stem cells by individually deleting all classical human leukocyte antigens except for the highly prevalent allele HLA-A2. This strategy significantly reduces NK- and T-cell-mediated rejection of stem cell-derived pancreatic β cells while retaining immune surveillance of the cells through HLA-A2.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Hypoxic preconditioning protects against ischemic kidney injury through the IDO1/kynurenine pathway</a></h4>

              
                Torosyan et al. show that two potent cytoprotective strategies, hypoxic preconditioning and PHD inhibition, enhance kidney tissue resilience against ischemic injury by activating the kynurenine metabolic pathway. Specifically, they promote systemic kynurenine increase and enhance kynurenine metabolism, leading to preservation of NAD+ and generation of kynurenic acid in the post-ischemic kidney.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Sun et al. report that the secreted stem cell growth factor R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) acts as a BMP signaling antagonist to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia cells. High RSPO2 expression predicts poor prognosis, suggesting RSPO2 as potential prognostic marker and drug target in AML.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">CD63-mediated cloaking of VEGF in small extracellular vesicles contributes to anti-VEGF therapy resistance</a></h4>

              
                Ma et.al report that cancer-cell-derived small EVs contain increasing amounts of VEGF (eVEGF) and contribute to resistance to anti-VEGF therapy (AVT). CD63 is a potential mediator that regulates packaging of VEGF into small EVs. eVEGF can trigger intracrine VEGF signaling in endothelial cells and promote angiogenesis despite AVT.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Cdc42 is required for male germline niche development in mice</a></h4>

              
                Mori et al. show that CDC42 deficiency impairs SSC niche development via downregulation of GDNF in Sertoli cells. CDC42-deficient Sertoli cells exhibit weaker nuclear MAPK1/3 staining and downregulated DMRT1 and SOX9, which suggests that the CDC42-MAPK1/3-DMRT1/SOX9 pathway plays critical roles in SSC niche development.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Male fertility in mice requires classical and nonclassical androgen signaling</a></h4>

              
                Cooke and Walker show that classical androgen signaling activity is sufficient for sperm production and male fertility in mice. Nonclassical activity supports meiosis and spermatid migration. Genes required for chromosome synapsis and meiosis are induced by classical signaling. Full prostate development requires synergistic classical and nonclassical signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Fatty acids impact sarcomere integrity through myristoylation and ER homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Tang et al. show that fatty acid deficiency causes defects in muscle integrity in the nematode C. elegans and such an impact is mediated by deficiency of lipid modification of specific proteins in the muscle that in turn triggers ER stress and muscle disorganization. The results reveal the regulatory roles of fatty acids and ER homeostasis in muscle maintenance.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Gli1+ progenitors mediate bone anabolic function of teriparatide via Hh and Igf signaling</a></h4>

              
                Gli1+ metaphyseal mesenchymal progenitors (MMPs) are a main source for osteoblasts in postnatal mice. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, Shi et al. find a chondrocyte-like osteoprogenitor (COP) among MMPs. COP is a target of teriparatide, the mainstay of bone anabolic therapy, and requires Hh and Igf signaling for bone formation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mds1CreERT2, an inducible Cre allele specific to adult-repopulating hematopoietic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Zhang et al. develop Mds1CreERT2 mice, which inducibly express Cre-recombinase in emerging fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Lineage tracing reveals increasing HSC contributions to hematopoietic cells in E14.5–E16.5 embryos, as well as the majority of macrophages in adult spleen and marrow. Mds1CreERT2 mice will help deconvolute the complexity of hematopoietic ontogeny.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NF1 regulates mesenchymal glioblastoma plasticity and aggressiveness through the AP-1 transcription factor FOSL1</a></h4>

              
                The molecular basis underlying glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity and plasticity is not fully understood. Using transcriptomic data of human patient-derived brain tumor stem cell lines (BTSCs), classified based on GBM-intrinsic signatures, we identify the AP-1 transcription factor <i>FOSL1</i> as a key regulator of the mesenchymal (MES) subtype. We provide a mechanistic basis to the role of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene (<i>NF1</i>), a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway, in GBM mesenchymal transformation through the modulation of <i>FOSL1</i> expression. Depletion of <i>FOSL1</i> in <i>NF1</i>-mutant human BTSCs and <i>Kras</i>-mutant mouse neural stem cells results in loss of the mesenchymal gene signature and reduction in stem cell properties and in vivo tumorigenic potential. Our data demonstrate that <i>FOSL1</i> controls GBM plasticity and aggressiveness in response to <i>NF1</i> alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The development of active binocular vision under normal and alternate rearing conditions</a></h4>

              
                The development of binocular vision is an active learning process comprising the development of disparity tuned neurons in visual cortex and the establishment of precise vergence control of the eyes. We present a computational model for the learning and self-calibration of active binocular vision based on the Active Efficient Coding framework, an extension of classic efficient coding ideas to active perception. Under normal rearing conditions with naturalistic input, the model develops disparity tuned neurons and precise vergence control, allowing it to correctly interpret random dot stereograms. Under altered rearing conditions modeled after neurophysiological experiments, the model qualitatively reproduces key experimental findings on changes in binocularity and disparity tuning. Furthermore, the model makes testable predictions regarding how altered rearing conditions impede the learning of precise vergence control. Finally, the model predicts a surprising new effect that impaired vergence control affects the statistics of orientation tuning in visual cortical neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cardiac pathologies in mouse loss of imprinting models are due to misexpression of H19 long noncoding RNA</a></h4>

              
                Maternal loss of imprinting (LOI) at the <i>H19/IGF2</i> locus results in biallelic <i>IGF2</i> and reduced <i>H19</i> expression and is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). We use mouse models for LOI to understand the relative importance of <i>Igf2</i> and <i>H19</i> mis-expression in BWS phenotypes. Here we focus on cardiovascular phenotypes and show that neonatal cardiomegaly is exclusively dependent on increased <i>Igf2</i>. Circulating IGF2 binds cardiomyocyte receptors to hyperactivate mTOR signaling, resulting in cellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy. These <i>Igf2</i>-dependent phenotypes are transient: cardiac size returns to normal once <i>Igf2</i> expression is suppressed postnatally. However, reduced <i>H19</i> expression is sufficient to cause progressive heart pathologies including fibrosis and reduced ventricular function. In the heart, <i>H19</i> expression is primarily in endothelial cells (ECs) and regulates EC differentiation both, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Finally, we establish novel mouse models to show that cardiac phenotypes depend on <i>H19</i> lncRNA interactions with <i>Mirlet7 </i>microRNAs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dual mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the inspiratory rhythm-generating network</a></h4>

              
                The analgesic utility of opioid-based drugs is limited by the life-threatening risk of respiratory depression. Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), mediated by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), is characterized by a pronounced decrease in the frequency and regularity of the inspiratory rhythm, which originates from the medullary preBӧtzinger Complex (preBӧtC). To unravel the cellular- and network-level consequences of MOR activation in the preBӧtC, MOR- expressing neurons were optogenetically identified and manipulated in transgenic mice <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Based on these results, a model of OIRD was developed <i>in silico</i>. We conclude that hyperpolarization of MOR<i>-</i>expressing preBӧtC neurons alone does not phenocopy OIRD. Instead, the effects of MOR activation are twofold: 1) pre-inspiratory spiking is reduced and 2) excitatory synaptic transmission is suppressed, thereby disrupting network-driven rhythmogenesis. These dual mechanisms of opioid action act synergistically to make the normally robust inspiratory rhythm generating network particularly prone to collapse when challenged with exogenous opioids.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KLF10 integrates circadian timing and sugar signaling to coordinate hepatic metabolism</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian circadian timing system and metabolism are highly interconnected, and disruption of this coupling is associated with negative health outcomes. Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are transcription factors that govern metabolic homeostasis in various organs. Many KLFs show a circadian expression in the liver. Here, we show that the loss of the clock-controlled KLF10 in hepatocytes results in extensive reprogramming of the mouse liver circadian transcriptome, which in turn, alters the temporal coordination of pathways associated with energy metabolism. We also show that glucose and fructose induce <i>Klf10, </i>which helps mitigate glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in mice challenged with a sugar beverage. Functional genomics further reveal that KLF10 target genes are primarily involved in central carbon metabolism. Together, these findings show that in the liver, KLF10 integrates circadian timing and sugar metabolism related signaling, and serves as a transcriptional brake that protects against the deleterious effects of increased sugar consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How will mosquitoes adapt to climate warming?</a></h4>

              
                The potential for adaptive evolution to enable species persistence under a changing climate is one of the most important questions for understanding impacts of future climate change. Climate adaptation may be particularly likely for short-lived ectotherms, including many pest, pathogen, and vector species. For these taxa, estimating climate adaptive potential is critical for accurate predictive modeling and public health preparedness. Here, we demonstrate how a simple theoretical framework used in conservation biology—evolutionary rescue models—can be used to investigate the potential for climate adaptation in these taxa, using mosquito thermal adaptation as a focal case. Synthesizing current evidence, we find that short mosquito generation times, high population growth rates, and strong temperature-imposed selection favor thermal adaptation. However, knowledge gaps about the extent of phenotypic and genotypic variation in thermal tolerance within mosquito populations, the environmental sensitivity of selection, and the role of phenotypic plasticity constrain our ability to make more precise estimates. We describe how common garden and selection experiments can be used to fill these data gaps. Lastly, we investigate the consequences of mosquito climate adaptation on disease transmission using <i>Aedes aegypti</i>-transmitted dengue virus in Northern Brazil as a case study. The approach outlined here can be applied to any disease vector or pest species and type of environmental change.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cost-precision trade-off relation determines the optimal morphogen gradient for accurate biological pattern formation</a></h4>

              
                Spatial boundaries formed during animal development originate from the pre-patterning of tissues by signaling molecules, called morphogens. The accuracy of boundary location is limited by the fluctuations of morphogen concentration that thresholds the expression level of target gene. Producing more morphogen molecules, which gives rise to smaller relative fluctuations, would better serve to shape more precise target boundaries; however, it incurs more thermodynamic cost. In the classical diffusion-depletion model of morphogen profile formation, the morphogen molecules synthesized from a local source display an exponentially decaying concentration profile with a characteristic length λ. Our theory suggests that in order to attain a precise profile with the minimal cost, <i>λ </i>should be roughly half the distance to the target boundary position from the source. Remarkably, we find that the profiles of morphogens that pattern the <i>Drosophila </i>embryo and wing imaginal disk are formed with nearly optimal<i> λ</i>. Our finding underscores the thermodynamic cost as a key physical constraint in the morphogen profile formation in <i>Drosophila</i> development.

                Follicular T helper cells (Tfh) are a specialized subset of CD4 effector T cells that are crucial for germinal center (GC) reactions and for selecting B cells to undergo affinity maturation. Despite this central role for humoral immunity, only few data exist about their clonal distribution when multiple lymphoid organs are exposed to the same antigen (Ag) as it is the case in autoimmunity. Here, we used an autoantibody-mediated disease model of the skin and injected one auto-Ag into the two footpads of the same mouse and analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR)β sequences of Tfh located in GCs of both contralateral draining lymph nodes. We found that over 90% of the dominant GC-Tfh clonotypes were shared in both lymph nodes but only transiently. The initially dominant Tfh clonotypes especially declined after establishment of chronic disease while GC reaction and autoimmune disease continued. Our data demonstrates a dynamic behavior of Tfh clonotypes under autoimmune conditions and emphasizes the importance of the time point for distinguishing auto-Ag-specific Tfh clonotypes from potential bystander activated ones.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An in vitro stem cell model of human epiblast and yolk sac interaction</a></h4>

              
                Human embryogenesis entails complex signalling interactions between embryonic and extra-embryonic cells. However, how extra-embryonic cells direct morphogenesis within the human embryo remains largely unknown due to a lack of relevant stem cell models. Here, we have established conditions to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into yolk sac-like cells (YSLCs) that resemble the post-implantation human hypoblast molecularly and functionally. YSLCs induce the expression of pluripotency and anterior ectoderm markers in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) at the expense of mesoderm and endoderm markers. This activity is mediated by the release of BMP and WNT signalling pathway inhibitors, and, therefore, resembles the functioning of the anterior visceral endoderm signalling centre of the mouse embryo, which establishes the anterior-posterior axis. Our results implicate the yolk sac in epiblast cell fate specification in the human embryo and propose YSLCs as a tool for studying post-implantation human embryo development <i>in vitro.</i>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Insulin-producing β-cells regenerate ectopically from a mesodermal origin under the perturbation of hemato-endothelial specification</a></h4>

              
                To investigate the role of the vasculature in pancreatic β-cell regeneration, we crossed a zebrafish β-cell ablation model into the avascular <i>npas4l</i> mutant (i.e. <i>cloche</i>). Surprisingly, β-cell regeneration increased markedly in <i>npas4l</i> mutants owing to the ectopic differentiation of β-cells in the mesenchyme, a phenotype not previously reported in any models. The ectopic β-cells expressed endocrine markers of pancreatic β-cells, and also responded to glucose with increased calcium influx. Through lineage tracing, we determined that the vast majority of these ectopic β-cells has a mesodermal origin. Notably, ectopic β-cells were found in <i>npas4l</i> mutants as well as following knockdown of the endothelial/myeloid determinant Etsrp. Together, these data indicate that under the perturbation of endothelial/myeloid specification, mesodermal cells possess a remarkable plasticity enabling them to form β-cells, which are normally endodermal in origin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seizures, behavioral deficits and adverse drug responses in two new genetic mouse models of HCN1 epileptic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                De novo mutations in voltage- and ligand-gated channels have been associated with an increasing number of cases of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, which often fail to respond to classic antiseizure medications. Here, we examine two knock-in mouse models replicating de novo mutations in the HCN1 voltage-gated channel gene, p.G391D and p.M153I (Hcn1G380D/+ and Hcn1M142I/+ in mouse), associated with severe drug-resistant neonatal- and childhood-onset epilepsy, respectively. Heterozygous mice from both lines displayed spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Hcn1G380D/+ animals had an overall more severe phenotype, with pronounced alterations in the levels and distribution of HCN1 protein, including disrupted targeting to the axon terminals of basket cell interneurons. In line with clinical reports from HCN1 patients, administration of the antiepileptic Na+ channel antagonists lamotrigine and phenytoin resulted in the paradoxical induction of seizures in both lines, consistent with an effect to further impair inhibitory neuron function. We also show that these variants can render HCN1 channels unresponsive to classic antagonists, indicating the need to screen mutated channels to identify novel compounds with diverse mechanism of action. Our results underscore the need to tailor effective therapies for specific channel gene variants, and how strongly validated animal models may provide an invaluable tool towards reaching this objective.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unique Characterization of Spatiotemporal Neuronal Network Activity</a></h4>

              
                We apply the Triple Correlation Uniqueness (TCU) theorem to the most basic representation of network spiking activity, the raster, to prove that third-order (triple) correlation uniquely characterizes spiking activity in the brain. As a consequence, the three-node (triple) motifs comprising the triple correlation are fundamental building blocks of neuronal activity. By analysing the putative flow of information in these motifs, we group all possible motifs into fourteen motif-classes. These motif-classes embody well-known and well-studied properties in neuroscience, e.g. spike rate, local dynamics, synchrony, feedback, feedforward, convergence, and divergence. We show that motifs with some of these properties---divergence, convergence, and feedforward---are far more prevalent in the triple correlation; and thus, these properties contribute more to characterizing neural activity than do the other properties. In the frequency domain, the triple correlation is the bispectrum, which characterizes the phase-relationship between spike trains and the relationships between frequency bands. We apply these analyses to example rasters to illustrate the dependence of our characterization on the firing patterns underlying neural activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cervical Spinal Cord Injury Leads to Injury and Metabolic Dysfunction of the Lung</a></h4>

              
                High-cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) often disrupts respiratory motor pathways and disables breathing in the affected population. Moreover, cervically injured individuals are at risk for developing acute lung injury (ALI), which predicts substantial mortality rates. While the correlation between ALI and SCI has been found in the clinical setting, the field lacks an animal model to interrogate the fundamental biology of this relationship. To begin to address this gap, we performed an experimental cervical SCI and assessed lung injury in adult rats. We demonstrate that animals display signs of ALI two weeks post-SCI. We also observed aberrant N-glycan metabolism determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging. Collectively, we establish for the first time a model of ALI after SCI at an acute time point that can be used to monitor the progression of lung damage, as well as identify potential targets to ameliorate ALI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Columnar localization and laminar origin of cortical surface electrical potentials</a></h4>

              
                Electrocorticography (ECoG) methodologically bridges basic neuroscience and understanding of human brains in health and disease. However, the localization of ECoG signals across the surface of the brain and the spatial distribution of their generating neuronal sources are poorly understood. To address this gap, we recorded from rat auditory cortex using customized microECoG, and simulated cortical surface electrical potentials with a full-scale, biophysically detailed cortical column model. Experimentally, microECoG-derived auditory representations were tonotopically organized and signals were anisotropically localized to 200 micrometers, i.e., a single cortical column. Biophysical simulations reproduce experimental findings, and indicate that neurons in cortical layers V and VI contribute ~85% of evoked high-gamma signal recorded at the surface. Cell number and synchronicity were the primary biophysical properties determining laminar contributions to evoked microECoG signals, while distance was only a minimal factor. Thus, evoked microECoG signals primarily originate from neurons in the infragranular layers of a single cortical column.

                We describe a framework where a biologically plausible spiking neural network mimicking hippocampal layers learns a cognitive map known as the successor representation. We show analytically how, on the algorithmic level, the learning follows the TD(lambda) algorithm, which emerges from the underlying spike-timing dependent plasticity rule. We then analyze the implications of this framework, uncovering how behavioural activity and experience replays can play complementary roles when learning the representation of the environment, how we can learn relations over behavioural timescales with synaptic plasticity acting on the range of milliseconds, and how the learned representation can be flexibly encoded by allowing state-dependent delay discounting through neuromodulation and altered firing rates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular signature and target-specificity of inhibitory circuits formed by Martinotti cells in the mouse barrel cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the neocortex, fast synaptic inhibition orchestrates both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. GABAergic interneurons (INs) inhibit pyramidal neurons (PNs) directly, modulating their output activity and thus contributing to balance cortical networks. Moreover, several IN subtypes also inhibit other INs, forming specific disinhibitory circuits, which play crucial roles in several cognitive functions. Here, we studied a homogeneous subpopulation of somatostatin (SST)-positive INs, the Martinotti cells (MCs) in layer 2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex (both sexes). MCs are a prominent IN subclass inhibiting the distal portion of PN apical dendrites, thus controlling dendrite electrogenesis and synaptic integration. Yet, it is poorly understood whether MCs inhibit other elements of the cortical circuits, and the connectivity properties with non-PN targets are unknown. We found that MCs have a strong preference for PN dendrites, but they also considerably connect with parvalbumin (PV)-positive, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing and layer 1 (L1) INs. Remarkably, GABAergic synapses from MCs exhibited clear cell-type-specific short-term plasticity. Moreover, whereas the biophysical properties of MC-PN synapses were consistent with distal dendritic inhibition, MC-IN synapses exhibited characteristics of fast perisomatic inhibition. Finally, MC-PN connections used 5-containing GABAARs, but this subunit was not expressed by the other INs targeted by MCs. We reveal a specialized connectivity blueprint of MCs within different elements of superficial cortical layers. In addition, our results identify 5-GABAARs as the molecular fingerprint of MC-PN dendritic inhibition. This is of critical importance, given the role of 5-GABAARs in cognitive performance and their involvement in several brain diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differences in working memory coding of biological motion attributed to oneself and others</a></h4>

              
                The question how the brain distinguishes between information about oneself and the rest of the world is of fundamental interest to both philosophy and neuroscience. This question can be approached empirically by investigating how associating stimuli with oneself leads to differences in neurocognitive processing. However, little is known about the brain network involved in forming such self-associations for, specifically, bodily stimuli. In this fMRI study, we sought to distinguish the neural substrates of representing a full-body movement as one's movement and as someone else's movement. Participants performed a delayed match-to-sample working memory task where a retained full-body movement (displayed using point-light walkers) was arbitrarily labelled as one's own movement or as performed by someone else. By using arbitrary associations we aimed to address a limitation of previous studies, namely that our own movements are more familiar to us than movements of other people. A searchlight multivariate decoding analysis was used to test where information about types of movement and about self-association was coded. Movement specific activation patterns was found in a network of regions also involved in perceptual processing of movement stimuli, however not in early sensory regions. Information about whether a memorized movement was associated with the self or with another person was found to be coded by activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), bilateral supplementary motor area, and (at reduced threshold) in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). These areas are frequently reported as involved in action understanding (IFG, MFG) and domain-general self/other distinction (TPJ). Finally, in univariate analysis we found that selecting a self-associated movement for retention was related to increased activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Association between Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status and Executive System Activation in Youth</a></h4>

              
                Low socioeconomic status has been shown to have detrimental effects on cognitive performance, including working memory (WM). As executive systems that support WM undergo functional neurodevelopment during adolescence, environmental stressors at both the individual and community levels may have a particularly strong impact on cognitive outcomes. Here, we sought to examine how neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) impacts task-related activation of the executive system during adolescence and to determine whether this effect mediates the relationship between neighborhood SES and WM performance. To address these questions, we studied 1,158 youths (age 8-22) that completed a fractal n-back WM task during fMRI at 3T as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We found that higher neighborhood SES was associated with greater activation of the executive system to WM load, including the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and precuneus. These associations remained significant when controlling for related factors like parental education and exposure to traumatic events. Furthermore, high dimensional multivariate mediation analysis identified two distinct patterns of brain activity within the executive system that significantly mediated the relationship between neighborhood SES and task performance. Together, these findings underscore the importance of neighborhood environment in shaping executive system function and WM in youth.
