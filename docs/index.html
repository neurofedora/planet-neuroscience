                Background: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and its associated factors among people living with HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh.   Methods: This cross-sectional study, which took place in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from July to December 2020, included 338 HIV-positive people. The method used was a simple random sampling technique. The Beck Depression Inventory assessed depression in HIV-positive people (BDI).    Results: More than 62 percent of the 338 people surveyed had severe depression, 30.5 percent had moderate depression, 5.6 percent had mild depression, and 1.8 percent had no depression at all. Age, being a man, being married, and having a low monthly income were all significant predictors of depression.  Conclusions: This study found that depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among HIV-positive patients in Bangladesh. The authors recommend that health care providers address depressive disorders for people with HIV/ AIDS comprehensively.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Causal reasoning over knowledge graphs leveraging drug-perturbed and disease-specific transcriptomic signatures for drug discovery</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Domingo-Fernández, Yojana Gadiya, Abhishek Patel, Sarah Mubeen, Daniel Rivas-Barragan, Chris W. Diana, Biswapriya B. Misra, David Healey, Joe Rokicki, Viswa Colluru</p>

Network-based approaches are becoming increasingly popular for drug discovery as they provide a systems-level overview of the mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology. They have demonstrated significant early promise over other methods of biological data representation, such as in target discovery, side effect prediction and drug repurposing. In parallel, an explosion of -omics data for the deep characterization of biological systems routinely uncovers molecular signatures of disease for similar applications. Here, we present RPath, a novel algorithm that prioritizes drugs for a given disease by reasoning over causal paths in a knowledge graph (KG), guided by both drug-perturbed as well as disease-specific transcriptomic signatures. First, our approach identifies the causal paths that connect a drug to a particular disease. Next, it reasons over these paths to identify those that correlate with the transcriptional signatures observed in a drug-perturbation experiment, and anti-correlate to signatures observed in the disease of interest. The paths which match this signature profile are then proposed to represent the mechanism of action of the drug. We demonstrate how RPath consistently prioritizes clinically investigated drug-disease pairs on multiple datasets and KGs, achieving better performance over other similar methodologies. Furthermore, we present two case studies showing how one can deconvolute the predictions made by RPath as well as predict novel targets.

The increasing availability of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from various developmental systems provides the opportunity to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) directly from data. Herein we describe IQCELL, a platform to infer, simulate, and study executable logical GRNs directly from scRNA-seq data. Such executable GRNs allow simulation of fundamental hypotheses governing developmental programs and help accelerate the design of strategies to control stem cell fate. We first describe the architecture of IQCELL. Next, we apply IQCELL to scRNA-seq datasets from early mouse T-cell and red blood cell development, and show that the platform can infer overall over 74% of causal gene interactions previously reported from decades of research. We will also show that dynamic simulations of the generated GRN qualitatively recapitulate the effects of known gene perturbations. Finally, we implement an IQCELL gene selection pipeline that allows us to identify candidate genes, without prior knowledge. We demonstrate that GRN simulations based on the inferred set yield results similar to the original curated lists. In summary, the IQCELL platform offers a versatile tool to infer, simulate, and study executable GRNs in dynamic biological systems.

                <p>by Sara Brin Rosenthal, Hao Wang, Da Shi, Cin Liu, Ruben Abagyan, Linda K. McEvoy, Chi-Hua Chen</p>

Integration of multi-omics data with molecular interaction networks enables elucidation of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using the latest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including proxy cases and the STRING interactome, we identified an AD network of 142 risk genes and 646 network-proximal genes, many of which were linked to synaptic functions annotated by mouse knockout data. The proximal genes were confirmed to be enriched in a replication GWAS of autopsy-documented cases. By integrating the AD gene network with transcriptomic data of AD and healthy temporal cortices, we identified 17 gene clusters of pathways, such as up-regulated complement activation and lipid metabolism, down-regulated cholinergic activity, and dysregulated RNA metabolism and proteostasis. The relationships among these pathways were further organized by a hierarchy of the AD network pinpointing major parent nodes in graph structure including endocytosis and immune reaction. Control analyses were performed using transcriptomics from cerebellum and a brain-specific interactome. Further integration with cell-specific RNA sequencing data demonstrated genes in our clusters of immunoregulation and complement activation were highly expressed in microglia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Predicting drug polypharmacology from cell morphology readouts using variational autoencoder latent space arithmetic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuen Ler Chow, Shantanu Singh, Anne E. Carpenter, Gregory P. Way</p>

A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a machine learning algorithm, useful for generating a compressed and interpretable latent space. These representations have been generated from various biomedical data types and can be used to produce realistic-looking simulated data. However, standard vanilla VAEs suffer from entangled and uninformative latent spaces, which can be mitigated using other types of VAEs such as β-VAE and MMD-VAE. In this project, we evaluated the ability of VAEs to learn cell morphology characteristics derived from cell images. We trained and evaluated these three VAE variants—Vanilla VAE, β-VAE, and MMD-VAE—on cell morphology readouts and explored the generative capacity of each model to predict compound polypharmacology (the interactions of a drug with more than one target) using an approach called latent space arithmetic (LSA). To test the generalizability of the strategy, we also trained these VAEs using gene expression data of the same compound perturbations and found that gene expression provides complementary information. We found that the β-VAE and MMD-VAE disentangle morphology signals and reveal a more interpretable latent space. We reliably simulated morphology and gene expression readouts from certain compounds thereby predicting cell states perturbed with compounds of known polypharmacology. Inferring cell state for specific drug mechanisms could aid researchers in developing and identifying targeted therapeutics and categorizing off-target effects in the future.

                <p>by Nir Gavish, Guy Katriel</p>

COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for children of age five and older in many countries. However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether children should be vaccinated and at what priority. In this work, we use mathematical modeling and optimization to study how vaccine allocations to different age groups effect epidemic outcomes. In particular, we consider the effect of extending vaccination campaigns to include the vaccination of children. When vaccine availability is limited, we consider Pareto-optimal allocations with respect to competing measures of the number of infections and mortality and systematically study the trade-offs among them. In the scenarios considered, when some weight is given to the number of infections, we find that it is optimal to allocate vaccines to adolescents in the age group 10-19, even when they are assumed to be less susceptible than adults. We further find that age group 0-9 is included in the optimal allocation for sufficiently high values of the basic reproduction number.

                <p>by Benedict Borer, Dani Or</p>

Resource patchiness and aqueous phase fragmentation in soil may induce large differences local growth conditions at submillimeter scales. These are translated to vast differences in bacterial age from cells dividing every thirty minutes in close proximity to plant roots to very old cells experiencing negligible growth in adjacent nutrient poor patches. In this study, we link bacterial population demographics with localized soil and hydration conditions to predict emerging generation time distributions and estimate mean bacterial cell ages using mechanistic and heuristic models of bacterial life in soil. Results show heavy-tailed distributions of generation times that resemble a power law for certain conditions, suggesting that we may find bacterial cells of vastly different ages living side by side within small soil volumes. Our results imply that individual bacteria may exist concurrently with all of their ancestors, resulting in an archive of bacterial cells with traits that have been gained (and lost) throughout time–a feature unique to microbial life. This reservoir of bacterial strains and the potential for the reemergence of rare strains with specific functions may be critical for ecosystem stability and function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Gene-rich germline-restricted chromosomes in black-winged fungus gnats evolved through hybridization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christina N. Hodson, Kamil S. Jaron, Susan Gerbi, Laura Ross</p>

Germline-restricted DNA has evolved in diverse animal taxa and is found in several vertebrate clades, nematodes, and flies. In these lineages, either portions of chromosomes or entire chromosomes are eliminated from somatic cells early in development, restricting portions of the genome to the germline. Little is known about why germline-restricted DNA has evolved, especially in flies, in which 3 diverse families, Chironomidae, Cecidomyiidae, and Sciaridae, carry germline-restricted chromosomes (GRCs). We conducted a genomic analysis of GRCs in the fungus gnat <i>Bradysia</i> (<i>Sciara</i>) <i>coprophila</i> (Diptera: Sciaridae), which has 2 large germline-restricted “L” chromosomes. We sequenced and assembled the genome of <i>B</i>. <i>coprophila</i> and used differences in sequence coverage and k-mer frequency between somatic and germline tissues to identify GRC sequence and compare it to the other chromosomes in the genome. We found that the GRCs in <i>B</i>. <i>coprophila</i> are large, gene rich, and have many genes with divergent homologs on other chromosomes in the genome. We also found that 2 divergent GRCs exist in the population we sequenced. GRC genes are more similar in sequence to genes from another Dipteran family (Cecidomyiidae) than to homologous genes from Sciaridae. This unexpected finding suggests that these chromosomes likely arose in Sciaridae through hybridization with a related lineage. These results provide a foundation from which to answer many questions about the evolution of GRCs in Sciaridae, such as how this hybridization event resulted in GRCs and what features on these chromosomes cause them to be restricted to the germline.

                <p>by Tom G. Richardson, Genevieve M. Leyden, Qin Wang, Joshua A. Bell, Benjamin Elsworth, George Davey Smith, Michael V. Holmes</p>

Large-scale molecular profiling and genotyping provide a unique opportunity to systematically compare the genetically predicted effects of therapeutic targets on the human metabolome. We firstly constructed genetic risk scores for 8 drug targets on the basis that they primarily modify low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (HMGCR, PCKS9, and NPC1L1<i>)</i>, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (CETP), or triglycerides (APOC3, ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and LPL). Conducting mendelian randomisation (MR) provided strong evidence of an effect of drug-based genetic scores on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk with the exception of ANGPTL3. We then systematically estimated the effects of each score on 249 metabolic traits derived using blood samples from an unprecedented sample size of up to 115,082 UK Biobank participants. Genetically predicted effects were generally consistent among drug targets, which were intended to modify the same lipoprotein lipid trait. For example, the linear fit for the MR estimates on all 249 metabolic traits for genetically predicted inhibition of LDL cholesterol lowering targets HMGCR and PCSK9 was r<sup>2</sup> = 0.91. In contrast, comparisons between drug classes that were designed to modify discrete lipoprotein traits typically had very different effects on metabolic signatures (for instance, HMGCR versus each of the 4 triglyceride targets all had r<sup>2</sup> < 0.02). Furthermore, we highlight this discrepancy for specific metabolic traits, for example, finding that LDL cholesterol lowering therapies typically had a weak effect on glycoprotein acetyls, a marker of inflammation, whereas triglyceride modifying therapies assessed provided evidence of a strong effect on lowering levels of this inflammatory biomarker. Our findings indicate that genetically predicted perturbations of these drug targets on the blood metabolome can drastically differ, despite largely consistent effects on risk of CAD, with potential implications for biomarkers in clinical development and measuring treatment response.

                Background: Clomiphene citrate (CC) is known to improve semen quality for men with infertility, but there are no published algorithms to predict the changes in an individual’s semen parameters following CC therapy. Since there are multiple options to treat men with infertility, a model to predict the outcomes of CC therapy would allow men to make a more informed decision on their treatment choices.  Methods: This is a prospective study on a cohort of 121 infertile men being treated empirically with CC 25 mg every other day for a minimum of three months.  Men were included if they did not have other active fertility therapies other than the use of supplements.  Semen samples and a hormone profile (including total testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and leutinizing hormone (LH)) were provided prior to and at least three months after initiation of therapy.  The patient age, pre-CC hormone values and semen parameters were used to develop a nomogram to predict the post-CC hormone values and semen parameters. The model was developed with predictors selected using backward selection methods by minimizing root mean square error evaluated on 500 bootstrap runs. A zero-inflated negative binomial modeling (ZINB) approach was used to model sperm concentration and sperm motility.  A generalized linear model for the Gamma distribution was used to model testosterone. A linear model was used to model log transformed LH, FSH and semen volume.  Results:  Post-CC sperm parameters and hormone values were predicted by the pre-CC sperm concentration, hormone values and patient.  Nomograms were developed to predict the outcomes of CC therapy based on pre-CC parameters.     Conclusion:   These new models will help physicians personalize care by predicting the outcomes of therapy and allow clinicians to tailor the treatment to the individual couple.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">On the development of B-Raf inhibitors acting through innovative mechanisms [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                B-Raf is a protein kinase participating to the regulation of many biological processes in cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that this protein is frequently overactivated in human cancers, especially when it bears activating mutations. In recent years, few ATP-competitive inhibitors of B-Raf have been marketed for the treatment of melanoma and are currently under clinical evaluation on a variety of other types of cancer. Although the introduction of drugs targeting B-Raf has provided significant advances in cancer treatment, responses to such ATP-competitive inhibitors remain limited, mainly due to selectivity issues, side effects, narrow therapeutic windows, and the insurgence of drug resistance. Impressive research efforts have been made so far towards the identification of novel ATP-competitive modulators with improved efficacy against cancers driven by mutant Raf monomers and dimers, some of them showing good premises. However, several limitations could still be envisioned for these compounds, according to recent literature data. Besides, increased attentions have recently arisen around approaches based on the design of allosteric modulators, polypharmacology, PROTACs and drug repurposing for the targeting of B-Raf proteins. The design of compounds acting through such innovative mechanisms is rather challenging. However, novel valuable therapeutic opportunities can be envisioned on these drugs, as they act through innovative mechanisms in which limitations typically observed for approved ATP-competitive B-Raf inhibitors are less prone to emerge. In this article, the most recent approaches adopted for the design of non-ATP competitive inhibitors targeting B-Raf are described, discussing also on the possibilities, ligands acting through such innovative mechanisms could provide for the obtainment of more effective therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">External stressors prior to traumatic knee injury: A cohort study on youth athletes. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Data on external stressors, such as social and environment variables and other "life events", and its relation to injury in youth athletic population are scarce. Investigating if external stressors is associated with injury risk may help coaches and other team staff to provide a more safe sport environment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate different aspects of external stressors and its potential association to traumatic knee injury in youth athletes. Methods: This study comprised of youth female and male athletes from Swedish national sports high schools, aged 15–19 years, participating and competing in soccer, handball, or floorball. The athletes recorded any traumatic knee injury that had occurred during high-school in a web-based injury form. Data on external stressors and subjective perceived stress was also collected. Results: The majority (60%) of stress factors noted was related to sport context. More athletes in the injured group of athletes reported life event stressor (p=0.001) and experienced stress more often (p=0.02) compared to the group of non-injured athletes. No differences between injured and non-injured athletes in terms of change of club, team coach, training protocol or game formation were noted (p>0.05). A weak correlation (r=0.20, p=0.02) was found between the number of stressors and injuries. Conclusions: A high prevalence of external stressors are present in youth elite athletes with a majority of stress factors related to sport context. Life event stressors are present prior to injury and seem to be associated with traumatic knee injury to some degree.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Using social annotation to construct knowledge with others: A case study across undergraduate courses [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social annotation (SA) is a genre of learning technology that enables the addition of digital notes to shared texts and affords contextualized peer-to-peer online discussion. A small body of literature examines how SA, as asynchronous online discussion, can contribute to students’ knowledge construction (KC)—or a process whereby learners collaborate through shared socio-cognitive practices. This case study analyzed how SA enabled student participation in seven KC activities, such as interpretation and elaboration. Methods: We analyzed 2,121 annotations written by 59 students in three undergraduate courses at a Canadian University in the Winter 2019 semester. Using a method of open coding and constant comparison, we coded each annotation for evidence of KC activities. Results: Results showed a range of KC activities in students’ SA. Across courses, interpretation was the most common KC activity (40%), followed by elaboration (20%). Annotations that were part of peer-to-peer discussion included all seven types of KC activities, but some activities, such as consensus building, support, and conflict, were almost exclusively found in replies to others. Conclusions: This study suggests that SA is a productive form of online learning through which undergraduate students in multiple disciplinary contexts can interact with peers, make sense of academic content, and construct knowledge by reading and writing together.

                Aversion toward unfamiliarity is a hallmark of autism. Kruettner et al. show that in Shank3ΔC/ΔC autism model mice, exposure to novel environments lacking familiar features produces failure to engage and repetitive behaviors upon context re-exposure. Therefore, behavioral therapies involving familiarity might prevent the emergence of autism phenotypes in predisposed individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Corticohippocampal circuit dysfunction in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic variants in <i>SCN1A</i> encoding the Nav1.1 sodium channel subunit, characterized by treatment-resistant epilepsy, temperature-sensitive seizures, developmental delay/intellectual disability with features of autism spectrum disorder, and increased risk of sudden death. Convergent data suggest hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) pathology in DS (<i>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></i>) mice. We performed two-photon calcium imaging in brain slice to uncover a profound dysfunction of filtering of perforant path input by DG in young adult <i>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice. This was not due to dysfunction of DG parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs), which were only mildly impaired at this timepoint; however, we identified enhanced excitatory input to granule cells, suggesting that circuit dysfunction is due to excessive excitation rather than impaired inhibition. We confirmed that both optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal cortex and selective chemogenetic inhibition of DG PV-INs lowered seizure threshold <i>in vivo </i>in young adult <i>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice. Optogenetic activation of PV-INs, on the other hand, normalized evoked responses in granule cells <i>in vitro.</i> These results establish the corticohippocampal circuit as a key locus of pathology in <i>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup> </i>mice and suggest that PV-INs retain powerful inhibitory function and may be harnessed as a potential therapeutic approach towards seizure modulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Signature-scoring methods developed for bulk samples are not adequate for cancer single-cell RNA sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying the activity of gene expression signatures is common in analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Methods originally developed for bulk samples are often used for this purpose without accounting for contextual differences between bulk and single-cell data. More broadly, these methods have not been benchmarked. Here we benchmark five such methods, including single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), AUCell, Single Cell Signature Explorer (SCSE), and a new method we developed, Jointly Assessing Signature Mean and Inferring Enrichment (JASMINE). Using cancer as an example, we show cancer cells consistently express more genes than normal cells. This imbalance leads to bias in performance by bulk-sample-based ssGSEA in gold standard tests and down sampling experiments. In contrast, single-cell-based methods are less susceptible. Our results suggest caution should be exercised when using bulk-sample-based methods in single-cell data analyses, and cellular contexts should be taken into consideration when designing benchmarking strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Blocking Kir6.2 channels with SpTx1 potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from murine pancreatic β cells and lowers blood glucose in diabetic mice</a></h4>

              
                ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels in pancreatic β cells are comprised of pore-forming subunits (Kir6.2) and modulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR1). The ATP sensitivity of these channels enables them to couple metabolic state to insulin secretion in β cells. Antidiabetic sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide target SUR1 and indirectly suppress Kir6.2 activity. Glibenclamide acts as both a primary and a secondary secretagogue to trigger insulin secretion and potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, respectively. We tested whether blocking Kir6.2 itself causes the same effects as glibenclamide, and found that the Kir6.2 pore-blocking venom toxin SpTx1 acts as a strong secondary, but not a strong primary, secretagogue. SpTx1 triggered a transient rise of plasma insulin and lowered the elevated blood glucose of diabetic mice overexpressing Kir6.2 but did not affect those of nondiabetic mice. This proof-of-concept study suggests that blocking Kir6.2 may serve as an effective treatment for diabetes and other diseases stemming from K<sub>ATP</sub> hyperactivity that cannot be adequately suppressed with sulfonylureas.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KDM6B interacts with TFDP1 to activate P53 signalling in regulating mouse palatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic regulation plays extensive roles in diseases and development. Disruption of epigenetic regulation not only increases the risk of cancer, but can also cause various developmental defects. However, the question of how epigenetic changes lead to tissue-specific responses during neural crest fate determination and differentiation remains understudied. Using palatogenesis as a model, we reveal the functional significance of <i>Kdm6b</i>, a H3K27me3 demethylase, in regulating mouse embryonic development. Our study shows that <i>Kdm6b</i> plays an essential role in cranial neural crest development, and loss of <i>Kdm6b</i> disturbs P53 pathway-mediated activity, leading to complete cleft palate along with cell proliferation and differentiation defects in mice. Furthermore, activity of H3K27me3 on the promoter of <i>Trp53 </i>is antagonistically controlled by <i>Kdm6b</i>, and <i>Ezh2 </i>in cranial neural crest cells. More importantly, without <i>Kdm6b</i>, the transcription factor TFDP1, which normally binds to the promoter of <i>Trp53</i>, cannot activate <i>Trp53</i> expression in palatal mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the function of <i>Kdm6b</i> in activating <i>Trp53</i> in these cells cannot be compensated for by the closely related histone demethylase <i>Kdm6a</i>. Collectively, our results highlight the important role of the epigenetic regulator KDM6B and how it specifically interacts with TFDP1 to achieve its functional specificity in regulating <i>Trp53</i> expression, and further provide mechanistic insights into the epigenetic regulatory network during organogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Architecture and evolution of the cis-regulatory system of the echinoderm kirrelL gene</a></h4>

              
                The gene regulatory network (GRN) that underlies echinoderm skeletogenesis is a prominent model of GRN architecture and evolution. <i>KirrelL</i> is an essential downstream effector gene in this network and encodes an Ig-superfamily protein required for the fusion of skeletogenic cells and the formation of the skeleton. In this study, we dissected the transcriptional control region of the <i>kirrelL </i>gene of the purple sea urchin, <i>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</i>. Using plasmid- and BAC-based transgenic reporter assays, we identified key <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factor inputs that regulate <i>Sp-kirrelL</i>, including direct, positive inputs from two key transcription factors in the skeletogenic GRN, Alx1 and Ets1. We next identified <i>kirrelL</i> <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions from seven other echinoderm species that together represent all classes within the phylum. By introducing these heterologous regulatory regions into developing sea urchin embryos we provide evidence of their remarkable conservation across ~500 million years of evolution. We dissected in detail the <i>kirrelL</i> regulatory region of the sea star, <i>Patiria miniata</i>, and demonstrated that it also receives direct inputs from Alx1 and Ets1. Our findings identify <i>kirrelL</i> as a component of the ancestral echinoderm skeletogenic GRN. They support the view that GRN sub-circuits, including specific transcription factor-CRE interactions, can remain stable over vast periods of evolutionary history. Lastly, our analysis of <i>kirrelL</i> establishes direct linkages between a developmental GRN and an effector gene that controls a key morphogenetic cell behavior, cell-cell fusion, providing a paradigm for extending the explanatory power of GRNs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis for an unprecedented enzymatic alkylation in cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                The cyanobacterial enzyme CylK assembles the cylindrocyclophane natural products by performing two unusual alkylation reactions, forming new carbon-carbon bonds between aromatic rings and secondary alkyl halide substrates. This transformation is unprecedented in biology and the structure and mechanism of CylK are unknown. Here, we report x-ray crystal structures of CylK, revealing a distinctive fusion of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding domain and a β-propeller fold. We use a mutagenic screening approach to locate CylK's active site at its domain interface, identifying two residues, Arg105 and Tyr473, that are required for catalysis. Anomalous diffraction datasets collected with bound bromide ions, a product analog, suggest these residues interact with the alkyl halide electrophile. Additional mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations implicates Asp440 in activating the nucleophilic aromatic ring. Bioinformatic analysis of CylK homologs from other cyanobacteria establishes that they conserve these key catalytic amino acids but they are likely associated with divergent reactivity and altered secondary metabolism. By gaining a molecular understanding of this unusual biosynthetic transformation, this work fills a gap in our understanding of how alkyl halides are activated and used by enzymes as biosynthetic intermediates, informing enzyme engineering, catalyst design, and natural product discovery.

                Syntax involves complex neurobiological mechanisms, which are difficult to disentangle for multiple reasons. Using a protocol able to separate syntactic information from sound information we investigated the neural causal connections evoked by the processing of homophonous phrases, either verb phrases (VP) or noun phrases (NP). We used event-related causality (ERC) from stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in 10 epileptic patients in multiple cortical areas, including language areas and their homologous in the non-dominant hemisphere. We identified the different networks involved in the processing of these syntactic operations (faster in the dominant hemisphere) showing that VPs engage a wider cortical network. We also present a proof-of-concept for the decoding of the syntactic category of a perceived phrase based on causality measures. Our findings help unravel the neural correlates of syntactic elaboration and show how a decoding based on multiple cortical areas could contribute to the development of speech prostheses for speech impairment mitigation.

                Age-related deficits in auditory nerve (AN) function reduce afferent input to the auditory cortex. The extent to which the auditory cortex in older adults compensates for this loss of afferent input, also known as central gain, and the mechanisms underlying this compensation are not well understood. We took a neural systems approach to estimate central gain, measuring AN and cortical evoked responses within 50 older and 27 younger adults. Amplitudes were significantly smaller for older than for younger adults for AN responses but not for cortical responses. We used the relationship between AN and cortical response amplitudes in younger adults to predict cortical response amplitudes for older adults from their AN responses. Central gain in older adults was thus defined as the difference between their observed cortical responses and those predicted from the parameter estimates of younger adults. More central gain was associated with decreased cortical levels of GABA measured with 1H-MRS and poorer speech recognition in noise (SIN). Effects of central gain and GABA on SIN occur in addition to, and independent from, effects attributed to elevated hearing thresholds. Our results are consistent with animal models of central gain and suggest that reduced AN afferent input in some older adults may result in changes in cortical encoding and inhibitory neurotransmission, which contribute to reduced SIN. An advancement in our understanding of the changes that occur throughout the auditory system in response to the gradual loss of input with increasing age may provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

                Autosomal recessive mutations in either PRKN or PINK1 are associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease. The corresponding proteins, PRKN, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the mitochondrial serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1 play a role in mitochondrial quality control. Using CRISPR/CAS9 technology we generated three human iPSC lines from the well characterized AIW002-02 control line. These isogenic iPSCs contain homozygous knockouts of PRKN (PRKN-KO, CBIGi001-A-1), PINK1 (PINK1-KO, CBIGi001-A-2) or both PINK1 and PRKN (PINK1-KO/PRKN-KO, CBIGi001-A-3). The knockout lines display normal karyotypes, express pluripotency markers and upon differentiation into relevant brain cells or midbrain organoids may be valuable tools to model Parkinson's disease.

                The tremendous increase of video-based eye tracking has made it possible to collect data from thousands of participants. Traditional manual detection and classification procedures for saccades and trial categorization is not viable for the large data sets being collected. Additionally, high-speed video-based eye trackers now allow for the novel analysis of pupil responses and blink behavior. Here we present a detailed description of our pipeline for collecting data, storing data, organizing participant codes, and cleaning data, which are fairly lab-specific but nonetheless important precursory steps in establishing standardized pipelines. More importantly, we also include descriptions of the automated detection and classification of saccades, blinks, blincades (blinks occurring during saccades), and boomerang saccades (two saccades in opposite directions that occur almost simultaneously so that speed-based algorithms fail to split them), which are almost entirely task-agnostic and can be used on a wide variety of data. We additionally describe novel findings about post-saccadic oscillations, and provide a method to get more accurate estimates for end-points of saccades. Lastly, we describe the automated behavior classification for the Interleaved Pro- and Anti-Saccade Task (IPAST), a well-known task that probes voluntary and inhibitory control. This pipeline was evaluated using data collected from 592 human participants between 5 and 93 years of age, making it robust enough to handle large clinical patient data sets as well. In sum, this pipeline has been optimized to consistently handle large data sets obtained from diverse study cohorts (i.e., development, aging, clinical), and collected across multiple laboratory sites.

                Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common complication of diabetes, but the underlying molecular pathogenesis remains unclear. Accumulating evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in DPN, while their expressions and functions in Schwann cell (SC) are rarely reported. Here, we performed protein profiling and circRNA sequencing on the peripheral nerves of patients with or without DPN. A total of 265 differentially expressed proteins were identified in DPN by protein profiling, which mainly enrich in myelination according to Gene Ontology analysis. Further, 15637 circRNAs were identified by circRNA sequencing, of which 11 were verified to be dysregulated. Among them, circ_0002538 was found to be downregulated in DPN and chosen for further investigation. Functional experiments revealed that circ_0002538 overexpression promoted SC migration and relieved demyelination in DPN. Mechanistic studies revealed that circ_0002538 could promote PLLP expression by sponging miR-138-5p, while lack of circ_0002538 led to PLLP deficiency, which further suppressed SC migration and caused demyelination. The present research provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of DPN, in which the circ_0002538/miR-138-5p/PLLP axis was suppressed in SCs and hence caused demyelination. These findings expanded the role of circRNAs in DPN and provided potential therapeutic targets for DPN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-deletion-mutant, third-generation rabies viral vectors allow nontoxic retrograde targeting of projection neurons with greatly increased efficiency</a></h4>

              
                Rabies viral vectors have become important components of the systems neuroscience toolkit, allowing both direct retrograde targeting of projection neurons and monosynaptic tracing of inputs to defined postsynaptic populations, but the rapid cytotoxicity of first-generation ({triangleup}G) vectors limits their use to short-term experiments. We recently introduced second-generation, double-deletion-mutant ({triangleup}GL) rabies viral vectors, showing that they efficiently retrogradely infect projection neurons and express recombinases effectively but with little to no detectable toxicity; more recently, we have shown that {triangleup}GL viruses can be used for monosynaptic tracing with far lower cytotoxicity than the first-generation system. Here we introduce third-generation ({triangleup}L) rabies viral vectors, which, like first-generation vectors, have only a single gene deleted from their genomes (in this case the viral polymerase gene L) but which we find are as nontoxic as second-generation ones: using longitudinal structural and functional two-photon imaging in mouse visual cortex in vivo, we found that they did not kill labeled neurons or perturb their response properties over the entire months-long courses of imaging. Although third-generation vectors are therefore phenotypically very similar to second-generation ones, we show that they have the major advantage of growing to much higher titers, and this key difference results in 25% - 525% increased numbers of retrogradely labeled neurons in vivo. These {triangleup}L rabies viral vectors therefore constitute a new state of the art for nontoxic, pathway-specific expression of recombinases and transactivators in mammalian neurons selected on the basis of their axonal projections. Because replication of deletion-mutant rabies viruses within complementing cells is precisely the process that underlies monosynaptic tracing, the higher replication efficiency of this new class of rabies viral vectors furthermore suggests the potential to provide the foundation of an improved nontoxic monosynaptic tracing system.

                Early-life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to develop neuropsychiatric conditions, which are more prevalent in women than men. Efforts to model this sex difference in rodents have produced mixed results, with some studies paradoxically showing stronger phenotypes in males than females. Since changes in reproductive hormone levels can increase the likelihood of anxiety disorders in women, we examined the effects of ELA on adult female mice across the estrous cycle. We found that during diestrus, when the ratio of progesterone to estrogen is relatively high, ELA mice exhibit increased avoidance behavior, altered activity levels in specific contexts, and increased theta oscillation power in the ventral hippocampus. Ovariectomy, which eliminates circulating estrogen but not progesterone, unexpectedly preserved some of the effects present in diestrus ELA mice. Progesterone receptor antagonism in diestrus normalized avoidance behavior in ELA mice, while treatment with a negative allosteric modulator of the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone promoted avoidance behavior in control mice. These results suggest that altered progesterone and allopregnanolone signaling during diestrus increases avoidance behavior in ELA mice

                We created resources to facilitate research on the role of human brain microstructure in the development of mental health disorders, based on openly-available diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study. First, we curated the HBN dMRI data (N=2747) into the Brain Imaging Data Structure and preprocessed it according to best-practices, including denoising and correcting for motion effects, susceptibility-related distortions, and eddy currents. Preprocessed, analysis-ready data was made openly available. Data quality plays a key role in the analysis of dMRI, and we provide automated quality control (QC) scores for every scan, as part of the data release. To scale QC to this large dataset, we trained a neural network through the combination of a small data subset scored by experts and a larger set scored by community scientists. The network performs QC highly concordant with that of experts on a held out set (ROC-AUC=0.947). A further analysis of the neural network demonstrates that it relies on image features with relevance to QC. Altogether, this work both delivers a resource for transdiagnostic research in brain connectivity and pediatric mental health and serves as a novel tool for automated QC of large datasets.

                Excessive alcohol (ethanol) consumption, such as binge-drinking, is extremely commonplace and represents a major health concern. Through modeling excessive drinking in rodents, we are beginning to uncover the neurobiological and neurobehavioral causes and consequences of this pattern of ethanol intake. One important factor for modeling binge drinking in mice is that subjects reliably drink to blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) of 80 mg/dl or higher. Drinking-in-the-dark (DID) is a commonly used mouse model of binge drinking, and we have shown these methods reliably result in robust ethanol front-loading and binge-level BECs in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as well as other ethanol-preferring mouse strains/lines. However, establishing the DID model in a new vivarium space forced us to consider the use of rodent diet formulations we had not previously used. The current set of experiments were designed to investigate the role of two standard rodent diet formulations on binge drinking and the development of ethanol front-loading using DID. We found that BECs in animals maintained on LabDiet 5001 (LD01) were double those found in mice maintained on Teklad 2920x (TL20). Interestingly, this effect was paralleled by differences in the degree of front-loading, such that LD01-fed mice consumed approximately twice as much ethanol in the first 15 minutes of the 2-hour DID sessions compared to TL20-fed mice. Surprisingly however, mice that developed front-loading during maintenance on the LD01 diet continued to display front-loading behavior after being switched to the TL20 diet. These data emphasize the importance of choosing and reporting diet formulations when conducting voluntary drinking studies and support the need for further investigation into the mechanisms behind diet-induced differences in binge drinking, particularly front-loading.

                The functional anatomy of fascicles evident in human and large mammal cervical vagus nerve is unknown. Organ-specific organization in the pig cervical nerve has been observed for cardiac, recurrent laryngeal and pulmonary function using anatomical tracing with X-ray microCT, and functional connectivity with selective stimulation or fast neural Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) with a custom nerve cuff. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) is currently used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and depression but current practice of stimulation of the entire nerve causes undesired side effects. These findings pave the way for improved outcomes in VNS as unwanted side effects could be reduced by targeted selective stimulation of identified organ-specific fascicles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Geometric View of Signal Sensitivity Metrics in multi-echo fMRI</a></h4>

              
                In multi-echo fMRI (ME-fMRI), two metrics have been widely used to measure the performance of various acquisition and analysis approaches. These are temporal SNR (tSNR) and differential contrast-to-noise ratio (dCNR). A key step in ME-fMRI is the weighted combination of the data from multiple echoes, and prior work has examined the dependence of tSNR and dCNR on the choice of weights. However, most studies have focused on only one of these two metrics, and the relationship between the two metrics has not been examined. In this work, we present a geometric view that offers greater insight into the relation between the two metrics and their weight dependence. We identify three major regimes: (1) a tSNR robust regime in which tSNR is robust to the weight selection with most weight variants achieving close to optimal performance, whereas dCNR shows a pronounced dependence on the weights with most variants achieving suboptimal performance; (2) a dCNR robust regime in which dCNR is robust to the weight selection with most weight variants achieving close to optimal performance, while tSNR exhibits a strong dependence on the weights with most variants achieving significantly lower than optimal performance; and (3) a within-type robust regime in which both tSNR and dCNR achieve nearly optimal performance when the form of the weights are variants of their respective optimal weights and exhibit a moderate decrease in performance for other weight variants. Insight into the behavior observed in the different regimes is gained by considering spherical representations of the weight dependence of the components used to form each metric.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Load Non-Linearly Modulates Movement Reflex Gain in an Insect Leg via a Distributed Network of Identified Nonspiking Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Producing context-specific motor acts requires sensorimotor neural networks to integrate multiple sensory modalities. Some of this integration occurs via presynaptic interactions between proprioceptive afferent neurons themselves, other by afferents of different modalities targeting appropriate motor neurons (MNs). How the interneuronal network typically interposed between sensory afferents and MNs contributes to this integration, particularly at single-neuron resolution, is much less understood. In stick insects, this network contains nonspiking interneurons (NSIs) converging onto the posture-controlling slow extensor tibiae motor neuron (SETi). We analyzed how load altered movement signal processing by tracing the interaction of movement (femoral chordotonal organ, fCO) and load (tibial campaniform sensilla, tiCS) signals from the afferents through the NSI network to the motor output. On the afferent level, load reduced movement signal gain by presynaptic inhibition; tiCS stimulation elicited primary afferent depolarization and reduced fCO afferent action potential amplitude. In the NSI network, graded responses to movement and load inputs summed nonlinearly and increased the gain of NSIs opposing movement-induced reflexes. The gain of SETi and muscle movement reflex responses consequently decreased. Gain modulation was movement parameter-specific and required presynaptic inhibition; pharmacologically blocking presynaptic inhibition abolished load-dependent tuning of SETi responses. These data describe sensorimotor gain control at the sensory, premotor, and motor levels. Presynaptic inhibition-mediated nonlinear integration allowed the NSI network to respond to movement sensory input in a context (load)-dependent manner. These findings show how gain changes can allow premotor networks to integrate multiple sensory modalities and thus generate context-appropriate motor activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A role for thalamic projection GABAergic neurons in circadian responses to light</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is an important hub for sensory information and participates in sensory perception, regulation of attention, arousal and sleep. These functions are executed primarily by glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons that extend axons to the cortex and initiate cortico-thalamocortical connectional loops. However, the thalamus also contains projection GABAergic neurons that do not engage in direct communication with the cortex. Here, we have harnessed recent insight into the development of the intergeniculate (IGL), the ventrolateral geniculate (LGv) and the perihabenula (pHB) to specifically target and manipulate thalamic projection GABAergic neurons in female and male mice. Our results show that thalamic GABAergic neurons of the IGL and LGv receive retinal input from diverse classes of ipRGCs, but not from the M1 ipRGC type, while those in the pHB lack direct retinal input. We describe the synergistic role of the photoreceptor melanopsin and the thalamic neurons of the IGL/LGv in circadian entrainment to dim light. We identify a requirement for the thalamic IGL/LGv in the rapid changes in vigilance states associated with circadian light transitions. Furthermore, we map a previously undescribed thalamic network of developmentally related GABAergic neurons in the IGL/LGv complex and the pHB potentially involved in light-dependent mood regulation.

                Neurovascular coupling (NVC) modulates cerebral blood flow to match increased metabolic demand during neuronal excitation. Activation of inhibitory interneurons also increase blood flow, but the basis for this inhibitory NVC is unclear. We performed two-photon microscopy in awake mice to examine the correlation between astrocytic Ca2+ and NVC, evoked by activity in either all (VGATIN) or parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons (PVIN). Optogenetic stimulation of VGATIN and PVIN in the somatosensory cortex triggered astrocytic Ca2+ increases that were abolished by anaesthesia. PVIN evoked astrocytic Ca2+ responses with a short latency that preceded NVC, whereas VGATIN evoked Ca2+ increases that were delayed relative to the NVC response. The early onset in PVIN evoked Ca2+ increases dependent on noradrenaline release from locus coeruleus, which also affected inhibitory NVC. Therefore, NVC mechanisms should be studied in awake mice and, though the relationship between interneuron activity and astrocytic Ca2+ is complex, we found a correlation between astrocyte activity and NVC in PVIN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-Related Central Gain with Degraded Neural Synchrony in the Auditory Brainstem of Mice and Humans</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with auditory nerve (AN) functional deficits and decreased inhibition in the central auditory system, amplifying central responses in a process known as central gain. Although central gain enhances response amplitudes, central gain may not restore disrupted response timing. In this translational study, we measured responses from the AN and auditory midbrain in younger and older mice and humans. We hypothesized that older mice and humans exhibit central gain without an improvement in inter-trial synchrony in the midbrain. Our data demonstrated greater age-related deficits in AN response amplitudes than auditory midbrain response amplitudes, as shown by significant interactions between neural generator and age group, indicating central gain in auditory midbrain. However, synchrony decreases with age in both the AN and midbrain responses. These results reveal age-related central gain without concomitant improvements in synchrony, consistent with those predictions based on decreases in inhibition. Persistent decreases in synchrony may contribute to auditory processing deficits in older mice and humans.

                Challenging the brain with experiential richness creates tissue-level changes and synaptic plasticity, but the interjacent network level has not been accessible. We here show that environmental enrichment has unexpectedly far-reaching effects on network connectivity and multi-dimensional coding in the hippocampus. We present direct evidence that experience impacts local and global network connectivity, synchrony, and rhythmic dynamics. For this, we investigated the hippocampi from standard-housed mice (SD) and mice living in an enriched environment (ENR) using large-scale ex vivo recordings with a high-density microelectrode sensing array that with the unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution allowed simultaneous electrophysiological assessment across the entire circuit. In the absence of extrinsic electrical network stimulation, we found enhanced functional connectivity and high-dimensional coding in hippocampal-cortical networks of ENR mice. The mapped connectome illustrated a scale-free small-world topology and an ENR-induced resilience to random failures. ENR enhanced large-scale spatiotemporal firing patterns, which facilitated efficient pattern separation and boosted the information encoded in the firing phases of slow oscillatory rhythms. Given that essentially all electrophysiological studies on network behaviors have been done on animals housed in stimulus-poor conditions, our SD mice showed the expected normal functionality. The literature consequently underestimates the extent of spontaneous network activity and connectivity under truly physiological conditions. Our results pave the way to unveil fundamental mechanisms of experience-dependent enhancement in the hippocampal network underlying high brain functions and provide markers for large-scale network remodeling and metaplasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissecting the effects of adaptive encoding and predictive inference on a single perceptual estimation</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system exploits continuity in the visual environment, which induces two contrasting perceptual phenomena: repulsive aftereffects and attractive serial dependences. Recent studies have theorized that these two effects concurrently arise in perceptual processing, but empirical evidence that directly supports this hypothesis lacks. Here we show that the two effects concurrently modulate estimation behavior in a typical sequence of perceptual tasks. We first demonstrate that observers' estimation error as a function of both the previous stimulus and response cannot be fully described by either attractive or repulsive bias but is instead well captured by a summation of repulsion from the previous stimulus and attraction toward the previous response. We then reveal that the repulsive bias is centered on the observer's sensory encoding of the previous stimulus, which is again repelled away from the preceding trials, whereas the attractive bias is centered precisely on the previous response, which is the observer's best prediction about the incoming stimuli. Our findings provide strong evidence that sensory coding is shaped by dynamic tuning of the system to the past stimuli, inducing repulsive aftereffects, and followed by inference incorporating the prediction from the past estimation, leading to attractive serial dependence.

With the growing number and scale of neuroimaging data sharing initiatives of both healthy and clinical populations comes an opportunity to create large and heterogeneous sets of dynamic network models to better understand individual differences in network dynamics and their impact on brain health. Here we present TheVirtualBrain-UK Biobank pipeline, a robust, automated and open-source brain image processing solution to address the expanding scope of TheVirtualBrain project. Our pipeline generates connectome-based modelling inputs compatible for use with TheVirtualBrain. We leverage the existing multimodal MRI processing pipeline from the UK Biobank made for use with a variety of brain imaging modalities. We add various features and changes to the original UK Biobank implementation specifically for informing large-scale network models, including user-defined parcellations for the construction of matching whole-brain functional and structural connectomes. Changes also include detailed reports for quality control of all modalities, a streamlined installation process, modular software packaging, updated software versions, and support for various publicly available datasets. The pipeline has been tested on both healthy and clinical populations and is robust to the morphological changes observed in aging and dementia. In this paper, we describe these and other pipeline additions and modifications in detail, as well as how this pipeline fits into the TheVirtualBrain ecosystem.

                KIAA1109 (4932438A13Rik) is a novel gene linked to Alkuraya-Kucinska Syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder with severe brain malformations and arthrogryposis in humans. The role of KIAA1109 in mammalian development and function is unknown. Here, we characterize mutant mice deficient in Kiaa1109 (Kiaa1109 null). We report that Kiaa1109 null mice died during perinatal stages. These Kiaa1109 null embryos exhibited impaired intramuscular nerve growth and reduced sizes of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) compared with their littermate controls. Electrophysiological analysis further revealed defects in neuromuscular synaptic transmission in Kiaa1109 null embryos. Notably, the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release was markedly increased, whereas evoked neurotransmitter release and quantal content were reduced. Furthermore, neuromuscular synapses in Kiaa1109 null embryos failed to respond to a repetitive, low frequency stimulation (10Hz). These results demonstrate that KIAA1109 is required for survival in mice and for proper development and function of the NMJ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigation on How Dynamic Effective Connectivity Patterns Encode the Fluctuating Pain Intensity in Chronic Migraine</a></h4>

              
                Chronic migraine is characterised by persistent headaches for more than 15 days per month; the intensity of the pain is fluctuating over time. Here, we explored the dynamic interplay of connectivity patterns between regions known to be related to pain processing and their relation to the ongoing dynamic pain experience. We recorded EEG from 80 sessions (20 chronic migraine patients in 4 separate sessions of 25 minutes). The patients were asked to continuously rate the intensity of their endogenous headache. On different time-windows, a dynamic causal model (DCM) of cross spectral responses was inverted to estimate connectivity strengths. For each patient and session, the evolving dynamics of effective connectivity were related to pain intensities and to pain intensity changes by using a Bayesian linear model. Hierarchical Bayesian modelling was further used to examine which connectivity-pain relations are consistent across sessions and across patients. The results reflect the multi-facetted clinical picture of the disease. Across all sessions, each patient with chronic migraine exhibited a distinct pattern of pain intensity-related cortical connectivity. The diversity of the individual findings are accompanied by inconsistent relations between the connectivity parameters and pain intensity or pain intensity changes at group level. This suggests a rejection of the idea of a common neuronal core problem for chronic migraine.

                The hippocampus is a vertebrate brain structure that expresses spatial representations1 and is critical for navigation2,3. Navigation in turn intricately depends on locomotion; however, current accounts suggest a dissociation between hippocampal spatial representations and the details of locomotor processes. Specifically, the hippocampus is thought to primarily represent higher-order cognitive and locomotor variables like position, speed, and direction of movement4-7, while the limb movements that propel the animal are thought to be computed and represented primarily in subcortical circuits, including the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum8-11. Whether hippocampal representations are actually decoupled from the detailed structure of locomotor processes remains unknown. To address this question, we simultaneously monitored hippocampal spatial representations and ongoing limb movements underlying locomotion at fast timescales. We found that the forelimb stepping cycle in freely behaving rats is rhythmic and peaks at ~8 Hz during movement, matching the ~8 Hz organization of information processing in the hippocampus during locomotion12. We also discovered precisely timed coordination between the time at which the forelimbs touch the ground ('plant' times of the stepping cycle) and the hippocampal representation of space. Notably, plant times coincide with hippocampal representations closest to the actual position of the animal, while in-between these plant times, the hippocampal representation progresses towards possible future locations. This synchronization was specifically detectable when animals approached upcoming spatial decisions. Taken together, our results reveal profound and dynamic coordination on a timescale of tens of milliseconds between central cognitive representations and peripheral motor processes. This coordination engages and disengages rapidly in association with cognitive demands and is well suited to support rapid information exchange between cognitive and sensory-motor circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A key role of orientation in the coding of visual motion direction</a></h4>

              
                Despite the fundamental importance of visual motion processing, our understanding of how the brain represents basic aspects of motion is incomplete. While it is generally believed that direction is the main representational feature of motion, motion processing is also influenced by non-directional orientation signals that are present in most motion stimuli. Here, we aimed to test whether this non-directional motion axis determines motion perception even when orientation is completely absent from the stimulus. Using stimuli with and without orientation signals, we found that serial dependence in a simple motion direction estimation task was predominantly determined by the orientation of the previous motion stimulus. Moreover, the observed attraction profiles closely matched the characteristic pattern of serial attraction found in orientation perception. Evidently, the sequential integration of motion signals depends solely on the orientation of motion, indicating a fundamental role of non-directional orientation in the coding of visual motion direction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural and functional alterations of neuromuscular synapses in a mouse model of ACTA1 congenital myopathy</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in skeletal muscle alpha-actin (Acta1) cause a variety of myopathies. In a mouse model of congenital myopathy, Acta1 (H40Y) knock-in (Acta1+/Ki) mice exhibit features of human nemaline myopathy, including premature lethality, severe muscle weakness, reduced mobility, and nemaline rods in the skeletal muscle fiber. In this study, we investigated the structure and function of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Acta1+/Ki mice. We found marked impairments in NMJ structure in these mutant mice, including fragmented endplate and nerve terminals, reduced density of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the endplate membrane, reduced nerve occupancy of endplates, and increased numbers of muscle subsynaptic nuclei. We compared the NMJs in three different types of muscles: the extensor digitorum longus (EDL, fast-twitch muscle), soleus (slow-twitch) and the triangularis sterni muscle (TS, mixed type). Among these three types of muscles, EDL was affected to the most extent, suggesting that susceptibility to NMJ fragmentation is muscle type-specific. Electrophysiological analysis showed a reduced quantal size (reduced mEPP amplitude), increased mEPP frequency, increased quantal content and normal EPP amplitude in mutant NMJs. The results indicate that homeostatic compensation may have occurred at affected synapses to maintain the normal amount of neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, paired-pulse facilitation was reduced and synaptic depression under repetitive nerve stimulation was enhanced, indicating short-term synaptic plasticity was compromised in these mutant mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Categorical bias as a crucial parameter in visual working memory: the effect of memory load and retention interval</a></h4>

              
                Visual information can be stored as continuous as well as categorical representations in visual working memory (VWM) to guide subsequent behavior. Yet it is still unclear what determines whether VWM is represented as continuous or categorical information, or as a mix of both. Recent studies have shown that color VWM representations adjust flexibly depending on the number of memory items as well as the duration that these items need to be maintained for. The current study aims to extend and replicate these crucial effects. In a delayed estimation task, participants memorized one to four colored objects presented at different spatial locations, followed by a delay of 100, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 ms. Next, a probe indicated the location of the color that participants needed to report. We measured the extent to which responses were biased in the direction of prototypical colors. Crucially, we implemented this categorical bias in an extension to the classic mixture model (Zhang & Luck 2008) in which the center of the error distribution is a crucial parameter that characterizes the extent to which VWM is biased by color categories. We found that VWM shows a strong categorical bias in all cases, and that this bias increases with increasing memory load; strikingly, this effect of memory load on categorical bias is stronger at longer intervals (1,000 ms or longer), as compared to shorter intervals, yet it peaks for intermediate memory loads as opposed to the highest memory load. Overall, our results suggest that when visual information needs to be maintained for one second or longer, VWM becomes more reliant on categorical representations as memory load increases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Olfactory responses of Drosophila are encoded in the organization of projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                The projection neurons (PNs), reconstructed from electron microscope (EM) images of the Drosophila olfactory system, offer a detailed view of neuronal anatomy, providing glimpses into information flow in the brain. About 150 PNs constituting 51 glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL) are bundled together in the axonal extension, routing the olfactory signal received at the AL to the mushroom body (MB) calyx and the lateral horn (LH). Here we quantify the neuronal organization by inter-PN distances and examine its relationship with the odor types sensed by Drosophila. The homotypic PNs that constitute glomeruli in AL are tightly bundled and stereotyped in position; however, such a glomerular-like PN organization in AL is no longer sustained in the higher brain center. Instead, odor-type dependent clusters consisting of multiple different homotypes become more prevalent in MB calyx and LH. We find that there are statistically significant associations between the spatial organization among a group of homotypic PNs and certain stereotyped behavioral responses. In particular, pheromone-encoding homotypes are segregated from other neurons not only in LH but also in MB calyx. Our findings suggest that before neural computation in the inner brain, some of the olfactory responses are already encoded either by the homotype or in the spatial organization of PNs, illuminating that the labeled-line strategy is at work in the Drosophila olfactory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Persistent horizontal and vertical, MR-induced nystagmus in resting state Human Connectome Project data</a></h4>

              
                Strong magnetic fields from magnetic resonance (MR) scanners induce a Lorentz force that contributes to vertigo and persistent nystagmus. Prior studies have reported a predominantly horizontal direction for healthy subjects in a 7 Tesla (T) MR scanner, with slow phase velocity (SPV) dependent on head orientation. Less is known about vestibular signal behavior for subjects in a weaker, 3T magnetic field, the standard strength used in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The purpose of this study is to characterize the form and magnitude of nystagmus induced at 3T. Forty-two subjects were studied after being introduced head-first, supine into a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. Eye movements were recorded in four separate acquisitions over 20 minutes. A biometric eye model was fit to the recordings to derive rotational eye position and then SPV. An anatomical template of the semi-circular canals was fit to the T2 anatomical image from each subject, and used to derive the angle of the B0 magnetic field with respect to the vestibular apparatus. Recordings from 37 subjects yielded valid measures of eye movements. The population-mean SPV {+/-} SD for the horizontal component was -1.38 {+/-} 1.27 deg/sec, and vertical component was -0.93 {+/-} 1.44 deg/sec, corresponding to drift movement in the rightward and downward direction. Although there was substantial inter-subject variability, persistent nystagmus was present in half of subjects with no significant adaptation over the 20 minute scanning period. The amplitude of vertical drift was correlated with the roll angle of the vestibular system, with a non-zero vertical SPV present at a 0 degree roll. We conclude that non-habituating vestibular signals of varying amplitude are present in resting state data collected at 3T.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Active exploration of a novel environment drives the activation of the hippocampus-amygdala complex of domestic chicks.</a></h4>

              
                In birds, like in mammals, the hippocampus critically mediates spatial navigation through the formation of a spatial map. This study investigates the impact of active exploration of a novel environment on the hippocampus of young domestic chicks, during formation of a new spatial map. Chicks that were free to actively explore the novel environment exhibited a significantly higher neural activation (measured by c-Fos expression), compared to those that passively observed the novel environment from a restricted area. The difference was limited to the anterior and the dorsolateral parts of the intermediate hippocampus. Furthermore, the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala showed a higher c-Fos expression in the active exploration group than the passive observation group. In both brain regions, brain activation correlated with the number of locations that chicks visited during the test. This suggest that the increase of c-Fos expression in the hippocampus is related to increased firing rates of spatially coding neurons. Furthermore, our study indicates a functional linkage of the hippocampus and nucleus taeniae of the amygdala in processing spatial information. Overall, with the present study, we confirm that, in birds like in mammals, exploration of novel environments activates hippocampus, which is likely related to the formation of new spatial representations.

                Food-handling offers unique yet largely unexplored opportunities to investigate how cortical activity relates to forelimb movements in a natural, ethologically essential, and kinematically rich form of manual dexterity. To determine these relationships, we recorded spiking activity in mouse forelimb M1 and S1 and tongue/jaw M1. Activity in all areas was strongly modulated in close association with discrete active manipulation events that occurred intermittently as mice fed. Each area's activity was also partly distinct in its overall timing and phasic/tonic temporal profile, attributable to area-specific composition of activity classes. Forelimb position could be accurately predicted from activity in all three regions. These results thus establish that cortical activity during food-handling is manipulation-specific, distributed, and broadly similar across multiple cortical areas, while also exhibiting area- and submovement-specific relationships with the fast kinematic hallmarks of this form of complex, free-object-handling manual dexterity.

                Machine learning studies have shown that various phenotypes can be predicted from structural and functional brain images. However, in most such studies, prediction performance ranged from moderate to disappointing. It is unclear whether prediction performance will substantially improve with larger sample sizes or whether insufficient predictive information in brain images impedes further progress. Here, we systematically assess the effect of sample size on prediction performance using sample sizes far beyond what is possible in common neuroimaging studies. We project 3-9 fold improvements in prediction performance for behavioral and mental health phenotypes when moving from one thousand to one million samples. Moreover, we find that moving from single imaging modalities to multimodal input data can lead to further improvements in prediction performance, often on par with doubling the sample size. Our analyses reveal considerable performance reserves for neuroimaging-based phenotype prediction. Machine learning models may benefit much more from extremely large neuroimaging datasets than currently believed.

                Fine-tuned sensory functions are bases of efficient motor control and learning and typically characterize skilled individuals. Although numerous studies demonstrated enhanced unimodal sensory functions at both neural and behavioral levels in skilled individuals, little is known about their multisensory interaction, especially multisensory integration and selective attention that involve volitional control of information derived from multiple sensory organs. Here, we show unique multisensory interaction functions of expert pianists. Expert pianists and musically untrained individuals performed five sets of intensity discrimination tasks at the auditory and somatosensory modalities with different conditions: (1) auditory stimulus, (2) somatosensory stimulus, (3) congruent auditory and somatosensory stimuli (i.e., multisensory integration), (4) auditory and task-irrelevant somatosensory stimuli, and (5) somatosensory and task-irrelevant auditory stimuli. In the fourth and fifth conditions, participants were instructed to ignore a task-irrelevant stimulus and to pay attention to a task-relevant stimulus (i.e., selective attention). The unimodal intensity discrimination of the pianists was superior to that of the nonmusicians at the auditory modality but not at the somatosensory modality. While the discrimination perception was superior in the condition (3) compared to the better one of the individual unimodal conditions (i.e., conditions 1 and 2) only in the pianists, the task-irrelevant somatosensory stimulus worsened the auditory discrimination more in the pianists than the nonmusicians. These findings indicate efficient processing of multisensory information in expert pianists, which enables to benefit from multisensory integration of the auditory and somatosensory information, but exacerbates top-down selective inhibition of somatosensory information during auditory processing.

	<p>Background: Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON) is related to numerical skills. This study aimed to examine (1) the developmental trajectory of SFON and (2) the interrelations between SFON and early numerical skills at pre-school as well as their influence on arithmetical skills at school. Method: Overall, 1868 German pre-school children were repeatedly assessed until second grade. Nonverbal intelligence, visual attention, visuospatial working memory, SFON and numerical skills were assessed at age five (M = 63 months, Time 1) and age six (M = 72 months, Time 2), and arithmetic was assessed at second grade (M = 95 months, Time 3). Results: SFON increased significantly during pre-school. Path analyses revealed interrelations between SFON and several numerical skills, except number knowledge. Magnitude estimation and basic calculation skills (Time 1 and Time 2), and to a small degree number knowledge (Time 2), contributed directly to arithmetic in second grade. The connection between SFON and arithmetic was fully mediated by magnitude estimation and calculation skills at pre-school. Conclusion: Our results indicate that SFON first and foremost influences deeper understanding of numerical concepts at pre-school and&amp;amp;mdash;in contrast to previous findings &amp;amp;ndash;affects only indirectly children&amp;amp;rsquo;s arithmetical development at school.</p>

	<p>Using a visual world eye-tracking paradigm, we investigated the real-time auditory sentence processing of neurologically unimpaired listeners and individuals with aphasia. We examined whether lexical-semantic cues provided as adjectives of a target noun modulate the encoding and retrieval dynamics of a noun phrase during the processing of complex, non-canonical sentences. We hypothesized that the real-time processing pattern of sentences containing a semantically biased lexical cue (e.g., the venomous snake) would be different than sentences containing unbiased adjectives (e.g., the voracious snake). More specifically, we predicted that the presence of a biased lexical cue would facilitate (1) lexical encoding (i.e., boosted lexical access) of the target noun, snake, and (2) on-time syntactic retrieval or dependency linking (i.e., increasing the probability of on-time lexical retrieval at post-verb gap site) for both groups. For unimpaired listeners, results revealed a difference in the time course of gaze trajectories to the target noun (snake) during lexical encoding and syntactic retrieval in the biased compared to the unbiased condition. In contrast, for the aphasia group, the presence of biased adjectives did not affect the time course of processing the target noun. Yet, at the post-verb gap site, the presence of a semantically biased adjective influenced syntactic re-activation. Our results extend the cue-based parsing model by offering new and valuable insights into the processes underlying sentence comprehension of individuals with aphasia.</p>

                Background: A multitude of health care professionals, including pharmacists, are needed in managing a complex and silent disease like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). These health care professionals can increase patients’ health awareness regarding the prevention and the management of the disease. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of clinical pharmacist education, counseling and follow up on the management of NAFLD with MetS. Methods: This study recruited 102 patients with NAFLD and MetS. Participants received regular health education sessions concerning the disease and recommended lifestyle (diet and exercise) and were followed by clinical pharmacist for 6 months. At the end of the study, participants were divided into two groups; those compliant with education and follow up session (compliant group; n=61); and those attending > 60% but not completing whole sessions (non-compliant group; n=41). Anthropometric measures, liver function, lipid profile, homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), biochemical NAFLD score, radiological liver steatosis and fibrosis grade changes were recorded at baseline and endpoint. Results: The compliant group showed a more significant decrease in weight (p=0.003), low density lipoprotein (LDL) (p=0.009), and very LDL (p<0.001), and a more significant increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) (p=0.010) compared with the non-compliant group. Moreover, the compliant group showed a statistically significant higher number of patients achieving normalization of total cholesterol (p=0.002), HDL (p=0.004), waist circumference (p=0.004), improvement of body mass index category (p=0.008), liver steatosis grade (p=0.009), liver fibrosis grade (p<0.001), and absence of dyspeptic symptoms (p=0.0010) and hepatomegaly (p= 0.027) compared with the non-compliant group. Fasting blood glucose (p=0.209), fasting insulin (p=0.179), and HOMA-IR score (p=0.193) showed non-significant difference between both groups at endpoint. Conclusion: The educational intervention of a clinical pharmacist showed significant positive impact on ameliorating metabolic syndrome parameters and achieving desired NAFLD therapeutic outcomes.

                In contrast to traditional methods like real-time polymerase chain reaction, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and especially small RNA-seq, enables the untargeted investigation of the whole small RNAome, including microRNAs (miRNAs) but also a multitude of other RNA species. With the promising application of small RNAs as biofluid-based biomarkers, small RNA-seq is the method of choice for an initial discovery study. However, the presentation of specific quality aspects of small RNA-seq data varies significantly between laboratories and is lacking a common (minimal) standard. The miRNA NGS Discovery pipeline (miND) aims to bridge the gap between wet lab scientist and bioinformatics with an easy to setup configuration sheet and an automatically generated comprehensive report that contains all essential qualitative and quantitative results that should be reported. Besides the standard steps like preprocessing, mapping, visualization, and quantification of reads, the pipeline also incorporates differential expression analysis when given the appropriate information regarding sample groups. Although miND has a focus on miRNAs, other RNA species like tRNAs, piRNA, snRNA, or snoRNA are included and mapping statistics are available for further analysis. miND has been developed and tested on a multitude of data sets with various RNA sources (tissue, plasma, extracellular vesicles, urine, etc.) and different species. miND is a Snakemake based pipeline and thus incorporates all advantages using a flexible workflow management system. Reference databases are downloaded, prepared and built with an included (but separate) workflow and thus can easily be updated to the most recent version but also stored for reproducibility. In conclusion, the miND pipeline aims to streamline the bioinformatics processing of small RNA-seq data by standardizing the processing from raw data to a final, comprehensive and reproducible report.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Can enhancement and suppression concurrently guide attention? An assessment at the individual level [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although people can pay attention to targets while ignoring distractors, previous research suggests that target enhancement and distractor suppression work separately and independently. Here, we sought to replicate previous findings and re-establish their independence. Methods: We employed an internet-based psychological experiment. We presented participants with a visual search task in which they searched for a specified shape with or without a singleton. We replicated the singleton-presence benefit in search performance, but this effect was limited to cases where the target color was fixed across all trials. In a randomly intermixed probe task (30% of all trials), the participants searched for a letter among colored probes; we used this task to assess how far attention was separately allocated toward the target or distractor dimensions. Results: We found a negative correlation between target enhancement and distractor suppression, indicating that the participants who paid closer attention to target features ignored distractor features less effectively and vice versa. Averaged data showed no benefit from target color or cost from distractor color, possibly because of the substantial differences in strategy across participants. Conclusions: These results suggest that target enhancement and distractor suppression guide attention in mutually dependent ways and that the relative contribution of these components depends on the participants’ search strategy.

                In this opinion article, we discuss the formatting of files from (plant) genotyping studies, in particular the formatting of (meta-) data in Variant Call Format (VCF) files. The flexibility of the VCF format specification facilitates its use as a generic interchange format across domains but can lead to inconsistency between files in the presentation of metadata. To enable fully autonomous machine actionable data flow, generic elements need to be further specified. We strongly support the merits of the FAIR principles and see the need to facilitate them also through technical implementation specifications. VCF files are an established standard for the exchange and publication of genotyping data. Other data formats are also used to capture variant call data (for example, the HapMap format and the gVCF format), but none currently have the reach of VCF. In VCF, only the sites of variation are described, whereas in gVCF, all positions are listed, and confidence values are also provided. For the sake of simplicity, we will only discuss VCF and our recommendations for its use. However, the part of the VCF standard relating to metadata (as opposed to the actual variant calls) defines a syntactic format but no vocabulary, unique identifier or recommended content. In practice, often only sparse (if any) descriptive metadata is included. When descriptive metadata is provided, proprietary metadata fields are frequently added that have not been agreed upon within the community which may limit long-term and comprehensive interoperability. To address this, we propose recommendations for supplying and encoding metadata, focusing on use cases from the plant sciences. We expect there to be overlap, but also divergence, with the needs of other domains.

                In this essay, we argue that colleges of education, particularly those at research-intensive institutions, favor simplistic notions of scholarly impact and that this trend has concerning implications for the field, for researchers, and for the public at large. After describing the challenges and shortcomings of the current models of research assessment in education, we outline an alternative proposal in which trustworthiness and usability of research would complement traditional metrics of scholarly relevance. This proposal encourages a twofold approach to research assessment that involves (1) a more thorough analysis of the limitations and problems generated by the use of simplistic notions of scholarly impact, and (2) a commitment to the implementation of more equitable systems based on a broader range of assessment measures to assess faculty research contributions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Conditioning Lesion Response in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons Is Inhibited in Oncomodulin Knock-Out Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Regeneration can occur in peripheral neurons after injury, but the mechanisms involved are not fully delineated. Macrophages in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are involved in the enhanced regeneration that occurs after a conditioning lesion (CL), but how macrophages stimulate this response is not known. Oncomodulin (Ocm) has been proposed as a proregenerative molecule secreted by macrophages and neutrophils, is expressed in the DRG after axotomy, and stimulates neurite outgrowth by DRG neurons in culture. Wild-type (WT) and <I>Ocm</I> knock-out (KO) mice were used to investigate whether Ocm plays a role in the CL response in DRG neurons after sciatic nerve transection. Neurite outgrowth was measured after 24 and 48 h in explant culture 7 d after a CL. Sciatic nerve regeneration was also measured <I>in vivo</I> 7 d after a CL and 2 d after a subsequent sciatic nerve crush. The magnitude of the increased neurite outgrowth following a CL was significantly smaller in explants from <I>Ocm</I> KO mice than in explants from WT mice. <I>In vivo</I> after a CL, increased regeneration was found in WT animals but not in KO animals. Macrophage accumulation and levels of <I>interleukin-6</I> (<I>IL-6</I>) mRNA were measured in axotomized DRG from WT and <I>Ocm</I> KO animals, and both were significantly higher than in sham-operated ganglia. At 6 h after axotomy, <I>Il</I>-6 mRNA was higher in WT than in <I>Ocm</I> KO mice. Our data support the hypothesis that Ocm plays a necessary role in producing a normal CL response and that its effects possibly result in part from stimulation of the expression of proregenerative macrophage cytokines such as IL-6.</p>

                Sufficiency measures are potentially decisive for the decarbonisation of energy systems but rarely considered in energy policy and modelling. Just as efficiency and renewable energies, the diffusion of demand-side solutions to climate change also relies on policy-making. Our extensive literature review of European and national sufficiency policies fills a gap in existing databases. We present almost 300 policy instruments clustered into relevant categories and publish them as "Energy Sufficiency Policy Database". This paper provides a description of the data clustering, the set-up of the database and an analysis of the policy instruments. A key insight is that sufficiency policy includes much more than bans of products or information tools leaving the responsibility to individuals. It is a comprehensive instrument mix of all policy types, not only enabling sufficiency action, but also reducing currently existing barriers. A policy database can serve as a good starting point for policy recommendations and modelling, further research is needed on barriers and demand-reduction potentials of sufficiency policy instruments.

                The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) is a series of specifications for describing all aspects of the neuroimaging data lifecycle from raw data to analyses and provenance. NIDM uses community-driven terminologies along with unambiguous data dictionaries within a Resource Description Framework (RDF) document to describe data and metadata for integration and query. Data from different studies, using locally defined variable names, can be retrieved by linking them to higher-order concepts from established ontologies and terminologies. Through these capabilities, NIDM documents are expected to improve reproducibility and facilitate data discovery and reuse. PyNIDM is a Python toolbox supporting the creation, manipulation, and querying of NIDM documents. Using the query tools available in PyNIDM, users are able interrogate datasets to find studies that have collected variables measuring similar phenotypic properties. This, in turn, facilitates the transformation and combination of data across multiple studies. The focus of this manuscript is the linear regression tool which is a part of the PyNIDM toolbox and works directly on NIDM documents. It provides a high-level statistical analysis that aids researchers in gaining more insight into the data that they are considering combining across studies. This saves researchers valuable time and effort while showing potential relationships between variables. The linear regression tool operates through a command-line interface integrated with the other tools (pynidm linear-regression) and provides the user with the opportunity to specify variables of interest using the rich query techniques available for NIDM documents and then conduct a linear regression with optional contrast and regularization.

                Introduction: Faith and systems of beliefs are known to impact not only the emotional, but also the immunological state of believers in ways that we are just starting to understand. Moreover, clinical implications of previous studies are limited.  The aim of the “HEALING” (Hospital-based Ecumenical and Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) Study was to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized patients after meeting a chaplain coupled with biblical readings. Methods: Hospitalized patients were pre-screened to find those who were the most in need of an intervention. A passage from the Bible was read to them during a meeting with the chaplain at the bedside (n= 20) or in the chapel (n= 18). No meeting occurred in the randomized control group (n=19). Blood samples were taken 30 minutes prior, and 60 minutes after the meeting to measure white blood cells (WBC), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, IgG, and complement 3 (C3). A subgroup of the visited patients was subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where they were played an audiotape of readings of the same passage from the Bible (n=21). Results: Lymphocyte counts increased more often after the more successful visits, but the immunological changes were not significant. Conversely, a significant (pfwe=0.003) correlation was revealed between changes in lymphocytes and activation of the angular gyrus (left BA39) during fMRI, a brain area involved in word recognition. Conclusions: Although limited by the sample size and cohort study design, the findings suggest the depth of psycho-immunological changes could depend on the degree to which the chaplains’ main message is understood.

                This case report describes an unreported case of  Purtscher-like retinopathy in a patient with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. A 39-year-old man was hospitalized for exploration of a hemoptysis and bilateral blurry vision. Fundoscopic examination showed multiple areas of retinal whitening in the peripapillary area. A chest computed tomography scan then showed a ground glass opacity in the right upper lobe associated to a hilar lymphadenopathy. A thoracotomy and lung biopsy were performed concluding with the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and received Taxol-Carboplatin chemotherapy with good visual outcomes. The article discusses furthermore the importance of including pulmonary adenocarcinoma to the list of systemic conditions for Purtscher-like retinopathy.

                Background Evidence on the affordability and cost-effectiveness of interventions is critical to decision-making for clinical practice guidelines and development of national health policies. This study aimed to develop a repository of primary economic evaluations to support global maternal health guideline development and provide insights into the body of research conducted in this field. Methods A scoping review was conducted to identify and map available economic evaluations of maternal health interventions. We searched six databases (NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo) on 20 November 2020 with no date, setting or language restrictions. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data independently. Included studies were categorised by subpopulation of women, level of care, intervention type, mechanism, and period, economic evaluation type and perspective, and whether the intervention is currently recommended by the World Health Organization. Frequency analysis was used to determine prevalence of parameters. Results In total 923 studies conducted in 72 countries were included. Most studies were conducted in high-income country settings (71.8%). Over half pertained to a general population of pregnant women, with the remainder focused on specific subgroups, such as women with preterm birth (6.2%) or those undergoing caesarean section (5.5%). The most common interventions of interest related to non-obstetric infections (23.9%), labour and childbirth care (17.0%), and obstetric complications (15.7%). Few studies addressed the major causes of maternal deaths globally. Over a third (36.5%) of studies were cost-utility analyses, 1.4% were cost-benefit analyses and the remainder were cost-effectiveness analyses. Conclusions This review provides a navigable, consolidated resource of economic evaluations in maternal health. We identified a clear evidence gap regarding economic evaluations of maternal health interventions in low- and middle-income countries. Future economic research should focus on interventions to address major drivers of maternal morbidity and mortality in these settings.

Most methods available for such comparisons cater to studying proteins which have clearly recognizable evolutionary relationships but not to proteins that recognize the same or similar ligands but do not share similarities in their sequence or structural folds. In many cases, proteins in the latter class share structural similarities only in their binding sites. While several algorithms are available for comparing binding sites, there are none for deriving structural motifs of the binding sites, independent of the whole proteins. We report the development of SiteMotif, a new algorithm that compares binding sites from multiple proteins and derives sequence-order independent structural site motifs. We have tested the algorithm at multiple levels of complexity and demonstrate its performance in different scenarios. We have benchmarked against 3 current methods available for binding site comparison and demonstrate superior performance of our algorithm. We show that SiteMotif identifies new structural motifs of spatially conserved residues in proteins, even when there is no sequence or fold-level similarity. We expect SiteMotif to be useful for deriving key mechanistic insights into the mode of ligand interaction, predict the ligand type that a protein can bind and improve the sensitivity of functional annotation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Measuring the repertoire of age-related behavioral changes in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katherine E. Overman, Daniel M. Choi, Kawai Leung, Joshua W. Shaevitz, Gordon J. Berman</p>

Aging affects almost all aspects of an organism—its morphology, its physiology, its behavior. Isolating which biological mechanisms are regulating these changes, however, has proven difficult, potentially due to our inability to characterize the full repertoire of an animal’s behavior across the lifespan. Using data from fruit flies (<i>D. melanogaster</i>) we measure the full repertoire of behaviors as a function of age. We observe a sexually dimorphic pattern of changes in the behavioral repertoire during aging. Although the stereotypy of the behaviors and the complexity of the repertoire overall remains relatively unchanged, we find evidence that the observed alterations in behavior can be explained by changing the fly’s overall energy budget, suggesting potential connections between metabolism, aging, and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring RNA-binding protein target preferences using adversarial domain adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ying Liu, Ruihui Li, Jiawei Luo, Zhaolei Zhang</p>

Precise identification of target sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBP) is important to understand their biochemical and cellular functions. A large amount of experimental data is generated by in vivo and in vitro approaches. The binding preferences determined from these platforms share similar patterns but there are discernable differences between these datasets. Computational methods trained on one dataset do not always work well on another dataset. To address this problem which resembles the classic “domain shift” in deep learning, we adopted the adversarial domain adaptation (ADDA) technique and developed a framework (RBP-ADDA) that can extract RBP binding preferences from an integration of in vivo and vitro datasets. Compared with conventional methods, ADDA has the advantage of working with two input datasets, as it trains the initial neural network for each dataset individually, projects the two datasets onto a feature space, and uses an adversarial framework to derive an optimal network that achieves an optimal discriminative predictive power. In the first step, for each RBP, we include only the in vitro data to pre-train a source network and a task predictor. Next, for the same RBP, we initiate the target network by using the source network and use adversarial domain adaptation to update the target network using both in vitro and in vivo data. These two steps help leverage the in vitro data to improve the prediction on in vivo data, which is typically challenging with a lower signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, to further take the advantage of the fused source and target data, we fine-tune the task predictor using both data. We showed that RBP-ADDA achieved better performance in modeling in vivo RBP binding data than other existing methods as judged by Pearson correlations. It also improved predictive performance on in vitro datasets. We further applied augmentation operations on RBPs with less in vivo data to expand the input data and showed that it can improve prediction performances. Lastly, we explored the predictive interpretability of RBP-ADDA, where we quantified the contribution of the input features by Integrated Gradients and identified nucleotide positions that are important for RBP recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Classification of bursting patterns: A tale of two ducks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mathieu Desroches, John Rinzel, Serafim Rodrigues</p>

Bursting is one of the fundamental rhythms that excitable cells can generate either in response to incoming stimuli or intrinsically. It has been a topic of intense research in computational biology for several decades. The classification of bursting oscillations in excitable systems has been the subject of active research since the early 1980s and is still ongoing. As a by-product, it establishes analytical and numerical foundations for studying complex temporal behaviors in multiple timescale models of cellular activity. In this review, we first present the seminal works of Rinzel and Izhikevich in classifying bursting patterns of excitable systems. We recall a complementary mathematical classification approach by Bertram and colleagues, and then by Golubitsky and colleagues, which, together with the Rinzel-Izhikevich proposals, provide the state-of-the-art foundations to these classifications. Beyond classical approaches, we review a recent bursting example that falls outside the previous classification systems. Generalizing this example leads us to propose an extended classification, which requires the analysis of both fast and slow subsystems of an underlying slow-fast model and allows the dissection of a larger class of bursters. Namely, we provide a general framework for bursting systems with both subthreshold and superthreshold oscillations. A new class of bursters with at least 2 slow variables is then added, which we denote <i>folded-node bursters</i>, to convey the idea that the bursts are initiated or annihilated via a <i>folded-node</i> singularity. Key to this mechanism are so-called <i>canard</i> or <i>duck</i> orbits, organizing the underpinning excitability structure. We describe the 2 main families of folded-node bursters, depending upon the phase (active/spiking or silent/nonspiking) of the bursting cycle during which folded-node dynamics occurs. We classify both families and give examples of minimal systems displaying these novel bursting patterns. Finally, we provide a biophysical example by reinterpreting a generic conductance-based <i>episodic burster</i> as a folded-node burster, showing that the associated framework can explain its subthreshold oscillations over a larger parameter region than the fast subsystem approach.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolutionary information helps understand distinctive features of the angiotensin II receptors AT1 and AT2 in amniota</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rym Ben Boubaker, Asma Tiss, Daniel Henrion, Hajer Guissouma, Marie Chabbert</p>

In vertebrates, the octopeptide angiotensin II (AngII) is an important <i>in vivo</i> regulator of the cardiovascular system. It acts mainly through two G protein-coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2. To better understand distinctive features of these receptors, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis that revealed a mirror evolution of AT1 and AT2, each one split into two clades, separating fish from terrestrial receptors. It also revealed that hallmark mutations occurred at, or near, the sodium binding site in both AT1 and AT2. Electrostatics computations and molecular dynamics simulations support maintained sodium binding to human AT1 with slow ingress from the extracellular side and an electrostatic component of the binding free energy around -3kT, to be compared to around -2kT for human AT2 and the δ opioid receptor. Comparison of the sodium binding modes in wild type and mutated AT1 and AT2 from humans and eels indicates that the allosteric control by sodium in both AT1 and AT2 evolved during the transition from fish to amniota. The unusual S7.46N mutation in AT1 is mirrored by a L3.36M mutation in AT2. In the presence of sodium, the N7.46 pattern in amniota AT1 stabilizes the inward orientation of N3.35 in the apo receptor, which should contribute to efficient N3.35 driven biased signaling. The M3.36 pattern in amniota AT2 favours the outward orientation of N3.35 and the receptor promiscuity. Both mutations have physiological consequences for the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Camptothecin effectively treats obesity in mice through GDF15 induction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jun Feng Lu, Meng Qing Zhu, Bao Cai Xie, Xiao Chen Shi, Huan Liu, Rui Xin Zhang, Bo Xia, Jiang Wei Wu</p>

Elevated circulating levels of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) have been shown to reduce food intake and lower body weight through activation of hindbrain receptor glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) in rodents and nonhuman primates, thus endogenous induction of this peptide holds promise for obesity treatment. Here, through <i>in silico</i> drug-screening methods, we found that small molecule Camptothecin (CPT), a previously identified drug with potential antitumor activity, is a GDF15 inducer. Oral CPT administration increases circulating GDF15 levels in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and genetic <i>ob/ob</i> mice, with elevated <i>Gdf15</i> expression predominantly in the liver through activation of integrated stress response. In line with GDF15’s anorectic effect, CPT suppresses food intake, thereby reducing body weight, blood glucose, and hepatic fat content in obese mice. Conversely, CPT loses these beneficial effects when <i>Gdf15</i> is inhibited by a neutralizing antibody or AAV8-mediated liver-specific knockdown. Similarly, CPT failed to reduce food intake and body weight in GDF15’s specific receptor GFRAL-deficient mice despite high levels of GDF15. Together, these results indicate that CPT is a promising anti-obesity agent through activation of GDF15-GFRAL pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between S-COMT activity and impulsive and premeditated aggression in a population of violent offenders: preliminary results of a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aggression can be conceptualised as a physical act towards another person, verbal offenses, destructive acts towards objects, and self-inflicted harmful acts. It is highly frequent in the context of Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) and has been correlated to disturbances in the dopaminergic system. In the prefrontal cortex, the dopamine metabolism depends on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). DRD2 receptors also play a role in the expression of aggression by modulating dopamine metabolism, in the striatum. In this study, we evaluated the association between COMT activity and type of aggression, in a sample of violent male offenders. Participants were subjected to sociodemographic, clinical, and psychometric evaluation through standardised instruments. Erythrocyte S-COMT activity was measured, and COMT and the DRD2 genotypes were analysed. Individuals displaying impulsive aggression showed lower S-COMT erythrocyte activity (p=0.026) and lower frequency of Val/Val (rs4680) genotype than individuals with premeditated aggression (p=0.047). S-COMT erythrocyte activity was positively correlated with the PCL-R total score (r=0.34; p=0.018). In conclusion, our preliminary results indicate that COMT can be associated to different aggression types in violent offenders, and it can represent a possible pharmacological target for the treatment of impulsive and premeditated aggression, in incarcerated patients.

                Background: Emvolio is a non-medical device, indigenously developed portable refrigeration for maintaining the internal temperature 2–8˚C. The Indian Patent Office has granted patent for applications such as preservation and transport of medicines, vaccines, food, beverages, dairy etc. Further, use of Emvolio can be utilized in transport and store biologicals to preserve their biochemical and cellular integrity.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the biochemical and haematological integrity of biological samples such as rat blood, serum and liver. Methods: The steady temperature was maintained inside the Emvolio, and it was compared to that of thermocol and polypropylene boxes aided with frozen gel packs. The blood and liver samples were isolated from Wistar rats and kept in Emvolio, thermocol and polypropylene boxes for 10 hrs, and the temperature was monitored. The blood parameters, namely red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, haematocrit, haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width (RDW), serum parameters like alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase, blood urea nitrogen and liver parameters like superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), catalase were estimated and compared. Results: Emvolio maintained a constant inner temperature range of 2–8˚C, whereas a significant temperature variation was seen in thermocol and polypropylene boxes. There was no significant deviation in the parameters tested when samples were kept in Emvolio for six hours compared to the zero hour readings. In contrast, there was a significant deviation among the parameters for the samples kept in thermocol and polypropylene boxes for six hours compared to zero hour parameters. Conclusions: Emvolio maintained constant temperature and preserved the biological integrity of rat blood, serum and liver. Thus, Emvolio can be efficiently used as a biological sample carrier, especially in preclinical studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">EMI radiation of power transmission lines in Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There has been rising concern amongst the public regarding their home's proximity to high tension power transmission lines. The primary cause of fear is the impact of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) radiation on the nearby occupants' health. Despite the presence of national permissible limits of EMI radiation, there is still lack of information with regards to the EMI radiation of the types of power lines configuration in Malaysia. Methods: The electric and magnetic fields of several selected power transmission lines were simulated using the EMFACDC software program from the recommendation ITU-T K.90. Five types of power transmission lines available in Malaysia are considered. Results: It was found that the simulated electric and magnetic field levels at all the power lines' right of way (ROW) boundary complies with the prescribed exposure limit. However, the electromagnetic fields (EMF) level increases significantly as the separation distance is reduced from 30m. For a more conservative approach, the ROW can be set at 30m across all transmission voltage level and corridor area condition. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Malaysia's power transmission lines are within the prescribed exposure limits. To further minimize the electric and magnetic field level, it is recommended that the residential building should be built at least 30 meters away from the power transmission lines, especially for the 275kV double circuit, 275/132kV quadruple circuit, and 500kV double circuit lines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lupeol and pristimerin do not inhibit activation of the human sperm CatSper Ca(2+)-channel [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Opposing findings have been published on the regulation of the sperm-specific Ca2+ channel CatSper (cation channel of sperm) in human sperm cells by the plant triterpenoids lupeol and pristimerin. While the original study on this topic found these triterpenoids to act as potent inhibitors of human CatSper, subsequent studies have failed to replicate such an inhibitory effect. It has been suggested that these issues could in part be due to purity issues and/or batch variation between the plant-derived extracts of lupeol and pristimerin obtained for the studies. The aim of this study was to elucidate this controversy by investigating the batches of lupeol and pristimerin used in our previous study with state-of-the-art 1H-, 13C- and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to reveal potential purity and/or batch variation issues. When comparing the NMR-spectra obtained from 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR with previously published NMR-spectra for lupeol and pristimerin, we could confirm that both the lupeol and pristimerin batch were ≥95 % pure. These results confirm the validity of the findings in our previous study for lupeol and pristimerin, showing that lupeol and pristimerin do not inhibit activation of CatSper in human sperm. In conclusion, using 1H-, 13C- and 2D-NMR methods, we confirm that the lupeol and pristimerin batches used in our previous study were ≥95 % pure and thereby fail to identify any purity issues and/or batch variation that could explain the observed inability of lupeol and pristimerin to inhibit activation of CatSper in human sperm.

                Harbauer et al. describe mitochondrial hitchhiking of the Pink1 mRNA on mitochondria in neurons. This coupling of the transcript of a short-lived mitochondrial protein to the movement of its target organelles ensures the functionality of the PINK1-dependent degradation of damaged mitochondria in distal parts of the cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Colicin E1 opens its hinge to plug TolC</a></h4>

              
                The double membrane architecture of Gram-negative bacteria forms a barrier that is impermeable to most extracellular threats. Bacteriocin proteins evolved to exploit the accessible, surface-exposed proteins embedded in the outer membrane to deliver cytotoxic cargo. Colicin E1 is a bacteriocin produced by, and lethal to, <i>Escherichia coli</i> that hijacks the outer membrane proteins TolC and BtuB to enter the cell. Here we capture the colicin E1 translocation domain inside its membrane receptor, TolC, by high-resolution cryoEM to obtain the first reported structure of a bacteriocin bound to TolC. Colicin E1 binds stably to TolC as an open hinge through the TolC pore-an architectural rearrangement from colicin E1's unbound conformation. This binding is stable in live <i>E. coli </i>cells as indicated by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Finally, colicin E1 fragments binding to TolC plug the channel, inhibiting its native efflux function as an antibiotic efflux pump and heightening susceptibility to three antibiotic classes. In addition to demonstrating that these protein fragments are useful starting points for developing novel antibiotic potentiators, this method could be expanded to other colicins to inhibit other outer membrane protein functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nanoscale binding site localization by molecular distance estimation on native cell surfaces using topological image averaging</a></h4>

              
                Antibody binding to cell surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity, and the location of an epitope can altogether determine the immunological outcome of a host-target interaction. Techniques available today for epitope identification are costly, time-consuming, and unsuited for high-throughput analysis. Fast and efficient screening of epitope location can be useful for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Cellular morphology typically varies, and antibodies often bind heterogeneously across a cell surface, making traditional particle-averaging strategies challenging for accurate native antibody localization. In the present work, we have developed a method, SiteLoc, for imaging-based molecular localization on cellular surface proteins. Nanometer-scale resolution is achieved through localization in one dimension, namely, the distance from a bound ligand to a reference surface. This is done by using topological image averaging. Our results show that this method is well suited for antibody binding site measurements on native cell surface morphology and that it can be applied to other molecular distance estimations as well.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging of macrophage intracellular metabolism during wound responses in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The function of macrophages in vitro is linked to their metabolic rewiring. However, macrophage metabolism remains poorly characterized in situ. Here, we used two-photon intensity and lifetime imaging of autofluorescent metabolic coenzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), to assess the metabolism of macrophages in the wound microenvironment. Inhibiting glycolysis reduced NAD(P)H mean lifetime and made the intracellular redox state of macrophages more oxidized, as indicated by reduced optical redox ratio. We found that TNFα+ macrophages had lower NAD(P)H mean lifetime and were more oxidized compared to TNFα− macrophages. Both infection and thermal injury induced a macrophage population with a more oxidized redox state in wounded tissues. Kinetic analysis detected temporal changes in the optical redox ratio during tissue repair, revealing a shift toward a more reduced redox state over time. Metformin reduced TNFα+ wound macrophages, made intracellular redox state more reduced and improved tissue repair. By contrast, depletion of STAT6 increased TNFα+ wound macrophages, made redox state more oxidized and impaired regeneration. Our findings suggest that autofluorescence of NAD(P)H and FAD is sensitive to dynamic changes in intracellular metabolism in tissues and can be used to probe the temporal and spatial regulation of macrophage metabolism during tissue damage and repair.

                The NLRP3 inflammasome coordinates inflammation in response to different pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, being implicated in different infectious, chronic inflammatory, metabolic and degenerative diseases. In chronic tendinopathic lesions, different non-resolving mechanisms produce a degenerative condition that impairs tissue healing and which therefore complicates their clinical management. Percutaneous needle electrolysis consists of the application of a galvanic current and is an emerging treatment for tendinopathies. In the present study, we found that galvanic current activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces an inflammatory response that promotes a collagen-mediated regeneration of the tendon in mice. This study establishes the molecular mechanism of percutaneous electrolysis that can be used to treat chronic lesions and describes the beneficial effects of an induced inflammasome-related response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Complex effects of kinase localization revealed by compartment-specific regulation of protein kinase A activity</a></h4>

              
                Kinase activity in signaling networks frequently depends on regulatory subunits that can both inhibit activity by interacting with the catalytic subunits and target the kinase to distinct molecular partners and subcellular compartments. Here, using a new synthetic molecular interaction system, we show that translocation of a regulatory subunit of the protein kinase A (PKA-R) to the plasma membrane has a paradoxical effect on the membrane kinase activity. It can both enhance it at lower translocation levels, even in the absence of signaling inputs, and inhibit it at higher translocation levels, suggesting its role as a linker that can both couple and decouple signaling processes in a concentration-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that superposition of gradients of PKA-R abundance across single cells can control the directionality of cell migration, reversing it at high enough input levels. Thus, complex in vivo patterns of PKA-R localization can drive complex phenotypes, including cell migration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Humans perseverate on punishment avoidance goals in multigoal reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Managing multiple goals is essential to adaptation, yet we are only beginning to understand computations by which we navigate the resource-demands entailed in so doing. Here, we sought to elucidate how humans balance reward seeking and punishment avoidance goals, and relate this to variation in its expression within anxious individuals. To do so, we developed a novel multigoal pursuit task that includes trial-specific instructed goals to either pursue reward (without risk of punishment) or avoid punishment (without the opportunity for reward). We constructed a computational model of multigoal pursuit to quantify the degree to which participants could disengage from the pursuit goals when instructed to, as well as devote less model-based resources towards goals that were less abundant. In general, participants (n=192) were less flexible in avoiding punishment than in pursuing reward. Thus, when instructed to pursue reward, participants often persisted in avoiding features that had previously been associated with punishment, even though at decision time these features were unambiguously benign. In a similar vein, participants showed no significant downregulation of avoidance when punishment avoidance goals were less abundant in the task. Importantly, we show preliminary evidence that individuals with chronic worry may have difficulty disengaging from punishment avoidance when instructed to seek reward. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that people avoid punishment less flexibly than they pursue reward. Future studies should test in larger samples whether a difficulty to disengage from punishment avoidance contributes to chronic worry.

A loss of ATM is also associated with increased protein aggregation. The relevance and characteristics of this aggregation are still incompletely understood. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent other genotoxic conditions can trigger protein aggregation as well. Here, we show that targeting ATM, but also ATR or DNA topoisomerases, results in the widespread aggregation of a metastable, disease-associated subfraction of the proteome. Aggregation-prone model substrates, including Huntingtin exon 1 containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, aggregate faster under these conditions. This increased aggregation results from an overload of chaperone systems, which lowers the cell-intrinsic threshold for proteins to aggregate. In line with this, we find that inhibition of the HSP70 chaperone system further exacerbates the increased protein aggregation. Moreover, we identify the molecular chaperone HSPB5 as a cell-specific suppressor of it. Our findings reveal that various genotoxic conditions trigger widespread protein aggregation in a manner that is highly reminiscent of the aggregation occurring in situations of proteotoxic stress and in proteinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impairing one sensory modality enhances another by reconfiguring peptidergic signalling in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Animals that lose one sensory modality often show augmented responses to other sensory inputs. The mechanisms underpinning this cross-modal plasticity are poorly understood. We probe such mechanisms by performing a forward genetic screen for mutants with enhanced O<sub>2</sub> perception in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Multiple mutants exhibiting increased O<sub>2</sub> responsiveness concomitantly show defects in other sensory responses. One mutant, <i>qui-1</i>, defective in a conserved NACHT/WD40 protein, abolishes pheromone-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the ADL pheromone-sensing neurons. At the same time, ADL responsiveness to pre-synaptic input from O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons is heightened in <i>qui-1</i>, and other sensory defective mutants, resulting in enhanced neurosecretion although not increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Expressing <i>qui-1</i> selectively in ADL rescues both the <i>qui-1</i> ADL neurosecretory phenotype and enhanced escape from 21% O<sub>2</sub>. Profiling ADL neurons in <i>qui-1</i> mutants highlights extensive changes in gene expression, notably of many neuropeptide receptors. We show that elevated ADL expression of the conserved neuropeptide receptor NPR-22 is necessary for enhanced ADL neurosecretion in <i>qui-1</i> mutants, and is sufficient to confer increased ADL neurosecretion in control animals. Sensory loss can thus confer cross-modal plasticity by changing the peptidergic connectome.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanisms of distributed working memory in a large-scale network of macaque neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity underlying working memory is not a local phenomenon but distributed across multiple brain regions. To elucidate the circuit mechanism of such distributed activity, we developed an anatomically constrained computational model of large-scale macaque cortex. We found that mnemonic internal states may emerge from inter-areal reverberation, even in a regime where none of the isolated areas is capable of generating self-sustained activity. The mnemonic activity pattern along the cortical hierarchy indicates a transition in space, separating areas engaged in working memory and those which do not. A host of spatially distinct attractor states is found, potentially subserving various internal processes. The model yields testable predictions, including the idea of counterstream inhibitory bias, the role of prefrontal areas in controlling distributed attractors, and the resilience of distributed activity to lesions or inactivation. This work provides a theoretical framework for identifying large-scale brain mechanisms and computational principles of distributed cognitive processes.

                Atmospheric Particulate Matter (PM) is one of the leading environmental risk factors for the global burden of disease. Increasing epidemiological studies demonstrated that PM plays a significant role in CNS demyelinating disorders; however, there is no direct testimony of this, and yet the molecular mechanism by which the occurrence remains unclear. Using multiple <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> strategies, in the present study we demonstrate that PM exposure aggravates neuroinflammation, myelin injury, and dysfunction of movement coordination ability via boosting microglial pro-inflammatory activities, in both the pathological demyelination and physiological myelinogenesis animal models. Indeed, pharmacological disturbance combined with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq suggests that TLR-4/NF-kB signaling mediated a core network of genes that control PM-triggered microglia pathogenicity. In summary, our study defines a novel atmospheric environmental mechanism that mediates PM-aggravated microglia pathogenic activities, and establishes a systematic approach for the investigation of the effects of environmental exposure in neurologic disorders.

                Opsins are universal photoreceptive proteins in animals and can be classified into three types based on their photoreaction properties. Upon light irradiation, vertebrate rhodopsin forms a metastable active state, which cannot revert back to the original dark state via either photoreaction or thermal reaction. By contrast, after photoreception, most opsins form a stable active state which can photoconvert back to the dark state. Moreover, we recently found a novel type of opsins whose activity is regulated by photocycling. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this diversification of opsins remains unknown. In this study, we showed that vertebrate rhodopsin acquired the photocyclic and photoreversible properties upon introduction of a single mutation at position 188. This revealed that the residue at position 188 contributes to the diversification of photoreaction properties of opsins by its regulation of the recovery from the active state to the original dark state.

                We present neural models of one of humans' most astonishing cognitive feats: the ability to interpret linguistic instructions in order to perform novel tasks with just a few practice trials. Models are trained on a set of commonly studied psychophysical tasks, and receive linguistic instructions embedded by transformer architectures pre-trained on natural language processing. Our best performing models can perform an unknown task with a performance of 80% correct on average based solely on linguistic instructions (i.e. 0-shot learning), and 90% after 3 learning updates. We found that the resulting neural representations capture the semantic structure of interrelated tasks even for novel tasks, allowing for the composition of practiced skills in unseen settings. Finally, we also demonstrate how this model can generate a linguistic description of a task it has identified using motor feedback, which, when communicated to another network, leads to near perfect performance (95%). To our knowledge, this is the first experimentally testable model of how language can structure sensorimotor representations to allow for task compositionality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Odorant receptor orthologues in conifer-feeding beetles display conserved responses to ecologically relevant odors</a></h4>

              
                Insects are able to detect a plethora of olfactory cues in the environment using a divergent family of odorant receptors (ORs). Despite the divergent nature of this family, related species frequently express several evolutionarily conserved OR orthologues. In Coleoptera, it remains unknown whether OR orthologues have conserved or divergent functions in different species. We addressed this question through functional characterization of two groups of OR orthologues in three species of the Curculionidae (weevil) family, the conifer-feeding bark beetles Ips typographus ('Ityp') and Dendroctonus ponderosae ('Dpon') (both in subfamily Scolytinae), and the pine weevil Hylobius abietis ('Habi'; Molytinae). The ORs of H. abietis were annotated from antennal transcriptomes. Results show highly conserved response specificities, with one group of orthologues (HabiOR3/DponOR8/ItypOR6) responding exclusively to 2-phenylethanol (2-PE), and the other group (HabiOR4/DponOR9/ItypOR5) responding to angiosperm green leaf volatile (GLV) alcohols. Both groups of orthologues belong to the major coleopteran OR group 2B, and share a common ancestor with OR5 in the cerambycid Megacyllene caryae, also tuned to 2-PE, suggesting a shared evolutionary history of 2-PE receptors across two beetle superfamilies. The detected compounds are ecologically relevant for conifer-feeding curculionids, and are probably linked to fitness, with GLVs being used to avoid angiosperm non-host plants, and 2-PE being important for intraspecific communication and/or playing a putative role in beetle-microbe symbioses. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal evolutionary conservation of OR functions across several beetle species and hence sheds new light on the functional evolution of beetle ORs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta-phase connectivity between medial prefrontal and posterior areas underlies novel instructions implementation</a></h4>

              
                Implementing novel instructions is a complex and uniquely human cognitive ability, that requires the rapid and flexible conversion of symbolic content into a format that enables the execution of the instructed behavior. Preparing to implement novel instructions, as opposed to their mere maintenance, involves the activation of the instructed motor plans, and the binding of the action information to the specific context in which this should be executed. Recent evidence and prominent computational models suggest that this efficient configuration of the system might involve a central role of frontal theta oscillations in establishing top-down long-range synchronization between distant and task-relevant brain areas. In the present EEG study (human subjects, 30 females, 4 males), we demonstrate that proactively preparing for the implementation of novels instructions, as opposed to their maintenance, involves a strengthened degree of connectivity in the theta frequency range between medial prefrontal and motor/visual areas. Moreover, we replicated previous results showing oscillatory features associated specifically with implementation demands, and extended on them demonstrating the role of theta oscillations in mediating the effect of task demands on behavioral performance. Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that the modulation of connectivity patterns between frontal and task-relevant posterior brain areas is a core factor in the emergence of a behavior-guiding format from novel instructions.

                The claustrum (CLA) is a conspicuous subcortical structure interconnected with cortical and subcortical regions. However, its regional anatomy and cell-type-specific connections in the mouse remain largely undetermined. Here, we accurately delineated the boundary of the mouse CLA and quantitatively investigated its inputs and outputs brain-wide using anterograde and retrograde viral tracing and fully reconstructed single claustral principal neurons. At a population level, the CLA reciprocally connects with all isocortical modules. It also receives inputs from at least 35 subcortical structures but sends projections back to only a few of them. We found that cell types projecting to the CLA are differentiated by cortical areas and layers. We classified single CLA principal neurons into at least 9 cell types that innervate the diverse sets of functionally linked cortical targets. Axons of interneurons within the CLA arborize along almost its entire anteroposterior extent. Together, this detailed wiring diagram of the cell-type-specific connections of the mouse CLA lays a foundation for studying its functions.

                The hypothalamic neuropeptide, oxytocin (OT), exerts prominent analgesic effects via central and peripheral action. Here we discovered a novel subset of OT neurons whose projections preferentially terminate on OT receptor (OTR)-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). Using a newly generated line of transgenic rats (OTR-IRES-Cre), we determined that most of the vlPAG OTR expressing cells being targeted by OT projections are GABAergic in nature. Both optogenetically-evoked axonal OT release in the vlPAG as well as chemogenetic activation of OTR vlPAG neurons results in a long-lasting overall increase of vlPAG neuronal activity. This then leads to an indirect suppression of sensory neuron activity in the spinal cord and strong analgesia. Finally, we describe a novel OT-vlPAG-spinal cord circuit that seems critical for analgesia in the context of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain.

                Macaque inferior temporal cortex neurons respond selectively to complex visual images, with recent work showing that they are also entrained reliably by the evolving content of natural movies. To what extent does visual continuity itself shape the responses of high-level visual neurons? We addressed this question by measuring how cells in face-selective regions of the macaque temporal cortex were affected by the manipulation of a movie's temporal structure. Sampling the movie at 1s intervals, we measured neural responses to randomized, brief stimuli of different lengths, ranging from 800 ms dynamic movie snippets to 100 ms static frames. We found that the disruption of temporal continuity strongly altered neural response profiles, particularly in the early onset response period of the randomized stimulus. The results suggest that models of visual system function based on discrete and randomized visual presentations may not translate well to the brain's natural modes of operation.

                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by alcohol use coupled with chronic relapse and involves brain regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Here, we explore whether a subpopulation of BNST neurons, somatostatin (SST) expressing GABAergic neurons, play a role in an animal model of binge-like alcohol consumption, the Drinking in the Dark (DID) model. Chemogenetic activation of BNST SST neurons reduced binge alcohol consumption in female but not male SST-Cre mice, while inhibition of these neurons in the same mice had no effect. In addition, chemogenetic activation of these neurons did not cause apparent changes in models of anxiety-like behavior in either sex. Basal SST cell counts and intrinsic excitability of SST neurons were compared to attempt to understand sex differences in DREADD-induced changes in drinking, and while males had a greater number of BNST SST neurons, this effect went away when normalizing for total BNST volume. Together, these results suggest SST neurons in the BNST should be further explored as a potential neuronal subtype modulated by AUD, and for their therapeutic potential.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of functional activity in brain white matter using fiber architecture informed synchrony mapping</a></h4>

              
                A general linear model is widely used for analyzing fMRI data, in which the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signals in gray matter (GM) evoked in response to neural stimulation are modeled by convolving the time course of the expected neural activity with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) obtained a priori. The maps of brain activity produced reflect the magnitude of local BOLD responses. However, detecting BOLD signals in white matter (WM) is more challenging as the BOLD signals are weaker and the HRF is different, and may vary more across the brain. Here we propose a model-free approach to detect changes in BOLD signals in WM by measuring task-evoked increases of BOLD signal synchrony in WM fibers. The proposed approach relies on a simple assumption that, in response to a functional task, BOLD signals in relevant fibers are modulated by stimulus-evoked neural activity and thereby show greater synchrony than when measured in a resting state, even if their magnitudes do not change significantly. This approach is implemented in two technical stages. First, for each voxel a fiber-architecture-informed spatial window is created with orientation distribution functions constructed from diffusion imaging data. This provides the basis for defining neighborhoods in WM that share similar local fiber architectures. Second, a modified principal component analysis (PCA) is used to estimate the synchrony of BOLD signals in each spatial window. The proposed approach is validated using a 3T fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) at a group level. The results demonstrate that neural activity can be reliably detected as increases in fMRI signal synchrony within WM fibers that are engaged in a task with high sensitivities and reproducibility.

	<p>Driver&amp;amp;rsquo;s stress affects decision-making and the probability of risk occurrence, and it is therefore a key factor in road safety. This suggests the need for continuous stress monitoring. This work aims at validating a stress neurophysiological measure&amp;amp;mdash;a Neurometric&amp;amp;mdash;for out-of-the-lab use obtained from lightweight EEG relying on two wet sensors, in real-time, and without calibration. The Neurometric was tested during a multitasking experiment and validated with a realistic driving simulator. Twenty subjects participated in the experiment, and the resulting stress Neurometric was compared with the Random Forest (RF) model, calibrated by using EEG features and both intra-subject and cross-task approaches. The Neurometric was also compared with a measure based on skin conductance level (SCL), representing one of the physiological parameters investigated in the literature mostly correlated with stress variations. We found that during both multitasking and realistic driving experiments, the Neurometric was able to discriminate between low and high levels of stress with an average Area Under Curve (AUC) value higher than 0.9. Furthermore, the stress Neurometric showed higher AUC and stability than both the SCL measure and the RF calibrated with a cross-task approach. In conclusion, the Neurometric proposed in this work proved to be suitable for out-of-the-lab monitoring of stress levels.</p>

	<p>Long-term depression at parallel fibers-Purkinje cells (PF-PC LTD) is essential for cerebellar motor learning and motor control. Recent progress in ataxiology has identified dysregulation of PF-PC LTD in the pathophysiology of certain types of immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs). Auto-antibodies towards voltage-gated Ca channel (VGCC), metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1), and glutamate receptor delta (GluR delta) induce dysfunction of PF-PC LTD, resulting in the development of cerebellar ataxias (CAs). These disorders show a good response to immunotherapies in non-paraneoplastic conditions but are sometimes followed by cell death in paraneoplastic conditions. On the other hand, in some types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), dysfunction in PF-PC LTD, and impairments of PF-PC LTD-related adaptive behaviors (including vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and prism adaptation) appear during the prodromal stage, well before the manifestations of obvious CAs and cerebellar atrophy. Based on these findings and taking into account the findings of animal studies, we re-assessed the clinical concept of LTDpathy. LTDpathy can be defined as a clinical spectrum comprising etiologies associated with a functional disturbance of PF-PC LTD with concomitant impairment of related adaptative behaviors, including VOR, blink reflex, and prism adaptation. In IMCAs or degenerative CAs characterized by persistent impairment of a wide range of molecular mechanisms, these disorders are initially functional and are followed subsequently by degenerative cell processes. In such cases, adaptive disorders associated with PF-PC LTD manifest clinically with subtle symptoms and can be prodromal. Our hypothesis underlines for the first time a potential role of LTD dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the prodromal symptoms of CAs. This hypothesis opens perspectives to block the course of CAs at a very early stage.</p>

	<p>Caregivers of patients with early-onset Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (EOAD) experience higher level of burden, stress, and depression, due to premature role changes and social isolation. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compelled restrictions regarding social interactions and mobility in Italy from March 2020, prompting telemedicine approaches for supporting patients and their families confined at home. We reported our experience regarding the effects of psychological phone-intervention (phone-I) on EOAD caregivers during pandemic. Twenty caregivers of EOAD patients were randomly assigned to treatment (TG) or control (CG) group. TG weekly underwent a phone-I for one month. All participants were assessed for caregiver burden and needs, anxiety and depression levels, and subjective impact of traumatic events at baseline (T0), at the fifth week (T1) and after 6 months (T2) from phone-I. We observed higher vulnerability to post-traumatic stress in TG compared to CG in all timepoints (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). Decreased stress effects and caregiver burden were revealed in TG at T1 compared to T0 (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05), although showing an increase of these measures at T2 in the treated caregivers. Our findings suggest that although TG showed a peculiar vulnerability to post-traumatic stress, they showed increased wellbeing immediately after phone-I. However, this benefit disappeared six months later, along with the second infection wave, probably due to &amp;amp;ldquo;exhaustion stage&amp;amp;rdquo; achievement in &amp;amp;ldquo;General Adaptation Syndrome&amp;amp;rdquo;. This trend may suggest a beneficial but not solving role of a prompt phone-I on burden of caregivers of EOAD patients during the SARS-CoV-2 emergency.</p>

	<p>Therapeutic interventions are greatly needed for age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes regulate many aspects of neuronal function including bioenergetics and synaptic transmission. Reactive astrocytes are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases due to their pro-inflammatory phenotype close association with damaged neurons. Thus, strategies to reduce astrocyte reactivity may support brain health. Caloric restriction and a ketogenic diet limit energy production via glycolysis and promote oxidative phosphorylation, which has gained traction as a strategy to improve brain health. However, it is unknown how caloric restriction affects astrocyte reactivity in the context of neuroinflammation. We investigated how a caloric restriction mimetic and glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), affects interleukin 1&amp;amp;beta;-induced inflammatory gene expression in human astrocytes. Human astrocyte cultures were exposed to 2-DG or vehicle for 24 h and then to recombinant IL-1&amp;amp;beta; for 6 or 24 h to analyze mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Gene expression levels of proinflammatory genes (complement component 3, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL6, and TNF&amp;amp;alpha;) were analyzed by real-time PCR, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry. As expected, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; induced elevated levels of proinflammatory genes. 2-DG reversed this effect at the mRNA and protein levels without inducing cytotoxicity. Collectively, these data suggest that inhibiting glycolysis in human astrocytes reduces IL-1&amp;amp;beta;-induced reactivity. This finding may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to limit inflammation and enhance bioenergetics toward the goal of preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Introduction: We hypothesized that an endovascular electroencephalogram (eEEG) can detect subdural electrode (SDE)-detectable, scalp EEG-undetectable epileptiform discharges. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to measure SDE-detectable, scalp EEG-undetectable epileptiform discharges by an eEEG on a pig. Methods: A pig under general anesthesia was utilized to measure an artificially generated epileptic field by an eEEG that was able to be detected by an SDE, but not a scalp EEG as a primary outcome. We also compared the phase lag of each epileptiform discharge that was detected by the eEEG and SDE as a secondary outcome. Results: The eEEG electrode detected 113 (97%) epileptiform discharges (97% sensitivity). Epileptiform discharges that were localized within the three contacts (contacts two, three and four), but not spread to other parts, were detected by the eEEG with a 92% sensitivity. The latency between peaks of the eEEG and right SDE earliest epileptiform discharge ranged from 0 to 48 ms (mean, 13.3 ms; median, 11 ms; standard deviation, 9.0 ms). Conclusion: In a pig, an eEEG could detect epileptiform discharges that an SDE could detect, but that a scalp EEG could not.</p>

	<p>Cue reactivity is often used to study alcohol cues brain responses. Standardized image sets are used, but the effect of viewing people interacting with the alcohol drink remains unclear, which is associated with the factors of alcohol cues that influence the degree of response to alcohol stimuli. The present study used fMRI to investigate the reactivity of alcohol dependence (AD) inpatients to alcohol cues with or without human drinking behavior. Cues with a human interacting with a drink were hypothesized to increase sensorimotor activation. In total, 30 AD inpatients were asked to view pictures with a factorial design of beverage types (alcoholic vs. non-alcoholic beverages) and cue types (with or without drink action). Whole-brain analyses were performed. A correlation analysis was conducted to confirm whether the whole-brain analysis revealed cue-related brain activations correlated with problem drinking duration. The left lingual gyrus showed significant beverage types through cue type interaction, and the bilateral temporal cortex showed significant activation in response to alcohol cues depicting human drinking behavior. The right and left lingual gyrus regions and left temporal cortex were positively correlated with problem drinking duration. Sensorimotor activations in the temporal cortex may reflect self-referential and memory-based scene processing. Thus, our findings indicate these regions are associated with alcohol use and suggest them for cue exposure treatment of alcohol addiction.</p>

	<p>Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) is a rare clinical entity. Its pathogenicity, heterogenous clinical presentation in the context of secondary systemic autoimmune disease and optimal treatment avenues remain poorly understood. Vestibular impairment occurring in the context of AIED is rarely subject to detailed investigation given that the auditory symptoms and their responsiveness to immunosuppression are the focus of the few proposed diagnostic criteria for AIED. We present three cases of vestibulopathy occurring in the context of autoimmune inner ear conditions, including the first known report of autoimmune inner ear pathology arising with a temporal association to administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV2 vaccination. We review the available literature pertinent to each case and summarise the key learning points, highlighting the variable presentation of vestibular impairment in AIED.</p>

	<p>The locus coeruleus (LC) is a brainstem structure that sends widespread efferent projections throughout the mammalian brain. The LC constitutes the major source of noradrenaline (NE), a modulatory neurotransmitter that is crucial for fundamental brain functions such as arousal, attention, and cognitive control. This role of the LC-NE is traditionally not believed to reflect functional influences on the frontoparietal network or the striatum, but recent advances in chemogenetic manipulations of the rodent brain have challenged this notion. However, demonstrations of LC-NE functional connectivity with these areas in the human brain are surprisingly sparse. Here, we close this gap. Using an established emotional stroop task, we directly compared trials requiring response conflict control with trials that did not require this, but were matched for visual stimulus properties, response modality, and controlled for pupil dilation differences across both trial types. We found that LC-NE functional coupling with the parietal cortex and regions of the striatum is substantially enhanced during trials requiring response conflict control. Crucially, the strength of this functional coupling was directly related to individual reaction time differences incurred by conflict resolution. Our data concur with recent rodent findings and highlight the importance of converging evidence between human and nonhuman neurophysiology to further understand the neural systems supporting adaptive and maladaptive behavior in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/pnas/UJrK">Cheap robust learning of data anomalies with analytically solvable entropic outlier sparsification [Applied Mathematics]</a></h4>

              
                Entropic outlier sparsification (EOS) is proposed as a cheap and robust computational strategy for learning in the presence of data anomalies and outliers. EOS dwells on the derived analytic solution of the (weighted) expected loss minimization problem subject to Shannon entropy regularization. An identified closed-form solution is proven to impose...

                The recent paper in PNAS by Chu and Evans (1), “Slowed canonical progress in large fields of science,” questions the maxim “more is better” when investing in science. They conclude the consequential increased production of new information is detrimental. Investigators increasingly rely on a few frameworks. Ideas challenging these frameworks...
