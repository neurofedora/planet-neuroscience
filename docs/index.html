	<p>Objective: To describe the sleep problems experienced by children with Down syndrome attending a tertiary sleep clinic and relationship with behaviour, function and cognition. Methods: Data were collected from children with Down syndrome aged 3–18 years old. Carers completed the Abbreviated Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire, Child Behaviour Checklist and Life-Habits Questionnaire at enrolment. Cognitive assessment (Stanford-Binet 5) was undertaken by a trained psychologist. Children received management for their sleep problem as clinically indicated. Results: Forty-two subjects with a median age of 6.8 years (Interquartile Range-IQR 4.5, 9.8) were enrolled. A total of 92% were referred with snoring or symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), with 79% of those referred having had previous ENT surgery. Thus, 85% of all participants underwent a sleep study and 61% were diagnosed with OSA (OAHI ≥ 1/h). Based on questionnaires, 86% of respondents indicated that their child had a significant sleep disorder and non-respiratory sleep problems were common. Non-respiratory problems included: trouble going to sleep independently (45%), restless sleep (76%), night-time waking (24%) and bedtime resistance (22%). No significant correlations were found between sleep measures (behavioural and medical sleep problems) and the behavioural, functional or cognitive parameters. Conclusion: Sleep disorders were very common, especially non-respiratory sleep problems. OSA was common despite previous surgery. No association was found between sleep-related problems (snoring, sleep-study-confirmed OSA or non-respiratory sleep problem) and parent-reported behavioural problems, functional impairments or intellectual performance. This may reflect limitations of the measures used in this study, that in this population ongoing problems with daytime function are not sleep related or that a cross-sectional assessment does not adequately take into account the impacts of past disease/treatments. Further research is required to further evaluate the tools used to evaluate sleep disorders, the impact of those disorder on children with Down syndrome and interventions which improve both sleep and daytime function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the current study, we examined the number, distribution, and aspects of the neurochemical identities of infracortical white matter neurons, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), in the brains of a southern lesser galago (<i>Galago moholi</i>), a black-capped squirrel monkey (<i>Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis</i>), and a crested macaque (<i>Macaca nigra</i>). Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most dense close to inner cortical border, decreasing in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN-immunopositive cells revealed estimates of approximately 1.1, 10.8, and 37.7 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the galago, squirrel monkey, and crested macaque, respectively. The total numbers of WMICs form a distinct negative allometric relationship with brain mass and white matter volume when examined in a larger sample of primates where similar measures have been obtained. In all three primates studied, the highest densities of WMICs were in the white matter of the frontal lobe, with the occipital lobe having the lowest. Immunostaining revealed significant subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calretinin, with very few WMICs containing parvalbumin, and none containing calbindin. The nNOS and calretinin immunopositive WMICs represent approximately 21% of the total WMIC population; however, variances in the proportions of these neurochemical phenotypes were noted. Our results indicate that both the squirrel monkey and crested macaque might be informative animal models for the study of WMICs in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders in humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of rodents is functionally subdivided into somatotopic subregions that represent each body part along both the dorsoventral and anteroposterior (A-P) axes and play crucial roles in sensorimotor functions via corticostriatal pathways. However, little is known about the spatial gene expression patterns and heterogeneity of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) within somatotopic subregions. Here, we show that the cell adhesion molecule gene <i>Cdh20</i>, which encodes a Type II cadherin, is expressed in discrete subregions covering the inner orofacial area and part of the forelimb area in the ventral domain of the DLS (v-DLS) in rats. <i>Cdh20-</i>expressing cells were localized in the v-DLS at the intermediate level of the striatum along the A-P axis and could be classified as direct-pathway SPNs or indirect-pathway SPNs. Unexpectedly, comprehensive analysis revealed that <i>Cdh20</i> is expressed in SPNs in the rat DLS but not in the mouse DLS or the ferret putamen (Pu). Our observations reveal that <i>Cdh20</i> expression demarcates somatotopic subregions and subpopulations of SPNs specifically in the rat DLS and suggest divergent regulation of genes differentially expressed in the v-DLS and Pu among mammals.</p>

     alt="Ephrin-A3 is required for tonotopic map precision and auditory functions in the mouse auditory brainstem"/>
<p>We investigated the molecular basis of tonotopic map formation in the mouse auditory brainstem. We found that the axon guidance cue ephrin-A3 is differentially expressed along the tonotopic map in the mouse auditory brainstem. Ephrin-A3 is sufficient to repel growing auditory nerve fibers in vitro. In mice lacking ephrin-A3, the tonotopic map is degraded in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, and auditory activation patterns and the ability to discriminate sound frequency changes are also impaired.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tonotopy is a prominent feature of the vertebrate auditory system and forms the basis for sound discrimination, but the molecular mechanism that underlies its formation remains largely elusive. Ephrin/Eph signaling is known to play important roles in axon guidance during topographic mapping in other sensory systems, so we investigated its possible role in the establishment of tonotopy in the mouse cochlear nucleus. We found that ephrin-A3 molecules are differentially expressed along the tonotopic axis in the cochlear nucleus during innervation. Ephrin-A3 forward signaling is sufficient to repel auditory nerve fibers in a developmental stage-dependent manner. In mice lacking ephrin-A3, the tonotopic map is degraded and isofrequency bands of neuronal activation upon pure tone exposure become imprecise in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Ephrin-A3 mutant mice also exhibit a delayed second wave in auditory brainstem responses upon sound stimuli and impaired detection of sound frequency changes. Our findings establish an essential role for ephrin-A3 in forming precise tonotopy in the auditory brainstem to ensure accurate sound discrimination.</p>

     alt="Axonal injury alters the extracellular glial environment of the axon initial segment and allows substantial mitochondrial influx into axon initial segment"/>
<p>Our present focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy analysis demonstrates marked mitochondrial influx into the axon initial segment (AIS) in response to axonal injury. In the healthy (control) AIS, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. On the other hand, after injury, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS (scale bar 5 μm).
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The axon initial segment (AIS) is structurally and functionally distinct from other regions of the axon, yet alterations in the milieu of the AIS after brain injury have not been well characterized. In this study, we have examined extracellular and intracellular changes in the AIS after hypoglossal nerve injury. Microglial adhesions to the AIS were rarely observed in healthy controls, whereas microglial adhesions to the AIS became apparent in the axonal injury model. Regarding intra-AIS morphology, we focused on mitochondria because mitochondrial flow into the injured axon appears critical for axonal regeneration. To visualize mitochondria specifically in injured axons, we used <i>Atf3</i>:BAC transgenic mice whose mitochondria were labeled with GFP in response to nerve injury. These mice clearly showed mitochondrial localization in the AIS after nerve injury. To precisely confirm the light microscopic observations, we performed three-dimensional ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). Although the healthy AIS was not surrounded by microglia, tight microglial adhesions with thick processes adhering to the AIS were observed after injury. FIB/SEM simultaneously allowed the observation of mitochondrial localization in the AIS. In the AIS of non-injured neurons, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. Intriguingly, in the injured AIS, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS. Taken together, axonal injury changes the extracellular glial environment surrounding the AIS and intracellular mitochondrial localization in the AIS. These changes would be crucial responses, perhaps for injured neurons to regenerate after axonal injury.</p>

     alt="Morphological properties of the axon initial segment-like process of AII amacrine cells in the rat retina"/>
<p>AII amacrine cells in the mammalian retina display an axon initial segment (AIS)-like process that expresses voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and generates spikes. Immunolabeling for the cytoskeletal linker protein ankyrin-G enables detection of the AIS-like processes in wholemounts and analysis of its distribution and spatial orientation. The AIS-like processes display no preferred orientation in the horizontal plane and randomly ascend or descend from the site of origin in the vertical plane of the retina, suggesting that this unique process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections. Instead, it may be adapted to respond to volume transmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Signal processing within the retina is generally mediated by graded potentials, whereas output is conveyed by action potentials transmitted along optic nerve axons. Among retinal neurons, amacrine cells seem to be an exception to this general rule, as several types generate voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Na<sub>v</sub>) channel-dependent action potentials. The AII, a narrow-field, bistratified axon-less amacrine cell found in mammalian retinas, displays a unique process that resembles an axon initial segment (AIS), with expression of Na<sub>v</sub> channels colocalized with the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin-G, and generates action potentials. As the role of spiking in AIIs is uncertain, we hypothesized that the morphological properties of the AIS-like process could provide information relevant for its functional importance, including potential pre- and/or postsynaptic connectivity. For morphological analysis, we injected AII amacrine cells in slices with fluorescent dye and immunolabeled the slices for ankyrin-G. Subsequently, this enabled us to reliably identify AII-type processes among ankyrin-G-labeled processes in wholemount retina. We systematically analyzed the laminar localization, spatial orientation, and distribution of the AIS-like processes as a function of retinal eccentricity. In the horizontal plane, the processes displayed no preferred orientation and terminal endings were randomly distributed. In the vertical plane, the processes displayed a horizontal preference, but also ascended and descended into the inner nuclear layer and proximal inner plexiform layer, respectively. These results suggest that the AII amacrine AIS-like process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections, but may instead be adapted to respond to volume neurotransmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.</p>

<p>
Testing the reward versus aversive value of electrical stimulation of 74 structures of the macaque brain revealed a ubiquitous distribution of valenced sites in pathways throughout the brain. Most positive were striatal and frontal cortical structures densely innervated by pathways originating in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) cell groups A9 and A10. Nevertheless, reward related more to structures' neurobehavioral function than to density of DA-innervation. Many positive sites were found in non-DA posterior cingulate cortex, and stimulation of purely sensory and motor areas was generally negative, regardless of DA innervation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The objective of the study was to identify brain structures that mediate reward as evidenced by positive reinforcing effects of stimuli on behavior. Testing by intracerebral self-stimulation enabled monkeys to inform whether activation of ~2900 sites in 74 structures of 4 sensorimotor pathways and 4 modulatory loop pathways was positive, negative or neutral. Stimulation was rewarding at 30% of sites, negative at 17%, neutral at 52%. Virtually all (99%) structures yielded some positive or negative sites, suggesting a ubiquitous distribution of pathways transmitting valence information. Mapping of sites to structures with dense versus sparse dopaminergic (DA) or noradrenergic (NA) innervation showed that stimulation of DA-pathways was rewarding or neutral. Stimulation of NA-pathways was not rewarding. Stimulation of association areas was generally rewarding; stimulation of purely sensory or motor structures was generally negative. Reward related more to structures' sensorimotor function than to density of DA-innervation. Stimulation of basal ganglia loop pathways was rewarding except in lateral globus pallidus, an inhibitory structure in the negative feedback loop; stimulation of the cerebellar loop was rewarding in anterior vermis and the spinocerebellar pathway; and stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 loop was rewarding. While most positive sites were in the DA reward system, numerous sites in sparsely DA-innervated posterior cingulate and parietal cortices may represent a separate reward system. DA-density represents concentrations of plastic synapses that mediate acquisition of new synaptic connections. DA-sparse areas may represent innate, genetically programmed reward-associated pathways. Implications of findings in regard to response habituation and addiction are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Finding and Keeping the Beat: Neural Mechanisms Differ as Beat Perception Unfolds</a></h4>

              
                Perception of a regular beat is essential to our ability to synchronize movements to music in an anticipatory fashion. Beat perception requires multiple, distinct neural functions, corresponding to the perceptual stages that occur over time, including 1) detection that regularity is present (beat finding), 2) prediction of future regular events to enable anticipation (beat continuation), and 3) dynamic adjustment of predictions as the rhythmic stimulus changes (beat adjustment). The striatum has been shown to be crucial for beat perception generally, although it is unclear how, or whether, distinct regions of the striatum contribute to these different stages of beat perception. Here, we used fMRI to investigate the activity of striatal subregions during the different stages of beat perception. Participants listened to pairs of rhythms (polyrhythms) whose temporal structure induced distinct perceptual stages: finding, continuation, and adjustment of the beat. Dorsal putamen was preferentially active during beat finding, whereas the ventral putamen was preferentially active during beat adjustment. We also observed that anterior insula activity was sensitive to metrical structure (greater when polyrhythms were metrically incongruent than when they were congruent). These data implicate the dorsal putamen in the detection of regularity, possibly by detection of coincidences between cortical oscillations, and the ventral putamen in the adjustment of regularity perception, possibly by integration of prediction errors in ongoing beat predictions. Additionally, activity in the supramarginal and superior temporal gyri correlated with beat tapping performance, and activity in the superior temporal gyrus correlated with beat perception (performance on the Beat Alignment Test).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Bidirectional Switch in the Shank3 Phosphorylation State Biases Synapses toward Up or Down Scaling</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity requires widespread remodeling of synaptic signaling and scaffolding networks, but the role of posttranslational modifications in this process has not been systematically studied. Using deepscale, quantitative analysis of the phosphoproteome in mouse neocortical neurons, we found wide-spread and temporally complex changes during synaptic scaling up and down. We observed 424 bidirectionally modulated phosphosites that were strongly enriched for synapse-associated proteins, including S1539 in the ASD-associated synaptic scaffold protein Shank3. Using a parallel proteomic analysis performed on Shank3 isolated from rat neocortical neurons by immunoaffinity, we identified two sites that were hypo-phosphorylated during scaling up and hyper-phosphorylated during scaling down: one (rat S1615) that corresponded to S1539 in mouse, and a second highly conserved site, rat S1586. The phosphorylation status of these sites modified the synaptic localization of Shank3 during scaling protocols, and dephosphorylation of these sites via PP2A activity was essential for the maintenance of synaptic scaling up. Finally, phosphomimetic mutations at these sites prevented scaling up but not down, while phosphodeficient mutations prevented scaling down but not up. Thus, an activity-dependent switch between hypo- and hyperphosphorylation at S1586/ S1615 of Shank3 enables scaling up or down, respectively. Collectively our data show that activity-dependent phosphoproteome dynamics are important for the functional reconfiguration of synaptic scaffolds, and can bias synapses toward upward or downward homeostatic plasticity.

                In vivo cortical optical imaging needs to overcome the scattering of skull. Compared to the traditional transcranial surgery-based open-skull glass window and thinned-skull preparation, chemical tissue optical clearing techniques can provide a skull-remained optical access to the brain while maintaining its original environment. However, previously demonstrated skull optical clearing windows could only maintain transparency for a couple of hours and hardly capable for high-resolution monitoring of awake animals. Here, we developed a convenient and easy-handling chronic skull optical clearing technique, named "Through-Intact-Skull (TIS) window", which was compatible with long-term observation at high resolution, and yielded large imaging depth of 900 m for cortical neurovascular visualization. In addition, our TIS window could monitor neuron activity in awake mice for a long term. Therefore, our bio-compatible and non-invasive TIS window is a new promising approach for intravital brain microscopy with great potential for basic research in neuroscience.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early onset deficits in social behavior and repetitive behavior. Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein (CHD8) is one of the genes with the strongest association to autism. Alongside with the core symptoms of ASD, individuals with ASD are reported to have gastrointestinal (GI) problems, and a majority of individuals with CHD8 mutations display GI problems. However, the relationship between autism related genes, such as CHD8, gastrointestinal function, and autism related behaviours are yet very unclear. In the current study, we found that mice haploinsufficient for CHD8 have leaky gut, a dysregulated transcriptome in gut epithelial cells, decreased gut tuft cells and goblet cells, and an increase in microbial load. Specific deletion of CHD8 in gut epithelial cells induced an increase in anxiety-related behaviours in, a phenotype that is often observed in autism and full body knockdown of CHD8, in addition to decreased tuft cells. In addition, antibiotic treatment of CHD8 haploinsufficient mice attenuates sociability deficits. Therefore, the current study determines a pathway for autism-related GI deficits, and how these deficits may play a direct role in the development of autism-related behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">tACS competes with ongoing oscillations for control of spike-timing in the primate brain.</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a promising but controversial method for modulating neural activity noninvasively. Much of the controversy revolves around the question of whether tACS can generate electric fields that are strong enough to entrain neuronal spiking activity. Here we show that what matters is not the electric field strength per se, but rather the strength of the stimulation relative to ongoing oscillatory entrainment. We recorded from single neurons in the cortex and subcortex of behaving non-human primates, while applying tACS at different frequencies and amplitudes. When neuronal activity was weakly locked to ongoing oscillations, tACS readily entrained single-neuron activity to specific stimulation phases. In contrast, neurons that were strongly locked to ongoing oscillations usually exhibited decreased entrainment during low-amplitude tACS. As this reduced entrainment is a property of many oscillating systems, attempts to impose an external rhythm on spiking activity may often yield precisely the opposite effect.

                The brain excels at processing sensory input, even in rich or chaotic environments. Mounting evidence attributes this to the creation of sophisticated internal models of the environment that draw on statistical structures in the unfolding sensory input. Understanding how and where this modeling takes place is a core question in statistical learning. It is unknown how this modeling applies to random sensory signals. Here, we identify conditional relations, through transitional probabilities, as an implicit structure supporting the encoding of a random auditory stream. We evaluate this representation using intracranial electroencephalography recordings by applying information-theoretical principles to high-frequency activity (75-145 Hz). We demonstrate how the brain continuously encodes conditional relations between random stimuli in a network outside of the auditory system following a hierarchical organization including temporal, frontal and hippocampal regions. Our results highlight that hierarchically organized brain areas continuously attempt to order incoming information by maintaining a probabilistic representation of the sensory input, even under random stimuli presentation.

                Loss of consciousness (LOC) is a hallmark of many epileptic seizures and carries risks of serious injury and sudden death. While cortical sleep-like activities accompany LOC during focal impaired awareness (FIA) seizures, the mechanisms of LOC during focal to bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC) seizures remain unclear. Quantifying differences in markers of cortical activation and ictal recruitment between FIA and FBTC seizures may also help to understand their different consequences for clinical outcomes and to optimize neuromodulation therapies. We quantified clinical signs of LOC and intracranial EEG (iEEG) activity during 129 FIA and 50 FBTC from 41 patients. We characterized iEEG changes both in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and in areas remote from SOZ with a total of 3386 electrodes distributed across brain areas. First, we compared the dynamics of iEEG sleep-like activities: slow-wave activity (SWA; 1-4 Hz) and beta/delta ratio (B/D; a validated marker of cortical activation) during FIA vs. FBTC. Second, we quantified differences between FBTC and FIA for a marker validated to detect ictal cross-frequency coupling: phase-locked high-gamma (PLHG; high gamma phased locked to low frequencies) and a marker of ictal recruitment: the epileptogenicity index (i.e. the number of channels crossing an energy ratio threshold for high vs. low frequency power). Third, we assessed changes in iEEG activity preceding and accompanying behavioral generalization onset and their correlation with electromyogram (EMG) channels. In addition, we analyzed human cortical multi-unit activity recorded with Utah arrays during three FBTC. Compared to FIA, FBTC seizures were characterized by deeper LOC and by stronger increases in SWA in parieto-occipital cortex. FBTC also displayed more widespread increases in cortical activation (B/D), ictal cross-frequency coupling (PLHG) and ictal recruitment (epileptogenicity index). Even before generalization, FBTC displayed deeper LOC; this early LOC was accompanied by a paradoxical increase in B/D in fronto-parietal cortex. Behavioral generalization coincided with complete loss of responsiveness and a subsequent increase in high-gamma in the whole brain, which was especially synchronous in deep sources and could not be explained by EMG. Similarly, multi-unit activity analysis of FBTC revealed sustained increases in cortical firing rates during and after generalization onset in areas remote from the SOZ. Unlike during FIA, LOC during FBTC is characterized by a paradoxical increase in cortical activation and neuronal firing. These findings suggest differences in the mechanisms of ictal LOC between FIA and FBTC and may account for the more negative prognostic consequences of FBTC.

                Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects young children and manifests symptoms such as hyperactivity, impulsivity and cognitive disabilities. Psychostimulants, which are the primary treatment for ADHD, target monoamine transporters and have a paradoxical calming effect, but their mechanism of action, is unclear. Studies using the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) knockout mice, which have elevated striatal DA levels and are considered an animal model of ADHD, have suggested that the paradoxical calming effect of psychostimulants might be through the actions on serotonin neurotransmission. On the other hand, newer non-stimulant class of drugs such as atomoxetine and Intuniv suggest that targeting the norepinephrine (NE) system in the PFC might explain this paradoxical calming effect. We sought to decipher the mechanism of this paradoxical effect of psychostimulants through an integrated approach using ex vivo monoamine efflux experiments, monoamine transporter knockout mice, drug infusions and behavior. Our ex vivo efflux experiments reveal that NE transporter (NET) blocker desipramine elevates both norepinephrine and dopamine but not serotonin levels, in PFC tissue slices from wild-type and DAT-KO but not NET KO mice. However, serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) inhibitor fluoxetine elevates only serotonin in all three genotypes. Systemic administration of both desipramine and fluoxetine but local PFC infusion of only desipramine and not fluoxetine inhibits hyperactivity in the DAT-KO mice. In contrast, pharmacological norepinephrine depletion but dopamine elevation using Nepicastat also inhibits hyperactivity in DATKO mice. Together, these data suggest that elevation of PFC dopamine and not norepinephrine or serotonin as a convergent mechanism for the paradoxical psychostimulant effects observe in ADHD therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulating music supports attention in listeners with attentional difficulties</a></h4>

              
                Background music is widely used to sustain attention, but little is known about what musical properties aid attention. This may be due to inter-individual variability in neural responses to music. We test the hypothesis that music can sustain attention by affecting oscillations via acoustic amplitude modulation, differentially for those with varying levels of attentional difficulty. We first show that heavily-modulated music improves sustained attention for participants with more ADHD symptoms. FMRI showed this music elicited greater activity in attentional networks in this group only, and EEG showed greater stimulus-brain coupling for this group in response to the heavily-modulated music. Finally, we parametrically manipulated the depth and rate of amplitude modulations inserted in otherwise-identical music, and found that beta-range modulations helped more than other frequency ranges for participants with more ADHD symptoms. Results suggest the possibility of an oscillation-based neural mechanism for targeted music to support improved cognitive performance.

                We seldom time life events intently yet recalling the duration of events is lifelike. Is episodic time the outcome of a rational after-thought or of physiological clocks keeping track of time without our conscious awareness of it? To answer this, we recorded human brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during quiet wakefulness. Unbeknownst to participants, we asked them after the MEG recording to guess its duration. In the absence of overt attention to time, the relative amount of time participants' alpha brain rhythms (  ~ 10 Hz) were in bursting mode predicted participants' retrospective duration estimate. This relation was absent when participants prospectively measured elapsed time during the MEG recording. We conclude that  bursts embody discrete states of awareness for episodic timing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of the 40-Hz Auditory Steady-state Response with Optically Pumped Magnetometers</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique that noninvasively detects the brain magnetic field from neuronal activations. Conventional MEG measures brain signals using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). SQUID based MEG requires a cryogenic environment involving a bulky non-magnetic dewar and the consumption of liquid helium, which restricts the variability of the sensor array and the gap between the cortical sources and sensors. Recently, miniature optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have been developed and commercialized. OPMs do not require cryogenic cooling and can be placed within millimeters from the scalp. In the present study, we arranged six OPM sensors on the temporal area to detect auditory related brain responses in a two layer magnetically shielded room. We presented the auditory stimuli of 1 kHz pure tone bursts with 200 ms duration and obtained the M50 and M100 components of auditory evoked fields. We delivered the periodic stimuli with a 40 Hz repetition rate and observed the gamma band power changes and inter trial phase coherence of auditory steady state responses at 40 Hz. We found that the OPM sensors have a performance comparable to that of conventional SQUID based MEG sensors, and our results suggest the feasibility of using OPM sensors for functional neuroimaging and brain computer interface applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presaccadic attention enhances contrast sensitivity, but not at the upper vertical meridian</a></h4>

              
                Human visual performance is not only better at the fovea and decreases with eccentricity, but also has striking radial asymmetries around the visual field: At a fixed eccentricity, it is better along (1) the horizontal than vertical meridian and (2) the lower than upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries, known as performance fields, are pervasive -they emerge for many visual dimensions, regardless of head rotation, stimulus orientation or display luminance- and resilient -they are not alleviated by covert exogenous or endogenous attention, deployed in the absence of eye movements. Performance fields have been studied exclusively during eye fixation. However, a major driver of everyday attentional orienting is saccade preparation, during which visual attention automatically shifts to the future eye fixation. This presaccadic shift of attention is considered strong and compulsory, and relies on fundamentally different neural computations and substrates than covert attention. Given these differences, we investigated whether presaccadic attention can compensate for the ubiquitous performance asymmetries observed during eye fixation. Our data replicate polar performance asymmetries during fixation and document the same asymmetries during saccade preparation. Crucially, however, presaccadic attention enhanced contrast sensitivity at the horizontal and lower vertical meridian, but not at the upper vertical meridian. Thus, instead of attenuating polar performance asymmetries, presaccadic attention exacerbates them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local brain-state dependency of effective connectivity: evidence from TMS-EEG</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous cortical oscillations have been shown to modulate cortical responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). If not controlled for, they might increase variability in responses and mask meaningful changes in the signals of interest when studying the brain with TMS combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG). To address this challenge in future closed-loop stimulation paradigms, we need to understand how spontaneous oscillations affect TMS-evoked responses. Objective: To describe the effect of the pre-stimulus phase of cortical mu (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations on TMS-induced effective connectivity patterns. Methods: We applied TMS to the left primary motor cortex and right pre-supplementary motor area of three subjects while recording EEG. We classified trials off-line into positive- and negative-phase classes according to the mu and beta rhythms. We calculated differences in the global mean-field amplitude (GMFA) and compared the cortical spreading of the TMS-evoked activity between the two classes. Results: Phase had significant effects on the GMFA in 11 out of 12 datasets (3 subjects x 2 stimulation sites x 2 frequency bands). Seven of the datasets showed significant differences in the time range 15-50 ms, nine in 50-150 ms, and eight after 150 ms post-stimulus. Source estimates showed complex spatial differences between the classes in the cortical spreading of the TMS-evoked activity. Conclusions: TMS-evoked effective connectivity appears to depend on the phase of local cortical oscillations at the stimulated site. This may be crucial for efficient design of future brain-state-dependent and closed-loop stimulation paradigms.

                Non-invasive gamma entrainment has shown promising results in alleviating cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in mice and humans. In this study, we examine improvements in the synchronization characteristics of the brain's oscillations induced by 40Hz auditory stimulation based on electroencephalography data recorded from a group of dementia patients. We observed that when the quality of entrainment surpasses a certain level, several indicators of brain synchronization significantly improve. Specifically, the entrained oscillatory activity maintains temporal phase stability in the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, and persistent spatial phase coupling between them. In addition, notable theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling is observed in these areas. Interestingly, a high theta power at rest predicts the quality of entrainment. We identify differentiating attributes of temporal/spatial synchronization and cross-frequency coupling in the data of two groups with entrained and non-entrained responses which point to enhanced network synchronization caused by entrainment and can explain its potential therapeutic effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TRACER: A toolkit to register and visualize anatomical coordinates in the rat brain</a></h4>

              
                The need for anatomical registration and visualization tools is greater than ever thanks to novel technologies that allow users to record from thousands of neurons across multiple brain regions simultaneously. The vast majority of digital reconstruction toolkits for rodent models were developed using mouse brain atlases, leaving few options for those using rats. Retrofitting rat atlases into extant software is possible, but this demands effort and programming skills which most end-users lack. We therefore developed an open-source, python-based Toolkit for Reconstructing Anatomical CoordinatEs in Rats, TRACER, which allows users to reconstruct the trajectories of recording electrodes (e.g Neuropixels) or to visualize virus expression or other features in a comprehensively annotated 3D volume, the Waxholm Space (WHS) rat brain atlas. The WHS atlas is made from high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, and contains >200 regional delineations. Beyond post-hoc reconstructions of electrodes or virus expression, TRACER can be used to generate coordinates for targeting brain regions prior to surgery. TRACER is available openly on GitHub and is compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-dependent selectivity to natural scenes in the retina</a></h4>

              
                Retina ganglion cells extract specific features from natural scenes and send this information to the brain. In particular, they respond to local light increase (On responses), or decrease (Off). However, it is unclear if this On-Off selectivity, characterized with synthetic stimuli, is maintained when they are stimulated with natural scenes. Here we recorded the responses of ganglion cells of mice and axolotls to stimuli composed of natural images slightly perturbed by patterns of random noise to determine their selectivity during natural stimulation. The On-Off selectivity strongly depended on the natural image. A single ganglion cell can signal luminance increase for one natural image, and luminance decrease for another. Modeling and experiments showed that this was due to the non-linear combination of different pathways of the retinal circuit. Despite the versatility of the On-Off selectivity, a systematic analysis demonstrated that contrast was reliably encoded in these responses. Our perturbative approach thus uncovers the selectivity of retinal ganglion cells to more complex features than initially thought during natural scene stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anatomical and functional connectivity support the existence of a salience network node within the caudal ventrolateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Three large-scale brain networks are considered essential to cognitive flexibility: the ventral and dorsal attention (VAN and DAN) and salience (SN) networks. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) is a known component of the VAN and DAN, but its role in the SN is controversial. In this study, we used a translational and multimodal approach to demonstrate the existence of a SN node within the vlPFC. First, we used tract-tracing methods in non-human primates (NHP) to quantify the anatomic connectivity strength between the different vlPFC areas and the frontal and insular cortices. The strongest connections with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) locations comprising the two main cortical SN nodes were derived from the caudal area 47/12. This location also has strong axonal projections to subcortical structures of the salience network, including the dorsomedial thalamus, hypothalamus, sublenticular extended amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Second, we used a seed-based functional connectivity analysis in NHP resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data to validate the caudal area 47/12 as an SN node. Third, we used the same approach in human rsfMRI data to identify a homologous structure in caudal area 47/12, also showing strong connections with the SN cortical nodes, thus confirming the caudal area 47/12 as the SN node in the vlPFC. Taken together, the vlPFC contains nodes for all three cognitive networks, the VAN, DAN, and SN. Thus, the vlPFC is in a position to switch between these three cognitive networks, suggesting a key role as an attentional hub. Its tight additional connections to the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, and ventral premotor cortices, places the vlPFC at the center for switching behaviors based on environmental stimuli, computing value and cognitive control.

	<p>The insula is involved in a wide variety of functions, including social and emotional processing. Despite the numerous connections it shares with brain structures known to play a role in autobiographical memory (AM), little is known on the contribution of the insula to AM processing. The aim of the study was to examine emotional AM retrieval in patients with insular resection for drug-resistant epilepsy. Ten patients who underwent partial or complete insular resection (IR) were matched on age, sex, and education, to fifteen patients who underwent temporal lobectomy (TL), and to fifteen healthy controls. Participants were asked to recall four positive, four negative, and four neutral memories from their past using the autobiographical interview procedure. The results suggest that AM for emotional and neutral events after IR was comparable to that of healthy controls, whereas deficits were observed after TL. However, an independent examiner judged IR patients’ memories as poorer than those of healthy controls on the episodic richness scale, suggesting a lack of some aspects of rich and vivid remembering. Furthermore, analysis on subjective self-rated scales revealed that, contrary to healthy controls, patients with IR judged their neutral memories as more emotional. This study suggests that AM is generally preserved after IR. However, given the small sample size and varied lesion location, one cannot totally exclude a potential role of specific insular sub-regions on some aspects of autobiographical memory. In addition, IR patients showed poor emotional judgment for neutral memories, which is congruent with previous findings of altered emotional processing in this population.</p>

	<p>Adult development throughout a lifetime implies a series of changes in systems, including cognitive and linguistic functioning. The aim of this article is to study the effect of foreign language training on linguistic processing, particularly the frequency of the tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon and on other cognitive processes such as processing speed and working memory in adults aged 40 to 60 years. Sixty-six healthy Colombian teachers were enrolled in this study. They were then randomly divided into an experimental group (33 healthy adults who underwent a four-week training period) and a passive control group (33 healthy adults who did not undergo any training). All participants performed induction tasks for the TOT phenomenon, working memory and processing speed before and after the four weeks. Results showed more of an effect in the semantic access, phonological access and processing speed measures with a better performance in the experimental group than in the control group. In Colombia, this type of training is still new and little is known to date about programs to prevent cognitive impairments. The need to conduct more studies confirming or refuting these findings is discussed, thus raising awareness about the extent of this type of training to increase the linguistic and cognitive performance of adults.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination allows for the regulation of conduction velocity, affecting the precise timing of neuronal inputs important for the development and function of brain circuits. In turn, myelination may be altered by changes in experience, neuronal activity, and vesicular release, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resulting alterations in myelination require further investigation. We thus studied the development of myelination in the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpole, a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of its retinotectal system. We begin with a systematic characterization of the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the <i>Xenopus</i> retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Based on the mid-larval developmental progression of MBP expression in <i>Xenopus</i>, we identify an appropriate developmental window in which to assess the effects of early temporally patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. We used calcium imaging of axon terminals in vivo to characterise the responses of retinal ganglion cells over a range of stroboscopic stimulation frequencies. Strobe frequencies that reliably elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses were then presented to animals for 7 d, and differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm were subsequently quantified. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">High resolution diffusion tensor imaging of the hippocampus across the healthy lifespan</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The human hippocampus is difficult to image given its small size, location, shape, and complex internal architecture. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown age-related hippocampal volume changes that vary along the anterior–posterior axis. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides complementary measures related to microstructure, but there are few hippocampus DTI studies investigating change with age in healthy participants, and all have been limited by low spatial resolution. The current study uses high resolution 1 mm isotropic DTI of 153 healthy volunteers aged 5–74 years to investigate diffusion and volume trajectories of the hippocampus (whole, head, body, and tail) and correlations with memory. Hippocampal volume showed age-related changes that differed between head (peaking at midlife), body (no changes), and tail (decreasing across the age span). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, axial, and radial diffusivities (MD, AD, RD) yielded peaks or minima, respectively, at ~30–35 years in all three subregions of the hippocampus. Greater magnitude changes were observed during development than in aging. Age trajectories for both volume and DTI were similar between males and females. Correlations between tests of memory and FA and/or volume were significant in younger subjects (5–17 years), but not in 18–49 year olds or 50–74 year olds. MD was significantly correlated with memory performance in 18–49 year olds, but not in other age groups. Given the diffusion-weighted image contrast and resolution, head digitations could be examined revealing that the majority of subjects had 3–4 (48%) or 2 (32%) bilaterally with no effect of age. One millimeter isotropic DTI yielded high quality diffusion-weighted maps of the human hippocampus that showed regionally specific age effects and cognitive correlations along the anterior–posterior axis from 5 to 74 years.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordination chemogenetics for activation of GPCR-type glutamate receptors in brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Direct activation of cell-surface receptors is highly desirable for elucidating the physiological roles of receptors. However, subtype-selective ligands are very limited because of the high homology among receptor subtypes. A potential approach for selective activation of a receptor subtype is chemogenetics, in which both point mutagenesis of the receptors and designed ligands are used. However, ligand-binding properties are affected in most current methods. Here, we developed a chemogenetic method for direct activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1), which plays essential roles in cerebellar functions in the brain. Our screening identified a mGlu1 mutant, mGlu1(N264H), that was directly activated by palladium complexes. Notably, a palladium complex showing low cytotoxicity successfully activated mGlu1 in mGlu1(N264H) knock-in mice, revealing that activation of endogenous mGlu1 is sufficient to evoke the critical cellular mechanism of synaptic plasticity, a basis of motor learning in the cerebellum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An internal expectation guides Drosophila egg-laying decisions</a></h4>

              
                When presented with two egg-laying substrates, Drosophila lay most of their eggs on the option with higher relative value. How do flies make this relative-value decision? Might the strategy they use allow them to choose the best option even when they experience substrates with a more complex spatiotemporal profile than in canonical two-choice paradigms? We measured Drosophila egg-laying behavior in diverse substrate environments. In all cases, we found that flies dynamically increase or decrease their egg-laying rates as they explore substrates for a deposition site so as to target eggs to the best, recently visited option. Visiting the best option typically led to a strong reduction in egg laying on other substrates for several minutes, with this timescale varying across fly strains. Our data support a model in which flies compare the value of the current substrate with an internally constructed expectation on the value of available options to regulate the likelihood of laying an egg. We show that dopamine-neuron activity is critical for learning and/or expressing this expectation, similar to its role in certain tasks in vertebrates. Integrating sensory experiences over minutes to generate an internal sense of the quality of available options, i.e., forming an expectation, allows flies to use a dynamic reference point for judging the current substrate and might be a general way in which decisions are made, even beyond flies and egg laying.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Capillary stall quantification from optical coherence tomography angiogram maximum intensity projections</a></h4>

              
                Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is applicable to the study of cerebral microvasculature in vivo. Optimised acquisition schemes enable the generation of three-dimensional OCT angiograms, i.e., volumetric images of red blood cell flux in capillary networks, currently at a repetition rate of up to 1/10 seconds. This makes testable a new class of hypotheses that strive to bridge the gap between microscopic phenomena occurring at the spatial scale of neurons, and less invasive but crude techniques to measure macroscopic blood flow dynamics. Here we present a method for quantifying the occurrence of transient capillary stalls in OCT angiograms, i.e., events during which blood flow through a capillary branch is temporarily occluded. By making the assumption that information on such events is present predominantly in the imaging plane, we implemented a pipeline that automatically segments a network of interconnected capillaries from the maximum intensity projections (MIP) of a series of 3D angiograms. We then developed tools enabling rapid manual assessment of the binary flow status (open/stalled) of hundreds of capillary segments based on the intensity profile of each segment across time. The entire pipeline is optimized to run on a standard laptop computer, requiring no high-performance, low-availability resources, despite very large data volumes. To further reduce the threshold of adoption, and ultimately to support the development of reproducible research methods in the young field, we provide the documented code for scrutiny and re-use under a permissive open-source license.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The generalized spatial representation in the prefrontal cortex is inherited from the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal and neocortical neural activity is modulated by the position of the individual in space. While hippocampal neurons provide the basis for a spatial map, prefrontal cortical neurons generalize over environmental features. Whether these generalized representations result from a bidirectional interaction with, or are mainly derived from hippocampal spatial representations is not known. By examining simultaneously recorded hippocampal and medial prefrontal neurons, we observed that prefrontal spatial representations show a delayed coherence with hippocampal ones. We also identified subpopulations of cells in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex that formed functional cross-area couplings; these resembled the optimal connections predicted by a probabilistic model of spatial information transfer and generalization. Moreover, cross-area couplings were strongest and had the shortest delay preceding spatial decision-making. Our results suggest that generalized spatial coding in the medial prefrontal cortex is inherited from spatial representations in the hippocampus, and that the routing of information can change dynamically with behavioral demands.

Or... is it? : A proposition for analyses and reporting standards for structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus</a></h4>

              
                The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem shows early signs of protein pathologies in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. As the LC's small size (approximately 2.5 mm in width) presents a challenge for molecular imaging, the past decade has seen a steep rise in structural and functional Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies aiming to characterise the LC's changes in ageing and neurodegeneration. However, given its position in the brainstem and small volume, great care must be taken to yield methodologically reliable MR results as spatial deviations in transformations can greatly reduce the statistical power of the analyses at the group level. Here, we suggest a spatial transformation procedure and a set of quality assessment methods which allow LC researchers to achieve the spatial precision necessary for investigating this small but potentially impactful brain structure. Using a combination of available toolboxes (SPM12, ANTs, FSL, FreeSurfer), individual structural and functional 3T LC scans are transformed into MNI space via a study-specific anatomical template. Following this, the precision of spatial alignment in individual MNI-transformed images is quantified using in-plane distance measures based on slice-specific centroids of structural LC segmentations and based on landmarks of salient anatomical features in mean functional images, respectively. Median in-plane distance of all landmarks on the transformed structural as well as functional LC imaging data were below 2 mm, thereby falling below the typical LC width of 2.5 mm suggested by post-mortem data. With the set of spatial post-processing steps outlined in this paper and available for download, we hope to give readers interested in LC imaging a starting point for a reliable analysis of structural and functional MR data of the LC and to have also taken a first step towards establishing reporting standards of LC imaging data.

                Changes in epigenetic modifications present a mechanism how environmental factors like the experience of stress can alter gene regulation. While stress-related disorders have consistently been associated with differential DNA methylation, little is known about the time scale in which these alterations emerge. We investigated dynamic DNA methylation changes in whole blood of 42 healthy male individuals in response to a stressful cognitive task, its association with concentration changes in cortisol and its modulation by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We observed a continuous increase in COMT promotor DNA methylation which correlated with higher saliva cortisol levels and was still detectable one week later. However, this lasting effect was suppressed by concurrent activity-enhancing anodal tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings support the significance of gene-specific DNA methylation in whole blood as potential biomarkers for stress-related disorders. Moreover, they suggest alternative molecular mechanisms possibly involved in lasting behavioral effects of tDCS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic phenotyping and characterization of the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Animal models of disease are valuable resources for investigating pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. However, for complex disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the generation and availability of innumerous distinct animal models present unique challenges to AD researchers and hinder the success of useful therapies. Here, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD across its lifespan to better inform the field of the various pathologies that appear at specific ages, and comment on drift that has occurred in the development of pathology in this line since its development 20 years ago. This modern characterization of the 3xTg-AD model includes an assessment of impairments in behavior, cognition, and long-term potentiation followed by quantification of amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaque burden and neurofibrillary tau tangles, biochemical levels of A{beta}, and tau protein, and neuropathological markers such as gliosis and accumulation of dystrophic neurites. We also present a novel comparison of the 3xTg-AD model with the 5xFAD model using the same deep-phenotyping characterization pipeline. The results from these analyses are freely available via the AD Knowledge Portal (https://admodelexplorer.synapse.org). Our work demonstrates the utility of a characterization pipeline that generates robust and standardized information relevant to investigating and comparing disease etiologies of current and future models of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oral and injected tamoxifen alter adult hippocampal neurogenesis in female and male mice</a></h4>

              
                Inducible Cre recombinase facilitates temporal control of genetic recombination in numerous transgenic model systems, a feature which has made it a popular tool for studies of adult neurogenesis. One of the most common forms of inducible Cre, CreERT2, requires activation by the synthetic estrogen tamoxifen (TAM) to initiate recombination of LoxP-flanked sequences. To date, most studies deliver TAM via intraperitoneal injection. But the introduction of TAM-infused commercial chows has recently expanded the possible modes of TAM delivery. Despite the widespread use of TAM-inducible genetic models in adult neurogenesis research, the comparative efficiency and off-target effects of TAM administration protocols is surprisingly infrequently studied. Here we compare a standard, 5 day TAM injection regimen with voluntary consumption of TAM-infused chow. First, we used adult NestinCreERT2;Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-EYFP reporter mice to show that 2 weeks of TAM chow and 5 days of injections led to LoxP recombination in a similar phenotypic population of neural stem and progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus. However, TAM chow resulted in substantially less overall recombination than injections. TAM administration also altered adult neurogenesis, but in different ways depending on administration route: TAM injection disrupted neural progenitor cell proliferation 3 weeks after TAM, whereas TAM chow increased neuronal differentiation of cells generated during the diet period. These findings provide guidance for selection of TAM administration route and appropriate controls in adult neurogenesis studies using TAM-inducible Cre mice. They also highlight the need for better understanding of off-target effects of TAM in other neurological processes and organ systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus projecting neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The paraventricular nucleus (PVT) of the midline thalamus is a critical higher-order cortico-thalamo-cortical integration site that plays a critical role in various behaviors including reward seeking, cue saliency, and emotional memory. Anatomical studies have shown that PVT projects to both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC). However, dual mPFC-HC projecting neurons which could serve a role in synchronizing mPFC and HC activity during PVT-dependent behaviors, have not been explored. Here we used a dual retrograde adenoassociated virus (AAV) tracing approach to characterize the location and proportion of different projection populations that send collaterals to mPFC and/or ventral hippocampus (vHC). Additionally, we examined the distribution of calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) with respect to these projection populations PVT. We found that PVT contains separate populations of cells that project to mPFC, vHC, and those that innervate both regions. Interestingly, dual mPFC-HC projecting cells expressed neither CR or CB. Topographically, mPFC- and vHC-projecting CB+ and CR+ cells clustered around dual projecting neurons in PVT. These results are consistent with the features of dual mPFC-vHC projecting cells in the nucleus reuniens (RE) and suggestive of a functional mPFC-PVT-vHC system that may support mPFC-vHC interactions in PVT-dependent behaviors.

                The Ataxin-2 (Atx2) protein contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative phenotypes in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA-2), Parkinsons Disease (PD) and Huntingtons Disease (HD). However, because the Atx2 protein contains multiple separable activities, deeper understanding requires experiments to address the exact mechanisms by which Atx2 modulates ND progression. Recent work on two ALS models, C9ORF72 and FUS, in Drosophila has shown that a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (cIDR) of Atx2 protein, required for assembly of RNP granules, is essential for the progression of neurodegenerative phenotypes as well as for accumulation of protein inclusions associated with these ALS models. Here we show that the Atx2-cIDR also similarly contributes to the progression of degenerative phenotypes and accumulation of Huntingtin protein aggregates in Drosophila models of HD. Because Huntingtin is not an established component of RNP granules, these observations support a recently hypothesised, unexpected protein-handling function for RNP granules, which could contribute to the progression of Huntingtons disease and, potentially, other proteinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Polyamine elevation and nitrogen stress are toxic hallmarks of chronic sleep loss in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Chronic sleep loss profoundly impacts health in ways coupled to metabolism; however, much existing literature links sleep and metabolism only on acute timescales. To explore the impact of chronically reduced sleep, we conducted unbiased metabolomics on heads from three Drosophila short-sleeping mutants. Common features included elevated ornithine and polyamines; and lipid, acyl-carnitine, and TCA cycle changes suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Biochemical studies of overall, circulating, and excreted nitrogen in sleep mutants demonstrate a specific defect in eliminating nitrogen, suggesting that elevated polyamines may function as a nitrogen sink. Both supplementing polyamines and inhibiting their synthesis with RNAi regulated sleep in control flies. Finally, both polyamine-supplemented food and high-protein feeding were highly toxic to sleep mutants, suggesting their altered nitrogen metabolism is maladaptive. Together, our results suggest polyamine accumulation specifically, and nitrogen stress in general, as potential mechanisms linking chronic sleep loss to adverse health outcomes.

                In the avian auditory brain stem, acoustic timing and intensity cues are processed in separate, parallel pathways via the two division of the cochlear nucleus, nucleus angularis (NA) and nucleus magnocellularis (NM). Differences in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic properties, such as release probability and short-term plasticity, contribute to differential processing of the auditory nerve inputs. We investigated the distribution of synaptotagmin, a putative calcium sensor for exocytosis, via immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence in the embryonic and hatchling chick brain stem (Gallus gallus). We found that the two major isoforms, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) and synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2), showed differential expression. In the NM, anti-Syt2 label was strong and resembled the endbulb terminals of the auditory nerve inputs, while anti-Syt1 label was weaker and more punctate. In NA, both isoforms were intensely expressed throughout the neuropil. A third isoform, synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), was largely absent from the cochlear nuclei. In nucleus laminaris (NL, the target nucleus of NM), anti-Syt2 and anti-Syt7 strongly labeled the dendritic lamina. These patterns were established by embryonic day 18 and persisted to postnatal day 7. Double labeling immunofluorescence showed Syt1 and Syt2 were associated with Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 (VGluT2), but not Vesicular GABA Transporter (VGAT), suggesting these Syt isoforms were localized to excitatory, but not inhibitory, terminals. These results suggest that Syt2 is the major calcium binding protein underlying excitatory neurotransmission in the timing pathway comprising NM and NL, while Syt2 and Syt1 regulate excitatory transmission in the parallel intensity pathway via cochlear nucleus NA.

	<p>We investigated the intervention effect of training using a feedback-type tactile discrimination system on sensorimotor dysfunction of the hand after a stroke. A human male subject with sensorimotor dysfunction in his left hand after a stroke was asked to perform peg manipulation practice, a building block stacking task, and a material identification task for 10 min each for six weeks. During the activities, a tactile discrimination feedback system was used. The system is a device that detects the vibration information generated when touching an object with a hand and that feeds back the captured information in real time as vibration information. After the intervention, in addition to the reorganization of the sensorimotor areas, the deep sensation, sense of agency, numbness, amount of use, and quality of the left-hand movement improved. Our results suggest that training with the use of a feedback system could be a new form of rehabilitation for sensorimotor dysfunction of the hand.</p>

	<p>It is a widely held belief that developmental dyslexia (DD) is a phonological disorder in which readers have difficulty associating graphemes with their corresponding phonemes. In contrast, the magnocellular theory of dyslexia assumes that DD is a visual disorder caused by dysfunctional magnocellular neural pathways. The review explores arguments for and against these theories. Recent results have shown that DD is caused by (1) a reduced ability to simultaneously recognize sequences of letters that make up words, (2) longer fixation times required to simultaneously recognize strings of letters, and (3) amplitudes of saccades that do not match the number of simultaneously recognized letters. It was shown that pseudowords that could not be recognized simultaneously were recognized almost without errors when the fixation time was extended. However, there is an individual maximum number of letters that each reader with DD can recognize simultaneously. Findings on the neurobiological basis of temporal summation have shown that a necessary prolongation of fixation times is due to impaired processing mechanisms of the visual system, presumably involving magnocells and parvocells. An area in the mid-fusiform gyrus also appears to play a significant role in the ability to simultaneously recognize words and pseudowords. The results also contradict the assumption that DD is due to a lack of eye movement control. The present research does not support the assumption that DD is caused by a phonological disorder but shows that DD is due to a visual processing dysfunction.</p>

	<p>Various studies demonstrate a special role of the right compared to the left anterior insula in mediating our self. However, the neural features of the right insula that allow for its special role remain unclear. Presupposing a spatiotemporal model of self—“Basis model of self-specificity” (BMSS)—we here address the following question: what spatial-topographic and temporal-dynamic features render neural activity in the right insula to be more suitable in mediating self-specificity than the left insula? First, applying fMRI, we demonstrate that the right insula (i) exhibits higher degrees of centrality in rest, and (ii) higher context-dependent functional connectivity in a self-specific task among regions of distinct layers of self (intero-, extero-proprioceptive, and mental). Second, using EEG in rest and task, we show that the right insula shows longer autocorrelation window (ACW) in its neural activity than both left insula and other regions of the different layers of self. Together, we demonstrate special topographic, i.e., high functional connectivity, and dynamic, i.e., long ACW, neural features of the right insula compared to both left insula and other regions of the distinct layers of self. This suits neural activity in the right insula ideally for high functional integration and temporal continuity as key features of the self including its intero-, extero-proprioceptive, and mental layers.</p>

	<p>There is increasing recognition of the involvement of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems in the modulation of chronic pain. The first part of the present article reviews the evidence indicating that dopamine exerts analgesic effects during persistent pain by stimulating the D2 receptors in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Thereby, dopamine inhibits striatal output via the D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSN). Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesostriatal pathways is hampered in chronic pain states and this alteration maintains and exacerbates pain. The second part of this article focuses on the glutamatergic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc, their activity changes in chronic pain, and their role in pain modulation. Finally, interactions between dopaminergic and glutamatergic inputs to the D2-MSN are considered in the context of persistent pain. Studies using novel techniques indicate that pain is regulated oppositely by two independent dopaminergic circuits linking separate parts of the ventral tegmental area and of the NAc, which also interact with distinct regions of the medial prefrontal cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Separable actions of acetylcholine and noradrenaline on neuronal ensemble formation in hippocampal CA3 circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke Y. Prince, Travis Bacon, Rachel Humphries, Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova, Claudia Clopath, Jack R. Mellor</p>

In the hippocampus, episodic memories are thought to be encoded by the formation of ensembles of synaptically coupled CA3 pyramidal cells driven by sparse but powerful mossy fiber inputs from dentate gyrus granule cells. The neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline are separately proposed as saliency signals that dictate memory encoding but it is not known if they represent distinct signals with separate mechanisms. Here, we show experimentally that acetylcholine, and to a lesser extent noradrenaline, suppress feed-forward inhibition and enhance excitatory–inhibitory ratio in the mossy fiber pathway but CA3 recurrent network properties are only altered by acetylcholine. We explore the implications of these findings on CA3 ensemble formation using a hierarchy of models. In reconstructions of CA3 pyramidal cells, mossy fiber pathway disinhibition facilitates postsynaptic dendritic depolarization known to be required for synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses. We further show in a spiking neural network model of CA3 how acetylcholine-specific network alterations can drive rapid overlapping ensemble formation. Thus, through these distinct sets of mechanisms, acetylcholine and noradrenaline facilitate the formation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 that encode salient episodic memories in the hippocampus but acetylcholine selectively enhances the density of memory storage.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Memory shapes microbial populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chaitanya S. Gokhale, Stefano Giaimo, Philippe Remigi</p>

Correct decision making is fundamental for all living organisms to thrive under environmental changes. The patterns of environmental variation and the quality of available information define the most favourable strategy among multiple options, from randomly adopting a phenotypic state to sensing and reacting to environmental cues. Cellular memory—the ability to track and condition the time to switch to a different phenotypic state—can help withstand environmental fluctuations. How does memory manifest itself in unicellular organisms? We describe the population-wide consequences of phenotypic memory in microbes through a combination of deterministic modelling and stochastic simulations. Moving beyond binary switching models, our work highlights the need to consider a broader range of switching behaviours when describing microbial adaptive strategies. We show that memory in individual cells generates patterns at the population level coherent with overshoots and non-exponential lag times distributions experimentally observed in phenotypically heterogeneous populations. We emphasise the implications of our work in understanding antibiotic tolerance and, in general, bacterial survival under fluctuating environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Action planning and control under uncertainty emerge through a desirability-driven competition between parallel encoding motor plans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vince Enachescu, Paul Schrater, Stefan Schaal, Vassilios Christopoulos</p>

Living in an uncertain world, nearly all of our decisions are made with some degree of uncertainty about the consequences of actions selected. Although a significant progress has been made in understanding how the sensorimotor system incorporates uncertainty into the decision-making process, the preponderance of studies focus on tasks in which selection and action are two separate processes. First people select among alternative options and then initiate an action to implement the choice. However, we often make decisions during ongoing actions in which the value and availability of the alternatives can change with time and previous actions. The current study aims to decipher how the brain deals with uncertainty in decisions that evolve while acting. To address this question, we trained individuals to perform rapid reaching movements towards two potential targets, where the true target location was revealed only after the movement initiation. We found that reaction time and initial approach direction are correlated, where initial movements towards intermediate locations have longer reaction times than movements that aim directly to the target locations. Interestingly, the association between reaction time and approach direction was independent of the target probability. By modeling the task within a recently proposed neurodynamical framework, we showed that action planning and control under uncertainty emerge through a desirability-driven competition between motor plans that are encoded in parallel.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hypothesis on the pathophysiology of syringomyelia based on analysis of phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging of Chiari-I malformation patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite a number of hypotheses, our understanding of the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is still limited. The current prevailing hypothesis assumes that the piston-like movement of the cerebellar tonsils drives the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the syrinx through the spinal perivascular space. However, it still needs to be verified by further experimental data. A major unexplained problem is how CSF enters and remains in the syrinx that has a higher pressure than the subarachnoid space. Methods: I analyzed phase-contrast MRI scans of 18 patients with Chiari-I malformation with syringomyelia undergoing foramen magnum decompression and 21 healthy volunteers. I analyzed the velocity waveforms of the CSF and the brain in various locations. The obtained velocity waveforms were post-processed using a technique called synchronization in situ. I compared between the preoperative data and the control data (case-control study), as well as between the preoperative and postoperative data (cohort study). Results: The syrinx shrank in 17 (94%) patients with good clinical improvement. In Chiari-I patients, the velocity of the tonsil was significantly larger than controls, but was significantly smaller than that of the CSF in the subarachnoid space, suggesting passive rather than active movement. The abnormal tonsillar movement disappeared after surgery, but the velocity waveform of the spinal subarachnoid CSF did not change. These results, contradicting the above mentioned hypothesis, required an alternative explanation. I thus hypothesized that there is a CSF channel between the fourth ventricle and the syrinx. This channel assumes one-way valve function when mildly compressed by the cyclical movement of the cerebellar tonsil. The decompression of the tonsils switches off the one-way valve, collapsing the syrinx. Conclusions: My hypothesis reasonably explained my data that clearly contradicted the existing hypothesis, and successfully addressed the above-mentioned theoretical problem. It will serve as a working hypothesis for further study of syringomyelia pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Long‐term cognitive outcome in anti‐NMDA receptor encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom of NMDAR encephalitis, but detailed studies on prevalence, characteristics of cognitive deficits, and the potential for recovery are missing. Here, we performed a prospective longitudinal study to assess cognitive long-term outcome and identify clinical predictors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed in 43 patients with NMDAR encephalitis 2.3 years and 4.9 years (median) after disease onset. Cognitive assessments covered executive functions, working memory, verbal/visual episodic memory, attention, as well as subjective complaints, depression and anxiety levels. Cognitive performance of patients was compared to that of 30 healthy participants matched for age, sex, and education.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients had persistent cognitive deficits 2.3 years after onset, with moderate or severe impairment in more than 80% of patients. Core deficits included memory and executive function. After 4.9 years, significant improvement of cognitive function was observed, but moderate to severe deficits persisted in 2/3 of patients, despite favorable functional neurological outcomes (median mRS=1). Delayed treatment, higher disease severity, and longer duration of the acute phase were predictors for impaired cognitive outcome. The recovery process was time-dependent with greater gains earlier after the acute phase, while improvements were possible for several years after disease onset.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cognitive deficits are the main contributor to long-term morbidity in NMDAR encephalitis and persist beyond functional neurological recovery. Nonetheless, cognitive improvement is possible for several years after the acute phase and should be supported by continued cognitive rehabilitation. Cognition should be included as outcome measure in future clinical studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">LTA4H Prevalence and Mortality in Adult Zambians with Tuberculous Meningitis</a></h4>

              
                <p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to determine the prevalence of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (<i>LTA4H</i>) polymorphisms in Zambian adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and its association with mortality. We completed genotype testing on 101 definite cases of TBM and 119 consecutive non-TBM controls. The distribution of genotypes among TBM patients was as follows: C/C (0.83), C/T (0.14), T/T (0.03). There was no significant difference in genotype distribution between TBM and non-TBM patients. We found no relationship between <i>LTA4H</i> polymorphism and survival. Prospective studies are needed to determine the benefit of adjuvant steroids in TBM based upon population LTA4H genotype.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">microRNA-mediated regulation of microRNA machinery controls cell fate decisions</a></h4>

              
                microRNAs associate with Argonaute proteins, forming the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), to repress target gene expression post-transcriptionally. Although microRNAs are critical regulators in mammalian cell differentiation, our understanding of how microRNA machinery, such as the miRISC, are regulated during development is still limited. We previously showed that repressing the production of one Argonaute protein, Ago2, by Trim71 is important for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) self-renewal (Liu et al., 2021). Here we show that among the four Argonaute proteins in mammals, Ago2 is the major developmentally regulated Argonaute protein in mESCs. Moreover, in pluripotency, besides the Trim71-mediated regulation of <i>Ago2</i> (Liu<i> et al.</i>, 2021), <i>Mir182/Mir183</i> also repress <i>Ago2</i>. Specific inhibition of this microRNA-mediated repression results in stemness defects and accelerated differentiation through the let-7 microRNA pathway. These results reveal a microRNA-mediated regulatory circuit on microRNA machinery that is critical to maintaining pluripotency.

                Hypoxic adaptation mediated by HIF transcription factors requires mitochondria, which have been implicated in regulating HIF1α stability in hypoxia by distinct models that involve consuming oxygen or alternatively converting oxygen into the second messenger peroxide. Here, we use a ratiometric, peroxide reporter, HyPer to evaluate the role of peroxide in regulating HIF1α stability. We show that antioxidant enzymes are neither homeostatically induced nor are peroxide levels increased in hypoxia. Additionally, forced expression of diverse antioxidant enzymes, all of which diminish peroxide, had disparate effects on HIF1α protein stability. Moreover, decrease in lipid peroxides by glutathione peroxidase-4 or superoxide by mitochondrial SOD, failed to influence HIF1α protein stability. These data show that mitochondrial, cytosolic or lipid ROS were not necessary for HIF1α stability, and favor a model where mitochondria contribute to hypoxic adaptation as oxygen consumers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proof of concept for multiple nerve transfers to a single target muscle</a></h4>

              
                Surgical nerve transfers are used to efficiently treat peripheral nerve injuries, neuromas, phantom limb pain or improve bionic prosthetic control. Commonly, one donor nerve is transferred to one target muscle. However, the transfer of multiple nerves onto a single target muscle may increase the number of muscle signals for myoelectric prosthetic control and facilitate the treatment of multiple neuromas. Currently, no experimental models are available for multiple nerve transfers to a common target muscle in the upper extremity. This study describes a novel experimental model to investigate the neurophysiological effects of peripheral double nerve transfers. For this purpose, we developed a forelimb model to enable tension-free transfer of one or two donor nerves in the upper extremity. Anatomic dissections were performed to design the double nerve transfer model (n=8). In 62 male Sprague-Dawley rats the ulnar nerve of the antebrachium alone (n=30) or together with the anterior interosseus nerve (n=32) was transferred to reinnervate the long head of the biceps brachii. Before neurotization, the motor branch to the biceps’ long head was transected at the motor entry point and resected up to its original branch to prevent auto-reinnervation. In all animals, coaptation of both nerves to the motor entry point could be performed tension-free. Mean duration of the procedure was 49 ± 13 min for the single nerve transfer and 78 ± 20 min for the double nerve transfer. Twelve weeks after surgery, muscle response to neurotomy, behavioral testing, retrograde labeling and structural analyses were performed to assess reinnervation. These analyses indicated that all nerves successfully reinnervated the target muscle. No aberrant reinnervation was observed by the originally innervating nerve. Our observations suggest a minimal burden for the animal with no signs of functional deficit in daily activities or auto-mutilation in both procedures. Furthermore, standard neurophysiological analyses for nerve and muscle regeneration were applicable. This newly developed nerve transfer model allows for the reliable and standardized investigation of neural and functional changes following the transfer of multiple donor nerves to one target muscle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bazooka/Par3 cooperates with Sanpodo for the assembly of Notch clusters following asymmetric division of Drosophila sensory organ precursor cells</a></h4>

              
                In multiple cell lineages, Delta-Notch signalling regulates cell fate decisions owing to unidirectional signalling between daughter cells. In <i>Drosophila</i> pupal sensory organ lineage, Notch regulates the intra-lineage pIIa/pIIb fate decision at cytokinesis. Notch and Delta that localise apically and basally at the pIIa-pIIb interface are expressed at low levels and their residence time at the plasma membrane is in the order of minutes. How Delta can effectively interact with Notch to trigger signalling from a large plasma membrane area remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the signalling interface possesses a unique apicobasal polarity with Par3/Bazooka localising in the form of nano-clusters at the apical and basal level. Notch is preferentially targeted to the pIIa-pIIb interface, where it co-clusters with Bazooka and its cofactor Sanpodo. Clusters whose assembly relies on Bazooka and Sanpodo activities are also positive for Neuralized, the E3 ligase required for Delta-activity. We propose that the nano-clusters act as snap buttons at the new pIIa-pIIb interface to allow efficient intra-lineage signalling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamics and variability in the pleiotropic effects of adaptation in laboratory budding yeast populations</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary adaptation to a constant environment is driven by the accumulation of mutations which can have a range of unrealized pleiotropic effects in other environments. These pleiotropic consequences of adaptation can influence the emergence of specialists or generalists, and are critical for evolution in temporally or spatially fluctuating environments. While many experiments have examined the pleiotropic effects of adaptation at a snapshot in time, very few have observed the dynamics by which these effects emerge and evolve. Here, we propagated hundreds of diploid and haploid laboratory budding yeast populations in each of three environments, and then assayed their fitness in multiple environments over 1000 generations of evolution. We find that replicate populations evolved in the same condition share common patterns of pleiotropic effects across other environments, which emerge within the first several hundred generations of evolution. However, we also find dynamic and environment-specific variability within these trends: variability in pleiotropic effects tends to increase over time, with the extent of variability depending on the evolution environment. These results suggest shifting and overlapping contributions of chance and contingency to the pleiotropic effects of adaptation, which could influence evolutionary trajectories in complex environments that fluctuate across space and time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Small, correlated changes in synaptic connectivity may facilitate rapid motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Animals can rapidly adapt their movements to external perturbations. This adaptation is paralleled by changes in single neuron activity in the motor cortices. Behavioural and neural recording studies suggest that when animals learn to counteract a visuomotor perturbation, these changes originate from altered inputs to the motor cortices rather than from changes in local connectivity, as neural covariance is largely preserved during adaptation. Since measuring synaptic changes in vivo remains very challenging, we used a modular recurrent network model to compare the expected neural activity changes following learning through altered inputs (Hinput) and learning through local connectivity changes (Hlocal). Learning under Hinput produced small changes in neural activity and largely preserved the neural covariance, in good agreement with neural recordings in monkeys. Surprisingly given the presumed dependence of stable neural covariance on preserved circuit connectivity, Hlocal led to only slightly larger changes in neural activity and covariance compared to Hinput. This similarity is due to Hlocal only requiring small, correlated connectivity changes to counteract the perturbation, which provided the network with significant robustness against simulated synaptic noise. Simulations of tasks that impose increasingly larger behavioural changes revealed a growing difference between Hinput and Hlocal, which could be exploited when designing future experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Approach to Measuring Protein Turnover in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Organoids by Mass Spectrometry</a></h4>

              
                Patient-derived organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a model for studying human diseases beyond conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. Briefly, these three-dimensional organoids are highly complex, capable of self-organizing, recapitulate cellular architecture, and have the potential to model diseases in complex organs, such as the brain. For example, the hallmark of Parkinson's disease - proteostatic dysfunction leading to the selective death of neurons in the substantia nigra - present a subtle distinction in cell type specificity that is simply lost in 2D cell culture models. As such, the development of robust methods to study global proteostasis and protein turnover in organoids will remain a critical need as organoid models evolve. To solve this problem, we have designed a workflow to extract proteins from organoids and measure global protein turnover using mass spectrometry and stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). This allowed us to measure the turnover rates of 844 proteins and compare protein turnover to previously reported data in primary cell cultures and in vivo models. Taken together, this method will facilitate the study of proteostasis in organoid models of human disease and will provide an analytical and statistical framework to measure protein turnover in organoids of all cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical sensorimotor activity in the execution and suppression of discrete and rhythmic movements</a></h4>

              
                Although the engagement of sensorimotor cortices in movement is well documented, the func-tional relevance of brain activity patterns remains ambiguous. Especially, the cortical engage-ment specific to the pre-, within-, and post-movement periods is poorly understood. The pre-sent study addressed this issue by examining sensorimotor EEG activity during the perfor-mance as well as STOP-signal cued suppression of movements pertaining to two distinct clas-ses, namely, discrete vs. ongoing rhythmic movements. Our findings indicate that the lateral-ized readiness potential (LRP), which is classically used as a marker of pre-movement pro-cessing, indexes multiple pre- and in- movement-related brain dynamics in a movement-class dependent fashion. In- and post-movement event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) ob-served in the Mu (8-13 Hz) and Beta (15-30 Hz) frequency ranges were associated with esti-mated brain sources in both motor and somatosensory cortical areas. Notwithstanding, Beta ERS occurred earlier following cancelled than actually performed movements. In contrast, Mu power did not vary. Whereas Beta power may reflect the evaluation of the sensory predicted outcome, Mu power might engage in linking perception to action. Additionally, the rhythmic movement forced stop (only) showed a post-movement Mu/Beta rebound, which might re-flect an active "clearing-out" of the motor plan and its feedback-based online control. Overall, the present study supports the notion that sensorimotor EEG modulations are key markers to investigate control or executive processes, here initiation and inhibition, which are exerted when performing distinct movement classes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular structure and conformation of stereocilia tip-links elucidated by cryo-electron tomography</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensory transduction (MT), the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, underpins hearing and balance and is carried out within hair cells in the inner ear. Hair cells harbor actin-filled stereocilia, arranged in rows of descending heights, where the tips of stereocilia are connected to their taller neighbors by a filament composed of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), deemed the "tip-link". Tension exerted on the tip-link opens an ion channel at the tip of the shorter stereocilia, thus converting mechanical force into an electrical signal. While biochemical and structural studies have provided insights into the molecular composition and structure of isolated portions of the tip-link, the architecture, location and conformational states of intact tip-links, on stereocilia, remains unknown. Here we report in situ cryo-electron microscopy imaging of the tip-link in mouse stereocilia. We observe individual PCDH15 molecules at the tip and shaft of stereocilia and determine their stoichiometry, conformational heterogeneity, and their complexes with CDH23. The PCDH15/CDH23 complexes occur in clusters, frequently with more than one copy of PCDH15 at the tip of stereocilia, suggesting that tip-links might consist of more than one copy of the PCDH15/CDH23 heterotetramer and by extension, might include multiple MT complexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Biophysical Counting Mechanism for Keeping Time</a></h4>

              
                The ability to estimate and produce appropriately timed responses is central to many behaviors including speaking, dancing, and playing a musical instrument. A classical framework for estimating or producing a time interval is the pacemaker-accumulator model in which pulses of a pacemaker are counted and compared to a stored representation. However, the neural mechanisms for how these pulses are counted remains an open question. The presence of noise and stochasticity further complicate the picture. We present a biophysical model of how to keep count of a pacemaker in the presence of various forms of stochasticity using a system of bistable Wilson-Cowan units asymmetrically connected in a one-dimensional array; all units receive the same input pulses from a central clock but only one unit is active at any point in time. With each pulse from the clock, the position of the activated unit changes thereby encoding the total number of pulses emitted by the clock. This neural architecture maps the counting problem into the spatial domain, which in turn translates count to a time estimate. We further extend the model to a hierarchical structure to be able to robustly achieve higher counts.

                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) controls psychomotor activity and is an efficient therapeutic deep brain stimulation target in Parkinson's disease patients. Despite evidence indicating position-dependent therapeutic effects and distinct functions within the STN, input circuit and cellular profile in the STN remain largely unclear. Using advanced neuroanatomical techniques, we constructed a comprehensive connectivity map of the indirect and hyperdirect pathways in both the mouse and human STN. Our detailed circuit- and cellular-level connectivity revealed a topographically graded organization with three convergent types of indirect and hyperdirect-pathways. Furthermore, we identified two functional types of glutamatergic STN neurons (parvalbumin, PV +/- neurons) segregated with a topographical distribution. Glutamatergic PV+ STN neurons contribute to burst firing. We confirmed synaptic connectivity from indirect and hyperdirect pathways to both PV+ and PV-. These data suggest a complex interplay of information integration within the basal ganglia underlying coordinated movement control and therapeutic effects.

                The nematode C. elegans uses rhythmic muscle contractions and relaxations called pumps to filter, transport, and crush food particles. A number of feeding mutants have been identified, including those with slow pharyngeal pumping rate, weak muscle contraction, defective muscle relaxation, and defective grinding of bacteria. Many aspects of these pharyngeal behavioral defects and how they affect pharyngeal function are not well understood. For example, the behavioral deficits underlying inefficient particle transport in 'slippery' mutants have been unclear. Here we use high speed video microscopy to describe pharyngeal pumping behaviors and particle transport in wild-type animals and in feeding mutants. Different 'slippery' mutants exhibit distinct defects including weak isthmus contraction, failure to trap particles in the anterior isthmus, and abnormal timing of contraction and relaxation in pharyngeal compartments. Our results show that multiple deficits in pharyngeal timing or contraction can cause defects in particle transport.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional characterisation of single nucleotide variants of the psychiatric risk gene cacna1c in the zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Several genome-wide association studies have associated CACNA1C variants with psychiatric disorders. The molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Taking advantage of the zebrafish larva as a model, we investigated how two different mutations in cacna1c; sa10930 (nonsense mutation) and sa15296 (splice site mutation), affect neuronal function. We characterized changes in cacna1c mRNA, neurotransmitter levels and behaviour, as well as whole-brain activity using single electrode local field potential recordings. Both point mutations resulted in a significant reduction in cacna1c mRNA, as well as social behaviour and prepulse inhibition deficits. Whereas sa15296 mutants displayed abnormal locomotor and open-field behaviour, we observed normal behaviour in the sa10930 mutants. Brain recordings from both mutants had lower spectral power while sa15296 displayed significant seizure-like activity. Finally, sa10930 homozygotes showed increased dopamine and serotonin levels, decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and unchanged glutamate levels while homozygous sa15296 larvae showed increased levels of serotonin and glutamate, and unaffected levels of GABA and dopamine. Our work provides new insights into the functional role of CACNA1C in behavioural, electrophysiological and biochemical traits linked to psychiatric disorders. We show a functional role for the non-coding mutation (sa15296) in the cacna1c in vivo animal model. Consistent with existing hypotheses, our data suggest that disruption of gene expression, neurotransmission, and cortical excitability are involved in CACNA1C related mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representation of motion concepts in occipitotemporal cortex: fMRI activation, decoding and connectivity analyses</a></h4>

              
                Embodied theories of semantic cognition predict that brain regions involved in motion perception are engaged when people comprehend motion concepts expressed in language. Left lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) is implicated in both motion perception and motion concept processing but prior studies have produced mixed findings regarding which parts of this region are engaged by motion language. We scanned participants performing semantic judgements about sentences describing motion events and static events. We performed univariate analyses, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses to investigate the effect of motion on activity and connectivity in different parts of LOTC. In multivariate analyses that decoded whether a sentence described motion or not, the whole of LOTC showed above-chance level performance, with performance exceeding that of other brain regions. Univariate ROI analyses found that the middle part of LOTC was more active for motion events than static ones. Finally, PPI analyses found that when processing motion events, the middle and posterior parts of LOTC, overlapping with motion perception regions, increased their connectivity with cognitive control regions. Taken together, these results indicate that the whole of the LOTC responds differently to motion vs. static event descriptions, and that these effects are most pronounced in more posterior sites. These findings are consistent with embodiment accounts of semantic processing, and suggest that understanding verbal descriptions of motion engages areas of the occipitotemporal cortex involved in perceiving motion.

                Thalamic nucleus reuniens (NRe) is located on the midline and acts as a hub to mediate interactions between hippocampal, entorhinal and prefrontal areas although these connections are poorly defined at the cellular and synaptic level. Using electrophysiology and monosynaptic circuit-tracing, we found that pyramidal cells in CA1 receive no direct input from NRe. This contrasts starkly with prefrontal cortex, subiculum and entorhinal cortex, and indicates that NRe inputs to CA1 primarily drive local inhibition and not excitation they do in the other regions.

                The neurovascular unit (NVU) consists of cells intrinsic to the vessel wall, the endothelial cells and pericytes, and astrocyte endfeet that surround the vessel but are separated from it by basement membrane. Endothelial cells are primarily responsible for creating and maintaining blood-brain-barrier (BBB) tightness, but astrocytes contribute to the barrier through paracrine signaling to the endothelial cells and by forming the glia limitans. Gap junctions (GJs) between astrocyte endfeet are composed of connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx30, which form plaques between cells. GJ plaques formed of Cx43 do not diffuse laterally in the plasma membrane and thus potentially provide stable organizational features to the endfoot domain, whereas GJ plaques formed of other connexins and of Cx43 lacking a large portion of its cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus are quite mobile. In order to examine the organizational features that immobile GJs impose on the endfoot, we have used super-resolution confocal microscopy to map number and sizes of GJ plaques and aquaporin (AQP)-4 channel clusters in the perivascular endfeet of mice in which astrocyte GJs (Cx30, Cx43) were deleted or the carboxyl terminus of Cx43 was truncated. To determine if blood-brain-barrier integrity was compromised in these transgenic mice, we conducted perfusion studies under elevated hydrostatic pressure using horseradish peroxide as a molecular probe enabling detection of micro-hemorrhages in brain sections. These studies revealed that microhemorrhages were more numerous in mice lacking Cx43 or its carboxyl terminus. In perivascular domains of cerebral vessels, we found that density of Cx43 GJs was higher in the truncation mutant, while GJ size was smaller. Density of perivascular particles formed by AQP4 and its extended isoform AQP4ex was inversely related to the presence of full length Cx43, whereas the ratio of sizes of the particles of the AQP4ex isoform to total AQP4 was directly related to the presence of full length Cx43. Confocal analysis showed that Cx43 and Cx30 were substantially colocalized in astrocyte domains near vasculature of truncation mutant mice. These results showing altered distribution of some astrocyte nexus components (AQP4 and Cx30) in Cx43 null mice and in a truncation mutant, together with leakier cerebral vasculature, support the hypothesis that localization and mobility of gap junction proteins and their binding partners influences organization of astrocyte endfeet which in turn impacts BBB integrity of the NVU.

                Background: Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may induce frequency-specific aftereffects on brain oscillations in the stimulated location, which could serve as evidence for region-specific neuroplasticity. Aftereffects of tACS on the motor system remain unknown. Objective: To find evidence for aftereffects in short EEG segments following tACS to two critical nodes of the motor network, namely, left motor cortex (lMC) and right cerebellum (rCB). We hypothesized that aftereffects of lMC will be stronger in and around lMC compared to both active stimulation of rCB, as well as inactive (sham) control conditions. Methods: To this end, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and trained a classifier to distinguish between EEG signals following each of the three stimulation protocols. This method accounts for the multitude facets of the EEG signal and thus is more sensitive to subtle modulation of the EEG signal. Results: EEG signals in both theta ({theta}, 4-8Hz) and alpha (, 8-13Hz) were better classified to lMC-tACS compared to rCB-tACS/sham, in and around lMC-tACS stimulation locations (electrodes FC3 and CP3). This effect was associated with a decrease in power following tACS. Source reconstruction revealed significant differences in premotor cortex but not in primary motor cortex as the computational model suggested. Correlation between classification accuracies in {theta} and  in lMC-tACS was stronger compared to rCB-tACS/sham, suggesting cross-frequency effects of tACS. Nonetheless, {theta}/ phase-coupling did not differ between stimulation protocols. Conclusions: Successful classification of EEG signals to left motor cortex using MVPA revealed focal tACS aftereffects on the motor cortex, indicative of region-specific neuroplasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A morphometric double dissociation: cortical thickness is more related to aging; surface area is more related to cognition</a></h4>

              
                The thickness and surface area of cortex are genetically distinct aspects of brain structure, and may be affected differently by age. However, their potential to differentially predict age and cognitive abilities has been largely overlooked, likely because they are typically aggregated into the commonly used measure of volume. In a large sample of healthy adults (N=647, aged 18-88), we investigated the brain-age and brain-cognition relationships of thickness, surface area, and volume, plus five additional morphological shape metrics. Cortical thickness was the metric most strongly associated with age cross-sectionally, as well as exhibiting the steepest longitudinal change over time (subsample N=261, aged 25-84). In contrast, surface area was the best single predictor of age-residualized cognitive abilities (fluid intelligence), and changes in surface area were most strongly associated with cognitive change over time. These findings were replicated in an independent dataset (N=1345, aged 18-93). Our results suggest that cortical thickness and surface area make complementary contributions the age-brain-cognition triangle, and highlight the importance of considering these volumetric components separately.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metacognition and the effect of incentive motivation in two compulsive disorders: gambling disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder</a></h4>

              
                Compulsivity is a common phenotype amongst various psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and gambling disorder (GD). Deficiencies in metacognition, such as the inability to properly estimates ones' own performance via well-calibrated confidence judgments could contribute to pathological decision-making in these psychiatric disorders. Earlier research has indeed suggested that OCD and GD patients reside at opposite ends of the confidence spectrum, with OCD patients exhibiting underconfidence, and GD patients exhibiting overconfidence. Recently, several studies established that motivational states (e.g. monetary incentives) influence metacognition, with gain (respectively loss) prospects increasing (respectively decreasing) confidence judgments. Here, we reasoned that the OCD and GD symptomatology might correspond to an exacerbation of this interaction between metacognition and motivational states. We hypothesized GD's overconfidence to be exaggerated during gain prospects, while OCD's underconfidence to be worsened in loss context, which we expected to see represented in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity. We tested those hypotheses in a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. Our initial analyses showed increased confidence levels for GD versus OCD patients, that could partly be explained by sex and IQ. Although our primary analyses did not support the hypothesized interaction between incentive motivation and groups, exploratory analyses did show increased confidence in GD patients specifically in gain context. fMRI analyses confirmed a central role for VMPFC in the processing of confidence and incentive motivation, but with no differences between the clinical samples.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A spike-sorting method based on hierarchical clustering to discriminate extracellularly recorded simple spikes and complex spikes from cerebellar Purkinje cells</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cells are the only output neurons and exhibit two types of discharge. Most Purkinje cell discharges are simple spikes, which are commonly appearing action potentials exhibiting a rich variety of firing patterns with a rate of up to 400 Hz. More infrequent discharges are complex spikes, which consist of a short burst of impulses accompanied by a massive increase in dendritic Ca2+ with a firing rate of around 1 Hz. The discrimination of these spikes in extracellular single-unit recordings is not always straightforward, as their waveforms vary depending on recording conditions and intrinsic fluctuations. New Method: To discriminate complex spikes from simple spikes in the extracellular single-unit data, we developed a semiautomatic spike-sorting method based on divisive hierarchical clustering. Results: Quantitative evaluation using parallel in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of Purkinje cell dendrites indicated that 96.6% of the complex spikes were detected using our spike-sorting method from extracellular single-unit recordings obtained from anesthetized mice. Comparison with Existing Method(s): No reports have conducted a quantitative evaluation of spike-sorting algorithms used for the classification of extracellular spikes recorded from cerebellar Purkinje cells. Conclusions: Our method could be expected to contribute to research in information processing in the cerebellar cortex and the development of a fully automatic spike-sorting algorithm by providing ground-truth data useful for deep learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic extracellular vesicles modulate neuronal calcium homeostasis via transglutaminase-2</a></h4>

              
                We have uncovered a novel role for astrocytes-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in controlling intraneuronal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and identified transglutaminase-2 (TG2) as a surface-cargo of astrocytes-derived EVs. Incubation of hippocampal neurons with primed astrocyte-derived EVs have led to an increase in [Ca2+]i, unlike EVs from TG2-knockout astrocytes. Exposure of neurons or brain slices to extracellular TG2 promoted a [Ca2+]i rise, which was reversible upon TG2 removal and was dependent on Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. Patch-clamp and calcium imaging recordings revealed TG2-dependent neuronal membrane depolarisation and activation of inward currents, due to the opening of L-type-VOCCs and to Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (NCX) operation in the reverse mode, as indicated by VOCCs/NCX pharmacological inhibitors. A subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase was selected by comparative proteomics and identified as being functionally inhibited by extracellular TG2, implicating Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition in NCX reverse mode-switching leading to Ca2+ influx and higher basal [Ca2+]i. These data suggest that reactive astrocytes control intraneuronal [Ca2+]i through release of EVs with TG2 as responsible cargo, which could have a significant impact on synaptic activity in brain inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrated Regulation of PKA by Fast and Slow Neurotransmission in the Nucleus Accumbens Controls Plasticity and Stress Responses</a></h4>

              
                Cortical glutamate and midbrain dopamine neurotransmission converge to mediate striatum-dependent behaviors, while maladaptations in striatal circuitry contribute to mental disorders. Here we uncover a molecular mechanism by which glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling integrate to regulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) via phosphorylation of the PKA regulatory subunit, RII{beta}. We find that glutamate-dependent reduction in Cdk5-dependent RII{beta} phosphorylation alters the PKA holoenzyme auto-inhibitory state to increase PKA signaling in response to dopamine. Disruption of RII{beta} phosphorylation by Cdk5, consequently, enhances cortico-ventral striatal synaptic plasticity. Acute and chronic stress in rats inversely modulates RII{beta} phosphorylation and ventral striatal infusion of a small interfering peptide that selectively targets RII{beta} regulation by Cdk5 improves behavioral response to stress. This new signaling mechanism integrating ventral striatal glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission is likely important to brain function, may contribute to neuropsychiatric conditions, and serves as a possible target for the development of novel therapeutics for stress-related disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A whole-brain monosynaptic input connectome to neuron classes in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Identification of the structural connections between neurons is a prerequisite to understanding brain function. We developed a pipeline to systematically map brain-wide monosynaptic inputs to specific neuronal populations using Cre-driver mouse lines and the recombinant rabies tracing system. We first improved the rabies virus tracing strategy to accurately identify starter cells and to efficiently quantify presynaptic inputs. We then mapped brain-wide presynaptic inputs to different excitatory and inhibitory neuron subclasses in the primary visual cortex and seven higher visual areas. Our results reveal quantitative target-, layer- and cell-class-specific differences in the retrograde connectomes, despite similar global input patterns to different neuronal populations in the same anatomical area. The retrograde connectivity we define is consistent with the presence of the ventral and dorsal visual information processing streams and reveals further subnetworks within the dorsal stream. The hierarchical organization of the entire visual cortex can be derived from intracortical feedforward and feedback pathways mediated by upper- and lower-layer input neurons, respectively. This study expands our knowledge of the brain-wide inputs regulating visual areas and demonstrates that our improved rabies virus tracing strategy can be used to scale up the effort in dissecting connectivity of genetically defined cell populations in the whole mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distance estimation from monocular cues in an ethological visuomotor task</a></h4>

              
                In natural contexts, sensory processing and motor output are closely coupled, which is reflected in the fact that many brain areas contain both sensory and movement signals. However, standard reductionist paradigms decouple sensory decisions from their natural motor consequences, and head-fixation prevents the natural sensory consequences of self-motion. In particular, movement through the environment provides a number of depth cues beyond stereo vision that are poorly understood. To study the integration of visual processing and motor output in a naturalistic task, we investigated distance estimation in freely moving mice. We found that mice use vision to accurately jump across a variable gap, thus directly coupling a visual computation to its corresponding ethological motor output. Monocular eyelid suture did not affect performance, thus mice can use cues that do not depend on binocular disparity and stereo vision. Under monocular conditions, mice performed more vertical head movements, consistent with the use of motion parallax cues, and optogenetic suppression of primary visual cortex impaired task performance. Together, these results show that mice can use monocular cues, relying on visual cortex, to accurately judge distance. Furthermore, this behavioral paradigm provides a foundation for studying how neural circuits convert sensory information into ethological motor output.

                Cerebral microinfarct increases the risk of dementia. But how microscopic cerebrovascular disruption affects the brain tissue in cellular-level are mostly unknown. Herein, with a longitudinal intravital imaging, we serially visualized in vivo dynamic cellular-level changes in astrocyte, pericyte and neuron as well as microvascular integrity after the induction of cerebral microinfarction for 1 month in mice. At day 2-3, it revealed a localized edema with acute astrocyte loss, neuronal death, impaired pericyte-vessel coverage and extravascular leakage indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. At day 5, edema disappeared with recovery of pericyte-vessel coverage and BBB integrity. But brain tissue continued to shrink with persisted loss of astrocyte and neuron in microinfarct until 30 days, resulting in a collagen-rich fibrous scar surrounding the microinfarct. Notably, reactive astrocytes appeared at the peri-infarct area early at day 2 and thereafter accumulated in the peri-infarct. Oral administration of a reversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor significantly decreased the astrocyte reactivity and fibrous scar formation. Our result suggests that astrocyte reactivity may be a key target to alleviate the impact of microinfarction.

                As we interact with our surroundings, we encounter the same or similar objects from different perspectives and are compelled to generalize. For example, we recognize dog barks as a distinct class of sound, despite the variety of individual barks. While we have some understanding of how generalization is done along a single stimulus dimension, such as frequency or color, natural stimuli are identifiable by a combination of dimensions. To understand perception, measuring the interaction across stimulus dimensions is essential. For example, when identifying a sound, does our brain focus on a specific dimension or a combination, such as its frequency and duration? Furthermore, does the relative relevance of each dimension reflect its contribution to the natural sensory environment? Using a 2-dimension discrimination task for mice we tested untrained generalization across several pairs of auditory dimensions. We uncovered a perceptual hierarchy over the tested dimensions that was dominated by the sound's spectral composition. A model tuned to the predictability inherent in natural sounds best explained the behavioral results, suggesting that the perceptual hierarchy parallels the predictive content of natural sounds.

                Sleep is essential but poses a risk to the animal. Filtering acoustic information according to its relevance, a process generally known as sensory gating, is crucial during sleep to ensure a balance between rest and danger detection. The mechanisms of this sensory gating and its specificity are not understood. Here, we tested the effect that sounds of different meaning had on sleep-associated ongoing oscillations. We recorded EEG and EMG from mice during rapid-eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep while presenting sounds with or without behavioural relevance. We found that sound presentation per se, in the form of an unfamiliar neutral sound, elicited a weak or no change in the sleep-dependent EEG power during NREM and REM sleep. In contrast, the presentation of a sound previously conditioned in an aversive task, elicited a clear and fast decrease in the sleep-dependent EEG power during both sleep phases, suggesting a transition to lighter sleep without awakening. The observed changes generally weakened over training days and were not present in animals that failed to learn. Interestingly, the effect could be generalized to unfamiliar neutral sounds if presented following conditioned training, an effect that depended on sleep phase and sound type. The data demonstrate that sounds are differentially gated during sleep depending on their meaning and that this process is reflected in disruption of sleep-associated brain oscillations without an effect on behavioural arousal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The proSAAS chaperone provides neuroprotection and attenuates transsynaptic α-synuclein spread in rodent models of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease is a devastating motor disorder involving the aberrant aggregation of the synaptic protein synuclein (aSyn) and degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic tract. We previously showed that proSAAS, a small secreted chaperone protein widely expressed in neurons within the brain, is able to block aSyn-induced dopaminergic cytotoxicity in primary nigral neuron cultures. We show here that coinjection of proSAAS-encoding lentivirus profoundly reduced the motor asymmetry caused by unilateral nigral AAV-mediated human aSyn overexpression. This positive functional outcome was accompanied by significant amelioration of the human aSyn-induced loss of both nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase-positive terminals, demonstrating clear proSAAS-mediated protection of the nigro-striatal tract. ProSAAS overexpression also reduced the content of human aSyn protein in both the nigra and striatum and reduced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase protein in both regions. Since proSAAS is a secreted protein, we tested the possibility that proSAAS is able to block the transsynaptic spread of aSyn from the periphery to the central nervous system, increasingly recognized as a potentially significant pathological mechanism. The number of human aSyn-positive neurites in the pons and caudal midbrain of mice following administration of human aSyn-encoding AAV into the vagus nerve was considerably reduced in mice coinjected with proSAAS-encoding AAV, supporting proSAAS-mediated blockade of transsynaptic aSyn transmission. We suggest that proSAAS may represent a promising target for therapeutic development in Parkinson's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards real-world neuroscience using mobile EEG and augmented reality</a></h4>

              
                Our visual environment impacts multiple aspects of cognition including perception, attention and memory, yet most studies traditionally remove or control the external environment. As a result, we have a limited understanding of neurocognitive processes beyond the controlled lab environment. Here, we aim to study neural processes in real-world environments, while also maintaining a degree of control over perception. To achieve this, we combined mobile EEG (mEEG) and augmented reality (AR), which allows us to place virtual objects into the real world. We validated this AR and mEEG approach using a well-characterised cognitive response - the face inversion effect. Participants viewed upright and inverted faces in three EEG tasks (1) a lab-based computer task, (2) walking through an indoor environment while seeing face photographs, and (3) walking through an indoor environment while seeing virtual faces. We find greater low frequency EEG activity for inverted compared to upright faces in all experimental tasks, demonstrating that cognitively relevant signals can be extracted from mEEG and AR paradigms. This was established in both an epoch-based analysis aligned to face events, and a GLM-based approach that incorporates continuous EEG signals and face perception states. Together, this research helps pave the way to exploring neurocognitive processes in real-world environments while maintaining experimental control using AR.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Odor motion sensing enables complex plume navigation</a></h4>

              
                Insects can detect bilateral differences in odor concentration between their two antennae, enabling them to sense odor gradients. While gradients aid navigation in simple odor environments like static ribbons, their role in navigating complex plumes remains unknown. Here, we use a virtual reality paradigm to show that Drosophila use bilateral sensing for a distinct computation: detecting the motion of odor signals. Such odor direction sensing is computationally equivalent to motion detection algorithms underlying motion detection in vision. Simulations of natural plumes reveal that odor motion contains valuable directional information absent from the airflow, which Drosophila indeed exploit when navigating natural plumes. Olfactory studies dating back a century have stressed the critical role of wind sensing for insect navigation; we reveal an entirely orthogonal direction cue used by flies in natural environments, and give theoretical arguments suggesting that this cue may be of broad use across the animal kingdom.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The organization of individually mapped structural and functional semantic networks in aging adults</a></h4>

              
                Language function in the brain, once thought to be highly localized, is now appreciated as relying on a connected but distributed network. The semantic system is of particular interest in the language domain because of its hypothesized integration of information across multiple cortical regions. Previous work in healthy individuals has focused on group-level functional connectivity (FC) analyses of the semantic system, which may obscure interindividual differences driving variance in performance. These studies also overlook the contributions of white matter networks to semantic function. Here, we identified semantic network nodes with a semantic decision fMRI task in 53 typically-aging adults, characterized network organization using structural connectivity (SC), and quantified the segregation and integration of the network using FC. Hub regions were identified in left inferior frontal gyrus. The individualized semantic network was composed of three interacting modules: 1) default-mode module characterized by bilateral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate regions and also including right-hemisphere homotopes of language regions; 2) left frontal module extending dorsally from inferior frontal gyrus to pre-motor area; and 3) left temporoparietal module extending from temporal pole to inferior parietal lobule. FC within Module3 and integration of the entire network related to a semantic verbal fluency task, but not a matched phonological task. These results support and extend the tri-network semantic model (Xu et al., 2017) and the controlled semantic cognition model (Chiou et al., 2018) of semantic function.

	<p>Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) are the most common mental health disorders in the school-aged child population. Although harsh parenting is a key risk factor in the shaping of DBD, studies neglect the presence of siblings and differential parenting. This study aims to compare: (1) parenting style and sibling relationship in sibling dyads of clinical families, composed of a DBD child and a non-clinical sibling, with control families composed of two non-clinical siblings; (2) parenting style, sibling relationship, and emotional and behavioral problems in DBD child, non-clinical sibling, and non-clinical child of control group. Sixty-one families (composed of mother and sibling dyads), divided into clinical (n = 27) and control (n = 34) groups, completed the APQ, SRI, and CBCL questionnaires. Results indicated differential parenting in clinical families, compared to control group families, with higher negative parenting toward the DBD child than the sibling; no difference emerged in sibling relationship within sibling dyads (clinical vs. control). Finally, externalizing and internalizing problems were higher in DBD children and their siblings, compared to control, indicating DBD sibling psychopathology vulnerability. Findings suggest inclusion of siblings in the clinical assessment and rehabilitative intervention of DBD children, given that the promotion of positive parenting could improve mental health in the offspring.</p>

	<p>Carotid revascularization may lead to improved cognitive function beyond stroke prevention. This article summarizes the conclusions from available studies on the effects of carotid reperfusion procedures on cognitive function. The papers cited used different neuropsychological tests for cognitive assessment, resulting in different methodologies and the results obtained were not always convergent. However, most studies reported an improvement in neurocognitive abilities after both vascular interventions, but a more precise assessment of the specific benefits is still awaited. Clinical determinants to predict the effects of these treatments on cognitive function are still being sought, but results are not yet satisfactory. In view of these studies, carotid stenosis seems to be an independent risk factor for cognitive deterioration, and the main mechanisms responsible are embolism and cerebral hypoperfusion. The aim of this study is to order the knowledge about the effects of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and endarterectomy (CEA) on neurocognitive functions and to verify the usefulness of using these treatments.</p>

	<p>Sleep disturbances are well-recognised symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This review updates knowledge regarding the relationship between sleep during deployment, combat-related trauma, and PTSD in military personnel, from which the importance of restorative sleep results. The description of the characteristics of sleep in military forces with the considerable roles of the operational and training contexts highlights the important consequences of degraded sleep. Indeed, a lot of data suggest a dynamic link between sleep and the onset and chronicity of PTSD. We propose a reciprocal relationship model with strategies strongly recommended or already adopted by the military to promote restorative sleep before and after combat exposure. Among the alterations in a variety of sleep architecture and sleep patterns described in PTSD, the physiological hypothesis of REM sleep fragmentation in the development of PTSD symptoms may be important because REM sleep is generally associated with emotional memory. Finally, we address clinical and research perspectives that could be used to detect or restore sleep continuity before and during military deployment to possibly alleviate nightmares and insomnia related to combat exposure and PTSD occurrence and improve our understanding of sleep in PTSD.</p>

	<p> Every day, multilinguals around the world make important healthcare decisions while using a foreign language. The present study examined how the use of a native vs. non-native language shapes evaluations and decisions about preventative care. Bilinguals were randomly assigned to evaluate a series of medical scenarios in either their native or non-native language. Each scenario described potential adverse effects of a medical condition and a preventative treatment, as well as the population risk of disease- or treatment-related complications. Participants judged the perceived negativity and likelihood of experiencing adverse effects and indicated how willing they would be to accept the preventative treatment. We found that bilinguals using a foreign language perceived disease symptoms and treatment side effects to be less negative than those using their native tongue. Foreign language users were also more likely to account for the objective risks associated with medical conditions and treatments when making decisions about preventative care. We conclude that the use of a native vs. foreign language changes how people evaluate the consequences of accepting and declining preventative treatment, with potential implications for millions of providers and patients who routinely make medical choices in their non-native tongue.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Pupil dynamics alterations have been found in patients affected by a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism. Studies in mouse models have used pupillometry for phenotypic assessment and as a proxy for arousal. Both in mice and humans, pupillometry is noninvasive and allows for longitudinal experiments supporting temporal specificity; however, its measure requires dedicated setups. Here, we introduce a convolutional neural network that performs online pupillometry in both mice and humans in a web app format. This solution dramatically simplifies the usage of the tool for the nonspecialist and nontechnical operators. Because a modern web browser is the only software requirement, this choice is of great interest given its easy deployment and setup time reduction. The tested model performances indicate that the tool is sensitive enough to detect both locomotor-induced and stimulus-evoked pupillary changes, and its output is comparable to state-of-the-art commercial devices.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spontaneous recognition memory tasks are widely used to assess cognitive function in rodents and have become commonplace in the characterization of rodent models of neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Leveraging an animal&rsquo;s innate preference for novelty, these tasks use object exploration to capture the what, where and when components of recognition memory. Choosing and optimizing objects is a key feature when designing recognition memory tasks. Although the range of objects used in these tasks varies extensively across studies, object features can bias exploration, influence task difficulty and alter brain circuit recruitment. Here, we discuss the advantages of using 3D-printed objects in rodent spontaneous recognition memory tasks. We provide strategies for optimizing their design and usage, and offer a repository of tested, open-source designs for use with commonly used rodent species. The easy accessibility, low-cost, renewability and flexibility of 3D-printed open-source designs make this approach an important step toward improving rigor and reproducibility in rodent spontaneous recognition memory tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Secreted Reporter Assay Enables Quantitative and Longitudinal Monitoring of Neuronal Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to measure changes in neuronal activity in a quantifiable and precise manner is of fundamental importance to understand neuron development and function. Repeated monitoring of neuronal activity of the same population of neurons over several days is challenging and, typically, low-throughput. Here, we describe a new biochemical reporter assay that allows for repeated measurements of neuronal activity in a cell type-specific manner. We coupled activity-dependent elements from the <I>Arc/Arg3.1</I> gene with a secreted reporter, <I>Gaussia</I> luciferase (Gluc), to quantify neuronal activity without sacrificing the neurons. The reporter predominantly senses calcium and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent activity. By repeatedly measuring the accumulation of the reporter in cell media, we can profile the developmental dynamics of neuronal activity in cultured neurons from male and female mice. The assay also allows for longitudinal analysis of pharmacological treatments, thus distinguishing acute from delayed responses. Moreover, conditional expression of the reporter allows for monitoring cell type-specific changes. This simple, quantitative, cost-effective, automatable, and cell type-specific activity reporter is a valuable tool to study the development of neuronal activity in normal and disease-model conditions, and to identify small molecules or protein factors that selectively modulate the activity of a specific population of neurons.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Children born very preterm (&lt;33 weeks of gestation) are at a higher risk of developing socio-emotional difficulties compared with those born at term. In this longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that diffusion characteristics of white matter (WM) tracts implicated in socio-emotional processing assessed in the neonatal period are associated with socio-emotional development in 151 very preterm children previously enrolled into the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42). All children underwent diffusion tensor imaging at term-equivalent age and fractional anisotropy (FA) was quantified in the uncinate fasciculus (UF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Children&rsquo;s socio-emotional development was evaluated at preschool age (median = 4.63 years). Exploratory factor analysis conducted on the outcome variables revealed a three-factor structure, with latent constructs summarized as: "emotion moderation," "social function," and "empathy." Results of linear regression analyses, adjusting for full-scale IQ and clinical and socio-demographic variables, showed an association between lower FA in the right UF and higher "emotion moderation" scores (&beta; = &ndash;0.280; <I>p </I>&lt;<I> </I>0.001), which was mainly driven by negative affectivity scores (&beta; = &ndash;0.281; <I>p </I>=<I> </I>0.001). Results further showed an association between higher full-scale IQ and better social functioning (&beta; = &ndash;0.334, <I>p </I>&lt;<I> </I>0.001). Girls had higher empathy scores than boys (&beta; = &ndash;0.341, <I>p </I>=<I> </I>0.006). These findings suggest that early alterations of diffusion characteristics of the UF could represent a biological substrate underlying the link between very preterm birth and emotional dysregulation in childhood and beyond.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Shifts in spatial patterns produced during the execution of a navigational task can be used to track the effects of the accumulation of knowledge and the acquisition of structured information about the environment. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of mice behavior while performing a novel goal localization task in a large, modular arena, the HexMaze. To demonstrate the effects of different forms of previous knowledge we first obtain a precise statistical characterization of animals&rsquo; paths with sub-trial resolution and over different phases of learning. The emergence of a flexible representation of the task is accompanied by a progressive improvement of performance, mediated by multiple, multiplexed time scales. We then use a generative mathematical model of the animal behavior to isolate the specific contributions to the final navigational strategy. We find that animal behavior can be accurately reproduced by the combined effect of a goal-oriented component, becoming stronger with the progression of learning, and of a random walk component, producing choices unrelated to the task and only partially weakened in time.</p>

                Background:  Low completion rates of questionnaires in randomised controlled trials can compromise the reliability of the results, so ways to boost questionnaire completion are often implemented. Although there is evidence to suggest that sending a text message to participants increases completion, there is little evidence around the timing or personalisation of these text messages.    Methods:  A two-by-two factorial SWAT (study within a trial) was embedded within the MiQuit-3 trial, looking at smoking cessation within pregnant smokers. Participants who reached their 36-week gestational follow-up were randomised to receive a personalised or non-personalised text message, either one week or one day prior to their follow-up. Primary outcomes were completion rate of questionnaire via telephone. Secondary outcomes included: completion rate via any method, time to completion, and number of attempts to contact required.    Results  In total 194 participants were randomised into the SWAT to receive a text message that was personalised early(n=50), personalised late (n=47), non-personalised early(n=50), or non-personalised late(n=47). There was no evidence that timing of the text message (early: one week before; or late: one day before) had an effect on any of the outcomes. There was evidence that a personalised text message would result in fewer completions compared with a non-personalised text message when data was collected only via the telephone(adjusted OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22–0.87, p=0.02). However, these results were not significant when looking at completion via any method (adjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.30-1.24, p=0.17). There was no evidence to show that personalisation or not was better for any of the secondary outcomes.    Conclusion  Timing of the text message does not appear to influence the completion of questionnaires. Personalisation of a text message may be detrimental to questionnaire completion, if data is only collected via the telephone - however, more SWATs should be undertaken in this field.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Heterodimer-heterotetramer formation mediates enhanced sensor activity in a biophysical model for BMP signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by M. Shahriar Karim, Aasakiran Madamanchi, James A. Dutko, Mary C. Mullins, David M. Umulis</p>

Numerous stages of organismal development rely on the cellular interpretation of gradients of secreted morphogens including members of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family through transmembrane receptors. Early gradients of BMPs drive dorsal/ventral patterning throughout the animal kingdom in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Growing evidence in Drosophila, zebrafish, murine and other systems suggests that BMP ligand heterodimers are the primary BMP signaling ligand, even in systems in which mixtures of BMP homodimers and heterodimers are present. Signaling by heterodimers occurs through a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex comprising of two distinct type one BMP receptors and two type II receptors. To understand the system dynamics and determine whether kinetic assembly of heterodimer-heterotetramer BMP complexes is favored, as compared to other plausible BMP ligand-receptor configurations, we developed a kinetic model for BMP tetramer formation based on current measurements for binding rates and affinities. We find that contrary to a common hypothesis, heterodimer-heterotetramer formation is <i>not</i> kinetically favored over the formation of homodimer-tetramer complexes under physiological conditions of receptor and ligand concentrations and therefore other mechanisms, potentially including differential kinase activities of the formed heterotetramer complexes, must be the cause of heterodimer-heterotetramer signaling primacy. Further, although BMP complex assembly favors homodimer and homomeric complex formation over a wide range of parameters, ignoring these signals and instead relying on the heterodimer improves the range of morphogen interpretation in a broad set of conditions, suggesting a performance advantage for heterodimer signaling in patterning multiple cell types in a gradient.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The critical balance between dopamine D2 receptor and RGS for the sensitive detection of a transient decay in dopamine signal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hidetoshi Urakubo, Sho Yagishita, Haruo Kasai, Yoshiyuki Kubota, Shin Ishii</p>

In behavioral learning, reward-related events are encoded into phasic dopamine (DA) signals in the brain. In particular, unexpected reward omission leads to a phasic decrease in DA (DA dip) in the striatum, which triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) in DA D2 receptor (D2R)-expressing spiny-projection neurons (D2 SPNs). While this LTP is required for reward discrimination, it is unclear how such a short DA-dip signal (0.5–2 s) is transferred through intracellular signaling to the coincidence detector, adenylate cyclase (AC). In the present study, we built a computational model of D2 signaling to determine conditions for the DA-dip detection. The DA dip can be detected only if the basal DA signal sufficiently inhibits AC, and the DA-dip signal sufficiently disinhibits AC. We found that those two requirements were simultaneously satisfied only if two key molecules, D2R and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) were balanced within a certain range; this balance has indeed been observed in experimental studies. We also found that high level of RGS was required for the detection of a 0.5-s short DA dip, and the analytical solutions for these requirements confirmed their universality. The imbalance between D2R and RGS is associated with schizophrenia and DYT1 dystonia, both of which are accompanied by abnormal striatal LTP. Our simulations suggest that D2 SPNs in patients with schizophrenia and DYT1 dystonia cannot detect short DA dips. We finally discussed that such psychiatric and movement disorders can be understood in terms of the imbalance between D2R and RGS.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mathematical learning deficits originate in early childhood from atypical development of a frontoparietal brain network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ulrike Kuhl, Sarah Sobotta, Legascreen Consortium , Michael A. Skeide</p>

Mathematical learning deficits are defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder (dyscalculia) in the International Classification of Diseases. It is not known, however, how such deficits emerge in the course of early brain development. Here, we conducted functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments in 3- to 6-year-old children without formal mathematical learning experience. We followed this sample until the age of 7 to 9 years, identified individuals who developed deficits, and matched them to a typically developing control group using comprehensive behavioral assessments. Multivariate pattern classification distinguished future cases from controls with up to 87% accuracy based on the regional functional activity of the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the network-level functional activity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the effective functional and structural connectivity of these regions. Our results indicate that mathematical learning deficits originate from atypical development of a frontoparietal network that is already detectable in early childhood.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Thalamic Influence on Slow Wave Slope Renormalization During Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Slow waves are thought to mediate an overall reduction in synaptic strength during sleep. The specific contribution of the thalamus to this so-called synaptic renormalization is unknown. Thalamic stroke is associated with daytime sleepiness, along with changes to sleep electroencephalography and cognition, making it a unique “experiment of nature” to assess the relationship between sleep rhythms, synaptic renormalization, and daytime functions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sleep was studied by polysomnography and high-density electroencephalography over 17 nights in patients with thalamic (n = 12) and 15 nights in patients with extrathalamic (n = 11) stroke. Sleep electroencephalographic overnight slow wave slope changes and their relationship with subjective daytime sleepiness, cognition, and other functional tests were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thalamic and extrathalamic patients did not differ in terms of age, sleep duration, or apnea–hypopnea index. Conversely, overnight slope changes were reduced in a large cluster of electrodes in thalamic compared to extrathalamic stroke patients. This reduction was related to increased daytime sleepiness. No significant differences were found in other functional tests between the 2 groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with thalamic stroke, a reduction in overnight slow wave slope change and increased daytime sleepiness was found. Sleep- and wake-centered mechanisms for this relationship are discussed. Overall, this study suggests a central role of the thalamus in synaptic renormalization. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Seizures after Ischemic Stroke: A Matched Multicenter Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures and post-stroke epilepsy after acute ischemic stroke and evaluate the effects of reperfusion treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed the risk factors for post-stroke seizures using logistic or Cox regression in a multicenter study, including adults from 8 European referral centers with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke. We compared the risk of post-stroke seizures between participants with or without reperfusion treatment following propensity score matching to reduce confounding due to treatment selection.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the overall cohort of 4,229 participants (mean age 71 years, 57% men), a higher risk of acute symptomatic seizures was observed in those with more severe strokes, infarcts located in the posterior cerebral artery territory, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Strokes caused by small-vessel occlusion carried a small risk of acute symptomatic seizures. 6% developed post-stroke epilepsy. Risk factors for post-stroke epilepsy were acute symptomatic seizures, more severe strokes, infarcts involving the cerebral cortex, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Electroencephalography findings within 7 days of stroke onset were not independently associated with the risk of post-stroke epilepsy. There was no association between reperfusion treatments in general or only intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy with the time to post-stroke epilepsy or the risk of acute symptomatic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Post-stroke seizures are related to stroke severity, etiology, and location, whereas an early electroencephalogram was not predictive of epilepsy. We did not find an association of reperfusion treatment with risks of acute symptomatic seizures or post-stroke epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Background  The CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials recommend use of a single primary outcome, to guard against the raised risk of false positive findings when multiple measures are considered. It is, however, possible to include a suite of multiple outcomes in an intervention study, while controlling the familywise error rate, if the criterion for rejecting the null hypothesis specifies that N or more of the outcomes reach an agreed level of statistical significance, where N depends on the total number of outcome measures included in the study, and the correlation between them.  Methods  Simulations were run, using a conventional null-hypothesis significance testing approach with alpha set at .05, to explore the case when between 2 and 12 outcome measures are included to compare two groups, with average correlation between measures ranging from zero to .8, and true effect size ranging from 0 to .7. In step 1, a table is created giving the minimum N significant outcomes (MinNSig) that is required for a given set of outcome measures to control the familywise error rate at 5%. In step 2, data are simulated using MinNSig values for each set of correlated outcomes and the resulting proportion of significant results is computed for different sample sizes,correlations, and effect sizes.  Results  The Adjust NVar approach can achieve a more efficient trade-off between power and type I error rate than use of a single outcome when there are three or more moderately intercorrelated outcome variables.  Conclusions  Where it is feasible to have a suite of moderately correlated outcome measures, then this might be a more efficient approach than reliance on a single primary outcome measure in an intervention study. In effect, it builds in an internal replication to the study. This approach can also be used to evaluate published intervention studies.

This study investigated the combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract in improvement of free fatty acid-induced cardiac insulin resistance by improving the adiponectin/FAS pathway. Methods: This study used 25 males Sprague-Dawley rats induced by a high-fat high sucrose diet and injection of low dose streptozotocin to make a metabolic syndrome (MS) rat model and standard chow as healthy control rats. The MS rats were treated with green tea (200 mg/ b. w.), decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee (300 mg/ b. w.), and the combination of both extracts in 9 weeks. Experimental groups in this study were divided into 5 groups: 1) MS (HFHS diet + STZ) group, 2) NC (normal chow) group, 3) GT (green tea extract) group, 4) GC (decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract), 5) CM (combination of both extracts) group. Adiponectin and HOMA-IR level was analysed using ELISA, and the gene expression of Adipo-R1, FAS, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, GLUT4 was measured by RT-PCR. Results: The combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee showed synergistic effects in improving FFA levels. The adiponectin/FAS pathway was attenuated in the CM group. Moreover, the combination also showed improvement in cardiac insulin resistance markers such as IRS1/2, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, and GLUT4. Conclusions:  The combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract improved cardiac insulin resistance better than green tea and green coffee extract administration alone by reducing free fatty acids levels through adiponectin/FAS pathway modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">pubassistant.ch: consolidating publication profiles of researchers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Online accounts to keep track of scientific publications, such as Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) or Google Scholar, can be time consuming to maintain and synchronize. Furthermore, the open access status of publications is often not easily accessible, hindering potential opening of closed publications. To lessen the burden of managing personal profiles, we developed a R shiny app that allows publication lists from multiple platforms to be retrieved and consolidated, as well as interactive exploration and comparison of publication profiles. A live version can be found at pubassistant.ch.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Utilizing data sampling techniques on algorithmic fairness for customer churn prediction with data imbalance problems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Customer churn prediction (CCP) refers to detecting which customers are likely to cancel the services provided by a service provider, for example, internet services. The class imbalance problem (CIP) in machine learning occurs when there is a huge difference in the samples of positive class compared to the negative class. It is one of the major obstacles in CCP as it deteriorates performance in the classification process. Utilizing data sampling techniques (DSTs) helps to resolve the CIP to some extent. Methods: In this paper, we review the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness, i.e., to investigate whether the results pose any discrimination between male and female groups and compare the results before and after using DSTs. Three real-world datasets with unequal balancing rates were prepared and four ubiquitous DSTs were applied to them. Six popular classification techniques were utilized in the classification process. Both classifier’s performance and algorithmic fairness are evaluated with notable metrics. Results: The results indicated that Random Forest classifier outperforms other classifiers in all three datasets and, using SMOTE and ADASYN techniques cause more discrimination in the female group. The rate of unintentional discrimination seems to be higher in the original data of extremely unbalanced datasets under the following classifiers: Logistics Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Conclusions: Algorithmic fairness has become a broadly studied area in recent years, yet there is a very little systematic study on the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness. This study presents important findings to further the use of algorithmic fairness in CCP research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integrating augmented reality technology in education: vector personal computer augmented reality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Educators often face difficulties in explaining abstract concepts such as vectors. During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, fully online classes have also caused additional challenges to using conventional teaching methods. To explain a vector concept of more than 2 dimensions, visualization becomes a problem. Although Microsoft PowerPoint can integrate animation, the illustration is still in 2-dimensions. Augmented reality (AR) technology is recommended to aid educators and students in teaching-learning vectors, namely via a vector personal computer augmented reality system (VPCAR), to fulfil the demand for tools to support the learning and teaching of vectors. Methods: A PC learning module for vectors was developed in a 3-dimensional coordinate system by using AR technology. Purposive sampling was applied to get feedback from educators and students in Malaysia through an online survey. The supportiveness of using VPCAR based on six items (attractiveness, easiness, visualization, conceptual understanding, inspiration and helpfulness) was recorded on 5-points Likert-type scales. Findings are presented descriptively and graphically. Results: Surprisingly, both students and educators adapted to the new technology easily and provided significant positive feedback that showed a left-skewed and J-shaped distribution for each measurement item, respectively. The distributions were proven significantly different among the students and educators, where supportive level result of educators was higher than students. This study introduced a PC learning module other than mobile apps as students mostly use laptops to attend online class and educators also engage other IT tools in their teaching. Conclusions: Based on these findings, VPCAR provides a good prospect in supporting educators and students during their online teaching-learning process. However, the findings may not be generalizable to all students and educators in Malaysia as purposive sampling was applied. Further studies may focus on government-funded schools using the newly developed VPCAR system, which is the novelty of this study.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Hydroxychloroquine for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) does not respond well to immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. Chronic activation of microglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PPMS. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the activity of human microglia and has neuroprotective effects in vitro.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-arm, phase 2 futility trial of 200mg oral HCQ twice daily for 18 months. In an effort to investigate disability worsening in the absence of overt focal inflammation, we excluded participants with contrast enhancing lesions on a screening MRI. The primary endpoint was ≥20% worsening on the timed 25-foot walk measured between 6 and 18 months of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Based on original trial data, 40% of the cohort were expected to worsen. We used a Simon two-stage design to compare a null hypothesis of 40% of the cohort worsening against the one-sided alternative of 20%. Using a 5% type 1 error rate and 80% power, HCQ treatment would be deemed successful if fewer than 10 of 35 participants experienced clinically significant worsening. The study met its primary endpoint, as only 8 of 35 participants worsened between 6 and 18 months. HCQ was overall well tolerated, with adverse events in 82% and serious adverse events in 12% of participants. All serious adverse events were unlikely related to HCQ use.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HCQ treatment was associated with reduced disability worsening in people with PPMS. HCQ is a promising treatment candidate in PPMS and should be investigated further in randomized controlled clinical trials. (<a target="_blank"

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparative Effectiveness of Stereo‐EEG versus Subdural Grids in Epilepsy Surgery</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the outcomes of subdural electrode (SDE) implantations versus stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG), the two predominant methods of intracranial EEG (iEEG) performed in difficult to localize drug-resistant focal epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Surgical Therapies Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy created an international registry of iEEG patients implanted between 2005-2019 with ≥ 1 year follow-up. We used propensity score matching to control exposure selection bias and generate comparable cohorts. Study endpoints: 1) likelihood of resection after iEEG; 2) seizure-freedom at last follow-up; and 3) complications (composite of either post-operative infection, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or permanent neurologic deficit).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ten study sites from seven countries and three continents contributed 2,012 patients, including 1,468 (73%) eligible for analysis (526 SDE, 942 SEEG) of whom 988 (67%) underwent subsequent resection. Propensity score matching improved covariate balance between exposure groups for all analyses. Propensity-matched patients who underwent SDE had higher odds of subsequent resective surgery (odds ratio OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.05 – 1.84), and higher odds of complications (OR=2.24, 95% CI 1.34-3.74; unadjusted: 9.6% after SDE vs. 3.3% after SEEG). Odds of seizure-freedom in propensity-matched resected patients were 1.66 times higher (95% CI 1.21, 2.26) for SEEG compared to SDE (unadjusted: 55% seizure-free after SEEG-guided resections vs. 41% after SDE)</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to SEEG, SDE evaluations are more likely to lead to brain surgery in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, but have more surgical complications and lower probability of seizure-freedom. This comparative-effectiveness study provides the highest feasible evidence level to guide decisions on iEEG.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Impact of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Neurogenesis and Cortical Maturation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurodevelopmental delays and frontal lobe cortical dysmaturation are widespread among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest pool of neural stem/progenitor cells in the postnatal brain. Our aim is to determine the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on neurogenesis and cortical maturation in piglets whose SVZ development is similar to human infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three week-old piglets (n=29) were randomly assigned to control (no surgery), mild-CPB (34°C full flow for 60min) and severe-CPB groups (25°C circulatory-arrest for 60min). The SVZ and frontal lobe were analyzed with immunohistochemistry 3 days and 4 weeks postoperatively. MRI of the frontal lobe was used to assess cortical development.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SVZ neurogenic activity was reduced up to 4 weeks after both mild and severe CPB-induced insults. CPB also induced decreased migration of young neurons to the frontal lobe, demonstrating that CPB impairs postnatal neurogenesis. MRI 4 weeks after CPB displayed a decrease in gyrification index and cortical volume of the frontal lobe. Cortical fractional anisotropy was increased after severe CPB injury, indicating a prolonged deleterious impact of CPB on cortical maturation. Both CPB-induced insults displayed a significant change in densities of three major inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the frontal cortex. In addition, different CPB insults altered different subpopulations of inhibitory neurons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced neurological impairments. Further refinement of CPB hardware and techniques is necessary to improve long-term frontal cortical dysmaturation observed in children with CHD.</p>

                <p>Difficulty retrieving proper names is common in older adults, coinciding with the accumulation of aggregated proteins in mid-life. We investigated the ability of healthy older adults to retrieve the names of famous faces in relation to positron emission tomography measurements of amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. More tau in the left fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus was related to reduced proper name retrieval performance and this effect was potentiated by amyloid-β. These findings provide an explanation for a common complaint of older adults and link proper name retrieval to neural systems involved in face perception, memory, and naming</p>
