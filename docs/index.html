              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21414">Brain Age Group Classification Based on Resting State Functional Connectivity Metrics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.21414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI and explored the efficacy of traditional deep learning for classifying brain developmental stages (BDS). Functional connectivity was assessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation across 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was analyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to classify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2. These deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA. Results showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven networks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that SBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and participation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while clustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet outperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for BDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local connectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study focused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited set of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior classification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing age-related brain changes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21611">Orientation selectivity analysis for integrated affine quasi quadrature models of complex cells</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the orientation selectivity properties of idealized models of complex cells in terms of affine quasi quadrature measures, which combine the responses of idealized models of simple cells in terms of affine Gaussian derivatives by (i) pointwise squaring, (ii) summation of responses for different orders of spatial derivation and (iii) spatial integration. Specifically, this paper explores the consequences of assuming that the family of spatial receptive fields should be covariant under spatial affine transformations, thereby implying that the receptive fields ought to span a variability over the degree of elongation.
  We investigate the theoretical properties of three main ways of defining idealized models of complex cells and compare the predictions from these models to neurophysiologically obtained receptive field histograms over the resultant of biological orientation selectivity curves. It is shown that the extended modelling mechanism lead to more uniform behaviour and a wider span over the values of the resultat that are covered, compared to earlier presented idealized models of complex cells without spatial integration. More generally, we propose that the presented methodology could be used as a new tool to evaluate other computational models of complex cells in relation to biological measurements.

                arXiv:2503.20841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons encode information in a binary manner and process complex signals. However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types. We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation. Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies. This work advances data-driven neuroscience and neural activity modeling, paving the way for more ethical and effective experimental methodologies.

                arXiv:2503.19923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to investigate whether latent space representations of visual stimuli and fMRI data share common information. Decoding and reconstructing stimuli from fMRI data remains a challenge in AI and neuroscience, with significant implications for understanding neural representations and improving the interpretability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this preliminary study, we investigate the feasibility of such reconstruction by examining the similarity between the latent spaces of one autoencoder (AE) and one vision transformer (ViT) trained on fMRI and image data, respectively. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that the latent spaces of the two domains appear different. However, these initial findings are inconclusive, and further research is needed to explore this relationship more thoroughly.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19924">Human Brain State Analysis Unveils Complexity of Brain Dynamics: Insights from General Anesthesia and ADHD EEG signals</a></h4>

Abstract: The human brain is a complex system exhibiting rich dynamical behavior across various states, including those induced by anesthesia or neurological disorders. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, our study investigates the underlying complexity and universal patterns in human brain dynamics across states induced by general anesthesia and neurological disorder of inattentive-type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We extract relative phase dynamics time series, $\beta(t)$, from EEG signals and compute permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity across the different states using the framework of ordinal patterns. Our results reveal several key findings. First, different brain states exhibit distinct PE values, indicating distinct signatures of information content across states. We find an inverse correlation between entropy and the level of consciousness during general anesthesia. Further, when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition, individual, or $\beta(t)$ time series, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics. Moreover, compared to well-known stochastic processes (linear underdamped Langevin dynamics, active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and fractional Brownian motion), brain data consistently exhibits higher complexity for any given PE value. Multifractal analysis shows this enhanced complexity likely arises from greater multifractal scaling properties compared to stochastic processes. Our findings highlight the power of ordinal patterns in distinguishing various dynamic brain states and uncovering hidden universal patterns in brain dynamics. Our comprehensive characterization of human brain complexity across states offers valuable insights for future research into consciousness, attention disorders, and neural information processing.

                arXiv:2503.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO) has been gaining popularity in research over the years due to its outstanding knowledge transfer ability to address various challenges in optimization. However, a pressing issue in this field is that the invention of new ETO algorithms has far outpaced the development of fundamental theories needed to clearly understand the key factors contributing to the success of these algorithms for effective generalization. In response to this challenge, this study aims to establish theoretical foundations for analogy-based ETO, specifically to support various algorithms that frequently reference a key concept known as similarity. First, we introduce analogical reasoning and link its subprocesses to three key issues in ETO. Then, we develop theories for analogy-based knowledge transfer, rooted in the principles that underlie the subprocesses. Afterwards, we present two theorems related to the performance gain of analogy-based knowledge transfer, namely unconditionally nonnegative performance gain and conditionally positive performance gain, to theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of various analogy-based ETO methods. Last but not least, we offer a novel insight into analogy-based ETO that interprets its conditional superiority over traditional evolutionary optimization through the lens of the no free lunch theorem for optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21347">Residual Learning Inspired Crossover Operator and Strategy Enhancements for Evolutionary Multitasking</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.21347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evolutionary multitasking, strategies such as crossover operators and skill factor assignment are critical for effective knowledge transfer. Existing improvements to crossover operators primarily focus on low-dimensional variable combinations, such as arithmetic crossover or partially mapped crossover, which are insufficient for modeling complex high-dimensional interactions.Moreover, static or semi-dynamic crossover strategies fail to adapt to the dynamic dependencies among tasks. In addition, current Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm frameworks often rely on fixed skill factor assignment strategies, lacking flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm-Residual Learning (MFEA-RL) method based on residual learning. The method employs a Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) model to generate high-dimensional residual representations of individuals, enhancing the modeling of complex relationships within dimensions. A ResNet-based mechanism dynamically assigns skill factors to improve task adaptability, while a random mapping mechanism efficiently performs crossover operations and mitigates the risk of negative transfer. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that MFEA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art multitasking algorithms. It excels in both convergence and adaptability on standard evolutionary multitasking benchmarks, including CEC2017-MTSO and WCCI2020-MTSO. Additionally, its effectiveness is validated through a real-world application scenario.

                arXiv:2503.21439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research in the runtime analysis of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) has focused on univariate EDAs for multi-valued decision variables. In particular, the runtime of the multi-valued cGA (r-cGA) and UMDA on multi-valued functions has been a significant area of study. Adak and Witt (PPSN 2024) and Hamano et al. (ECJ 2024) independently performed a first runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the r-valued OneMax function (r-OneMax). Adak and Witt also introduced a different r-valued OneMax function called G-OneMax. However, for that function, only empirical results were provided so far due to the increased complexity of its runtime analysis, since r-OneMax involves categorical values of two types only, while G-OneMax encompasses all possible values.
  In this paper, we present the first theoretical runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the G-OneMax function. We demonstrate that the runtime is O(nr^3 log^2 n log r) with high probability. Additionally, we refine the previously established runtime analysis of the r-cGA on r-OneMax, improving the previous bound to O(nr log n log r), which improves the state of the art by an asymptotic factor of log n and is tight for the binary case. Moreover, we for the first time include the case of frequency borders.

                arXiv:2503.20286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has made significant strides over the past two decades. However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113x compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

                arXiv:2405.13088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pruning neural networks, i.e., removing some of their parameters whilst retaining their accuracy, is one of the main ways to reduce the latency of a machine learning pipeline, especially in resource- and/or bandwidth-constrained scenarios. In this context, the pruning technique, i.e., how to choose the parameters to remove, is critical to the system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach, called FlexRel and predicated upon combining training-time and inference-time information, namely, parameter magnitude and relevance, in order to improve the resulting accuracy whilst saving both computational resources and bandwidth. Our performance evaluation shows that FlexRel is able to achieve higher pruning factors, saving over 35% bandwidth for typical accuracy targets.

                arXiv:2408.10672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research in Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) have shown that meta-trained neural networks can effectively guide the design of black-box optimizers, significantly reducing the need for expert tuning and delivering robust performance across complex problem distributions. Despite their success, a paradox remains: MetaBBO still rely on human-crafted Exploratory Landscape Analysis features to inform the meta-level agent about the low-level optimization progress. To address the gap, this paper proposes Neural Exploratory Landscape Analysis (NeurELA), a novel framework that dynamically profiles landscape features through a two-stage, attention-based neural network, executed in an entirely end-to-end fashion. NeurELA is pre-trained over a variety of MetaBBO algorithms using a multi-task neuroevolution strategy. Extensive experiments show that NeurELA achieves consistently superior performance when integrated into different and even unseen MetaBBO tasks and can be efficiently fine-tuned for further performance boost. This advancement marks a pivotal step in making MetaBBO algorithms more autonomous and broadly applicable. The source code of NeurELA can be accessed at https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Neur-ELA.

                arXiv:2409.11593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents that operate autonomously benefit from lifelong learning capabilities. However, compatible training algorithms must comply with the decentralized nature of these systems, which imposes constraints on both the parameter counts and the computational resources. The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm is one of these. FF relies only on feedforward operations, the same used for inference, for optimizing layer-wise objectives. This purely forward approach eliminates the need for transpose operations required in traditional backpropagation. Despite its potential, FF has failed to reach state-of-the-art performance on most standard benchmark tasks, in part due to unreliable negative data generation methods for unsupervised learning.
  In this work, we propose the Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward (SCFF) algorithm, a competitive training method aimed at closing this performance gap. Inspired by standard self-supervised contrastive learning for vision tasks, SCFF generates positive and negative inputs applicable across various datasets. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing unsupervised local learning algorithms on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet. We extend FF's application to training recurrent neural networks, expanding its utility to sequential data tasks. These findings pave the way for high-accuracy, real-time learning on resource-constrained edge devices.

                arXiv:2412.17411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty calibration is crucial for various machine learning applications, yet it remains challenging. Many models exhibit hallucinations - confident yet inaccurate responses - due to miscalibrated confidence. Here, we show that the common practice of random initialization in deep learning, often considered a standard technique, is an underlying cause of this miscalibration, leading to excessively high confidence in untrained networks. Our method, inspired by developmental neuroscience, addresses this issue by simply pretraining networks with random noise and labels, reducing overconfidence and bringing initial confidence levels closer to chance. This ensures optimal calibration, aligning confidence with accuracy during subsequent data training, without the need for additional pre- or post-processing. Pre-calibrated networks excel at identifying "unknown data," showing low confidence for out-of-distribution inputs, thereby resolving confidence miscalibration.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.

                arXiv:2503.17132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-341/v1?src=rss">Hybrid optimization technique for matrix chain multiplication using Strassen’s algorithm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) is a fundamental problem in computational mathematics and computer science, often encountered in scientific computing, graphics, and machine learning. Traditional MCM optimization techniques use Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization to determine the optimal parenthesization for minimizing the number of scalar multiplications. However, standard matrix multiplication still operates in O(n3) time complexity, leading to inefficiencies for large matrices. Methods In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization technique that integrates Strassen’s algorithm into MCM to further accelerate matrix multiplication. Our approach consists of two key phases: (i) matrix chain order optimization, using a top-down memoized DP approach, we compute the best multiplication sequence, and (ii) hybrid multiplication strategy, we selectively apply Strassen’s algorithm for large matrices (n ≥ 128), reducing the complexity from O(n3) to O(n2.81), while using standard multiplication for smaller matrices to avoid recursive overhead. We evaluate the performance of our hybrid method through computational experiments comparing execution time, memory usage, and numerical accuracy against traditional MCM and Strassen’s standalone multiplication. Results Our results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method achieves significant speedup (4x–8x improvement) and reduces memory consumption, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. This research opens pathways for further optimizations in parallel computing and GPU-accelerated matrix operations. Conclusion This study presents a hybrid approach to Matrix Chain Multiplication by integrating Strassen’s algorithm, reducing execution time and memory usage. By selectively applying Strassen’s method for large matrices, the proposed technique improves efficiency while preserving accuracy. Future work can focus on parallel computing and GPU acceleration for further optimization.

                In cases where vaginal delivery is not feasible and the mother's or the child's health is in danger, a Caesarean section (CS) is medically warranted. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that between 10% and 15% of all births will have medically justifiable CS rates. Globally, WHO estimates that 6.2 million CSs are performed each year without medical justification. The determination to proceed with or forgo a CS can be understood as the result of weighing three key categories of influence: demand-side factors, supply-side factors, and clinical factors. Each of these categories contributes uniquely to the ultimate decision of whether to perform a CS, highlighting the multifaceted nature of this healthcare challenge. Within each input, there is also, often, a complex interplay. For example, there is a local narrative of mothers seeking an elective CS being "too posh to push", inextricably linking household socioeconomic factors and maternal preferences. On the supply side there are issues of the policy within the healthcare facility (private hospitals prefer CSs) and an interplay with time management and maximizing the efficiency of the facility. Bangladesh's CS has been on the rise; according to the most recent survey, it was 45%, far higher than the WHO recommendation. The private sector interacts with the high rates of CS in Bangladesh; MOH Bangladesh has little control over this sector. To optimize the CS rate, the nation must first recognize that needless CS is an issue and take all necessary action to address it.

                Background Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 1 billion people. Recent evidence has highlighted iron status as a key requirement for effective immune responses. Iron deficiency is common in pregnant women and vaccines are mandated at this stage of life. In the antenatal clinics (ANC) of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit on the Thailand-Myanmar border, all pregnant women receive nutritional iron supplements at prophylactic or treatment dosages, as determined by haematocrit. Migrant pregnant women have been offered vaccination against diphtheria-tetanus since 1997, and since April-2022 COVID-19 vaccination, as indicated by vaccine history. In this setting, nearly 10% of pregnant women are anaemic at their first ANC visit; approximately 50% of anaemic women receiving treatment doses of nutritional supplements respond by increasing haematocrit after one month of supplementation. Methods This study aimed to investigate whether response to iron supplementation is associated with improved vaccine responses in pregnant women with anemia in this setting. We will monitor three groups of pregnant women vaccinated at their first ANC visit before 28 weeks of gestation receiving nutritional iron-containing multiple micronutrient supplements (Sangobion®, Procter&Gamble): 1) non-anaemic women who receive preventive doses of supplementation, 2) anaemic women who display a haematocrit response to treatment doses, and 3) anaemic women who do not respond to treatment doses. The primary endpoint is the difference in the geometric mean titer ratio (rGMT, comparing baseline to 28 days post-vaccination) of diphtheria-tetanus and COVID vaccine-specific antibodies between anaemic women who respond and those who fail to make a haematocrit response to iron-containing interventions. Discussion Iron deficiency in different populations is associated with poor vaccine efficacy, and nutritional iron supplementation may improve the immune response to vaccines. Interventions that significantly increase vaccine efficacy would represent a major benefit to public health.

As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                <p>Stress is a common occurrence for military personnel. This can include the stress of deployment and active combat. Anxiety is considered a reaction to stress, and with anxiety-related disorders on the rise, it is imperative that stress be considered a preexisting condition when studying a number of neurological conditions. To determine the effects of stress on the behavioral outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), we used a 3&nbsp;d acute unpredictable stress (AUS) model followed by blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) to assess social anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats. The animals were divided into four groups including unstressed and uninjured control (Con), stress-only animals (AUS), injury-only animals (BINT), and animals that received both stress and injury (AUS + BINT). In the males, behavioral tests such as elevated plus and three-chamber sociability (3-CS) showed that stress plays a dominant role in determining behavioral outcomes after TBI with the AUS + BINT animals behaving more similarly to the AUS animals than the BINT animals. Other tests, such as open field, showed that AUS + BINT had an additive effect on anxiety-like behavior or that prestress could even have a protective effect as seen in three-chamber social novelty (3-CSN). Behavioral assessment of female animals showed that AUS + BINT had the opposite effect than it did on the males in both three-chamber sociability and three-chamber social novelty, while the open field results were similar to the males. This study shows that neurological changes driven by stress have an effect on the behavioral outcomes of BINT.</p>

                <p>Anterior&ndash;posterior interactions in the alpha band (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) have been implicated in various functions including perception, attention, and working memory. The underlying neural communication can be flexibly controlled by adjusting phase relations when activities across anterior&ndash;posterior regions oscillate at a matched frequency. We thus investigated how alpha oscillation frequencies spontaneously converged along anterior&ndash;posterior regions by tracking oscillatory EEG activity while participants rested. As more anterior&ndash;posterior regions (scalp sites) frequency-converged, the probability of additional regions joining the frequency convergence increased, and so did oscillatory synchronization (i.e., oscillatory power) at participating regions, suggesting that anterior&ndash;posterior frequency convergences are driven by inter-regional entrainment. Notably, frequency convergences were accompanied by two types of approximately linear phase gradients, one progressively phase lagged in the anterior direction, the posterior-to-anterior (P-A) gradient, and the other progressively phase lagged in the posterior direction, the anterior-to-posterior (A-P) gradient. These gradients implied traveling waves propagating in the feedforward and feedback directions, respectively. Interestingly, while in natural viewing frequency convergences were accompanied by both gradient types (occurring at different frequencies) regardless of anterior&ndash;posterior routes, when the eyes were closed, the P-A and A-P gradients spatially segregated, channeling feedforward flows of information primarily through the midline and feedback flows primarily through each hemisphere. Future research may investigate how eye closure organizes information flows in this way and how it influences hierarchical information processing. Future research may also investigate the functional roles of frequency-convergence contingent traveling waves in contrast to those generated by other mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Delayed motor development is an early clinical sign of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. However, changes at the neural circuit level that underlie early motor differences are underexplored. The striatum, the principal input nucleus of the basal ganglia, plays an important role in motor learning in adult animals, and the maturation of the striatal circuit has been associated with the development of early motor behaviors. Here, we briefly exposed pregnant C57BL/6 dams to ethanol (5% w/w) in a liquid diet on embryonic days 13.5&ndash;16.5 and assessed the mouse progeny using a series of nine brief motor behavior tasks on postnatal days 2&ndash;14. Live brain slices were then obtained from behaviorally tested mice for whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp electrophysiology to assess GABAergic/glutamatergic synaptic activity and passive/active properties in two populations of striatal neurons: GABAergic interneurons and spiny striatal projection neurons. Electrophysiologically recorded spiny striatal projection neurons were also filled intracellularly with biocytin for post hoc analysis of dendritic morphology. We found that prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in developmental motor delays that were more severe in male mice and coincided with sex-dependent differences in the maturation of striatal neurons. Our findings indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure results in dynamic morphological and functional changes to the developmental trajectories of striatal neurons commensurate with the development of motor behaviors that differ between male and female mice.</p>

                <p>When attempting to concurrently perform two distinct cognitive tasks, the performance of either task is frequently compromised. This phenomenon is known as dual-task interference. Although multiple task features have been postulated to influence on dual-task interference, the primary determinant remains unclear. The determinant factor causing dual-task interference is an important issue to understand its mechanism and associated functions including switching tasks and planning task order. The present study investigated this issue using monkeys and three behavioral tasks requiring distinct cognitive processes (spatial working memory, SWM; working memory and long-term memory of objects, PA; object working memory, DMS) and manipulating task pair (SWM and PA or SWM and DMS), task order (fixed or randomized), and task difficulty (different delay lengths). The task introduced first showed better performance as compared with the task introduced second, suggesting the task order as an important factor. However, the performance of the SWM task decreased when preceded by the PA and DMS tasks, while the latter tasks were unaffected when the SWM task was introduced first. This tendency was more obvious in random-order conditions than fixed-order conditions. Further, interference effect increased as task difficulty increased. Although the task order is one determinant, our results show the difference in cognitive process needed for tasks, its complexity, and the demand of working memory resources as more significant determinants for deciding the dominant task in dual-task conditions, indicating importance of neural mechanisms including managing working memory resources and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to understand the cause of dual-task interference.</p>

                Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) is an exceptionally rare malignancy, often misdiagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to overlapping and non-specific clinical and radiological features. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been increasingly associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case of a 63-year-old male with chronic HCV infection and F2 hepatic fibrosis who presented with abdominal pain, pruritus, and weight loss. Radiological imaging revealed a pancreatic mass which was subsequently confirmed via histopathological examination to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Despite the initiation of antiviral therapy, the patient succumbed before starting chemotherapy. This case underscores the potential association between HCV infection and PPL, highlighting the importance of early antiviral treatment to prevent severe extrahepatic complications.

                Background During fixed appliance therapy, maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial; however, certain mouthwashes can negatively impact orthodontic treatment by altering the mechanical properties of archwires. The study investigated the impact of conventional mouthwashes on orthodontic archwires' Modulus of Elasticity (MoE). Methods It was an in vitro study that tested MoE of stainless steel (SS), nickel-titanium (NiTi), and β-titanium (β-Ti) archwires after immersing them in chlorhexidine (CHX), sodium fluoride (NaF), and HiORA mouthwashes along with distilled water (control) for one minute daily over three months. The wires were then subjected to a three-point bending test to measure their flexural modulus of elasticity (MoE) while applying loading and unloading forces at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm deflections. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc test at significant α≤0.05. Results NaF reduced MoE for SS (loading 172.99 ± 7.71 GPa, unloading 148.88 ± 14.65 GPa), NiTi (Loading: 48.42 ± 6.13 GPa, unloading 30.60 ± 4.29 GPa), β-Ti wires (unloading 79.51 ± 1.62 GPa) than Control (loading 185.35 ± 8.06 GPa, unloading 199.78 ± 9.49 GPa) with p<0.05. CHX mouthwash reduced SS (loading -158.58 ± 4.47 GPa, unloading-138.54 ± 6.12 GPa), NiTi (unloading 37.05 ± 2.58 GPa), β-Ti (unloading 81.58 ± 7.94 GPa) with p<0.05. HiORA showed no significant differences in MoE for SS (loading 190.28 ± 7.54 GPa, unloading 185.58 ± 5.35 GPa), NiTi (loading 58.85 ± 2.39, unloading 37.05 ± 2.58), or β-Ti archwire (loading 89.92 ± 2.20, unloading 104.22 ± 5.00) compared to the controls with p<0.05. Conclusion HiORA herbal mouthwash is safe for NiTi, SS, and β-Ti archwires at all stages. Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash should be prescribed briefly to prevent MoE degradation in NiTi and β-Ti archwires. NaF-based rinses should be cautiously used and monitored in SS, NiTi, and β-Ti archwires patients.

                Background Cognitive decline and dementia disproportionately affect Black/African populations in the United States, influenced by lifestyle, socioeconomic, and health disparities. This study examines the association between lifestyle factors and cognitive decline using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using NACC data on 24,476 Black/African adults. Key variables included age, sex, education, BMI, smoking status, alcohol use, mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, PTSD), and vascular health markers (hypertension, blood pressure). Multivariable regression models were used to assess the relationship between lifestyle factors and cognitive decline, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) sum scores. Results The study population had a mean age of 74.5 years, with 74.1% being female. Education levels varied, with 46.84% completing high school and 18.74% attaining a bachelor’s degree or higher. The mean BMI was 29.46 kg/m2, indicating a high prevalence of overweight and obesity, and 77.1% had hypertension, yet only 8.02% were on antihypertensive medication. MMSE scores declined significantly with increasing age (β = -0.09, p < 0.001) and higher depression scores (β = -0.27, p < 0.001), while higher education levels were associated with better cognitive performance (β = 0.42, p < 0.001). Obesity showed a non-linear association, with midlife obesity linked to higher dementia risk but late-life low BMI correlated with frailty and cognitive impairment. Hypertension and elevated systolic blood pressure were weak but significantly associated with cognitive decline (p < 0.001). Alcohol consumption (48.77%) and smoking (8%) had mixed effects, with heavy drinking negatively affecting cognition. Conclusion Modifiable risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, depression, and limited educational attainment, significantly influence cognitive outcomes in Black/African populations. Targeted public health interventions, improved healthcare access, and culturally tailored lifestyle modifications could mitigate cognitive decline and dementia risk in this population.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                <p>by Carla M. Kumbale, Qiang Zhang, Eberhard O. Voit</p>

Dioxins are persistent environmental pollutants known for their multiple health effects, from skin rashes to liver dysfunction, reproductive toxicity and cancer. While the hazards of dioxins have been well documented, the challenge of developing a comprehensive understanding of the overall health impact of dioxins remains. We propose to address this challenge with a new approach methodology (NAM) consisting of a novel adaptation of the Template-and-Anchor (T&A) modeling paradigm. Generically, the template model is defined as a high-level coarse-grained model capturing the main physiological processes of the system. The variables of this template model are anchor models, which represent component sub-systems in greater detail at lower biological levels. For the case of dioxin, we design the template to capture the systemic effects of dioxin on the body’s handling of cholesterol. Two new anchor models within this template elucidate the effects of dioxin on cholesterol transport in the bloodstream and on sex hormone steroidogenesis and the menstrual cycle. A third anchor model, representing dioxin-mediated effects on cholesterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway, had been developed previously. The T&A modeling paradigm enables a holistic evaluation of the impact of toxicants, which in the future may be translated into a powerful tool for comprehensive computational health risk assessments, personalized medicine, and the development of virtual clinical trials.

Aortic stenosis (AS) leads to alterations of supra-valvular flow patterns which can cause increased damage of red blood cell (RBC) membranes. We investigated these patient specific patterns of a severe AS patient and their reversal in healthy flow through a 4D Flow MRI-based CFD methodology. Computational models of subject-specific aortic geometries were created using in-vivo medical imaging data. Temporally and spatially resolved boundary conditions derived from 4D Flow MRI were implemented for an AS patient and a healthy subject. After validation of the in-silico results with in-vivo data, a healthy inflow profile was set for the AS patient in the CFD model. Pathological versus healthy flow fields were compared regarding their blood flow characteristics, i.e., shear stresses on RBCs and helicity. The accuracy of the 4D Flow MRI-based CFD model was proven with excellent agreement between in-vivo and in-silico velocity fields and R² = 0.9. A pathological high shear stress region in the bulk flow was present during late systole with an increase of 125% compared to both healthy flow. The physiological bihelical structure with predominantly right-handed helices vanished for the pathological state. Instead, a left-handed helix appeared, accompanied by an overall increase in turbulent kinetic energy in areas of accumulated left-handed helicity. The validated 4D Flow MRI-based CFD model identified marked differences between AS and healthy flow. It suggests that altered turbulent and helical structures in the bulk flow are the cause for increased, potentially damaging forces acting upon RBCs in AS.

                <p>by Manuel Delgado-Baquerizo, David J. Eldridge, Yu-Rong Liu, Zhong-Wen Liu, Claudia Coleine, Pankaj Trivedi</p>

Soil organisms represent the most abundant and diverse organisms on the planet and support almost every ecosystem function we know, and thus impact our daily lives. Some of these impacts have been well-documented, such as the role of soil organisms in regulating soil fertility and carbon sequestration; processes that have direct implications for essential ecosystem services including food security and climate change mitigation. Moreover, soil biodiversity also plays a critical role in supporting other aspects from One Health—the combined health of humans, animals, and the environment—to the conservation of historic structures such as monuments. Unfortunately, soil biodiversity is also highly vulnerable to a growing number of stressors associated with global environmental change. Understanding how and when soil biodiversity supports these functions, and how it will adapt to changing environmental conditions, is crucial for conserving soils and maintaining soil processes for future generations. In this Essay, we discuss the fundamental importance of soil biodiversity for supporting multiple ecosystem services and One Health, and further highlight essential knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to conserve soil biodiversity for the next generations.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27223?af=R">Dopamine Transporter Imaging as Objective Monitoring Biomarker in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging is a valuable diagnostic biomarker, few studies have investigated its utility in objectively monitoring disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no study has established a longitudinal relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom increase, potentially due to neglected factors such as brain regions, disease laterality, and symptom subtypes, which this study addresses.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study included participants who met the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for PD, with longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative Database. Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom severity increase over time. We hypothesized that a decline in putaminal DaT availability in the less affected hemisphere would be associated with increasing contralateral motor symptoms, measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Additional models explored the effects of different brain regions (caudate and putamen), symptom categories (MDS UPDRSIII score with and without tremor items), and disease onset laterality (left or right hemisphere).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 719 participants (443 male patients and 276 female patients; mean age = 62.2 ± 9.5 years) with 1,981 available data points. As hypothesized, we observed a significant association between the decrease in the less affected putaminal DaT signal and motor symptom increase in the contralateral body side, independent of including or excluding tremor scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings support the use of repetitive DaT imaging for objectively monitoring PD progression. This could facilitate personalized disease tracking, subtyping, and intervention testing in the future. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="Evidence for Auditory Stimulus-Specific Adaptation But Not Deviance Detection in Larval Zebrafish Brains"/>
<p>The mismatch negativity response is brain activity following an unexpected auditory stimulus in humans. We used whole-brain calcium imaging to characterize auditory responses to unexpected sounds in larval zebrafish. Auditory neuron responses decrease after repetition of specific frequencies without generalization between frequencies, evidence of stimulus-specific adaptation. However, we did not find evidence for deviance responses to unexpected sounds within a sequence or to the unexpected omission of sounds from a sequence.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals receive a constant stream of sensory input, and detecting changes in this sensory landscape is critical to their survival. One signature of change detection in humans is the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), a neural response to unexpected stimuli that deviate from a predictable sequence. This process requires the auditory system to adapt to specific repeated stimuli while remaining sensitive to novel input (stimulus-specific adaptation [SSA]). MMN was originally described in humans, and equivalent responses have been found in other mammals and birds, but it is not known to what extent this deviance detection circuitry is evolutionarily conserved. Here we present the first evidence for SSA in the brain of a teleost fish, using whole-brain calcium imaging of larval zebrafish at single-neuron resolution with selective plane illumination microscopy. We found frequency-specific responses across the brain with variable response amplitudes for frequencies of the same volume and created a loudness curve to model this effect. We presented an auditory “oddball” stimulus in an otherwise predictable train of pure tone stimuli and did not find a population of neurons with specific responses to deviant tones that were not otherwise explained by SSA. Further, we observed no deviance responses to an unexpected omission of a sound in a repetitive sequence of white noise bursts. These findings extend the known scope of auditory adaptation and deviance responses across the evolutionary tree and lay groundwork for future studies to describe the circuitry underlying auditory adaptation at the level of individual neurons.</p>

                The human brain is characterized by impressive cognitive abilities. The neocortex is the seat of higher cognition, and neocortex expansion is a hallmark of human evolution. While developmental programs are similar in different species, the timing of developmental transitions and the capacity of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to proliferate differ, contributing to the increased production of neurons during human cortical development. Here, we review the epigenetic regulation of developmental transitions during corticogenesis, focusing mostly on humans while building on knowledge from studies in mice. We discuss metabolic-epigenetic interplay as a potential mechanism to integrate extracellular signals into neural chromatin. Moreover, we synthesize current understanding of how epigenetic and metabolic deregulation can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Finally, we outline how developmental timing can be investigated using brain organoid models.

                Oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs), comprising oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes, are pivotal in sculpting central nervous system (CNS) architecture and function. OPCs mature into oligodendrocytes, which enwrap axons with myelin sheaths that are critical for enhancing neural transmission. Notably, OLCs actively respond to neuronal activity, modulating neural circuit functions. Understanding neuron–OLC interactions is key to unraveling how OLCs contribute to CNS health and pathology. This review highlights insights from zebrafish and mouse models, revealing how synaptic and extrasynaptic pathways converge to shape spatiotemporal calcium (Ca2+) dynamics within OLCs. We explore how Ca2+ signal integration across spatial and temporal scales acts as a master regulator of OLC fate determination and myelin plasticity.

                Spontaneous pain, characterized by episodic shooting or stabbing sensations, is a significant complaint among neuropathic pain patients but remains poorly understood. Xie et al. provide evidence that triggers of spontaneous pain and clustered firings are dynamic movements of blood vessels in the sensory ganglion, detected by Piezo2 receptors in adjacent neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99217">CDK-mediated phosphorylation of PNKP is required for end-processing of single-strand DNA gaps on Okazaki fragments and genome stability</a></h4>

              
                Polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) has enzymatic activities as 3′-phosphatase and 5′-kinase of DNA ends to promote DNA ligation and repair. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate the phosphorylation of threonine 118 (T118) in PNKP. This phosphorylation allows recruitment to the gapped DNA structure found in single-strand DNA (ssDNA) nicks and/or gaps between Okazaki fragments (OFs) during DNA replication. T118A (alanine)-substituted PNKP-expressing cells exhibited an accumulation of ssDNA gaps in S phase and accelerated replication fork progression. Furthermore, PNKP is involved in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent replication gap filling as part of a backup pathway in the absence of OFs ligation. Altogether, our data suggest that CDK-mediated PNKP phosphorylation at T118 is important for its recruitment to ssDNA gaps to proceed with OFs ligation and its backup repairs via the gap-filling pathway to maintain genome stability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100350">Deficiency in DNAH12 causes male infertility by impairing DNAH1 and DNALI1 recruitment in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Asthenoteratozoospermia, a prevalent cause of male infertility, lacks a well-defined etiology. DNAH12 is a special dynein featured by the absence of a microtubule-binding domain, however, its functions in spermatogenesis remain largely unknown. Through comprehensive genetic analyses involving whole-exome sequencing and subsequent Sanger sequencing on infertile patients and fertile controls from six distinct families, we unveiled six biallelic mutations in <i>DNAH12</i> that co-segregate recessively with male infertility in the studied families. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed pronounced axonemal abnormalities, including inner dynein arms (IDAs) impairment and central pair (CP) loss in sperm flagella of the patients. Mouse models (<i>Dnah12</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></i>) were generated and recapitulated the reproductive defects in the patients. Noteworthy, DNAH12 deficiency did not show effects on cilium organization and function. Mechanistically, DNAH12 was confirmed to interact with two other IDA components DNALI1 and DNAH1, while disruption of DNAH12 leads to failed recruitment of DNALI1 and DNAH1 to IDAs and compromised sperm development. Furthermore, DNAH12 also interacts with radial spoke head proteins RSPH1, RSPH9, and DNAJB13 to regulate CP stability. Moreover, the infertility of <i>Dnah12</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice could be overcome by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Collectively, DNAH12 plays a crucial role in the proper organization of axoneme in sperm flagella, but not cilia, by recruiting DNAH1 and DNALI1 in both humans and mice. These findings expand our comprehension of dynein component assembly in flagella and cilia and provide a valuable marker for genetic counseling and diagnosis of asthenoteratozoospermia in clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105802">Transcriptome profiling of tendon fibroblasts at the onset of embryonic muscle contraction reveals novel force-responsive genes</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical forces play a critical role in tendon development and function, influencing cell behavior through mechanotransduction signaling pathways and subsequent extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which tenocytes in developing zebrafish embryos respond to muscle contraction forces during the onset of swimming and cranial muscle activity. Using genome-wide bulk RNA sequencing of FAC-sorted tenocytes we identify novel tenocyte markers and genes involved in tendon mechanotransduction. Embryonic tendons show dramatic changes in expression of <i>matrix remodeling associated 5b</i> (<i>mxra5b</i>), <i>matrilin1</i> (<i>matn1</i>), and the transcription factor <i>kruppel-like factor 2a</i> (<i>klf2a</i>), as muscles start to contract. Using embryos paralyzed either by loss of muscle contractility or neuromuscular stimulation we confirm that muscle contractile forces influence the spatial and temporal expression patterns of all three genes. Quantification of these gene expression changes across tenocytes at multiple tendon entheses and myotendinous junctions reveals that their responses depend on force intensity, duration and tissue stiffness. These force-dependent feedback mechanisms in tendons, particularly in the ECM, have important implications for improved treatments of tendon injuries and atrophy.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The impact of excessive cognitive workload on personal work and life is widely recognized, yet the brain information processing mechanisms under cognitive overload remain unclear. This study employed a spatial configuration task, combined with time-varying brain network analysis and source localization techniques based on electroencephalography signals, to delve into the dynamic adjustment processes of the brain among healthy participants during cognitive overload. The results revealed that under cognitive overload, the overall activation level of the brain significantly decreases, with characteristics of delayed responses. Further analysis indicated that under overload, the brain network connectivity in the right hemisphere brain networks closely associated with spatial object recognition and localization was weakened. In contrast, the brain network connections between the left hemisphere are enhanced. These changes suggest that during cognitive overload, the brain prioritizes resource allocation to support spatial memory functions, which might lead to restricted resources for subsequent spatial information processing. Notably, the significant differences in brain network connectivity observed in the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus make them important potential markers for identifying cognitive overload states during spatial configuration tasks. This study provides a fresh perspective and scientific foundation for understanding the impact of cognitive overload on work performance.</span>

                <p>Sensory perception relies on the flexible detection and interpretation of stimuli across variable contexts, conditions, and behavioral states. The basal forebrain (BF) is a hub for behavioral state regulation, supplying dense cholinergic and GABAergic projections to various brain regions involved in sensory processing. Of GABAergic neurons in the BF, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) subtypes serve opposing roles toward regulating behavioral states. To elucidate the role of BF circuits in sensory-guided behavior, we investigated GABAergic signaling dynamics during odor-guided decision-making in male and female mice. We used fiber photometry to record cell type-specific BF activity during an odor discrimination task and correlated temporal patterns of PV and SST neuronal activity with olfactory task performance. We found that while both PV-expressing and SST-expressing GABAergic neurons were excited during trial initiation, PV neurons were selectively suppressed by reward, whereas SST neurons were excited. Notably, chemogenetic inhibition of BF SST neurons modestly altered decision bias to favor reward seeking, while optogenetic inhibition of BF PV neurons during odor presentations improved discrimination accuracy. Together, these results suggest that the bidirectional activity of GABAergic BF neuron subtypes distinctly influence perception and decision-making during olfactory-guided behavior.</p>

                <p>We previously reported that ventral subiculum (vSub) activity is critical to incubation of oxycodone seeking after abstinence induced by adverse consequences of drug seeking. Here, we studied the role of claustrum, a key vSub input, in this incubation. We trained male and female rats to self-administer oxycodone for 2&nbsp;weeks and then induced abstinence by exposing them to an electric barrier for 2&nbsp;weeks. We used retrograde tracing (cholera toxin B subunit) plus the activity marker Fos to identify projections to vSub cactivated during "incubated" relapse (Abstinence Day 15). We then used pharmacological reversible inactivation to determine the causal role of claustrum in incubation and the behavioral and anatomical specificity of this role. We also used an anatomical disconnection procedure to determine the causal role of claustrum&ndash;vSub connections in incubation. Finally, we analyzed an existing functional MRI dataset to determine if functional connectivity changes in claustrum-related circuits predict incubation of oxycodone seeking. Claustrum neurons projecting to vSub were activated during relapse tests after electric barrier-induced abstinence. Inactivation of claustrum but not areas dorsolateral to claustrum decreased incubation of oxycodone seeking after electric barrier-induced abstinence; claustrum inactivation had no effect on incubation after food choice-induced abstinence. Both ipsilateral and contralateral inactivation of claustrum&ndash;vSub projections decreased incubation after electric barrier-induced abstinence.

                <p>Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ is a transient developmental structure in the mouse cochlea that undergoes significant remodeling postnatally. Utilizing an epithelial-specific conditional deletion mouse model of <I>Prdm16</I> (marker and regulator of Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ), we show that <I>Prdm16</I> is required for interdental cell development, and thereby the development of the limbal domain of the tectorial membrane and its medial anchorage to the spiral limbus. Additionally, we show that Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ is involved in normal tectorial membrane collagen fibril development and maturation. Interestingly, mesenchymal cells of the spiral limbus underneath <I>Prdm16</I>-deficient Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ failed to produce interstitial matrix proteins, resulting in a hypoplastic and truncated spiral limbus, indicating a non-cell autonomous role of <I>Prdm16</I> in regulating spiral mesenchymal matrix development. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes in <I>Prdm16</I>-deficient Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ suggesting a role for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) downstream <I>Prdm16</I> in epithelial-mesenchymal signaling involved in spiral limbus matrix deposition. <I>Prdm16</I>-deficient mice showed a hearing deficit, as indicated by elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds at most frequencies, consistent with the cochlear structural defects. Both sexes were studied. This work establishes <I>Prdm16</I> as a deafness gene in mice through its role in regulating Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ development. Such understanding recognizes Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ as a developmental hub regulating multiple surrounding cochlear structures.</p>

                <p>Inhibition of GABAergic interneurons has been found to critically fine-tune the excitation&ndash;inhibition balance of the cortex. Inhibition is mediated by many connectivity motifs formed by GABAergic neurons. One such motif is the inhibition of somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons. We studied the synaptic properties of layer (L) 2/3 VIP cells onto L4 SST cells in somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) cortices of mice of either sex using paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, followed by morphological reconstructions. We identified strong differences in the morphological features of L4 SST cells, wherein cells in S1 fell into the non-Martinotti cell (nMC) subclass, while in V1 presented with Martinotti cell (MC)-like features. Approximately 40&ndash;45% of tested SST cells were inhibited by VIP cells in both cortices. While unitary connectivity properties of the VIP-to-nMC and VIP-to-MC motifs were comparable, we observed stark differences in short-term plasticity. During high-frequency stimulation of both motifs, some connections showed short-term facilitation while others showed a stable response, with a fraction of VIP-to-nMC connections showing short-term depression. We thus provide evidence that VIP cells target morphological subclasses of SST cells differentially, forming cell-type&ndash;specific inhibitory motifs.</p>

                <p>Neurodegenerative diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous system are characterized by selective neuronal vulnerability, i.e., pathology that affects particular types of neurons. While much of this cell type selectivity may be driven by intrinsic differences among the neuron subpopulations, neuron-extrinsic mechanisms such as the selective malfunction of glial support cells may also play a role. Recently, we identified a population of Schwann cells (SCs) expressing <I>Adamtsl1</I>, <I>Cldn14</I>, and <I>Pmp2</I> (a.k.a. PMP2+ SCs) that preferentially myelinate large-caliber motor axons. PMP2+ SCs are decreased in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mice and ALS patient nerves. Thus, PMP2+ SC dysfunction could contribute to motor-selective neuropathies. We engineered a tamoxifen-inducible Pmp2-CreERT2 mouse and expressed diphtheria toxin in PMP2+ SCs to assess the consequences of ablating this SC subtype in male and female mice. Loss of PMP2+ SCs led to significant loss of large-caliber motor axons with concomitant behavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural defects. Subsequent withdrawal of tamoxifen restored both PMP2+ SCs and large-caliber motor axons and improved behavioral and electrophysiological readouts. Together, our findings highlight that the survival of large-caliber motor axons relies on PMP2+ SCs, demonstrating that malfunction of a specific SC subtype can lead to selective neuronal vulnerability.</p>

                <p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is crucial in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by triggering cellular apoptosis and exacerbating neuronal damage. This study elucidates the dynamics of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) translocation and its role in regulating neural fate during cerebral ischemia-induced ER stress, specifically in male mice. We found enhanced nuclear localization of TIGAR in neurons after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (tMCAO/R) in male mice, as well as oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) and treatment with ER stress inducer (tunicamycin and thapsigargin) in neuronal cells. Conditional neuronal knockdown of <I>Tigar</I> aggravated the injury following ischemia-reperfusion, whereas overexpression of <I>Tigar</I> attenuated cerebral ischemic injury and ameliorated intraneuronal ER stress. Additionally, TIGAR overexpression reduced the elevation of ATF4 target genes and attenuated ER stress-induced cell death. Notably, TIGAR colocalized and interacted with ATF4 in the nucleus, inhibiting its downstream proapoptotic gene transcription, consequently protecting against ischemic injury. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that ATF4 overexpression reversed the protective effects of TIGAR against cerebral ischemic injury. Intriguingly, our study identified the Q141/K145 residues of TIGAR, crucial for its nuclear translocation and interaction with ATF4, highlighting a novel aspect of TIGAR's function distinct from its known phosphatase activity or mitochondrial localization domains. These findings reveal a novel neuroprotective mechanism of TIGAR in regulating ER stress through ATF4-mediated signaling pathways. These insights may guide targeted therapeutic strategies to protect neuronal function and alleviate the deleterious effects of cerebral ischemic injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/13/e1537242025?rss=1">Common and Unique Neurophysiological Processes That Support the Stopping and Revising of Actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inhibitory control is a crucial cognitive-control ability for behavioral flexibility, which has been extensively investigated through action-stopping tasks. Multiple neurophysiological features have been proposed as "signatures" of inhibitory control during action-stopping, though the processes indexed by these signatures are still controversially discussed. The present study aimed to disentangle these processes by comparing simple stopping situations with those in which additional action revisions were needed. Three experiments in female and male humans were performed to characterize the neurophysiological dynamics involved in action-stopping and action-changing, with hypotheses derived from recently developed two-stage "pause-then-cancel" models of inhibitory control. Both stopping and revising an action triggered an early, broad "pause"-process, marked by frontal EEG &beta;-frequency bursting and nonselective suppression of corticospinal excitability. However, EMG showed that motor activity was only partially inhibited by this "pause" and that this activity could be modulated during action revision. In line with two-stage models of inhibitory control, subsequent frontocentral EEG activity after this initial "pause" selectively scaled depending on the required action revisions, with more activity observed for more complex revisions. This demonstrates the presence of a selective, effector-specific "retune" phase as the second process involved in action-stopping and action revision. Together, these findings show that inhibitory control is implemented over an extended period of time and in at least two phases. We are further able to align the most commonly proposed neurophysiological signatures to these phases and show that they are differentially modulated by the complexity of action revision.</p>

                <p>Opioid use disorder constitutes a major health and economic burden, but our limited understanding of the underlying neurobiology impedes better interventions. Alteration in the activity and output of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contributes to drug effects, but the mechanisms underlying these changes remain relatively unexplored. We used translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA sequencing to identify gene expression changes in mouse VTA DA neurons following chronic morphine exposure. We found that expression of the neuropeptide neuromedin S (NMS) is robustly increased in VTA DA neurons by morphine. Using an NMS-iCre driver line, we confirmed that a subset of VTA neurons express NMS and that chemogenetic modulation of VTA NMS neuron activity altered morphine responses in male and female mice. Specifically, VTA NMS neuronal activation promoted morphine locomotor activity while inhibition reduced morphine locomotor activity and conditioned place preference. Interestingly, these effects appear specific to morphine, as modulation of VTA NMS activity did not affect cocaine behaviors, consistent with our data that cocaine administration does not increase VTA <I>Nms</I> expression. Chemogenetic manipulation of VTA neurons that express glucagon-like peptide, a transcript also robustly increased in VTA DA neurons by morphine, does not alter morphine-elicited behavior, further highlighting the functional relevance of VTA NMS-expressing neurons. Together, our current data suggest that NMS-expressing neurons represent a novel subset of VTA neurons that may be functionally relevant for morphine responses and support the utility of cell-type&ndash;specific analyses like TRAP to identify neuronal adaptations underlying substance use disorder.</p>

                <p>A dynamic interplay between fast synaptic signals and slower neuromodulatory signals controls the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance within neuronal circuits. The mechanisms by which neuropeptide signaling is regulated to maintain E/I balance remain uncertain. We designed a genetic screen to isolate genes involved in the peptidergic maintenance of the E/I balance in the <I>C. elegans</I> motor circuit. This screen identified the <I>C. elegans</I> orthologs of the presynaptic phosphoprotein synapsin (<I>snn-1</I>) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit PHACTR1 (<I>phac-1</I>). We demonstrate that both <I>phac-1</I> and <I>snn-1</I> alter the motor behavior of <I>C. elegans</I>, and genetic interactions suggest that SNN-1 contributes to PP1-PHAC-1 holoenzyme signaling. De novo variants of human PHACTR1, associated with early-onset epilepsies [developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 70 (DEE70)], when expressed in <I>C. elegans</I> resulted in constitutive PP1-PHAC-1 holoenzyme activity. Unregulated PP1-PHAC-1 signaling alters the synapsin and actin cytoskeleton and increases neuropeptide release by cholinergic motor neurons, which secondarily affects the presynaptic vesicle cycle. Together, these results clarify the dominant mechanisms of action of the DEE70 alleles and suggest that altered neuropeptide release may alter E/I balance in DEE70.</p>

                <p>Multiple studies suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with changes in neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit. There are limited electrophysiological data, however, describing how parkinsonism impacts neuronal activity in the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), an area in the medial frontal cortex involved in movement planning and motor control. In this study, single unit activity was recorded in the pre-SMA of two female nonhuman primates during a visually cued reaching task in both the naive and parkinsonian state using the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of parkinsonism. In the naive state, neuronal discharge rates were dynamically modulated prior to the presentation of the instructional go-cue. In a subset of these modulated cells, the magnitude of modulation correlated linearly with reaction time (RT). In the parkinsonian state, however, modulation of discharge rates in the pre-SMA was disrupted, and the predictive encoding of RT was significantly diminished. These findings add to our understanding of the role of pre-SMA in motor behavior and suggest that disrupted encoding in this cortical region contributes to the alteration of early preparatory and premovement processes present in Parkinson's disease.</p>

                <p>Dopaminergic brain areas are crucial for cognition and their dysregulation is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders typically treated with pharmacological interventions. These treatments often have side effects and variable effectiveness, underscoring the need for alternatives. We introduce the first demonstration of neurofeedback using local field potentials (LFP) from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This approach leverages the real-time temporal resolution of LFP and ability to target deep brain. In our study, two male rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) learned to regulate VTA beta power using a customized normalized metric to stably quantify VTA LFP signal modulation. The subjects demonstrated flexible and specific control with different strategies for specific frequency bands, revealing new insights into the plasticity of VTA neurons contributing to oscillatory activity that is functionally relevant to many aspects of cognition. Excitingly, the subjects showed transferable patterns, a key criterion for clinical applications beyond training settings. This work provides a foundation for neurofeedback-based treatments, which may be a promising alternative to conventional approaches and open new avenues for understanding and managing neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>Voltage-gated potassium conductances <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> play a critical role not only in normal neural function, but also in many neurological disorders and related therapeutic interventions. In particular, in an important animal model of epileptic seizures, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) administration is thought to induce seizures by reducing <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> in cortex and other brain areas. Interestingly, 4-AP has also been useful in the treatment of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, where it is thought to improve action potential propagation in axonal fibers. Here, we examined <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> downmodulation in biophysical models of cortical networks that included different neuron types organized in layers, potassium diffusion in interstitial and larger extracellular spaces, and glial buffering. Our findings are fourfold. First, <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> downmodulation in pyramidal and fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons led to differential effects, making the latter much more likely to enter depolarization block. Second, both neuron types showed an increase in the duration and amplitude of action potentials, with more pronounced effects in pyramidal neurons. Third, a sufficiently strong <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> reduction dramatically increased network synchrony, resulting in seizure-like dynamics. Fourth, we hypothesized that broader action potentials were likely to not only improve their propagation, as in 4-AP therapeutic uses, but also to increase synaptic coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/13/e1923242025?rss=1">Contribution of Rat Insular Cortex to Stimulus-Guided Action</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anticipating rewards is fundamental for decision-making. Animals often use cues to assess reward availability and to make predictions about future outcomes. The gustatory region of the insular cortex (IC), the so-called gustatory cortex, has a well-established role in the representation of predictive cues, such that IC neurons encode both a general form of outcome expectation and anticipatory outcome-specific knowledge. Here, we used pavlovian&ndash;instrumental transfer (PIT) in male rats to assess if the IC is also required for predictive cues to exert both a general and specific influence over instrumental actions. Chemogenetic inhibition of IC impaired the ability of a reward-predictive stimulus to energize instrumental responding for reward. This deficit in general transfer was evident whether the same or different outcomes were used in the pavlovian and instrumental conditioning phases. We observed a similar deficit in specific PIT, such that rats with IC inhibition failed to use a reward-predictive stimulus to guide choice toward actions that deliver the same food reward. Finally, we show that rats with IC inhibition also fail to show outcome-selective reinstatement. Together, these data suggest a crucial role for IC in the representation of appetitive outcomes and particularly in using this representation to guide instrumental action.</p>

                <p>Synaptically released zinc is a neuronal signaling system that arises from the actions of the presynaptic vesicular zinc transporter protein zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3). Mechanisms that regulate the actions of zinc at synapses are of great importance for many aspects of synaptic signaling in the brain. Here, we identify the astrocytic zinc transporter protein ZIP12 as a candidate mechanism that contributes to zinc clearance at cortical synapses. We identify small-molecule compounds that antagonize the function of ZIP12 in heterologous expression systems, and we use one of these compounds, ZIP12 modulator 8, to increase the concentration of ZnT3-dependent zinc at synapses in the brain of male and female mice to inhibit the activity of neuronal AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors. These results identify a cellular mechanism and provide a pharmacological toolbox to target the molecular machinery that supports the actions of synaptic zinc in the brain.</p>

                <p>Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels of the Kv2 family are highly expressed in brain and play dual roles in regulating neuronal excitability and in organizing endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions. Studies in heterologous cells suggest that Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 co-assemble with "electrically silent" KvS subunits to form heterotetrameric channels with distinct biophysical properties, but the prevalence and localization of these channels in native neurons are unknown. Here, using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified five KvS subunits as components of native Kv2.1 channels immunopurified from mouse brain of both sexes, the most abundant being Kv5.1. We found that Kv5.1 co-immunoprecipitates with Kv2.1 and to a lesser extent with Kv2.2 from brain lysates and that Kv5.1 protein levels are decreased by 70% in Kv2.1 knock-out mice and 95% in Kv2.1/Kv2.2 double knock-out mice. RNAscope and immunolabeling revealed that Kv5.1 is prominently expressed in neocortex, where it is detected in a substantial fraction of Kv2.1/Kv2.2 positive neurons in layers 2/3, 5, and 6. At the subcellular level, Kv5.1 protein is coclustered with Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 at presumptive ER-PM junctions on the soma and proximal dendrites of cortical neurons. Moreover, in addition to modifying channel conductance, we found that Kv2/Kv5.1 channels are less phosphorylated and insensitive to RY785, a potent and selective Kv2 channel inhibitor. Together, these findings demonstrate that KvS subunits create multiple Kv2 channel subtypes in brain. Most notably, Kv2/Kv5.1 channels are highly expressed in cortical neurons, where their unique properties likely modulate the critical conducting and nonconducting roles of Kv2 channels.</p>

                Background Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases worldwide. One of the most common therapy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), has a high failure rate. The failure rate can be significantly reduced by identifying the candidates most likely to benefit from ESWL, for example, by using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Decision tree analysis (DTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) represent a few of the machine learning approaches employed to forecast the stone-free outcome following ESWL. Methods 219 studies were searched through six electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, Proquest, SCOPUS). We employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and adhered to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD). To evaluate the potential bias in all the studies, we utilized the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Results 41,484 patients from 11 studies were included. The ML models highlight varying levels of diagnostic precision, with sensitivity spanning from 35-96%, and specificity ranging from 63-98.4%, and area under the curve falling between 0.49-0.96. It is shown in this study that the accuracy of RF and DTA in predicting stone-free status is superior than ANN. Conclusion ML is a comparable predictive method to statistical analysis in predicting stone-free status. Random forest method and DTA are superior MLs compared to ANN. Stone size, density, and 3D texture analysis are the most important variables to be considered in the ML models and should be included in the models to ensure accuracy of stone-free status prediction.

                Parenting a preterm infant is highly challenging, considering the need to care for the infant in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The parents or caregivers spend approximately 22.3 hours per day in the NICU caring for the infant through involvement in various activities not limited to feeding, medication administration, and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC). These activities simultaneously involve the infant and the parent or caregiver, termed co-occupation. These co-occupation activities benefit the infants and parent dyads. The study aims to identify the existing literature that discusses occupational therapy interventions that promote or support co-occupation among infants and parents or caregivers. The scoping review will use the framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, adhering to PRISMA for scoping review guidelines. The Person- Environment -Occupation (PEO) Model will also be used to report the results. The study will include searches across multiple databases and reference lists of relevant articles. The findings from this study may identify the gaps in occupational therapy practice in NICU from the perspective of co-occupations and the associated interventions provided. Further, these insights may help future studies explore strategies to enhance co-occupation, improving the outcomes for infants and parents or caregivers.

                Background The triple planetary crisis of climate change, environmental pollution, and biodiversity loss is increasingly driving poor health outcomes worldwide. Healthcare systems and services are often not environmentally sustainable and compound the problem, while healthcare professionals are also recognised as key leaders in advancing sustainable healthcare. To adopt this leadership position, healthcare professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding environmental sustainability in healthcare must be established. This article reports the development and validation of a new instrument for this purpose that corresponds to the specificities of the Southern African context. Methods Questionnaire development followed a seven-stage process. Information was obtained from a 2021 study titled ‘South African Healthcare Professionals’ Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare: A Mixed-Methods Study’ to develop the instrument. Information was also sourced from the literature regarding environmental sustainability and healthcare to generate the first questionnaire with 29 items. The following stages included two rounds of expert input, separated by a pilot study with the target population to receive feedback regarding the instrument’s structure, relevance, and length. Content validity was determined through statistical analysis. Results Feedback was received from nine experts in stage two and 13 pilot-study participants in stage four and incorporated to improve the questionnaire. In stage six, the questionnaire was rated by seven experts. The content validity index of the questionnaire was calculated at two different stages, after which the indices were compared. Following a final edit, the questionnaire has 24 questionnaire items. The closing analysis calculated the scale content validity index average (S-CVI/Ave) of 0,922; this indicates that the final questionnaire has excellent content validity. Conclusion A questionnaire that assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals regarding environmental sustainability in Southern Africa has been developed and validated. This questionnaire can now be used for further studies in Southern Africa.

                Background The neglect of visual identity (VI) at the organizational level within higher education institutions (HEIs) has become a critical issue, while previous studies over the past decade has focused on HEI branding and reputation. This creates a potential gap in understanding HEI branding processes. Thus, this study aims to explore the relationship between VI and HEI reputation by integrating the Expressiveness Quotient (EQ) and experiential brand meaning at the organizational level. Method Using a qualitative case study approach, the study involves semi-structured interviews with 29 employees from five top-ranked universities in Indonesia. Furthermore, it analyzes the integration of experiential brand meaning across the stages of awareness, interpretation, appropriation, and communication, alongside the EQ framework to assess how visual identity impacts visibility, distinctiveness, transparency, authenticity, and consistency. Result The findings indicate that visual identity significantly influences perceptions of institutional identity and reputation. Effective management of visual identity elements enhances competitive advantage in academia and aligns internal stakeholder perceptions with external branding, which is essential for a cohesive organizational identity. Conclusion This study emphasizes the strategic importance of visual identity in enhancing institutional reputation and provides a model for universities aiming to strengthen their reputational power through effective visual identity management. The study also reveals strong awareness and acceptance of brand identity.

                <p>by Joseph D. Jones, Brandon L. Holder, Andrew C. Montgomery, Chloe V. McAdams, Emily He, Anna E. Burns, Kiran R. Eiken, Alex Vogt, Adriana I. Velarde, Alexandra J. Elder, Jennifer A. McEllin, Stephane Dissel</p>

Sleep is a behavior that is conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Yet, despite extensive studies in humans and animal models, the exact function or functions of sleep remain(s) unknown. A complicating factor in trying to elucidate the function of sleep is the complexity and multiplicity of neuronal circuits that are involved in sleep regulation. It is conceivable that distinct sleep-regulating circuits are only involved in specific aspects of sleep and may underlie different sleep functions. Thus, it would be beneficial to assess the contribution of individual circuits in sleep’s putative functions. The intricacy of the mammalian brain makes this task extremely difficult. However, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster,</i> with its simpler brain organization, available connectomics, and unparalleled genetics, offers the opportunity to interrogate individual sleep-regulating centers. In <i>Drosophila</i>, neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) have been proposed to be key regulators of sleep, particularly sleep homeostasis. We recently demonstrated that the most widely used genetic tool to manipulate dFB neurons, the 23E10-GAL4 driver, expresses in 2 sleep-regulating neurons (VNC-SP neurons) located in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), the fly analog of the vertebrate spinal cord. Since most data supporting a role for the dFB in sleep regulation have been obtained using 23E10-GAL4, it is unclear whether the sleep phenotypes reported in these studies are caused by dFB neurons or VNC-SP cells. A recent publication replicated our finding that 23E10-GAL4 contains sleep-promoting neurons in the VNC. However, it also proposed that the dFB is not involved in sleep regulation at all, but this suggestion was made using genetic tools that are not dFB-specific and a very mild sleep deprivation protocol. In this study, using a newly created dFB-specific genetic driver line, we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of the majority of 23E10-GAL4 dFB neurons promotes sleep and that these neurons are involved in sleep homeostasis. We also show that dFB neurons require stronger stimulation than VNC-SP cells to promote sleep. In addition, we demonstrate that dFB-induced sleep can consolidate short-term memory (STM) into long-term memory (LTM), suggesting that the benefit of sleep on memory is not circuit-specific. Finally, we show that dFB neurons are neurochemically heterogeneous and can be divided in 3 populations. Most dFB neurons express both glutamate and acetylcholine, while a minority of cells expresses only one of these 2 neurotransmitters. Importantly, dFB neurons do not express GABA, as previously suggested. Using neurotransmitter-specific dFB tools, our data also points at cholinergic dFB neurons as particularly potent at regulating sleep and sleep homeostasis.

<p>This final part 3 review builds on the practical applications discussed in part 2 and explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming data management, neurological education, and neurological care across large healthcare networks and datasets. The review also highlights AI's role in real-world and synthetic data, digital twins, and innovative clinical trial designs, such as in silico and adaptive trials. The review emphasizes AI's ability to drive continuous improvements in care and discovery through comparative effectiveness research and learning health systems. The global healthcare implications discussed here tie back to earlier discussions on human-AI collaboration and precision care, underscoring the neurological sciences' responsibility to adopt AI advances judiciously, while managing their ethical, economic, and environmental impacts.

                Background and Objective Peripheral nerve blocks can induce vasodilation, benefiting patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). However, the comparative vasodilatory effects of femoropopliteal versus neuraxial blocks remain unclear. This pilot study aimed to evaluate these effects by measuring changes in tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) using noninvasive NIRS. Method This study was a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital from July to November 2024 of patients with PAD who underwent lower limb surgeries. Subjects were randomly assigned to either group F (Femoropopliteal block) or group S (Subarachnoid block). StO2 was measured at baseline (pre-block) also 5, 15, and 30 minutes after block using NIRS. The main outcome is the delta increase in the StO2 in each time point between groups. The difference was analyzed with General Linear Model (GLM) with post-hoc Bonferroni correction. Results A total of 16 patients took part in the study (8 in group F and 8 in group S), with a total of 24 observations (12 group F and 12 group S). Increased of StO2 was noticed as early as 5 minutes with mean delta StO2 of 1.4 ± 1.5 for the F group and 5.3 ± 5.2 for the S group (p=0.02). At minute 15, the values were 2.4 ± 1.2 for the F group and 6.6 ± 5.4 for the S group (p=0.02). At minute 30, the values were 2.9 ± 1.7 for the F group and 6.2 ± 4.4 for the S group (p=0.12). Conclusion Compared to subarachnoid block, increase of StO2 hence the vasodilatory effect of femoropopliteal block is modest. Clinical Trial Number The clinical trial number is NCT06702202

                Caccavano et al. examine opioid-mediated suppression of inhibition across cortical regions, species, and development. They report divergence in opioid-mediated disinhibitory motifs between hippocampus and neocortex. This regionally specialized opioid disinhibition is evolutionarily conserved, established in early post-natal development, and regulates immature hippocampal population activity.

                Wang et al. profile the brain’s metabolic uptake and release by comparing blood samples from the cerebral venous sinus and femoral artery. The study identifies key metabolites and lipids consumed or released by the brain. It also highlights age-related changes in metabolic processes.

                The success of many modern machine-learning systems rests on a computational mechanism known as key-value memory. Gershman et al. connect this mechanism to existing ideas about memory in the brain, indicating convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.

                FANCA is a DNA repair gene that plays a tumor-suppressor role by maintaining genome stability in normal cells. Luo et al. report that instead of being a tumor suppressor, WT-FANCA demonstrates oncogenic properties in breast cancer by promoting cell proliferation, and it is targetable for breast cancer intervention.

                Fidelito et al. conducted lipid-metabolism-focused CRISPR screens and identified the dependency of prostate cancer on enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway. Further validation identified NUS1 as a dependency of prostate cancer cell lines, xenografts, and PDX-derived organoids.

                Wilson et al. develop a model of presynaptic spontaneous release rate based on the entropic force generated by the density of the recycling pool. They support this model experimentally using multiple approaches. They then use this model to show how β-amyloid mutations lead to an increasing spontaneous release rate.
