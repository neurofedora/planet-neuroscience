              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14806">Place Cells as Position Embeddings of Multi-Time Random Walk Transition Kernels for Path Planning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hippocampus orchestrates spatial navigation through collective place cell encodings that form cognitive maps. We reconceptualize the population of place cells as position embeddings approximating multi-scale symmetric random walk transition kernels: the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle = q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, where $h(x, t)$ is the embedding at location $ x $, and $q(y|x, t)$ is the normalized symmetric transition probability over time $t$. The time parameter $\sqrt{t}$ defines a spatial scale hierarchy, mirroring the hippocampal dorsoventral axis. $q(y|x, t)$ defines spatial adjacency between $x$ and $y$ at scale or resolution $\sqrt{t}$, and the pairwise adjacency relationships $(q(y|x, t), \forall x, y)$ are reduced into individual embeddings $(h(x, t), \forall x)$ that collectively form a map of the environment at sale $\sqrt{t}$. Our framework employs gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t) = \langle h(x, t), h(y, t)\rangle$ with adaptive scale selection, choosing the time scale with maximal gradient at each step for trap-free, smooth trajectories. Efficient matrix squaring $P_{2t} = P_t^2$ builds global representations from local transitions $P_1$ without memorizing past trajectories, enabling hippocampal preplay-like path planning. This produces robust navigation through complex environments, aligning with hippocampal navigation. Experimental results show that our model captures place cell properties -- field size distribution, adaptability, and remapping -- while achieving computational efficiency. By modeling collective transition probabilities rather than individual place fields, we offer a biologically plausible, scalable framework for spatial navigation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14855">Neural Heterogeneity Enables Adaptive Encoding of Time Sequences</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems represent time from microseconds to years. An important gap in our knowledge concerns the mechanisms for encoding time intervals of hundreds of milliseconds to minutes that matter for tasks like navigation, communication, storage, recall, and prediction of stimulus patterns. A recently identified mechanism in fish thalamic neurons addresses this gap. Representation of intervals between events uses the ubiquitous property of neural fatigue, where firing adaptation sets in quickly during an event. The recovery from fatigue by the next stimulus is a monotonous function of time elapsed. Here we develop a full theory for the representation of intervals, allowing for recovery time scales and sensitivity to past stimuli to vary across cells. Our Bayesian framework combines parametrically heterogeneous stochastic dynamical modeling with interval priors to predict available timing information independent of actual decoding mechanism. A compromise is found between optimally encoding the latest time interval and previous ones, crucial for spatial navigation. Cellular heterogeneity is actually necessary to represent interval sequences, a novel computational role for experimentally observed heterogeneity. This biophysical adaptation-based timing memory shapes spatiotemporal information for efficient storage and recall in target recurrent networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15453">A dynamical memory with only one spiking neuron</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common wisdom indicates that to implement a Dynamical Memory with spiking neurons two ingredients are necessary: recurrence and a neuron population. Here we shall show that the second requirement is not needed. We shall demonstrate that under very general assumptions a single recursive spiking neuron can realize a robust model of a dynamical memory. We demonstrate the implementation of a dynamical memory in both, software and hardware. In the former case, we introduce trivial extensions of the popular aQIF and AdEx models. In the latter, we show traces obtained in a circuit model with a recently proposed memristive spiking neuron. We show that the bistability of the theoretical models can be understood in terms of a self-consistent problem that can be represented geometrically. Our minimal dynamical memory model provides a simplest implementation of an important neuro-computational primitive, which can be useful in navigation system models based on purely spiking dynamics. A one neuron dynamical memory may also provides a natural explanation to the surprising recent observation that the excitation bump in Drosophila's ellipsoidal body is made by just a handful of neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15477">Brain volume predicts survival of colliding-spreading messages on mammal brain networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White matter in mammal brains forms a densely interconnected communication network. Due to high edge density, along with continuous generation and spread of messages, brain networks must contend with congestion, which may limit polysynaptic message survival in complex ways. Here we study congestion with a colliding-spreading model, a synchronous Markovian process where messages arriving coincidentally at a node are deleted, while surviving messages spread to all nearest neighbors. Numerical simulations on a large sample of mammal connectomes demonstrate that message survival follows a positively skewed lognormal-like distribution for all connectomes tested. This distribution mirrors empirical distributions of interareal distances and edge weights. However, the distribution of message survival is an emergent property of system dynamics and graph topology alone; it does not require interareal distances or edge weights. We then show that message survival is well predicted by log brain volume (r = -0.64) across species. Thus, messages survive longer in small compared to large mammals, in accordance with the notion that larger brains become more modular. Chimpanzee showed the lowest message survival among the animals tested. We describe structural properties that may play a role in generating these dynamics and we discuss implications of our results for brain function and evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15813">Meta-Learning an In-Context Transformer Model of Human Higher Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.15813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18991">Uncovering potential effects of spontaneous waves on synaptic development: the visual system as a model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.18991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous waves are ubiquitous during early brain development and are hypothesized to drive the development of receptive fields (RFs). Different stages of spontaneous waves in the retina have been observed to coincide with the development of the retinotopic map, ON-OFF segregation, and orientation selectivity in the early visual pathway of mammals, and can be characterized by different activity patterns in the retina and downstream areas. Stage II waves, which occur in rodents right after birth, have been implicated in a possible synaptic pruning process, relating these stage II retinal waves to the refinement of the retinotopic map. However, the mechanisms underlying the activity-dependent effects of retinal waves on synapses into the primary visual cortex (V1) are poorly understood. In this work, we build a biologically-constrained model of the development of thalamocortical synapses of V1 cells driven by stage II retinal waves using a spike-timing dependent triplet learning rule. Using this model, together with a reduced rate-based model, we propose mechanisms underlying such a pruning process and predict how characteristics of the retinal waves may lead to different RF structures, including periodic RFs. We introduce gap junctions into the V1 network and show that such a coupling can serve to promote precise local retinotopy. Finally, we discuss how the spatial distribution of synaptic weights at the end of stage II may affect the emergence of orientation selectivity of V1 neurons during stage III waves. The mechanisms uncovered in this work may be useful in understanding synaptic structures that emerge across cortical regions during development.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14841">Beyond Pairwise Plasticity: Group-Level Spike Synchrony Facilitates Efficient Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain networks rely on precise spike timing and coordinated activity to support robust and energy-efficient learning. Inspired by these principles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely regarded as promising candidates for low-power, event-driven computing. However, most biologically-inspired learning rules employed in SNNs, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), rely on isolated spike pairs and lack sensitivity to population-level activity. This limits their stability and generalization, particularly in noisy and fast-changing environments. Motivated by biological observations that neural synchrony plays a central role in learning and memory, we introduce a spike-synchrony-dependent plasticity (SSDP) rule that adjusts synaptic weights based on the degree of coordinated firing among neurons. SSDP supports stable and scalable learning by encouraging neurons to form coherent activity patterns. One prominent outcome is a sudden transition from unstable to stable dynamics during training, suggesting that synchrony may drive convergence toward equilibrium firing regimes. We demonstrate SSDP's effectiveness across multiple network types, from minimal-layer models to spiking ResNets and SNN-Transformer. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a synaptic plasticity mechanism in a spiking transformer. SSDP operates in a fully event-driven manner and incurs minimal computational cost, making it well-suited for neuromorphic deployment. In this approach, local synaptic modifications are associated with the collective dynamics of neural networks, resulting in a learning strategy that adheres to biological principles while maintaining practical efficiency, these findings position SSDP as a general-purpose optimization strategy for SNNs, while offering new insights into population-based learning mechanisms in the brain.

                arXiv:2505.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) represents a promising avenue for advancing artificial intelligence by combining powerful natural language understanding with optimization and search capabilities. This manuscript explores the synergistic potential of LLMs and EC, reviewing their intersections, complementary strengths, and emerging applications. We identify key opportunities where EC can enhance LLM training, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and architecture search, while LLMs can, in turn, aid in automating the design, analysis, and interpretation of ECs. The manuscript explores the synergistic integration of EC and LLMs, highlighting their bidirectional contributions to advancing artificial intelligence. It first examines how EC techniques enhance LLMs by optimizing key components such as prompt engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and architecture search, demonstrating how evolutionary methods automate and refine these processes. Secondly, the survey investigates how LLMs improve EC by automating metaheuristic design, tuning evolutionary algorithms, and generating adaptive heuristics, thereby increasing efficiency and scalability. Emerging co-evolutionary frameworks are discussed, showcasing applications across diverse fields while acknowledging challenges like computational costs, interpretability, and algorithmic convergence. The survey concludes by identifying open research questions and advocating for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of EC and LLMs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14893">On the Day They Experience: Awakening Self-Sovereign Experiential AI Agents</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing on Andrew Parker's "Light Switch" theory-which posits that the emergence of vision ignited a Cambrian explosion of life by driving the evolution of hard parts necessary for survival and fueling an evolutionary arms race between predators and prey-this essay speculates on an analogous explosion within Decentralized AI (DeAI) agent societies. Currently, AI remains effectively "blind", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and engaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively "experience" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may eventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel, perceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies, memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital "metabolism" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration without human intervention-evolving "in the wild". Ultimately, by transitioning from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age.

                arXiv:2505.15228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Our primary contribution involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of financial time series. Our empirical validation across multiple domains demonstrates competitive performance compared to several traditional architectures tested, especially in scenarios where data efficiency and numerical stability are important. Our implementation, including strategies for managing computational overhead in larger networks is available in Ref.~\citep{cpkan_implementation}.

                arXiv:2505.15355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.

                arXiv:2505.15514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm that heavily relies on accurate advantage estimates for stable and efficient training. However, raw advantage signals can exhibit significant variance, noise, and scale-related issues, impeding optimal learning performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO (AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage estimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive modulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling factor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such as their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By incorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled advantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates and improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this modulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and adaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward trajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly reduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers. These findings underscore the potential of advantage modulation as a broadly applicable technique for enhancing reinforcement learning optimization.

                arXiv:2505.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft" permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort. We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.

                arXiv:2310.06488v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating comparable performance in both visual and linguistic tasks while offering the advantage of improved energy efficiency. Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

                arXiv:2405.09962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box optimization problems often require simultaneously optimizing different types of variables, such as continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Unlike integer variables, categorical variables do not necessarily have a meaningful order, and the discretization approach of continuous variables does not work well. Although several Bayesian optimization methods can deal with mixed-category black-box optimization (MC-BBO), they suffer from a lack of scalability to high-dimensional problems and internal computational cost. This paper proposes CatCMA, a stochastic optimization method for MC-BBO problems, which employs the joint probability distribution of multivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions as the search distribution. CatCMA updates the parameters of the joint probability distribution in the natural gradient direction. CatCMA also incorporates the acceleration techniques used in the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and the stochastic natural gradient method, such as step-size adaptation and learning rate adaptation. In addition, we restrict the ranges of the categorical distribution parameters by margin to prevent premature convergence and analytically derive a promising margin setting. Numerical experiments show that the performance of CatCMA is superior and more robust to problem dimensions compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization algorithms.

                arXiv:2505.01256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NSGA-III is a prominent algorithm in evolutionary many-objective optimization. It is well-suited for optimizing functions with more than three objectives, setting it apart from the classic NSGA-II. However, theoretical insights about NSGA-III of when and why it performs well are still in its early development. This paper addresses this point and conducts a rigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on the many-objective $\OJZJfull$ benchmark ($\OJZJ$ for short), providing runtime bounds where the number of objectives is constant. We show that NSGA-III finds the Pareto front of $\OJZJ$ in time $O(n^{k+d/2}+ \mu n \ln(n))$ where $n$ is the problem size, $d$ is the number of objectives, $k$ is the gap size, a problem specific parameter, if its population size $\mu \in 2^{O(n)}$ is at least $(2n/d+1)^{d/2}$. Notably, NSGA-III is faster than NSGA-II by a factor of $\mu/n^{d/2}$ for some $\mu \in \omega(n^{d/2})$. We also show that a stochastic population update, proposed by~\citet{UpBian}, provably guarantees a speedup of order $\Theta((k/b)^{k-1})$ in the runtime where $b>0$ is a constant. Besides~\cite{DoerrNearTight}, this is the first rigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on \OJZJ. Proving these bounds requires a much deeper understanding of the population dynamics of NSGA-III than previous papers achieved.

Abstract: Planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. Metaheuristic algorithms search through the space of possible transit networks by applying heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper, we use deep reinforcement learning to train a graph neural net to provide heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm. These neural heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and achieve new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Mumford benchmark. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by 52% and 25% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 19% over the city's existing transit network.

                arXiv:2411.02001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local learning, which trains a network through layer-wise local targets and losses, has been studied as an alternative to backpropagation (BP) in neural computation. However, its algorithms often become more complex or require additional hyperparameters because of the locality, making it challenging to identify desirable settings in which the algorithm progresses in a stable manner. To provide theoretical and quantitative insights, we introduce the maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) in the infinite-width limit for two representative designs of local targets: predictive coding (PC) and target propagation (TP). We verified that $\mu$P enables hyperparameter transfer across models of different widths. Furthermore, our analysis revealed unique and intriguing properties of $\mu$P that are not present in conventional BP. By analyzing deep linear networks, we found that PC's gradients interpolate between first-order and Gauss-Newton-like gradients, depending on the parameterization. We demonstrate that, in specific standard settings, PC in the infinite-width limit behaves more similarly to the first-order gradient. For TP, even with the standard scaling of the last layer, which differs from classical $\mu$P, its local loss optimization favors the feature learning regime over the kernel regime.

Abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.

                Background Tuberculosis remains a significant global public health concern. Genetic variants influence the distribution of vitamin D in circulation, leading to vitamin D deficiency. The two extensively studied non-synonymous D-binding protein nucleotide polymorphisms rs7041 and rs4588 were found in different populations. These polymorphisms result into three different genotypes, Gc1F (rs7041(A)- rs4588(G)), Gc1S (rs7041(C)- rs4588(G)) and Gc2 (rs7041(A)- rs4588(T)). These genotypes have configurational changes that differ and therefore cause variation in the binding affinity of the vitamin D metabolite. This study aimed to compare the frequency distribution of vitamin D binding protein gene polymorphisms in patients with active Ugandan tuberculosis, individuals with latent tuberculosis infection, and those with no tuberculosis infection. Methods This pilot studyselected 102 samples, including 52 active tuberculosis patients, 23 latent tuberculosis individuals, and 27 individuals without tuberculosis infection, from a previous cross-sectional study. Vitamin D binding protein rs7041 and rs4588 SNPs were genotyped using Polymerase Chain Reaction and Sanger sequencing. Vitamin D binding protein gene polymorphisms were identified using BioEdit software. 7.2 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) Results This study revealed no significant differences in DBP genetic polymorphisms among the study groups. The frequency distribution of the DBP gene has been reported to be 97% Gc1F, 2% Gc2, and 1% Gc1S. The frequency distribution among patients with TB was 96.2% for Gc1F, 0% for Gc1F, and 3.8% for Gc2. Among the LTBI cases, 95.7% were Gc1F, 4.3% were Gc1S, and 0%were Gc2. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis was in equilibrium, D’= 0. P=0.2 Conclusions The Gc1F genotype was predominantly found in the study population, with no difference in the frequency distribution according to TB status.

                <p>All available antiseizure medications aim at symptomatic control of epilepsy, but there is no strategy to stop the development of the disease. The main reason is the lack of understanding of the epileptogenic mechanisms. Closing this knowledge gap is an essential prerequisite for developing disease-modifying therapies that can prevent the onset of epilepsy. Using primary cocultures of hippocampal neurons and glial cells derived from rat pups of either sex, we show that epileptiform paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDS) induce neuronal glucose hypometabolism which is compensated for by increased glutaminolysis. Glutaminolysis not only provides sufficient ATP to support electrical activity but also leads to decreased vesicular glutamate release, thereby promoting neuronal hypersynchrony. Moreover, prolonged promotion of PDS increased neuronal arborization and synaptic density, which in combination with spontaneous recovery of neuronal glucose metabolism led to seizure-like discharge activity. Since inhibition of glutaminolysis did not prevent the PDS-induced morphogenesis but eliminated seizure-like activity, we propose that glutaminolysis is a causative process linking neuronal metabolism with electrical activity thereby driving epileptogenesis.</p>

                <p>Intracortical circuits, including long-range callosal projections, are crucial for information processing. The development of neuronal connectivity in the cerebral cortex is contingent on ordered emergence of neuronal classes followed by the formation of class-specific axon projections. However, the genetic determinants of intracortical axon targeting are still unclear. We find that the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2-c (Mef2c) directs the development of somatosensory cortical (S1) Layer 4 and 5 identity in murine postmitotic pyramidal neurons during embryogenesis. During postnatal development, <I>Mef2c</I> expression shifts to Layer 2/3 callosal projection neurons (L2/3 CPNs). At this later developmental stage, we identify a novel function for <I>Mef2c</I> in contralateral homotopic domain targeting by S1-L2/3 CPN axons. We employ functional manipulation of EphrinA&ndash;EphA signaling in <I>Mef2c</I> mutant CPNs and demonstrate that Mef2c represses <I>EphA</I>6 to desensitize S1-L2/3 CPN axons to EphrinA5 repulsion at their contralateral targets. Our work uncovers dual roles for <I>Mef2c</I> in cortical development: regulation of laminar subtype specification during embryogenesis and axon targeting in postnatal callosal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e0249252025?rss=1">Sensorimotor Transformations for Postural Control in the Vermis of the Cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cerebellar vermis plays an essential role in maintaining posture and balance by integrating sensory inputs from multiple modalities to effectively coordinate movement. By transforming convergent sensory information into precise motor commands, it ensures smooth, adaptive motor control, enabling the body to maintain stability in dynamic environments. This review examines recent findings that investigate the distinct neural computations performed by the anterior vermis and posterior vermis (nodulus/uvula). Specifically, we examine how Purkinje cells in these regions integrate vestibular and proprioceptive signals to convert self-motion information from a head-centered to a body-centered reference frame, which is essential for maintaining precise postural control in response to unexpected movements. Additionally, we consider recent findings showing that, during voluntary self-motion, Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis selectively suppress responses in the vestibulospinal pathway by integrating motor inputs with sensory signals. Given the anterior vermis's role in maintaining balance during voluntary behaviors such as locomotion, its suppression prevents counterproductive stabilizing reflexes, enabling goal-directed movement through space. In contrast, the posterior vermis, encompassing the nodulus and uvula, integrates vestibular inputs from both the otoliths and semicircular canals to maintain equilibrium relative to gravitational forces. We thus hypothesize that Purkinje cells in the nodulus/uvula do not generate suppression signals like those observed in the anterior vermis but instead continuously compute our orientation in space, regardless of whether movement is voluntarily generated or unexpected. If our hypothesis is correct, the nodulus/uvula would effectively provide consistent "ground truth" information about self-motion relative to gravity.</p>

                <p>Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are impaired at incremental reward-based learning. It is typically assumed that this impairment reflects a loss of striatal dopamine. However, many open questions remain about the nature of reward-based learning deficits in PD. Recent studies have found that even simple reward-based learning tasks rely on a combination of cognitive and computational strategies, including one-shot episodic memory. These findings raise questions about how incremental learning and episodic memory contribute to decision-making in PD. We tested healthy participants (<I>n</I> = 26; 14 males and 12 females) and patients with PD (<I>n</I> = 26; 16 males and 10 females), both on- and off-dopamine replacement medication, on a task designed to differentiate between the contributions of incremental learning and episodic memory to reward-based learning and decision-making. We found that PD patients performed equally well as healthy controls when using episodic memory but were impaired at incremental reward-based learning. Dopamine replacement medication remediated this deficit and enhanced subsequent episodic memory for the value of motivationally relevant stimuli. These results demonstrate that while PD patients are impaired at learning about reward from trial-and-error, their ability to encode memories for the value of one-shot experiences is intact.</p>

                <p>Sleep spindles, transient bursts of rhythmic activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep, are generated by the thalamocortical network through an intricate interplay between the thalamus and the cortex. Emerging research has shed light on the role of sleep spindles in cognitive function, memory consolidation, and overall brain health. Using a behavioral genetics approach in female and male adolescent humans, this study examined the degree to which sleep spindles (measured via high-density sleep electroencephalography) and thalamic volume (measured via magnetic resonance imaging) are driven by common genetic and environmental factors. Here we show a strong correlation between thalamic volume and sleep spindle amplitude and density. Bayesian structural equation modeling estimated that over posterior regions, genetic factors accounted for approximately half of the covariance between sleep spindle activity and thalamic volume. Our findings demonstrate that genetic factors play a role in shaping the structural and functional integrity of the thalamocortical network, with implications for understanding how these processes contribute to neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>

                <p>Serotonin critically modulates the activity of many brain networks, including circuits that control motivation and responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli. Furthermore, the serotonin system is targeted by first-line pharmacological treatments for several psychiatric disorders, including obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder. However, understanding the behavioral function of serotonin is hampered by methodological limitations: the (brainstem) location of serotonergic neuron cell-bodies is difficult to access, their innervation of the brain is diffuse, and they release serotonin in relatively low concentrations. Here, we advance this effort by developing novel Tph2-Cre rats, which we utilized to study serotonin in the context of motor, compulsive, and reinforced behaviors using optogenetics in both male and female rats. Specificity and sensitivity of Cre recombinase expression and Cre-dependent processes were validated immunohistochemically, and optogenetic induction of in vivo serotonin release was validated with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Optogenetic stimulation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus did not initiate locomotion or alter aversion-induced locomotion, nor did it elicit (real-time) place preference, and it had no measurable effect on compulsive behavior in the schedule-induced polydipsia task. In contrast, this optogenetic stimulation moderately sustained ongoing spontaneous locomotion and robustly reinforced operant lever pressing for self-stimulation of serotonin neurons, which was exacerbated by food restriction. Together, this work both introduces a novel rat Cre line to study serotonin and advances our understanding of serotonin's behavioral functions. Complementing previous findings, we find that brainwide serotonin release has an overall relatively mild effect on behavior, which manifested only in the absence of natural reinforcers and was modulated by physiological state.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e1504242025?rss=1">Macroscale Traveling Waves Evoked by Single-Pulse Stimulation of the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural signal propagation is fundamental to unraveling the complexities of brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that corticocortical-evoked potentials (CCEPs) resulting from single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) may be used to characterize the patterns of information flow between and within brain networks. At present, the basic spatiotemporal dynamics of CCEP propagation cortically and subcortically are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that SPES evokes neural traveling waves detectable in the three-dimensional space sampled by intracranial stereoelectroencephalography. Across a cohort of 21 adult males and females with intractable epilepsy, we delivered 17,631 stimulation pulses and recorded CCEP responses in 1,019 electrode contacts. The distance between each pair of electrode contacts was approximated using three different metrics (Euclidean distance, path length, and geodesic distance), representing direct, tractographic, and transcortical propagation, respectively. For each robust CCEP, we extracted amplitude-, spectral-, and phase-based features to identify traveling waves emanating from the site of stimulation. Many evoked responses to stimulation appear to propagate as traveling waves (~14&ndash;28%, ~5&ndash;19% with false discovery rate correction), despite sparse sampling throughout the brain. These stimulation-evoked traveling waves exhibited biologically plausible propagation velocities (range, 0.1&ndash;9.6&nbsp;m/s). Our results reveal that direct electrical stimulation elicits neural activity with variable spatiotemporal dynamics that can be modeled as a traveling wave.</p>

                <p>Adipose-derived leptin contributes to energy homeostasis by balancing food intake and motor output, but how leptin acts in brain motor centers remains poorly understood. We investigated the influence of leptin on neuronal activity in two basal ganglia nuclei involved in motor control: the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and pars reticulata (SNr). Using a mouse reporter line to identify cells expressing leptin receptors (LepRs), we found that in both sexes, a majority of SNc dopamine neurons express a high level of LepR. Whole-cell recording in ex vivo midbrain slices from male wild-type mice showed that leptin activates SNc dopamine neurons directly and increases somatodendritic dopamine release. Although LepR expression in SNr GABA output neurons was low, leptin also activated these cells. Additional experiments showed that the influence of leptin on SNr neurons is indirect and involves D1 dopamine receptors and TRPC3 channels. Systemic administration of leptin to male mice increased locomotor activity, consistent with activation of dopamine neurons in the SNc coupled to previously reported amplification of axonal dopamine release by leptin in striatal slices. These findings indicate that in addition to managing energy homeostasis through its actions as a satiety hormone, leptin also promotes axonal and somatodendritic dopamine release that can influence motor output.</p>

                <p>Mesopic (dim light) conditions are prevalent in everyday environments, yet most human vision research is conducted under idealized, photopic (bright) conditions. Electrophysiological studies suggest that under mesopic conditions, contrast-encoding retinal ganglion cell receptive fields expand their center width while diminishing surround inhibition. These retinal modifications enhance light capture by increasing the summation area but they limit spatial resolution. However, the impact of mesopic conditions on human cortical spatial integration mechanisms remains unclear. To address this, we investigate how mesopic conditions affect early visuocortical processing, specifically spatial summation and surround suppression. Across two experiments, we acquired fMRI BOLD responses from 11 normally sighted participants of both sexes under photopic and mesopic conditions in visual areas V1&ndash;V3. The first experiment estimated population receptive field (pRF) properties while the second experiment assessed cortical surround suppression. Photopic and mesopic psychophysical surround suppression, contrast sensitivity function (CSF), and visual acuity were also measured. At the cortical level, mesopic conditions were associated with smaller pRF sizes, while surround suppression remained robust. At the perceptual level, mesopic conditions led to reduced acuity, lower CSF, and weaker suppression, diverging from the observed cortical effects. Importantly, individual differences linked these findings: participants who exhibited greater mesopic reductions in visual acuity also showed larger decreases in early visuocortical surround suppression, underscoring its role in contrast coding and spatial resolution. Altogether, our fMRI findings contrast with retinal electrophysiology and suggest that early visual cortex may employ distinct, perhaps compensatory, mechanisms in response to reduced retinal input under mesopic conditions.</p>

                <p>"Are you talkin&rsquo; to me?!" If you ever watched the masterpiece "Taxi Driver" directed by Martin Scorsese, you certainly recall the monologue during which Travis Bickle rehearses an imaginary confrontation in front of a mirror. While remembering this scene, you recollect a myriad of speech features across visual and auditory senses with a smooth sensation of unified memory. The aim of this study was to investigate how the fine-grained synchrony between coinciding visual and auditory features impacts brain oscillations when forming multisensory speech memories. We developed a memory task presenting participants with short synchronous or asynchronous movie clips focused on the face of speakers in real interviews, all the while undergoing magnetoencephalography recording. In the synchronous condition, the natural alignment between visual and auditory onsets was kept intact. In the asynchronous condition, auditory onsets were delayed to present lip movements and speech sounds in antiphase specifically with respect to the theta oscillation synchronizing them in the original movie. Our results first showed that theta oscillations in the neocortex and hippocampus were modulated by the level of synchrony between lip movements and syllables during audiovisual speech perception. Second, theta asynchrony between the lip movements and auditory envelope during audiovisual speech perception reduced the accuracy of subsequent theta oscillation reinstatement during memory recollection. We conclude that neural theta oscillations play a pivotal role in both audiovisual integration and memory replay of speech.</p>

                <p>Through experience, humans can learn to suppress locations that frequently contain distracting stimuli. However, the neural mechanism underlying learned suppression remains largely unknown. In this study, we combined steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) with event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the mechanism behind statistically learned spatial suppression. Twenty-four male and female human participants performed a version of the additional singleton search task in which one location contained a distractor stimulus frequently. The search stimuli constantly flickered on-and-off the screen, resulting in steady-state entrainment. Prior to search onset, no differences in the SSVEP response were found, though a post hoc analysis did reveal proactive alpha lateralization. Following search onset, clear evoked differences in both the SSVEP and ERP signals emerged at the suppressed location relative to all other locations. Crucially, the early timing of these evoked modulations suggests that learned distractor suppression occurs at the initial stages of visual processing.</p>

                <p>We investigate how respiration influences cognition by examining the interaction between respiratory phase and task-related brain activity during two visual categorization tasks. While prior research shows that cognitive performance varies along the respiratory cycle, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Though some studies have shown that large-scale neural activity reflecting for example changes in the excitation&ndash;inhibition balance is comodulated with the respiratory cycle, it remains unclear whether respiration directly shapes the neural signatures reflecting the encoding of task-specific external signals. We address this gap by applying single-trial multivariate analyses to EEG data obtained in humans (<I>n</I> = 25, any gender), allowing us to track how respiration relates to the sensory evidence reflected in this neurophysiological signal. Confirming previous studies, our data show that participant's performance varies with the respiratory phase prior and during a trial. Importantly, they suggest that respiration may directly influence the sensory evidence carried by neurophysiological processes emerging ~300&ndash;200&nbsp;ms prior to participant's responses. Hence, respiration and sensory-cognitive processes are not only highly intertwined but respiration may directly facilitate the representation of behaviorally relevant signals in the brain.</p>

                <p>To learn complex motor skills, an organism must be able to assign sensory feedback events to the actions that caused them. This matching problem would be simple if motor neuron output led to sensory feedback with a fixed, predictable lag. However, nonlinear dynamics in the brain and the body's periphery can decouple the timing of critical events from that of the motor output which caused them. During human speech production, for example, phonation from the glottis (a sound source for speech) begins suddenly when subglottal pressure and laryngeal tension cross a sharp threshold (i.e., a bifurcation). Only if the brain can predict the timing of these discrete peripheral events resulting from motor output, then, would it be possible to match sensory feedback to movements based on temporal coherence. We show that event onsets in the (male and female) human glottal waveform, measured using electroglottography, are reflected in the electroencephalogram during speech production, leading up to the time of the event itself. Conversely, glottal event times can be decoded from the electroencephalogram. After prolonged exposure to delayed auditory feedback, subjects recalibrate their behavioral threshold for detecting temporal auditory&ndash;motor mismatches and decoded event times decouple from actual movements. This suggests decoding performance is driven by plastic predictions of peripheral timing, providing a missing component for hindsight credit assignment, in which specific feedback events are associated with the neural activity that gave rise to movements. We discuss parallel findings from the birdsong system suggesting that results may generalize across vocal learning species.</p>

                <p>Real-world social cognition requires processing and adapting to multiple dynamic information streams. Interpreting neural activity in such ecological conditions remains a key challenge for neuroscience. This study leverages advancements in denoising techniques and multivariate modeling to extract interpretable EEG signals from pairs of (male and/or female) participants engaged in spontaneous dyadic dance. Using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), we investigated how music acoustics, self-generated kinematics, other-generated kinematics, and social coordination uniquely contributed to EEG activity. Electromyogram recordings from ocular, face, and neck muscles were also modeled to control for artifacts. The mTRFs effectively disentangled neural signals associated with four processes: (I) auditory tracking of music, (II) control of self-generated movements, (III) visual monitoring of partner movements, and (IV) visual tracking of social coordination. We show that the first three neural signals are driven by event-related potentials: the P50-N100-P200 triggered by acoustic events, the central lateralized movement-related cortical potentials triggered by movement initiation, and the occipital N170 triggered by movement observation. Notably, the (previously unknown) neural marker of social coordination encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, surpassing the encoding of self- or partner-related kinematics taken alone. This marker emerges when partners can see each other, exhibits a topographical distribution over occipital areas, and is specifically driven by movement observation rather than initiation. Using data-driven kinematic decomposition, we further show that vertical bounce movements best drive observers&rsquo; EEG activity. These findings highlight the potential of real-world neuroimaging, combined with multivariate modeling, to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex yet natural social behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e2375242025?rss=1">Multimodal Correspondence between Optogenetic fMRI, Electrophysiology, and Anatomical Maps of the Secondary Somatosensory Cortex in Nonhuman Primates</a></h4>

              
                <p>Optogenetic neuromodulation combined with functional MRI (opto-fMRI) enables noninvasive monitoring of brain-wide activity and probes causal connections. In this study, we focused on the secondary somatosensory (S2) cortex, a hub for integrating tactile and nociceptive information. By selectively stimulating excitatory neurons in the S2 cortex of monkeys using optogenetics, we observed widespread opto-fMRI activity in regions beyond the somatosensory system, as well as a strong spatial correspondence between opto-fMRI activity map and anatomical connections of the S2 cortex. Locally, optogenetically evoked fMRI BOLD signals from putative excitatory neurons exhibited standard hemodynamic response function. At low laser power, graded opto-fMRI signal changes are closely correlated with increases in local field potential (LFP) signals, but not with spiking activity. This indicates that LFP changes in excitatory neurons more accurately reflect the opto-fMRI signals than spikes. In summary, our optogenetic fMRI and anatomical findings provide causal functional and anatomical evidence supporting the role of the S2 cortex as a critical hub connecting sensory regions to higher-order cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognition and emotion. The electrophysiological basis of the opto-fMRI signals uncovered in this study offers novel insights into interpreting opto-fMRI results. Nonhuman primates are an invaluable intermediate model for translating optogenetic preclinical findings to humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e2430242025?rss=1">Functional Heterogeneity within the Primate Ventral Striatum for Motivational Regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ventral striatum (VS) is a key brain region for reward processing and motivation, and its dysfunctions have been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as apathy and obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder. Although functional heterogeneity within the VS has been well established in rodents, its relevance and mechanisms in primates remain unclear. To address this issue, we performed bilateral pharmacological inactivation of the VS in two male macaque monkeys using muscimol, a GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor agonist. Precise targeting was achieved through computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral effects were evaluated using two methods: a goal-directed task with variable rewards and analysis of spontaneous behavior. Our results demonstrated that anterior (a)VS inactivation induced a hypoactivity state that we termed "resting," whereas posterior (p)VS inactivation elicited compulsive-like "checking" behaviors. Notably, neither the aVS nor the pVS inactivation affected reward value or drive processing, thus differentiating aVS and pVS from those involved in incentive motivation, such as the rostromedial caudate and ventral pallidum. Retrograde tracing demonstrated distinct anatomical projection patterns for the aVS and pVS, supporting their functional segregation. Together, the present results suggest the functional heterogeneity of the primate VS along its anterior&ndash;posterior axis, with the aVS and pVS participating in distinct motivational control circuits. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and for the development of new therapeutic approaches.</p>

                Background Tuberculosis remains a significant public health issue in Tunisia. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of cervical lymph node tuberculosis and identify factors influencing outcomes. Methods A retrospective study was conducted over a 3-year period in the ENT department at La Rabta Hospital, Tunis. Diagnosis was based on histopathological evidence, and disease progression was categorized as favorable (treatment <9 months, no additional surgery) or unfavorable (treatment >9 months and/or supplementary surgery). The study population was divided into two groups based on the outcome nature, and analytical analysis was performed to assess factors influencing outcomes Results The study included 102 patients (32 men and 70 women), with a median age of 34.5 years (range: 8-83 years). Most patients (78.4%) had no significant medical history or known HIV infection. Thirty-nine patients (38.2%) had a history of consuming raw milk. In 65 cases (63.7%), lymph node size exceeded 3 cm. Hypoechogenicity (53.9%) and necrosis (40.1%) were the most common findings on ultrasound and CT scan, respectively. The initial diagnostic approach included adenectomy (56.8%), lymph node dissection (8.9%), and drainage of cold abscesses (34.3%). All patients received an initial four-drug antituberculosis regimen. Ethambutol treatment was extended beyond 2 months in 65 cases (63.7%). Fifty-six patients (54.9%) had a favorable outcome. Factors associated with a favorable outcome included intact skin, complete initial lymph node dissection, favorable progress at 2 months, and prolonged ethambutol therapy. Conclusions The management of lymph node tuberculosis remains challenging, especially with insufficient bacteriological confirmation. Regional epidemiological factors should be considered. The role of surgery is crucial; however, further standardization is needed to optimize patient outcomes.

                Introduction Traumatic ulcers are among the most prevalent injuries with a reported incidence of up to 95%. This study aims to evaluate Stem Cells from Human Exfoliated Deciduous Teeth Spent Medium (SHED-SM) nanoemulgel on the cytotoxicity of NIH-3T3 and buccal mucosal ulcer wounds. Materials and methods The cytotoxicity test of SHED-SM was analyzed on NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells using MTT. Thirty male Wistar rats, 2-3 months, were used as experimental subjects. Traumatic ulcer models were created by excising the right buccal mucosa with a 3 mm punch biopsy. Subjects were divided into 2 groups @15 rats for the treatment (SHED-SM) and control. The gel was applied on the surface once a day for 4 days. Evaluation was conducted on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) and immunohistochemical were stained to evaluate a number of neutrophils and the expression of COX-2, VEGF, and Col-1. Results The ANOVA results showed significant differences in the cytotoxicity test, the number of neutrophils, and the expression of COX-2, Col-1, and VEGF. The number of neutrophils and the expression of COX-2, Col-1, and VEGF were higher in the treatment group compared to the control. Conclusion SHED-SM demonstrates potential to accelerate the healing of traumatic buccal mucosal ulcers.

                Background Postoperative infection and rejection of miniplates in maxillofacial surgery are linked to surface irregularities and bacterial adhesion. This study investigated the physical and microbiological characteristics of patient-rejected miniplates to elucidate factors contributing to implant failure. Methods Forty miniplates, including straight-type BSSO and L-shaped designs, were collected from patients. Macro photography documented surface deformities. Contact angle measurements assessed surface wettability. Bacterial adhesion for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis was quantified via the crystal violet assay. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize microbial colonization. Results Macro images showed visible deformations, especially in the bridge areas of straight-type BSSO plates. Contact angle analysis revealed significantly greater hydrophobicity in rejected plates than controls (mean: 89.6° vs. 72.3°, p < 0.01). Rejected plates demonstrated significantly increased adhesion of S. aureus and S. mutans (p < 0.001), particularly on mandibular plates. P. aeruginosa adhered more to control plates (p < 0.05), while E. faecalis showed no significant difference between groups. SEM confirmed dense bacterial clusters, with S. aureus forming cocci aggregates and S. mutans forming chains, particularly in regions of surface distortion. Conclusion Rejected miniplates exhibit increased surface roughness and hydrophobicity, correlating with elevated bacterial adhesion. These findings highlight the need for improved surface design or coating technologies to reduce biofilm formation and enhance clinical outcomes in maxillofacial surgery.

                <p>by Elnaz Nemati, David B. Grayden, Anthony N. Burkitt, Parvin Zarei Eskikand</p>

This study introduces a neurobiologically inspired computational model based on the predictive coding algorithm, providing insights into coherent motion detection processes. The model is designed to reflect key principles observed in the visual system, particularly MT neurons and their surround suppression mechanisms, which play a critical role in detecting global motion. By integrating these principles, the model simulates how motion structures are decomposed into individual and shared sources, mirroring the brain’s strategy for extracting coherent motion patterns. The results obtained from random dot stimuli underscore the delicate balance between sensory data and prior knowledge in motion detection. Model testing across varying noise levels reveals that, as noise increases, the model takes longer to stabilize its motion estimates, consistent with psychophysical experiments showing that response duration (e.g., reaction time or decision-making time) also increases under higher noise conditions. The model suggests that an excessive emphasis on prior knowledge prolongs the stabilization time for motion detection, whereas an optimal integration of prior expectations enhances detection accuracy and efficiency by preventing excessive disturbances due to noise. These findings contribute to potential explanations for motion detection deficiencies observed in schizophrenia.

African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a life-threatening disease caused by the protozoan parasite <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>. The bloodstream form of <i>T. brucei</i> has a slender body with a relatively long active flagellum, which makes it an excellent swimmer. We develop a realistic trypanosome model and perform mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations to study the importance of various mechanical characteristics for trypanosome swimming behavior. The membrane of the cell body is represented by an elastic triangulated network, while the attached flagellum consists of four interconnected running-in-parallel filaments with an active travelling bending wave, which permits a good control of the flagellum beating plane. Our simulation results are validated against experimental observations, and highlight the crucial role of body elasticity, non-uniform actuation along the flagellum length, and the orientation of flagellum-beating plane with respect to the body surface for trypanosome locomotion. These results offer a framework for exploring parasite behavior in complex environments.

                <p>by Zoë Lange, Franziska Matthäus, Mingfeng Qiu</p>

Vertex models provide a robust theoretical framework for studying epithelial tissues as a network of cell boundaries. They have been pivotal in exploring properties such as cell packing geometry and rigidity transitions. Recently, extended vertex models have become instrumental in bridging the subcellular scales to the tissue scale. Here, we review extensions of the model aiming to capture experimentally observed subcellular features of epithelial tissues including heterogeneity in myosin activity across the tissue, non-uniform contractility structures, and mechanosensitive feedback loops. We discuss how these extensions change and challenge current perspectives on observables of macroscopic tissue properties. First, we find that extensions to the vertex model can change model properties significantly, impacting the critical threshold and in some cases even the existence of a rigidity transition. Second, we find that packing disorder can be explained by models employing different subcellular mechanisms, indicating a source of stochasticity and gradual local size changes as common mesoscopic motifs in the mechanics of tissue organization. We address complementary models and statistical inference, putting vertex models in a broader methodological context and we give a brief overview of software packages utilized in increasingly complex vertex model studies. Our review emphasizes the need for more comparative, systematic studies that identify specific classes of vertex models which share a set of well-defined properties, as well as a more in-depth discussion of modeling choices and their biological motivations.

                <p>by Xi Feng, Xiaoman Wang, Shouhong Guang, Shanshan Pang, Haiqing Tang</p>

In response to nutrient scarcity, cells must reallocate their limited energy for cellular maintenance at the expense of certain processes. How such a tradeoff is achieved remains largely unknown. RNA surveillance is crucial for the integrity of the transcriptome, whose defects are associated with several human diseases. Unexpectedly, we discover that the nucleolar RNA exosome, a key RNA surveillance machine, is inhibited by starvation. This is not merely the cessation of a temporarily non-essential process, but rather a key signal to allocate energy. By rewiring one-carbon metabolism, the inhibition of RNA exosome reduces translation, the most energy-consuming process. Energy is then conserved for fat synthesis to enhance cellular maintenance and starvation survival. Notably, while benefiting starvation fitness, RNA exosome inhibition impairs the life span of well-fed animals, indicating a tradeoff between short-term and long-term fitness. Our findings suggest that the nucleolar RNA surveillance can be temporarily sacrificed to facilitate starvation adaptation.

                <p>by Elisa T. Granato, Jacob D. Palmer, Christian Kirk, Connor Sharp, George Shillcock, Kevin R. Foster</p>

Bacteria commonly use molecular weaponry to kill or inhibit competitors. Genes encoding many weapons and their associated immunity mechanisms can be transmitted horizontally. These transfer events are striking because they appear to undermine bacterial weapons when given to competing strains. Here, we develop an ecological model of bacterial warfare to understand the impacts of horizontal gene transfer. Our model predicts that weapon gene transfer from an attacker to a target strain is possible, but will typically occur at a low rate such that transfer has a negligible impact on competition outcomes. We tested the model empirically using a transmissible plasmid encoding colicin E2, a potent antibacterial toxin produced by <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As predicted by the model, we find that toxin plasmid transfer is feasible during warfare, but the resulting transconjugants remain rare. However, exploring the model further reveals realistic conditions where transfer is predicted to have major impacts. Specifically, the model predicts that whenever competing strains have access to unique nutrients, transconjugants can proliferate and reach high abundances. In support of these predictions, short- and long-term experiments show that transconjugants can thrive when nutrient competition is relaxed. Our work shows how horizontal gene transfer can reshape bacterial warfare in a way that benefits a weapon gene and strains that receive it. Interestingly, we also find that there is little cost to a strain that transfers a weapon gene, which is expected to further enable the horizontal gene transfer of molecular weapons.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-321/v2?src=rss">The distribution of groundwater uranium in Chintamani village, Karnataka, India [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Chintamani village, Chikkaballapura district, Karnataka, India was found to possess high aquifer uranium concentrations. Geologically, Chintamani village is located on bedrock that is rich in elements like potassium (K) that naturally contain high levels of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, due to the presence of alkali-feldspar granites and gneisses. Aquifer depletion has caused the concentration of these elements in groundwater to increase over time, posing a potential health hazard to the residents of Chintamani village. Methods Here, we report the sampling of groundwater from 12 borewells located in Chintamani village in between the period of August 2024 to December 2024. We observed groundwater uranium concentrations of 0.018 ppm to 8.64 ppm. Data for borewell depth, the quantity of total dissolved solids (TDS), and the elemental composition of TDS is also reported. We observed a statistically significant spatial distribution of uranium concentrations in Chintamani village. Borewells possessing the highest observed concentrations of uranium were clustered towards the northwestern region of the village. Conclusions This dataset is expected to serve as a resource for guiding potential remediation efforts in these locations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-508/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Early Detection of Carotid Artery Stenosis with Falck Multifunctional Device (FMD), A Revised Ophthalmodynamometry Method [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Advanced clinical diagnostic tools enable ophthalmologists to diagnose not only ocular pathologies but also identify disorders that extend beyond ocular diseases. Ophthalmodynamometry (ODM), a screening tool that most ophthalmologists do not commonly use, measured reduced mean central retinal artery pressure (MCRAP) in the clinical setting. We describe a 70-year-old female with a reduced MCRAP in the right eye who identified 50% stenosis in her right internal carotid artery (ICA). Early diagnosis facilitated prompt management and potentially prevented future ischemic events.

                Boshnakovska et al. show that loss of the complex IV assembly factor SMIM20 in mice impairs complex IV function and causes a cardiac phenotype. SMIM20−/− mice demonstrate increased complex I activity and ROS levels, affecting Ca2+ handling and fatty acid-based respiration.

                Madej et al. reveal that PUS10, a pseudouridine synthase, regulates innate immunity impacting the inflammatory response in vivo. PUS10 loss disrupts tRNA-derived small RNAs, affecting translation and retroelement expression. This drives RNA-DNA hybrids accumulation, possibly activating cGAS-STING-induced inflammation and linking PUS10 dysregulation to human autoimmune disorders.

Depletion of sin-lncRNA causes DLST translocation to the nucleus, impairing mitochondrial function and triggering transcriptional changes, leading to metabolic reprogramming in senescence.

They show that the bioactive ketamine metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine, acts as a neuroplastogen by restoring synaptic strength and reversing deficits in CA1-dependent activity and behavior in a treatment-resistant depression model.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100747">Glutamine catabolism supports amino acid biosynthesis and suppresses the integrated stress response to promote photoreceptor survival</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptor loss results in vision loss in many blinding diseases, and metabolic dysfunction underlies photoreceptor degeneration. So, exploiting photoreceptor metabolism is an attractive strategy to prevent vision loss. Yet, the metabolic pathways that maintain photoreceptor health remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the dependence of photoreceptors on glutamine (Gln) catabolism. Gln is converted to glutamate via glutaminase (GLS), so mice lacking GLS in rod photoreceptors were generated to inhibit Gln catabolism. Loss of GLS produced rapid rod photoreceptor degeneration. In vivo metabolomic methodologies and metabolic supplementation identified Gln catabolism as critical for glutamate and aspartate biosynthesis. Concordant with this amino acid deprivation, the integrated stress response (ISR) was activated with protein synthesis attenuation, and inhibiting the ISR delayed photoreceptor loss. Furthermore, supplementing asparagine, which is synthesized from aspartate, delayed photoreceptor degeneration. Hence, Gln catabolism is integral to photoreceptor health, and these data reveal a novel metabolic axis in these metabolically demanding neurons.

                Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare, fatal, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that is most often caused by mutations affecting the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). To understand how CSF-1R-mutation affects human microglia – the specialized brain-resident macrophages of the central nervous system – and the downstream consequences for neuronal cells, we used a macrophage and forebrain organoid co-culture system based on induced pluripotent stem cells generated from two patients with HDLS, with <i>CSF-1R</i> gene-corrected isogenic organoids as controls. Macrophages derived from iPSC (iMacs) of patients exhibited a metabolic shift toward the glycolytic pathway and reduced CSF-1 sensitivity, which was associated with higher levels of IL-1β production and an activated inflammatory phenotype. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that iMacs adopt a reactive state that leads to impaired regulation of neuronal cell populations in organoid cultures, thereby identifying microglial dysregulation and specifically IL-1β production as key contributors to the degenerative neuro-environment in HDLS.

                Spatial periodicity in grid cell firing has been interpreted as a neural metric for space providing animals with a coordinate system in navigating physical and mental spaces. However, the specific computational problem being solved by grid cells has remained elusive. Here, we provide mathematical proof that spatial periodicity in grid cell firing is the only possible solution to a neural sequence code of 2-D trajectories and that the hexagonal firing pattern of grid cells is the most parsimonious solution to such a sequence code. We thereby provide a likely teleological cause for the existence of grid cells and reveal the underlying nature of the global geometric organization in grid maps as a direct consequence of a simple local sequence code. A sequence code by grid cells provides intuitive explanations for many previously puzzling experimental observations and may transform our thinking about grid cells.

">Shared Hierarchical Representations Explain Temporal Correspondence Between Brain Activity and Deep Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                The visual cortex and artificial neural networks both process images hierarchically, progressing from low-level features to high-level semantic representations. We investigated the temporal correspondence between activations from multiple convolutional and transformer-based neural network models (AlexNet, MoCo, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and ViT) and human EEG responses recorded during visual perception tasks. Leveraging two EEG datasets of images presented at different durations, we assessed whether this correspondence reflects general architectural principles or model-specific computations. Our analysis revealed a robust mapping: early EEG components correlated with activations from initial network layers and low-level visual features, whereas later components aligned with deeper layers and semantic content. Moreover, for images presented during longer times, the extent of correspondence correlated with the semantic contribution to the EEG response. These findings highlight a consistent temporal alignment between biological and artificial vision, suggesting that this correspondence is primarily driven by the hierarchical transformation of visual to semantic representations rather than by idiosyncratic computational features of individual network architectures.

">Seizure Circuit Activity in the Theilers Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus Model of Infection-induced Epilepsy Using Transient Recombination in Active Populations.</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy affects one in twenty-six individuals. A major cause of epilepsy worldwide is viral encephalitis. Central nervous system infections can provoke seizures in the short term and increase the risk of spontaneous, recurrent seizures post-infection. However, the neural mechanisms underlying seizures during acute infection are unknown. These neuronal changes can be studied in C57BL6/J mice infected with Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). TMEV-infected mice experience seizures 3-8 days post-injection (DPI), clear the virus by DPI 14, and may develop chronic, acquired temporal lobe epilepsy. TMEV may incite seizures during the acute infection period through inflammation, reactive gliosis, and cell death in hippocampal area CA1. Here, we explore the neuronal circuits underlying acute seizures in TMEV-injected mice using c-Fos driven TRAP (targeted recombination in active populations). TRAP mice (c-Fos-CreERT2 x CAG-tdTomato) were injected with PBS or TMEV and gently handled on DPI 5 to induce seizures. 4-OHT was administered to mice either 1.5 or 3 hr after seizures to tag the active cells expressing c-Fos with tdTomato. After 1 week, the mice were sacrificed and whole mouse brains were sectioned and immunostained for tdTomato expression. Percent area of fluorescence was quantified, and comparisons were made between TMEV-injected mice and PBS controls, sites ipsilateral vs contralateral to TMEV injection site, and between sexes. TdTomato expression was elevated in the TMEV-injected mice in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus, thalamus, lateral septal nucleus, basal ganglia, triangular septal nucleus, fornix, and corpus callosum. Critically, the expression pattern suggests that seizures induced on DPI 5 arise from the hilus, dentate gyrus, and CA3 hippocampal subregions. Generalized seizures during acute TMEV infection may have propagated to the contralateral hemisphere via CA3 and the hippocampal commissure. TRAP has not been previously utilized in the TMEV mouse model and these experiments address crucial questions regarding seizure spread during TMEV infection.

">Disturbed engram network caused by NPTXs downregulation underlies aging-related memory deficits</a></h4>

              
                Engram cells storing specific memories are allocated to separate neuronal ensembles, which preferentially recruit either excitatory or inhibitory inputs to drive precise memory expression. However, how these formed neuronal ensembles maintain their stability, and whether the disturbed stability contributes to aging-related memory deficits remain elusive. Here, we show that neuronal pentraxin1 (NPTX1) facilitates Kv7.2-mediated inhibition of Fos+ ensemble hyperexcitability, thereby restricting its response to excitatory inputs from medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and promoting memory expression in the fear context. Meanwhile, NPTX2 facilitates the perisomatic inhibition of the Npas4+ ensemble by parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, thus preventing fear memory overgeneralization. Pharmacological activation of Kv7.2 or chemogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons repaired memory deficits caused by engram specific NPTXs depletion. Contextual fear memory precision and NPTXs expression in dentate gyrus (DG) engram cells are decreased in aged mice. Overexpression of NPTX1 in Fos+ ensemble or AMPAR binding domain of NPTX2 in Npas4+ ensemble rescued memory imprecision. These findings elucidate that the coordination of NPTXs prevents engram ensembles from becoming hyperactive and provide a causal link between engram network destabilization and aging-associated memory deficits.

">Two senses, one rhythm: Pre- and post-stimulus neural states predict perceived audio-visual synchrony</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain integrate or segregate multiple sensory inputs? In our study, we used magnetoencephalography to comprehensively investigate local and network dynamics before and after the presentation of sequences of beeps and flashes that are sometimes perceived as synchronous or asynchronous. Frequency-tagging and spectral analysis revealed that under identical physical conditions, subjective perceptual fusion of multisensory signals elicits stronger evoked sensory responses in both visual and auditory cortices. Crucially, perceptual fusion is preceded by locally reduced pre-stimulus alpha activity, as well as enhanced functional connectivity between auditory and visual cortices within the pre-stimulus gamma activity. We also show that pre-stimulus neuronal states in the occipital cortex predict post-stimulus sensory responses to auditory sequences in the temporal cortex, but not the opposite. The current findings provide evidence that the perceptual fusion of multisensory events relate to a complex interplay between local and inter-sensory neuronal states before and after stimulus presentation.

">Chimpanzee and human ApoE isoforms differ in the stimulation of neurite differentiation consistent with structural predictions with relevance to brain development and aging</a></h4>

              
                Background: Among anthropoids, humans uniquely possess ApoE isoforms that modulate Alzheimers disease (AD) risk and brain aging. While chimpanzee and human ApoE4 share R112 and R158, chimps do not exhibit advanced AD. A key difference is T61 in chimps versus R61 in humans, structurally resembling ApoE3. Objective: We examined how astrocyte-derived ApoE isoforms impact neuronal morphology and used structural modeling to explore functional divergence. Methods: Neonatal rat hippocampal neurons were cultured with astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) from mice expressing human ApoE3, ApoE4, or chimpanzee ApoE. Neuronal outgrowth was quantified after 72 hours. Results: Chimpanzee ACM increased neurite number by 30% over human ApoE isoforms. However, chimpanzee ACM resembled ApoE4 functionally, producing 40% shorter neurites and spines. Structural modeling supported greater similarity to ApoE4. Conclusions: Chimpanzee ApoE is structurally and functionally more similar to ApoE4 than ApoE3, revealing evolutionary distinctions relevant to AD risk and neurodevelopment.

">The Human Insula Encodes Somatotopic Representation of Motor Execution with an Effector-Specific Connectomic Map to Primary Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding motor representation in the human brain requires mapping beyond the primary motor cortex, into the distributed networks that coordinate complex movements. The insular cortex, a multifunctional hub buried within the Sylvian fissure, has been implicated in motor control through clinical observations and neuroimaging, yet its precise contribution to movement processing remains one of the least understood aspects of motor neurophysiology. To address this gap, we quantified electrophysiological changes from implanted depth electrodes in patients performing simple movement tasks combined with single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) to map functional connectivity. We observe regions of distinct somatotopic separation bilaterally, as well as cross-modal regions that are active for different movement types. Hand representation is centered along the ventral aspect of the middle and posterior short gyri bilaterally, while tongue/mouth tuned sites cluster in the dorsal posterior short gyrus and the dorsal long gyri. Insular activity temporally follows the primary motor cortex (M1) and precedes movement onset. SPES revealed somatotopically-specific connectivity between corresponding sites in M1 and insula (hand-to-hand, tongue-to-tongue) and between bilateral insulae. These observations establish that somatotopy is a conserved property of distributed motor control incorporating the insula, with direct implications for surgical planning and targeted neuromodulation therapies.

">Brain Multi-Omic Subtypes of Neuroticism Reveal Molecular Signatures linked to Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Importance: Molecular mechanisms linking neuroticism with Alzheimer's disease traits are unknown. Objective: To identify molecular subtypes of neuroticism and examine their association with ADRD traits. Design: Three ongoing cohort studies were used; Religious Orders Study (ROS), Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), that began enrollment in 1994, 1997, and 2004, respectively. Setting: Older priests, nuns, and brothers from across the U.S. (ROS), older adults (MAP) and older African-American adults (MARS) from across the greater Chicago metropolitan area. Participants: 1,028 decedents with multi-omic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (AC), and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG). Exposure(s): Eight layers of omics (DNA methylation and histone acetylation from DLPFC; RNA seq from AC, DLPFC, and PCG, single-nucleus RNA, TMT proteomics and metabolomics from DLPFC) and Neuroticism using the 12-item version from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Person-specific multi-omic molecular pseudotime representing molecular progression from low to high phenotypic expression of neuroticism, and three multi-omic brain molecular subtypes of neuroticism which represent distinct omic pathways from no/low neuroticism to high neuroticism that differ by their omic constituents. Participants are exclusively assigned to the subtype which aligns mostly with their multi-omic profile. Results: The top drivers of subtype differentiation were transcriptomic alterations across three brain regions (DLPFC, AC, PCG) which extensively and differentially characterized the subtypes. The subtypes were also differentially associated with AD pathology, temporal lobe atrophy, and AD dementia, with subtype N1 showing the strongest associations. Conclusions and Relevance: Neuroticism may be driven by three distinct molecular subtypes, with subtype N1 driving ADRD-related associations, N2 showing some ADRD associations, and N3 being completely independent of these outcomes. Our data provide novel insights into the biology of individual differences in predispositions of neuroticism and its associations with ADRD traits.

">Intercellular communication in the brain via dendritic nanotubular network</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have identified intercellular networks for material exchange by bridge-like nanotubular structures, yet their existence in neurons remains unexplored within the brain. Here, we identified long, thin dendritic filopodia that establish direct dendrite-to-dendrite contacts, forming dendritic nanotubes (DNTs) in mammalian brains. Using super-resolution microscopy, we characterized their unique molecular composition and dynamics in dissociated neurons, enabling Ca2+ propagation over distances. Utilizing imaging and machine-learning-based analysis, we confirmed the in situ presence of DNTs connecting dendrites to other dendrites whose anatomical features are distinguished from synaptic dendritic spines. DNTs mediate the active transport of small molecules or human amyloid-beta (A{beta}), implicating the role of DNT network in AD pathology. Notably, DNT levels increased prior to the onset of amyloid plaque deposits in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. Computational simulations predicted the progression of amyloidosis, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration through these DNTs. This study unveils a previously unrecognized nanotubular network, highlighting another dimension of neuronal connectivity beyond synapses.

">Anti-amyloid antibody equilibrium binding to Aβ aggregates from human Alzheimer disease brain</a></h4>

              
                Importance: Anti-amyloid immunotherapy is used to treat Alzheimer disease (AD) with moderate benefits and potentially serious side effects due to amyloid related imaging abnormality with effusions/edema (ARIA-E). Different anti-amyloid antibodies have different in vitro binding characteristics to different synthetic A{beta} aggregates, leading to the assumption that they bind different species in the human brain. Lecanemab is hypothesized to bind "protofibrils," but these are not well-characterized in human brain. It is also unknown how binding differences correlate with ARIA-E rates. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele increases ARIA-E risk, but how it affects antibody binding characteristics is unknown. Objectives: To determine whether anti-amyloid antibodies bind different species of human brain A{beta} and whether these binding properties to human brain A{beta} explains ARIA-E rates. Design: Cross-sectional study of 18 postmortem human brains. Setting: Single tertiary care hospital. Participants: Deceased patients with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Main Outcomes and Measures: Equilibrium binding constants (KD) and total A{beta} binding (Bmax) of recombinant aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab equivalents to human brain soluble and insoluble amyloid plaque-enriched and CAA-enriched A{beta} aggregates. Results: Lecanemab did not bind with greater affinity to the soluble fraction of A{beta} compared to aducanumab. All three antibodies were bound essentially identical quantities of A{beta} across the 18 cases and fractions (Pearson's r 0.84 -- 0.97). Antibody preference for plaque vs CAA A{beta} did not differ in soluble fractions but differed slightly in insoluble extracts. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele led to a more soluble antibody-accessible A{beta} pool in a dose-dependent manner for all three antibodies. Conclusions and Relevance: The lecanemab binding target in human brain is unlikely to be distinctly "protofibrillar" compared to other antibodies. Differences in antibody preference for plaque vs CAA A{beta} are unlikely to fully explain differences in ARIA-E rates. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele may plausibly increase ARIA-E risk by making antibody-accessible A{beta} more soluble. These results have implications for improving the safety and efficacy of current and future anti-amyloid antibody therapies.

">Accelerating Neuron Reconstruction with PATHFINDER</a></h4>

              
                Comprehensive mapping of neural connections is essential for understanding brain function. Existing automated methods for connectome reconstruction from high-resolution images of brain tissue introduce errors that require extensive and time-consuming manual correction, a critical bottleneck in the field. To address this, we developed PATHFINDER, an AI system that segments volumetric image data, identifies potential ways to assemble neuron fragments, and evaluates the plausibility of resulting shapes to reconstruct complete neurons. Using a dataset of all axons in an IBEAM-mSEM volume of mouse cortex, we show that PATHFINDER reduces the error rate in axon reconstruction by an order of magnitude over previous state of the art, leading to an improvement in proofreading throughput of up to 84x relative to prior estimates in the context of a whole mouse brain. By drastically reducing the manual effort required for analysis, this advance unlocks the potential for both large-scale connectome mapping and routine investigation of smaller volumes.

">Purkinje Cell spike patterns do not correlate with nuclei cell spike patterns in mouse models for cerebellar disease</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar dysfunction causes various movement disorders, including ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. Previous work demonstrated that spike patterns in cerebellar nuclei neurons were distinct between different movement disorder mouse models. However, often these changes arise from neural dysfunction in the cerebellar cortex, through misfiring, miswiring, or degenerating Purkinje cells. Even though Purkinje cells form the sole output from the cerebellar cortex, their information is relayed to other regions of the motor network via cerebellar nuclei cells. Purkinje cells make GABAergic synapses onto cerebellar nuclei cells, and it is often assumed that changes in Purkinje cell spike patterns result in inverse changes in nuclei cell spike patterns. Here, we test this hypothesis by answering the question of whether a reliable relationship between Purkinje cell and nuclei cell spike patterns exists. Single-cell, in vivo electrophysiology recordings of both cell types from six mouse models for cerebellar movement disorders were analyzed according to parameters relating to spike rate and irregularity. We investigated whether Purkinje cell spike patterns correlated with nuclei cell spike patterns. We found that some parameters for firing irregularity were positively correlated between Purkinje and nuclei cells but no -- and particularly no inverse - relationship was observed between Purkinje and nuclei cell spike rate. Overall, this study begins to illuminate that the relationship between Purkinje cells and nuclei cell spike activity in a disease state is more complex and unpredictable. The data suggest Purkinje cell spike activity changes cannot accurately predict nuclei cell changes, which ultimately drive cerebellar disease states. Our findings underscore the importance of studying cerebellar nuclei cell function in cerebellar disease, as lack of changes in Purkinje cell firing patterns can mask disease-causing firing patterns in these cerebellar output cells.

">Development of noninvasive imaging to measure spontaneous pain in mice</a></h4>

              
                Objectively measuring pain in laboratory animals is essential for pain research and analgesic development. Despite the development of various behavioral tests to measure evoked pain in animal models, measuring spontaneous pain remains challenging. To address this unmet need, we developed a novel imaging approach to detect spontaneous nociception in animal pain models. To do this, we generated a Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes transgenic mouse that expresses Redquorin under the murine synapsin 1 promoter. Redquorin is a fusion protein consisting of chimera and a 2x tandem dimer Tomato Aequorin (tdTA), which emits long wavelength bioluminescence from activated neurons in the presence of coelenterazine. This luminescence can penetrate tissues and form a projected image on the body surface that can be detected with a spectrum In Vivo Imaging System, thus creating a Nociceptive Neuronal Activity Imaging mouse. We used the tdTA mice to image bioluminescence in the spinal regions as a surrogate of spontaneous pain induced by capsaicin, the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120, and spinal nerve ligation. Results show that Redquorin-emitted bioluminescence is a sensitive optical surrogate to measure spontaneous pain. This approach offers a new method to measure spontaneous pain in animal models for basic and translational research.

">Reorganization of spinal neural connectivity following recovery after thoracic spinal cord injury: insights from computational modelling</a></h4>

              
                Rats exhibit significant recovery of locomotor function following incomplete spinal cord injuries, albeit with altered gait expression and reduced speed and stepping frequency. These changes likely result from and give insight into the reorganization within spared and injured spinal circuitry. Previously, we developed computational models of the mouse spinal locomotor circuitry controlling speed-dependent gait expression (Danner et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2022). Here, we adapted these models to the rat and used the adapted model to explore potential circuit-level changes underlying altered gait expression observed after recovery from two different thoracic spinal cord injuries (lateral hemisection and contusion) that have roughly comparable levels of locomotor recovery (Danner et al., 2023). The model reproduced experimentally observed gait expression before injury and after recovery from lateral hemisection and contusion, and suggests two distinct, injury-specific mechanisms of recovery. First, recovery after lateral hemisection required substantial functional restoration of damaged descending drive and long propriospinal connections, suggesting compensatory plasticity through formation of detour pathways. Second, recovery after a moderate mid-line contusion predominantly relied on reorganization of spared sublesional networks and altered control of supralesional cervical circuits, compensating for weakened propriospinal and descending pathways. These observations suggest that symmetrical (contusion) and asymmetrical (lateral hemisection) injuries induce distinct types of plasticity in different regions of the spinal cord, indicating that effective therapeutic strategies may benefit from targeting specific circuits according to injury symmetry.

">Error-driven changes in hippocampal representations accompany flexible re-learning</a></h4>

              
                Flexible behavior requires both the learning of new associations, and the suppression of previous ones, but how neural circuits achieve this balance remains unclear. Here we show that continuous changes in hippocampal representations, known as drift, may facilitate this process. We used voluntary head-fixation and calcium imaging to record from CA1 in rats during an odor-guided navigation task that required frequent re-learning. We found systematic representational changes over the course of the multi-hour sessions that were increased following errors. A simple neural network model revealed that such error-driven drift can enable flexible re-learning by allowing new associations to form from new neural patterns. A consequence of this is that previous associations are maintained in latent synaptic weights. These findings reconcile the apparent tension between representational drift and stable memory storage, demonstrating how dynamic neural codes could support both flexible behavior and lasting memories.

                Emerging evidence suggests that ocular dynamics, pupil dilation, eye movements, and blinks, can serve as markers of task engagement. In this study, we examined whether these measures dissociate different perceptual states during an auditory attention task. Participants (Main and Control experiments; N = 34 and 27, both sexes) listened to tone sequences designated as 'Target', 'Distractor', and 'Probe', designed to isolate active attention from suppression of irrelevant input. We focused on four physiological signals: pupil diameter (PD), pupil dilation rate (PDR), blink rate, and microsaccades (MS). Compared to a control condition, both Target and Probe intervals elicited sustained PD increases, blink suppression, and prolonged MS inhibition indicating extended attentional engagement. Interestingly, the Distractor interval also showed prolonged blink suppression and elevated PDR, suggesting active arousal to suppress irrelevant input. However, MS dynamics during Distractors were indistinguishable from control, implying that attention was not allocated to the distractors despite the heightened arousal. This dissociation supports the interpretation that MS is specifically modulated by attentional allocation, while PD and blinks also reflect general arousal or suppressive mechanisms. Overall, these findings reveal that PD, MS, and blinking capture distinct aspects of cognitive control. Together, they offer a multidimensional framework for studying selective attention and distractor suppression in complex tasks.

">The NOX2-ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome axis in traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Background: Phagocyte NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is an enzyme complex responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Chronic NOX2 activity sustains oxidative stress/damage and drives neuroinflammation following traumatic brain injury (TBI). NOX2 acts as a priming signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which also plays a role in secondary injury after TBI. GSK2795039 is a small molecule brain penetrable drug that inhibits NOX2 in a NADPH competitive manner. Here, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of NOX2 using GSK2795039 can reduce secondary neuroinflammation after TBI, specifically via inhibition of downstream NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in both resident microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells in the injured brain. Methods: Immortalised microglial (IMG) cells or primary microglia were pre-treated with GSK2795039 (NOX2 inhibitor) or MCC950 (NLRP3 inhibitor) and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and nigericin to induce NOX2/ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The controlled cortical impact model, pharmacokinetic analyses, multi-dimensional flow cytometry, histology and neurobehavioral assessments were used to translate in vitro findings to an experimental TBI model in adult male C57BL6/J mice. Results: The small molecule NOX2 inhibitor, GSK2795039, attenuated microglial NOX2 activity, thereby reducing ROS, nitrite and cytokine levels, as well as NLRP3 inflammasome components in pro-inflammatory microglia. TBI recruited NOX2/ROS/IL-1{beta}+ neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes into injured brain parenchyma with peak monocytic NOX2/ROS/IL-1{beta} production at 3 days post-injury (DPI), coincident with peak NOX2/ROS/IL-1{beta} expression in microglia. Systemic administration of GSK2795039 (100mg/kg; I.P.) starting 2 hours post-injury attenuated NOX2/IL-1{beta}+ microglial and infiltrating myeloid cell activation at 3 DPI. In addition, NOX2 inhibition reduced numbers of IL-1R+ T cells in the brain of TBI mice, indicating that myeloid-T cell crosstalk was altered by GSK2795039 treatment. Innate and adaptive neuroimmune changes were associated with improvements in motor function post-TBI. In the chronic phase through 28 DPI, pharmacological inhibition of NOX2 by GSK2795039 treatment resulted in modest improvements in neurobehavioral deficits and TBI neuropathology. Conclusions: These preclinical studies identify the NOX2-ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome axis along with myeloid-T cell crosstalk as effective targets for TBI neuroinflammation. Our translational studies indicate that NOX2 may be a promising therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation in microglia, and peripheral immune cells, following experimental TBI in mice.

">Introductory notes before zebra finch song have unique timing properties while sharing acoustic properties with song</a></h4>

              
                Preparatory neural activity precedes the initiation of simple movements and a key feature of this preparatory activity is its trial-by-trial correlation with features of the upcoming movement. Recent studies in the zebra finch, a songbird with a complex, naturally learned, movement sequence (song), have suggested that the repeats of short introductory notes (INs) at the start of each song bout, reflect motor preparation. However, whether IN properties correlate with upcoming song features remains poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by recording and analyzing male zebra finch songs over a 3 year period. We found bout-to-bout correlations in the acoustic features of the last IN and the first song syllable. However, similar correlations were present between the first song syllable and the first IN and the first and second song syllable suggesting that INs are also part of the song sequence. Next, we found an age-related increase in the mean IN number before song and song tempo. If INs reflected preparation of song parameters, we expected age-related song changes to be predicted by IN-song correlations at a younger age. We did not find any such correlations. Finally, we compared INs to other repeated syllables within song and outside song bouts and found that the speeding up of intervals between successive INs is unique to INs. Overall our results showing similarities in the acoustic features of INs and song syllables suggest shared neural control of INs and song syllables, while differences in timing suggest different neural mechanisms controlling IN timing.

">Analgesic actions of Intrathecal NaV 1.7 antisense in rats: loss of antagonist channel binding, message depletion, and neuraxial distribution of oligonucleotide</a></h4>

              
                Background: Genome targeting strategies to address NaV 1.7 mediated signaling in nociceptive afferents produce highly selective and persistent analgesic outcomes. Here, we analyze the concentration-dependent effects of the reduction of primary afferent NaV 1.7 channel expression by intrathecal delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide on pain behaviors and the covariance of Scn9a knock-down on NaV 1.7 message expression and channel binding. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with lumbar intrathecal catheters and dosed with different NaV 1.7 ASO concentrations (100 to 3000 & [micro]g;10 {micro}L). Pain behavior assays were conducted 0-28 days after ASO injections. Brain, spinal cords (SC) and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were collected. Quantification of ASO knock-down was assessed through RT-qPCR. NaV 1.7 expression was assessed by binding of NaV 1.7 fluorescent labeled antagonist (ATTO488PTx-II). Distribution studies were performed using anti-ASO antibody staining in brain, SCs and DRGs. Results: NaV 1.7 message was detected in nerve, DRG and SC. Intrathecal ASO induced a concentration dependent gradient of knock down in DRGs (lumbar to cervical) of Scn9a mRNA and ATTO488PTx-II binding in small DRG neurons, and in spinal parenchyma, and a suppression of pain behaviors initiated by mechanical compression, inflammation and following intraplantar NaV1.7 agonist (OD1) or formalin. At 1000 {micro}g, there was a 47% reduction in phase 2 flinching, a 60% reduction in DRG mRNA and a 36% reduction in ATTO488PTx-II DRG binding in comparison with mismatch controls. Although marked changes were seen at the sensory ganglia level and spinal dorsal horn, no changes in NaV 1.7 binding or mRNA were detected in sciatic nerves. Reduction in DRG message displayed a rostro-caudal gradient that corresponded with ASO distribution. Conclusions: The study presents how NaV 1.7 ASOs reduce primary afferent channel binding through an effective knock-down on Scn9a mRNA, and channel binding leading to a covariate reduction in pain behavior.

">Glutamatergic Dysfunction of Astrocytes in Paraventricular Nucleus of Thalamus Contributes to Adult Anxiety Susceptibility in Adolescent Ethanol Exposed Mice</a></h4>

              
                Repeated ethanol exposure during adolescence increases the risk for displaying anxiogenic phenotype in adulthood, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The paraventricular nucleus of thalamus (PVT) has been considered a hub brain area for controlling the anxiety network in the brain. Recent structural and functional investigations indicate that the PVT exhibits diverse neural signals aligned with early-life events, which are highly linked with anxiety-like behaviors. However, it remains unknown if repeated ethanol exposure during adolescence will affect the coordinated brain activities of the PVT in adulthood, and consequent behavioral adaptation. Here we show that adolescent repeated intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) triggers anxiety-like behaviors and parallelly induces the glutamatergic adaptation in the PVT after four weeks withdrawal from the last ethanol exposure. The firing rates, along with the spatiotemporal calcium transients in the PVT neurons during behavior were increased in the AIE mice compared to those in the counterpart control mice. Importantly, with the chemogenetic inhibition of the PVT neurons, we found alleviated the anxiety-like behavior in the AIE mice. The increased neuronal activities in the PVT of AIE mice was, at least partly, via the reduction of GLT1 (an astrocyte dominant glutamate transporter, known as EAAT2, slc1a2). Our non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures also showed an increase in glutamate/GABA ratio in the thalamic area including the PVT of the GLT1 conditional knock-down mice, which exhibited the heightened anxiety-like behavior. In addition, while the selective knock-out of GLT1 in the astrocytes of PVT in the alcohol naive mice induces anxiogenic phenotypes, the selective upregulation of GLT1 in the PVT astrocytes of the mice that were treated with AIE paradigm alleviated the anxiety-like behaviors as well. These findings highlight the significant role of PVT astrocytic GLT1 in the anxiogenic phenotype in adulthood induced by withdrawal from adolescent repeated ethanol exposure, suggesting that GLT1 in the PVT could serve as a therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder and comorbid emotional disorders.

">NaviGraph</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in neuroscience have enabled simultaneous collection of multimodal datasets, including behavioral tracking, physiological signals, and neuronal recordings. Yet most analysis tools process these streams independently, often requiring manual alignment and custom code. This fragmentation limits reproducibility and interpretability at the experiment level, particularly in models where cognitive impairments are subtle, and reflects a broader tendency to analyze behavior as isolated events rather than as a structured process. Topological methods, though successful in other domains, remain underused in behavioral neuroscience, leaving the architecture of decision-making largely unexplored. To address these, we developed NaviGraph (Navigation on the Graph), a flexible, open-source pipeline designed to integrate diverse data types into a unified graph-based framework suited for spatial decision-making studies. By modeling decision points as graph nodes and populating them with behavioral, neuronal, and physiological parameters, NaviGraph offers a holistic, multi-layered perspective on cognition, enabling computation of spatial and topological metrics. This approach shifts the focus from isolated modalities to comprehensive interpretation, making behavioral patterns more accessible and easier to validate across datastreams. We applied NaviGraph to a trial-based spatial memory task in a complex maze and uncovered nuanced sex- and genotype-specific differences. In a knock-in model of Apolipoprotein {epsilon}E (apoE4), the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, females exhibited deficits detectable only through topological metrics, including inefficient navigation and increased visits to decision points, aligning with the heightened cognitive vulnerability observed in female apoE4 human carriers. Wildtype females, in contrast, displayed more direct recall navigation compared to males. To demonstrate NaviGraph's multimodal capabilities, we mapped neuronal activity from head-mounted miniaturized microscope calcium imaging in the retrosplenial cortex, an area extensively involved in path integration, alongside head orientation dynamics and behavioral trajectories onto the graph structure. This unified framework enabled visualization of decision-point-specific neuronal activity patterns, subpopulation dynamics linked to path familiarity, and physiological- behavioral alignment. With its modular architecture, NaviGraph supports diverse maze configurations and data types, providing a holistic, interpretable, and high-resolution tool for spatial navigation and cognitive research.

">Increased vulnerability to noise exposure of low spontaneous rate type 1C spiral ganglion neuron synapses with inner hair cells (Pre-Print)</a></h4>

              
                The inner hair cells (IHCs) in the inner ear form synapses with auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) that send sound signals to the brain. ANFs have been grouped by their level of spontaneous firing rates (SRs) into high-, medium-, and low-SR ANFs. Based on their molecular profiles evaluated by RNAseq experiments, ANFs have been divided into three groups (1A, 1B, and 1C) that likely correspond to high-, medium-, and low-SR ANFs, respectively. In guinea pigs, the synapses between IHCs and low-SR ANFs have been shown to be more vulnerable to noise exposure compared to other ANF subtypes, but not in a study performed in CBA/CaJ mice, questioning if these results can be generalized. Here, an LYPD1 reporter mouse model on a C57Bl/6J background with specifically labeled group 1C, low-SR ANFs was used to examine whether LYPD1 positive ANF synapses are more vulnerable to noise exposure. Six-week-old mice were exposed to an 8-16 kHz octave band noise presented at 100 dBA for 2 hours. One week later, cochlear tissue was harvested to quantify ANF synapses and compare the percentage of LYPD1 positive ANF synapses in noise-exposed and unexposed animals. Auditory brainstem response measurements were performed to assess hearing function after noise exposure. The number of all ANF synapses and the percentage of LYPD1-positive ANF synapses were reduced following noise exposure, concurrent with increased ABR thresholds and decreased ABR wave 1 amplitudes. The reduction in the percentage of LYPD1-positive ANF synapses specifically indicates greater vulnerability of LYPD1 positive ANF synapses to noise exposure compared to other ANFs in C57Bl/6J mice.

">The semantics of dreams</a></h4>

              
                Dreams are universal yet deeply personal experiences. While memory and personal concerns influence dream content, the impact of other individual, generalizable traits remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we built a multimodal dataset including dream and wakefulness reports, alongside demographic, psychometric, cognitive, and sleep-related measures in a large adult cohort. Natural language processing characterized the semantic features that quantitatively distinguish dream from wakefulness reports, with this distinction significantly modulated by individual-specific factors. Longitudinal and cross-sample analyses further demonstrated that major external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affect dream content, leaving lasting traces. Overall, the findings highlight a dynamic interplay between stable individual traits and external events in shaping dream experiences, offering novel insights into the cognitive and emotional architecture of dreaming.

">Endotoxemia-induced inflammation in the absence of obesity decreases anxiety-like and impulsive behavior without affecting learning and memory</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is associated with increased gut permeability, which contributes to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Obesity is also linked with altered neurocognitive functions, including impaired learning and memory. Whether these changes are secondary to neuroinflammation vs. other comorbidities associated with obesity is unknown. Here, we modeled the chronic low-grade inflammation that accompanies diet-induced obesity, but in the absence of obesity or consumption of an obesogenic diet. Male rats were implanted with intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps, continuously dispensing either saline (control) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin produced in the gut that triggers inflammation when in circulation. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that LPS exposure led to neuroinflammation, with an increased number of Ionized Calcium-Binding Molecule 1 (Iba1+) cells in the amygdala and hippocampus in LPS rats vs. controls. Given that these brain regions are associated with impulse control, anxiety-like behavior, and learning and memory, we tested whether chronic LPS treatment impacted these behaviors. Interestingly, LPS exposure did not affect hippocampal-dependent memory in the Morris water maze, novel location recognition, or novel object in context memory tests, suggesting that neuroinflammation in the absence of obesity does not induce memory impairments. Further, chronic LPS significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior in the open field test and food impulsivity in an operant-based procedure. LPS animals also had significantly lower corticosterone and melatonin levels when compared to controls, which may contribute to these behavioral outcomes. These results suggest that the low-grade inflammation associated with obesity is not driving obesity-associated memory impairments but does reduce anxiety and food-motivated impulsive responses.

                Seizure-associated cognitive co-morbidities can substantially reduce the quality of life in people with epilepsy. Neuroinflammation is an invariant feature of all chronic neurologic diseases, including epilepsy, and acute brain insults, including status epilepticus (SE). The generalized seizures of SE trigger a robust inflammatory response involving astrocytosis, erosion of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), activation of brain-resident microglia, and recruitment of blood-borne CCR2+ monocytes into the brain. We have shown that blocking monocyte recruitment into the brain via global Ccr2 knockout or systemic CCR2 antagonism with a small molecule alleviates multiple deleterious SE-induced pathologies, including BBB damage, microgliosis, neuronal damage, and monocyte brain invasion in the days following pilocarpine-induced SE. This study aimed to determine if fleeting CCR2 antagonism improves SE-associated cognitive impairments in the long term. Here, we show that the brief antagonism of CCR2 eliminates the profound deficit in working memory in the Y-maze and retention memory in the novel object recognition test but does not attenuate anxiety-like behavior in the open field arena. Microgliosis and astrocytosis were observed in brain sections from SE mice after the behavioral tests, and CA1 hippocampal astrocytosis mildly correlated with performance in the Y-maze. Notably, SE mice exposed to the vehicle showed robust neuronal loss in the cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus, and mice treated with the CCR2 antagonist showed less neurodegeneration in both the cortex and hippocampus. Our results indicate that monocyte brain infiltration after SE opens a window for preventing cognitive co-morbidities and neurodegeneration with an orally available CCR2 antagonist.

">Rapid FFR: A rapid method for obtaining Frequency Following Responses</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Frequency-Following Responses (FFRs) are typically recorded using stimuli of 40-250 ms in duration separated by silent intervals. Because robust FFRs require averaging across approximately 3000 stimulus repetitions, conventional acquisition is time-intensive. We introduce the Rapid FFR, a technique that minimises recording time by presenting the stimulus continuously (i.e., without interstimulus intervals) and by averaging across individual response cycles. This study aimed to: (a) compare Rapid and Conventional FFR performance under time matched conditions; (b) assess test-retest reliability of both methods, and (c) examine potential neural adaptation during extended Rapid FFR recordings. Design: All participants (37 in total) were young adults with clinically normal hearing. In Experiment 1, FFRs were elicited from 16 listeners using a 128 Hz sawtooth wave presented in two ways: (1) continuously over approximately 1 minute in each polarity for the Rapid FFR and (2) as discrete tone bursts (1500 trials per polarity) for the standard FFR. Signal-to-Noise ratios (SNRs), response amplitudes, and test-retest reliability were compared across techniques. In Experiment 2, the Rapid FFR was recorded continuously from 21 listeners for nearly nine minutes to assess potential adaptation over time. Results: The Rapid FFR produced significantly higher SNRs than the standard FFR, reflecting improved recording efficiency. Both techniques captured inter-individual differences reliably, with comparable frequency-domain response patterns across participants. In particular, measures derived from the Rapid FFR showed strong agreement with those from the standard FFR for lower harmonics (F0-H3). Higher harmonics (H4-H7) exhibited greater variability but remained consistent between techniques. In the prolonged recording condition, FFR amplitudes remained stable over time, with no significant decline across the nine-minute recording. This indicates that continuous stimulation did not result in measurable neural adaptation or response fatigue. Conclusions: The Rapid FFR offers a time-efficient alternative to standard protocols, preserving signal fidelity and reliability while enabling shorter acquisition times. These findings suggest that the Rapid FFR is well-suited for use in populations where long recordings are challenging (e.g., in infants and the clinic) and can facilitate more extensive experimental designs within a single session. The method holds promise for advancing both research and clinical applications of the FFR. Future studies should explore its use across a broader range of sounds (in particular, dynamically varying ones) and listener groups.

">Spatial distance and temporal attentional focus modulate voluntary action preparation and awareness</a></h4>

              
                Peripersonal space (PPS)-the immediate space surrounding the body-modulates perception and motor control. However, its impact on how voluntary actions are initiated and subjectively experienced remains underexplored. Similarly, how directing attention to different phases of an action, such as intention formation versus execution, and anticipating outcomes of an action, modulates the neural readiness for movement, has yet to be fully examined. This study investigates whether spatial proximity, attentional focus, and anticipated action outcomes influence action preparation and action awareness, using a virtual reality adaptation of the Libet clock paradigm during EEG recordings. Neural results reveal that attentional focus and anticipated action outcomes modulate different phases of motor preparation, as indexed by the readiness potential (RP)-a gradual buildup of neural activity preceding voluntary movement. Focusing on decision timing (without subsequent action outcomes) enhances early RP amplitude and decreases the late RP slope, suggesting increased preparatory neural engagement during intention formation. In contrast, focusing on action execution leads to a steeper late RP slope, indicating later and faster motor activity buildup when attention is directed toward movement onset. Anticipating action outcomes increased late RP slope, which was accompanied by the temporal binding effect: when a tone followed the action, both decision and action estimates shifted toward it. Spatial proximity influences RP dynamics specifically in tasks when participants focused on their intention to act in the absence of an outcome. Behavioural results show that actions are perceived as occurring earlier when the clock is displayed near compared to far, indicating that PPS influences the temporal perception of action timing. Overall, these findings highlight the dynamic interplay among external spatial context and internal cognitive processes in shaping motor preparation and action awareness. Importantly, a temporal internal attentional focus on intention to act modulates early RP-traditionally considered an unconscious stage of neural readiness. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of how PPS and the locus of attention on specific action phases affect action preparation and awareness, with potential implications for future research on the sense of agency and voluntary action decision making.

">Cell type distribution of intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide activity in deep brain regions of non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Intrathecally administered RNase H1-active gapmer antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are promising therapeutics for brain diseases where lowering the expression of one target gene is expected to be therapeutically beneficial. Such ASOs are active, to varying degrees, across most or all cell types in the cortex and cerebellum of mouse and non-human primate (NHP), brain regions with substantial drug accumulation. Intrathecally delivered ASOs, however, exhibit a gradient of exposure across the brain, with more limited drug accumulation and weaker target engagement in deep brain regions of NHP. Here, we profiled the activity of a tool ASO against Malat1 in three deep brain regions of NHP: thalamus, caudate, and putamen. All neuronal subtypes exhibited knockdown similar to, or deeper than, the bulk tissue. Among non-neuronal cells, knockdown was deepest in microglia and weakest in endothelial stalk. Overall, we observed broad target engagement across all cell types detected, supporting the relevance of intrathecal ASOs to diseases with deep brain involvement.

">A hierarchy of time constants and reliable signal propagation in the marmoset cortex</a></h4>

              
                A hierarchy of timescales in the cortex is functionally desirable for rapid information processing in sensory areas and slow time integration in association areas. Here, through an analysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) data, we identified a timescale hierarchy in the cortex of marmoset, a primate species commonly used in neuroscience. Constrained by the anatomical and electrophysiological data, we developed a multi-regional model of the marmoset cortex that captures the observed timescale hierarchy phenomenon. Furthermore, we used the model to investigate how the cortex reconciles information integration on distinct timescales in local areas with reliable signal propagation globally across regions. We found that a near-criticality state is optimal for both localized signal integration within areas and reliable signal propagation across areas in the multi-regional cortex. Our model also mechanically explains recent experimental observations that the structural and functional connectivities are less correlated in association areas than in sensory areas.

">Enkephalinergic Neurons Gate Sex-Specific Control of Voluntary Micturition</a></h4>

              
                Barrington's nucleus (Bar) is a brainstem hub essential for lower urinary tract (LUT) function, yet the molecular identity and functional specialization of its neuronal subtypes remain poorly defined. Here, we construct a single-nucleus transcriptional atlas of Bar and identify an excitatory Penk-expressing population of (BarPenk) critical for LUT regulation. BarPenk neurons are active selectively during voiding, when the external urethral sphincter (EUS) relaxes, and their optogenetic activation elicits time-locked suppression of EUS activity. Chemogenetic activation of these neurons induces a sex-specific, aberrant pattern of micturition behavior, while targeted ablation impairs voluntary marking behavior in response to female cues. We observe multiple regions involved in visceromotor regulation and behavioral state control projecting to BarPenk neurons, supporting their role as integrators of internal state and environmental context to drive urinary output. These findings provide new insights into the brainstem circuits that shape reflexive and voluntary micturition, and highlight how discrete neuronal subtypes contribute to sexually dimorphic regulation of LUT function.

">3D organoids containing endothelial and neural cells generation by serial inductions of differentiation on human iPSC-derived embryoid bodies</a></h4>

              
                3D brain organoids have been widely used as a tool to study human brain development and disorders. Although endothelial cells play important roles in the brain development and pathogenesis in neurological disorders, most 3D brain organoids lack inherent endothelial cells and need either the addition of endothelial cells or to be transplanted to animals to reconstitute such vascular structures, likely missing the developmental interactions of endothelial cells and other cells in the human brain. In order to reconstitute a 3D organoid mimicking the in vivo neural and endothelial cells development, we cultured iPSC-derived embryoid bodies in sequentially applied endothelial and neuronal induction media along with Matrigel embedding. The resulting 3D organoid consists of both neural cells and endothelial cells with vascular like structures, as determined by immunostaining. With scRNA-Seq analysis, the brain organoid was confirmed to contain neural cell types similar with human brains, including a variety of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and glia. Furthermore, when compared with traditional cerebral organoids without endothelial cells using RNA-Seq analysis, the endothelial containing neural organoids (EC-neural organoids) showed difference in gene profiles and favored angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Of the differentially expressed genes, KRBA2 expression was found higher in neural cells and its inhibition by siRNA treatment resulted in decreased transcriptions of a variety of genes such as neuronal differentiation specific genes but not in genes specific to pluripotent stem cells such as OCT4. The EC-neural organoids also express receptors to SARS-CoV-2 similar to human brains. This 3D model provides a useful tool to study the interactions of endothelial cells and neural cells in the brain development and neural infectious disorders where endothelial cells and pericytes play pivotal roles.

                <p>Distinct frontal regions make dissociable contributions to rule-guided decision-making, including the ability to learn and exploit associations between abstract rules and reward value, maintain those rules in memory, and evaluate choice outcomes. Value-based learning can be quantified using reinforcement learning (RL) models predicting optimal trial-wise choices and estimating learning rates, which can then be related to the intact functioning of specific brain areas by combining a modeling approach with lesion-behavioral data. We applied a three-parameter feedback-dependent RL model to behavioral data obtained from macaques with circumscribed lesions to the principal sulcus (PS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (sdlPFC), and frontopolar cortex (FPC) performing a Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) analog. Our modeling-based approach identified distinct lesion effects on component cognitive mechanisms contributing to WCST performance. OFC lesions decreased the rate of rule value updating following both positive and negative feedback. In contrast, we found no deficit in rule value updating following PS lesions, which instead made monkeys less likely to repeat correct choices when rule values were well established, suggesting a crucial role of the PS in the working memory maintenance of rule representations. Finally, ACC lesions produced a specific deficit in learning from negative feedback, as well as impaired the ability to repeat choices following highly surprising reward, supporting a proposed role for ACC in flexibly switching between a trial-and-error mode and a working memory mode in response to increased error likelihood.</p>

                <p>In the mammalian primary visual cortex (V1), there are complex interactions between responses to stimuli present in the cell&rsquo;s classical receptive field (CRF) or "center" and in the surrounding region or "surround." The circuit mechanisms underlying these behaviors are likely to represent more general cortical mechanisms for integrating information. Here, we develop a circuit model that accounts for three important features of surround suppression (suppression of response to a center stimulus by addition of a surround stimulus): (1) The surround stimulus suppresses the inhibitory and excitatory currents that the cell receives; (2) The strongest suppression arises when the surround orientation matches that of the center stimulus, even when the center stimulus orientation differs from the cell&rsquo;s preferred orientation; and (3) A surround stimulus of a given orientation most strongly suppresses that orientation&rsquo;s component of the response to a plaid center stimulus ("feature-specific suppression"). We show that a stabilized supralinear network (SSN) with biologically plausible connectivity and synaptic efficacies that depend on cortical distance and orientation difference between units can consistently reproduce phenomena (1) and (3), and, qualitatively, phenomenon (2). We explain the mechanism behind each result. We argue that phenomena (2) and (3) are independent: the model with some aspects of connectivity removed still produces phenomenon (3) but not (2). The model reproduces the rapid time scale of activity decay observed in mouse V1 when thalamic input to V1 is silenced. Finally, we show that these results hold both in networks with rate-based and conductance-based spiking units. </p>

                Stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. The advent of nanotechnology, particularly oxygen-delivering nanobubbles (ODNBs), has introduced a promising avenue for enhancing stroke therapy. ODNBs have demonstrated the ability to improve oxygen delivery, enhance therapeutic efficacy, and provide diagnostic advantages through imaging contrast enhancement. However, challenges such as toxicity, off-target effects, and regulatory hurdles must be addressed before clinical translation. This review synthesizes the latest findings on ODNBs in stroke therapy, highlights their key benefits and challenges, and explores future applications, including gene therapy and brain tissue regeneration. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential of ODNBs in revolutionizing stroke treatment.

                Background Globally, stunting remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In Egypt, it affects approximately 33% of children under five and contributes to a 2–3% reduction in the country’s gross domestic product. Therefore, this study examined the trends in the prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among children under five and 0-59 months in Egypt. Methods This survey used combined data from the 2005, 2008, and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS), with a total sample of 39,857 children aged 0-59 months. A multilevel logistic regression that adjusts for sampling weights and clustering was performed to analyse the factors associated with stunting among children in Egypt. Results The prevalence of stunting was 24.8% in children aged 0-23 months, 24.3% in children aged 24-59 months, and 24.5 % in children aged 0-59 months. After controlling for potential confounders, the common factors associated with stunting in three age groups were mothers with primary education and mothers who did not have an antenatal care (ANC) visit during pregnancy. Maternal short stature (height < 155 cm) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in three age groups compared to mothers taller than 160 cm. Conclusion A coordinated approach across health, WASH, education, and social protection is essential to address stunting in Egypt. Interventions should target high-risk groups, particularly those with low socioeconomic status, focusing on healthcare access, parental education, and infant feeding practices. While short maternal height increases risk, interventions must also tackle broader factors like food security and sanitation. A nutrition monitoring framework integrated into health systems will enable data collection, evidence-based actions, and progress tracking. Effective implementation requires cost-effective, scalable solutions, community involvement, and resource prioritisation to ensure sustainability and equity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-287/v2?src=rss">Progress and challenges for the application of machine learning for neglected tropical diseases [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) continue to affect the livelihood of individuals in countries in the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific region. These diseases have been long existing and have caused devastating health problems and economic decline to people in low- and middle-income (developing) countries. An estimated 1.7 billion of the world’s population suffer one or more NTDs annually, this puts approximately one in five individuals at risk for NTDs. In addition to health and social impact, NTDs inflict significant financial burden to patients, close relatives, and are responsible for billions of dollars lost in revenue from reduced labor productivity in developing countries alone. There is an urgent need to better improve the control and eradication or elimination efforts towards NTDs. This can be achieved by utilizing machine learning tools to better the surveillance, prediction and detection program, and combat NTDs through the discovery of new therapeutics against these pathogens. This review surveys the current application of machine learning tools for NTDs and the challenges to elevate the state-of-the-art of NTDs surveillance, management, and treatment.
