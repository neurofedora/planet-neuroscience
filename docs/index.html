              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A training curriculum for retrieving, structuring, and aggregating information derived from the biomedical literature and large-scale data repositories. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biomedical research over the past two decades has become data and information rich. This trend has been in large part driven by the development of systems-scale molecular profiling capabilities and by the increasingly large volume of publications contributed by the biomedical research community. It has therefore become important for early career researchers to learn to leverage this wealth of information in their own research. Methods: Here we describe in detail a training curriculum focusing on the development of foundational skills necessary to retrieve, structure, and aggregate information available from vast stores of publicly available information. It is provided along with supporting material and an illustrative use case. The stepwise workflow encompasses; 1) Selecting a candidate gene; 2) Retrieving background information about the gene; 3) Profiling its literature; 4) Identifying in the literature instances where its transcript abundance changes in blood of patients; 5) Retrieving transcriptional profiling data from public blood transcriptome and reference datasets; and 6) Drafting a manuscript, submitting it for peer-review, and publication. Results: This resource may be leveraged by instructors who wish to organize hands-on workshops. It can also be used by independent trainees as a self-study toolkit. The workflow presented as proof-of-concept was designed to establish a resource for assessing a candidate gene’s potential utility as a blood transcriptional biomarker. Trainees will learn to retrieve literature and public transcriptional profiling data associated with a specific gene of interest. They will also learn to extract, structure, and aggregate this information to support downstream interpretation efforts as well as the preparation of a manuscript. Conclusions: This resource should support early career researchers in their efforts to acquire skills that will permit them to leverage the vast amounts of publicly available large-scale profiling data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Facilitating bias in cost-effectiveness analysis: CHEERS 2022 and the creation of assumption-driven imaginary value claims in health technology assessment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The current standards for health technology cost-effectiveness assessment rest on the creation of lifetime assumption-driven modeled simulations for imaginary pricing and consequent patient access recommendations. A recent BMJ paper reports a detailed assessment of 8,192 cost-effectiveness analyses, concluding that industry-sponsored modeled claims were more likely to publish incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below a USD 50,000 threshold than non-industry sponsored studies, supporting the claim that the product was cost-effective. This is unsurprising; indeed, the opposite can occur with a modeled claim deliberately resulting in ICER is excess of USD 50,000. This methodology is well entrenched with the recently published Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 guidance for creating imaginary cost-effectiveness modeled claims ensuring the opportunity for deliberately manipulated cost-effectiveness claims. This overlooks limitations imposed by fundamental measurement, rendering assumption-driven simulations redundant analytical exercises. Manipulation of ICERs and claims for cost-effectiveness are mathematically impossible; including cost-utility thresholds, because the preference or utilities supporting creation of quality-of-life years (QALYs) are ordinal scores. Nevertheless, with the promotion of CHEERS 2022, the belief in imaginary modeled value claims is both facilitated and reinforced. With CHEERS 2022, there is a concerted effort, largely in self-interest, to perpetuate the current belief system. This is a self-defeating strategy. Rather than admitting to the deficiencies of assumption-driven simulated imaginary claims, leaders are maintaining that health system decision makers can ignore standards of normal science and fundamental measurement in value claims for pharmaceutical products. This disregard of standards that are commonplace in the sciences and mainstream social sciences perpetuates the opportunity for self-serving modeled claims; where models are a marketing vehicle leading to sponsored systematic bias in formulary submissions. This supports the need for a NEW START paradigm for health technology assessment, focusing on evaluable single-attribute value claims, meeting the required standards for normal science and fundamental measurement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A digital workflow in the treatment of bruxism in a young patient [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Bruxism is increasingly common in today's stressful world and affects mainly young patients. It is a combined disease that involves dentition and its supporting structures, muscles, ligaments and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Here we present a complete combined analog and digital clinical protocol in a patient with parafunction. A young patient sought help due to impaired aesthetics, as a result of abraded tooth surfaces and severe symptoms of TMJ. We implemented a therapeutic protocol of six stages: deprogramming of the muscles and determination of treatment position and digital optimization; realization of the morphological plan for the upper dentition; non-invasive repositioning of the lower jaw by splint therapy; splint placement and follow-up; morphological planning of the lower dentition and replacement of the splint with fixed prosthesis with follow-up; and completion of the case with ceramic restorations. The digitally modeled temporary constructions for the upper jaw were made of PMMA and placed in the patient's mouth together with the splint on the lower jaw, made of Ceramill Splintec. After an adaptation period, all restorations were replaced by permanent zirconia. We achieved restoration of the defects of the dental arches and hard dental tissues and recovery to normal height of the lower third of the face (vertical dimension occlusion), fixed a stable and balanced position of the lower jaw, and repaired the normal physiological position of the TMJ for the patient. Аfter a multi-stage treatment we received a result satisfying the patient, the dentist and the dental technician. Aesthetics and function were restored, and clinical symptoms were removed from the TMJ.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An observational cross-sectional study on breast cancer patients’ knowledge of their disease: A likely cause of depression and anxiety [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aimed to assess breast cancer awareness among patients undergoing active treatment for breast cancer at Day Hospital, assess their quality of life (QoL), and explore the association between minor knowledge of the disease and higher levels of anxiety. Methods: This prospective observational study included patients with breast cancer undergoing active treatment at the Instituto Português de Oncologia Coimbra. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, QLQ-INFO25, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were completed, and demographic and clinical data were collected and processed using SPSSÒ. Results: In total, 188 patients with breast cancer were included. A vast majority had a positive perception of their QoL, with a higher average value compared to “cognitive functioning” (c=77.22±22.53), “social functioning” (76.86±25.41), and “physical functioning” (75.67±17.24). Regarding the information received, an overall “score” below the “cut-off line” (47.96±14.40) was observed. When evaluating “satisfaction” in isolation, the average value for “satisfaction with the information received” was 53.55±23.99, and patients perceived that the information received was beneficial to them (67.38±23.87) and did not wish to have received less information (99.47±7.29). With decreased functionality, higher levels of depression and anxiety were observed (p<0.0001). Regarding “information related to illness and anxiety/depression”, it was noted that as satisfaction with information decreased, patients tended to have higher levels of anxiety/depression (p<0.013). Conclusions: It is necessary to create dedicated spaces for information and clinical clarification, with regular assessments of patients’ perceptions. The information provided must be reinforced through written or digital support, or brochures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of a novel variant in the HR1 domain of MFN2 in a patient with ataxia, optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pathogenic variants in MFN2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2A (CMT2A) and are the leading cause of the axonal subtypes of CMT. CMT2A is characterized by predominantly distal motor weakness and muscle atrophy, with highly variable severity and onset age. Notably, some MFN2 variants can also lead to other phenotypes such as optic atrophy, hearing loss and lipodystrophy. Despite the clear link between MFN2 and CMT2A, our mechanistic understanding of how dysfunction of the MFN2 protein causes human disease pathologies remains incomplete. This lack of understanding is due in part to the multiple cellular roles of MFN2. Though initially characterized for its role in mediating mitochondrial fusion, MFN2 also plays important roles in mediating interactions between mitochondria and other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Additionally, MFN2 is also important for mitochondrial transport, mitochondrial autophagy, and has even been implicated in lipid transfer. Though over 100 pathogenic MFN2 variants have been described to date, only a few have been characterized functionally, and even then, often only for one or two functions. Method: Several MFN2-mediated functions were characterized in fibroblast cells from a patient presenting with cerebellar ataxia, deafness, blindness, and diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, who harbours a novel homozygous MFN2 variant, D414V, which is found in a region of the HR1 domain of MFN2 where few pathogenic variants occur. Results: We found evidence for impairment of several MFN2-mediated functions. Consistent with reduced mitochondrial fusion, patient fibroblasts exhibited more fragmented mitochondrial networks and had reduced mtDNA copy number. Additionally, patient fibroblasts had reduced oxygen consumption, fewer mitochondrial-ER contacts, and altered lipid droplets that displayed an unusual perinuclear distribution. Conclusion: Overall, this work characterizes D414V as a novel variant in MFN2 and expands the phenotypic presentation of MFN2 variants to include cerebellar ataxia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The state of the art of the electronic bill of lading [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The shipping industry is widely regarded as a slow adapting industry, for any innovation to be made there needs to be a real demand. One of these innovations is the electronic Bill of Lading. The need for an alternative to the expensive and slow traditional Bill of Lading has been rising since the beginning of the century. Now the digital revolution naturally introduced the electronic Bill of Lading, but its unclear legal status and different regulations in different countries make it hard to establish a worldwide solution. Nevertheless, there has been progress and the current focus on standardization along with the many advantages of blockchain technology may take it a step closer to a worldwide adoption. Methods: This paper aims to provide information about the most relevant providers of electronic bills of lading, with a clear focus on the underlying technology, in order to make a grounded analysis about each technological solution individually and in general. Results and Conclusions: The information presented was gathered by searching existing literature and public information from the technology providers, focusing on the technology and avoiding law matters.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Women’s access to health care for non-communicable diseases in South Africa: A scoping review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension (HPT), and type II diabetes (T2D) are of increasing concern in South Africa (SA), with women being more at risk. Authors conducted a scoping review to identify and map the evidence available about the barriers of access to obesity, HPT, and T2D care among women in SA. Methods: Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review was used. The search of the literature was completed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases between April and May 2022. Only studies conducted among women in SA were eligible for inclusion. Identified barriers were mapped onto Levesque’s framework of access to health care to determine which points along the chain of accessing NCD health care among women are mostly impacted. Results: Seven articles were included in the review: qualitative (n=2), quantitative (n=2), mixed methods (n=2), and grey literature (n=1). The included studies reported barriers of access to HPT and T2D care only, and no study reported barriers to obesity care. Supply-side barriers included lack of knowledge about available services, physician heavy workloads, medicine stock-outs, limited availability of testing equipment, unaffordable transport costs, travelling longer distances, inefficiently longer waiting times, and delayed referral. Demand-side barriers included women having low self-awareness of NCD status, concerns about confidentiality, perceived discrimination, and poverty. Conclusions: Access to HPT and T2D services is impacted from perception of need to benefitting from care. Articles included identified barriers affecting the availability and accommodation dimension of access to care, suggesting that HPT and T2D care is often unavailable or that women are unable to reach health facilities or service providers. There is need for more and better-quality research about access to NCD health care in SA, especially among women having a disproportionately high burden of obesity, T2D, and HPT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differences in the length of postoperative care of endoscopic endonasal surgery in simple and complex surgical procedure groups [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The rapid development of endoscopic endonasal surgery has made the procedure widely used in nasal and sinus surgery. Endoscopic endonasal surgery is a minimally invasive procedure, but the possibility of postoperative damage to the sinonasal mucosa cannot be ruled out. The aim of this study was to analyze the difference in the length of postoperative care between complex and simple endoscopic endonasal surgeries which can be used as a reference in planning postoperative care.   Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional observational study. The participants were divided into two groups, i.e., simple, and complex surgical procedures groups. The simple procedure group consisted of middle meatal anstrostomy, uncinectomy, endoscopic septoplasty, and endoscopic turbinoplasty. The complex procedure group included frontal sinusotomy, sphenoidectomy, as well as anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy. The length of postoperative care between the two groups were measured and analyzed using the Chi-square test.   Results: The median length of care in the complex procedure group was significantly longer than that in the simple procedure group (p = 0.028), 12 weeks and 9 weeks, respectively. The number of postoperative outpatient visits was significantly less in the simple procedure group compared with the complex procedure group (Median 4 vs. 5; p=0.015). There was a significant correlation between length of care and the endonasal endoscopic surgical procedure group (p = 0.023).   Conclusions: The complex endoscopic endonasal surgery group required a longer length of care and more postoperative outpatient visit than the simple procedure group.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal anti-amyloid-beta therapy for Alzheimer’s disease via a personalized mathematical model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wenrui Hao, Suzanne Lenhart, Jeffrey R. Petrella</p>

With the recent approval by the FDA of the first disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), personalized medicine will be increasingly important for appropriate management and counseling of patients with AD and those at risk. The growing availability of clinical biomarker data and data-driven computational modeling techniques provide an opportunity for new approaches to individualized AD therapeutic planning. In this paper, we develop a new mathematical model, based on AD cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI biomarkers, to provide a personalized optimal treatment plan for individuals. This model is parameterized by biomarker data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, a large multi-institutional database monitoring the natural history of subjects with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Optimal control theory is used to incorporate time-varying treatment controls and side-effects into the model, based on recent clinical trial data, to provide a personalized treatment regimen with anti-amyloid-beta therapy. In-silico treatment studies were conducted on the approved treatment, aducanumab, as well as on another promising anti-amyloid-beta therapy under evaluation, donanemab. Clinical trial simulations were conducted over both short-term (78 weeks) and long-term (10 years) periods with low-dose (6 mg/kg) and high-dose (10 mg/kg) regimens for aducanumab, and a single-dose regimen (1400 mg) for donanemab. Results confirm those of actual clinical trials showing a large and sustained effect of both aducanumab and donanemab on amyloid beta clearance. The effect on slowing cognitive decline was modest for both treatments, but greater for donanemab. This optimal treatment computational modeling framework can be applied to other single and combination treatments for both prediction and optimization, as well as incorporate new clinical trial data as it becomes available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamical modeling of the H3K27 epigenetic landscape in mouse embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kapil Newar, Amith Zafal Abdulla, Hossein Salari, Eric Fanchon, Daniel Jost</p>

The Polycomb system via the methylation of the lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) plays central roles in the silencing of many lineage-specific genes during development. Recent experimental evidence suggested that the recruitment of histone modifying enzymes like the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) at specific sites and their spreading capacities from these sites are key to the establishment and maintenance of a proper epigenomic landscape around Polycomb-target genes. Here, to test whether such mechanisms, as a minimal set of qualitative rules, are quantitatively compatible with data, we developed a mathematical model that can predict the locus-specific distributions of H3K27 modifications based on previous biochemical knowledge. Within the biological context of mouse embryonic stem cells, our model showed quantitative agreement with experimental profiles of H3K27 acetylation and methylation around Polycomb-target genes in wild-type and mutants. In particular, we demonstrated the key role of the reader-writer module of PRC2 and of the competition between the binding of activating and repressing enzymes in shaping the H3K27 landscape around transcriptional start sites. The predicted dynamics of establishment and maintenance of the repressive trimethylated H3K27 state suggest a slow accumulation, in perfect agreement with experiments. Our approach represents a first step towards a quantitative description of PcG regulation in various cellular contexts and provides a generic framework to better characterize epigenetic regulation in normal or disease situations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-order functional redundancy in ageing explained via alterations in the connectome in a whole-brain model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marilyn Gatica, Fernando E. Rosas, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Ibai Diez, Stephan P. Swinnen, Patricio Orio, Rodrigo Cofré, Jesus M. Cortes</p>

The human brain generates a rich repertoire of spatio-temporal activity patterns, which support a wide variety of motor and cognitive functions. These patterns of activity change with age in a multi-factorial manner. One of these factors is the variations in the brain’s connectomics that occurs along the lifespan. However, the precise relationship between high-order functional interactions and connnectomics, as well as their variations with age are largely unknown, in part due to the absence of mechanistic models that can efficiently map brain connnectomics to functional connectivity in aging. To investigate this issue, we have built a neurobiologically-realistic whole-brain computational model using both anatomical and functional MRI data from 161 participants ranging from 10 to 80 years old. We show that the differences in high-order functional interactions between age groups can be largely explained by variations in the connectome. Based on this finding, we propose a simple neurodegeneration model that is representative of normal physiological aging. As such, when applied to connectomes of young participant it reproduces the age-variations that occur in the high-order structure of the functional data. Overall, these results begin to disentangle the mechanisms by which structural changes in the connectome lead to functional differences in the ageing brain. Our model can also serve as a starting point for modeling more complex forms of pathological ageing or cognitive deficits.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Characteristics and neural correlates of emotional behavior during prefrontal seizures</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize clinical expression and intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of emotional expression during prefrontal epileptic seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a decriptive analysis of seizure semiology in patients explored with stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) for pharmacoresistant prefrontal epilepsy, using a semi-quantitative score for seizure-related emotional behavior. Two independent observers scored occurrence and intensity of objective emotional features (face/body movements/vocalization/overall appearance), testing inter-observer reliability. Intracerebral electrophysiological changes were documented. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) compared behavioral signs with neural SEEG correlates. For each patient, the clinical and anatomo-electrophysiological scores were established, based on a prototypical emotional seizure.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-two patients (469 seizures) were included. Inter-observer correlation for emotional signs was satisfactory (Kappa 0.6-0.8). Prevalence of any subjective and/or objective ictal emotional phenomena was 79% (33/42); objective emotional signs occurred in 27/42 (64%). Negatively valenced emotional semiology (ictal feeling of fear, defence and/or aggressive behaviors) was much more prevalent than positively-valenced, prosocial behaviors. Cluster analysis and PCA identified 4 groups with different occurrence of emotional signs and cerebral correlates. Two main clusters of negatively valenced behavior were identified: “active threat response”, associated with seizure organizations involving posterior orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, dorsolateral and/or ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; and “passive fear”, associated with amygdala, other mesial temporal structures and posterior orbitofrontal cortex.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Emotional behaviors, especially fear/threat response, are common in prefrontal seizures, reflecting the role of the prefrontal cortex in emotion control. Different cortical seizure localizations were associated with “passive fear” and “active threat response” seizure behaviors at group level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Ganaxolone versus phenobarbital for neonatal seizure management</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures are more common in the neonatal period than at any other stage of life. Phenobarbital is the first-line treatment for neonatal seizures and is at best effective in about 50% of babies, but may contribute to neuronal injury. Here we assessed the efficacy of phenobarbital versus the synthetic neurosteroid, ganaxolone, to moderate seizure activity and neuropathology in neonatal lambs exposed to perinatal asphyxia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Asphyxia was induced via umbilical cord occlusion in term lambs at birth. Lambs were treated with ganaxolone (5mg/kg/bolus then 5mg/kg/d for 2d) or phenobarbital (20mg/kg/bolus then 5mg/kg/d for 2d) at 6h. Abnormal brain activity was classified as stereotypic evolving (SE) seizures, epileptiform discharges (ED) and epileptiform transients (ET) using continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) recordings. At 48h, lambs were euthanized for brain collection.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Asphyxia caused abnormal brain activity including SE seizures that peaked at 18-20h, EDs and ETs, and induced neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation. Ganaxolone treatment was associated with an 86.4% reduction in the number of seizures compared to the asphyxia group. The total seizure duration in the asphyxia+ganax group was less than the untreated asphyxia group. There was no difference in the number of SE seizures between the asphyxia and asphyxia+pheno groups or duration of SE seizures. Ganaxolone treatment, but not phenobarbital, reduced neuronal degeneration within hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, and cortical neurons and, ganaxolone reduced neuroinflammation within the thalamus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Ganaxolone provided better seizure control than phenobarbital in this perinatal asphyxia model and was neuroprotective for the newborn brain, affording a new therapeutic opportunity for treatment of neonatal seizures.</p>

                <b>Background:</b> Large-scale neuronal network breakdown underlies memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the differential trajectories of the relationships between network organization and memory across pathology and cognitive stages in AD remain elusive. We determined whether and how the influences of individual-level structural and metabolic covariance network integrity on memory varied with amyloid pathology across clinical stages without assuming a constant relationship.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Viscoelastic properties of suspended cells measured with shear flow deformation cytometry</a></h4>

              
                Numerous cell functions are accompanied by phenotypic changes in viscoelastic properties, and measuring them can help elucidate higher-level cellular functions in health and disease. We present a high-throughput, simple and low-cost microfluidic method for quantitatively measuring the elastic (storage) and viscous (loss) modulus of individual cells. Cells are suspended in a high-viscosity fluid and are pumped with high pressure through a 5.8 cm long and 200 μm wide microfluidic channel. The fluid shear stress induces large, near ellipsoidal cell deformations. In addition, the flow profile in the channel causes the cells to rotate in a tank-treading manner. From the cell deformation and tank treading frequency, we extract the frequency-dependent viscoelastic cell properties based on a theoretical framework developed by R. Roscoe that describes the deformation of a viscoelastic sphere in a viscous fluid under steady laminar flow. We confirm the accuracy of the method using atomic force microscopy-calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells. Our measurements demonstrate that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Data-driven, participatory characterization of farmer varieties discloses teff breeding potential under current and future climates</a></h4>

              
                In smallholder farming systems, traditional farmer varieties of neglected and underutilized species (NUS) support the livelihoods of millions of growers and consumers. NUS combine cultural and agronomic value with local adaptation, and transdisciplinary methods are needed to fully evaluate their breeding potential. Here, we assembled and characterized the genetic diversity of a representative collection of 366 Ethiopian teff (<i>Eragrostis tef</i>) farmer varieties and breeding materials, describing their phylogenetic relations and local adaptation on the Ethiopian landscape. We phenotyped the collection for its agronomic performance, involving local teff farmers in a participatory variety evaluation. Our analyses revealed environmental patterns of teff genetic diversity and allowed us to identify 10 genetic clusters associated with climate variation and with uneven spatial distribution. A genome-wide association study was used to identify loci and candidate genes related to phenology, yield, local adaptation, and farmers’ appreciation. The estimated teff genomic offset under climate change scenarios highlighted an area around lake Tana where teff cropping may be most vulnerable to climate change. Our results show that transdisciplinary approaches may efficiently propel untapped NUS farmer varieties into modern breeding to foster more resilient and sustainable cropping systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Keratinocyte PIEZO1 modulates cutaneous mechanosensation</a></h4>

              
                Epidermal keratinocytes mediate touch sensation by detecting and encoding tactile information to sensory neurons. However, the specific mechanotransducers that enable keratinocytes to respond to mechanical stimulation are unknown. Here, we found that the mechanically-gated ion channel PIEZO1 is a key keratinocyte mechanotransducer. Keratinocyte expression of PIEZO1 is critical for normal sensory afferent firing and behavioral responses to mechanical stimuli in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vaccination decreases the risk of influenza A virus reassortment but not genetic variation in pigs</a></h4>

              
                Although vaccination is broadly used in North American swine breeding herds, managing swine influenza is challenging primarily due to the continuous evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) and the ability of the virus to transmit among vaccinated pigs. Studies that have simultaneously assessed the impact of vaccination on the emergence of IAV reassortment and genetic variation in pigs are limited. Here, we directly sequenced 28 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains, and characterized 202 individual viral plaques recovered from 13 BALF samples. We identified 54 reassortant viruses that were grouped in 17 single and 16 mixed genotypes. Notably, we found that prime-boost vaccinated pigs had less reassortant viruses than nonvaccinated pigs, likely due to a reduction in the number of days pigs were co-infected with both challenge viruses. However, direct sequencing from BALF samples revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions. Overall, our results highlight the value of IAV vaccination not only at limiting virus replication in pigs but also at protecting public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hemocyte differentiation to the megacyte lineage enhances mosquito immunity against Plasmodium</a></h4>

              
                Activation of <i>Toll</i> signaling in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> by silencing <i>Cactus</i>, a suppressor of this pathway, enhances local release of hemocyte-derived microvesicles (HdMv), promoting activation of the mosquito complement-like system, which eliminates <i>Plasmodium</i> ookinetes. We uncovered the mechanism of this immune enhancement. <i>Cactus</i> silencing triggers a <i>Rel1</i>-mediated differentiation of granulocytes to the megacyte lineage, a new subpopulation of giant cells, resulting in a dramatic increase in the proportion of circulating megacytes. Megacytes are very plastic cells that are massively recruited to the basal midgut surface in response to <i>Plasmodium</i> infection. We show that <i>Toll</i> signaling modulates hemocyte differentiation and that megacyte recruitment to the midgut greatly enhances mosquito immunity against <i>Plasmodium</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crosstalk between AML and stromal cells triggers acetate secretion through the metabolic rewiring of stromal cells</a></h4>

              
                Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells interact and modulate components of their surrounding microenvironment into their own benefit. Stromal cells have been shown to support AML survival and progression through various mechanisms. Nonetheless, whether AML cells could establish beneficial metabolic interactions with stromal cells is underexplored. By using a combination of human AML cell lines and AML patient samples together with mouse stromal cells and a MLL-AF9 mouse model, here we identify a novel metabolic crosstalk between AML and stromal cells where AML cells prompt stromal cells to secrete acetate for their own consumption to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and lipid biosynthesis. By performing transcriptome analysis and tracer-based metabolic NMR analysis, we observe that stromal cells present a higher rate of glycolysis when co-cultured with AML cells. We also find that acetate in stromal cells is derived from pyruvate via chemical conversion under the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ROS transfer from AML to stromal cells via gap junctions. Overall, we present a unique metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells and propose two different molecular targets, ACSS2 and gap junctions, that could potentially be exploited for adjuvant therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Brain atlas for glycoprotein hormone receptors at single-transcript level</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing evidence that anterior pituitary hormones, traditionally thought to have unitary functions in regulating single endocrine targets, act on multiple somatic tissues, such as bone, fat, and liver. There is also emerging evidence for anterior pituitary hormone action on brain receptors in mediating central neural and peripheral somatic functions. Here, we have created the most comprehensive neuroanatomical atlas on the expression of TSHR, LHCGR and FSHR. We have used RNAscope, a technology that allows the detection of mRNA at single-transcript level, together with protein level validation, to document <i>Tshr</i> expression in 173 and <i>Fshr</i> expression in 353 brain regions, nuclei and sub-nuclei identified using the <i>Atlas for the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates</i>. We also identified <i>Lhcgr</i> transcripts in 401 brain regions, nuclei and sub-nuclei. Complementarily, we used ViewRNA, another single-transcript detection technology, to establish the expression of <i>FSHR</i> in human brain samples, where transcripts were co-localized in <i>MALAT1</i> positive neurons. In addition, we show high expression for all three receptors in the ventricular region-with yet unknown functions. Intriguingly, <i>Tshr</i> and <i>Fshr</i> expression in the ependymal layer of the third ventricle was similar to that of the thyroid follicular cells and testicular Sertoli cells, respectively. In contrast, <i>Fshr</i> was localized to NeuN-positive neurons in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in murine and human brain-both are Alzheimer's disease vulnerable regions. Our atlas thus provides a vital resource for scientists to explore the link between the stimulation or inactivation of brain glycoprotein hormone receptors on somatic function. New actionable pathways for human disease may be unmasked through further studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral temporal and posteromedial sulcal morphology in autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Two recent parallel research tracks link tertiary sulcal morphology sulci that emerge last in gestation and continue to develop after birth with functional features of the cerebral cortex and cognition, respectively. The first track identified a relationship between the mid fusiform sulcus (MFS) in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and cognition in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second track identified a new tertiary sulcus, the inframarginal sulcus (IFRMS), that serves as a tripartite landmark within the posteromedial cortex (PMC). As VTC and PMC are structurally and functionally different in individuals with ASD compared to neurotypical controls (NTs), here, we integrated these two tracks with a twofold approach. First, we tested if there are morphological differences in VTC and PMC sulci between 50 NTs and 50 individuals with ASD. Second, we tested if tertiary sulcal morphology was linked to cognition in ASD individuals. Our twofold approach replicates and extends recent findings in five ways. First, in terms of replication, the standard deviation (STD) of MFS cortical thickness (CT) was increased in ASDs compared to NTs. Second, MFS length was shorter in ASDs compared to NTs. Third, the CT STD effect extended to other VTC and PMC sulci. Fourth, a subset of VTC and PMC morphological features were correlated between regions in ASD. Fifth, IFRMS depth was negatively associated with ADOS GS score. These results empirically support a relationship between later-developing, tertiary sulci and ASD, providing a novel framework to study the relationship between brain structure and cognition in additional neurodevelopmental disorders in future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conceptual associations generate sensory predictions</a></h4>

              
                A crucial ability of the human brain is to learn and exploit probabilistic associations between stimuli to facilitate perception and behavior by predicting future events. While studies have shown how perceptual relationships are used to predict sensory inputs, relational knowledge is often between concepts rather than percepts (e.g., we learned to associate cats with dogs, rather than specific images of cats and dogs). Here we asked if and how sensory responses to visual input may be modulated by predictions derived from conceptual associations. To this end we exposed participants to arbitrary word pairs (e.g., car and dog) repeatedly, creating an expectation of the second word, conditional on the occurrence of the first. In a subsequent session, we exposed participants to novel word-picture pairs, while measuring fMRI BOLD responses. All word-picture pairs were equally likely, but half of the pairs conformed to the previously formed conceptual (word-word) associations, whereas the other half violated this association. Results showed suppressed sensory responses throughout the ventral visual stream, including early visual cortex, to pictures that corresponded to the previously expected words compared to unexpected words. This suggests that the learned conceptual associations were used to generate sensory predictions that modulated processing of the picture stimuli. Moreover, these modulations were tuning-specific, selectively suppressing neural populations tuned towards the expected input. Combined, our results suggest that recently acquired conceptual priors are generalized across domains and used by the sensory brain to generate feature specific predictions, facilitating processing of expected visual input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spatiotemporal dynamics of semantic integration in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Language depends critically on the integration of lexical information to derive semantic concepts. The neurobiology of this fundamental aspect of human cognition remains mostly unknown. Limitations of spatiotemporal resolution have previously rendered it difficult to disentangle processes involved in semantic integration from independent computations such as tracking word meaning and establishing referents. We utilized intracranial recordings (n = 58) during the presentation of orthographic descriptions that were either referential or non-referential to a common object. Referential contexts enabled high frequency broadband gamma activation (70-150 Hz) of a distributed network including the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), medial parietal cortex (MPC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the left, language-dominant hemisphere. Components of this network (IFS, MPC), alongside posterior superior temporal sulcus, showed greater engagement for trials that did not progressively isolate a limited set of referents, relative to trials that did. IFS and posterior middle temporal gyrus activity was modulated by semantic coherence, regardless of whether the sentence picked out a common object. Centered around IFS and spreading out dorsally towards middle frontal gyrus and ventrally towards anterior/posterior inferior frontal gyrus, we uncovered a cortical mosaic of functional specialization for reference, coherence and semantic narrowing. Early processing windows implicated IFS in all aspects of semantics, and in later windows sub-portions of IFS exposed a clearer functional tessellation with some remaining overlap. This work unveils how lateral fronto-temporal regions make distinctly rich semantic contributions and are involved jointly in semantic integration and conflict resolution, depending on the sub-region and processing stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental shift in testosterone influence on prefrontal emotion control</a></h4>

              
                A paradox of testosterone effects is seen in adolescents vs. adults in social emotional approach-avoidance behavior. During adolescence, high testosterone levels are associated with increased anterior prefrontal (aPFC) involvement in emotion control, whereas during adulthood this neuro-endocrine relation is reversed. Rodent work shows that, during puberty, testosterone transitions from a neuro-developmental to a social-sexual activating hormone. In this study, we explored whether this functional transition is also present in human adolescents and young adults. Using a prospective longitudinal design, we investigated the role of testosterone on neural control of social emotional behavior during the transitions from middle to late adolescence and into young adulthood. Seventy-one individuals (tested at ages 14, 17, and 20 years) performed an fMRI-adapted approach-avoidance (AA) task involving automatic and controlled actions in response to social emotional stimuli. In line with predictions from animal models, the effect of testosterone on aPFC engagement decreased between middle and late adolescence, and shifted into an activational role by young adulthood - impeding neural control of emotions. This change in testosterone function was accompanied by increased testosterone-modulated amygdala reactivity. These findings qualify the testosterone-dependent maturation of the prefrontal-amygdala circuit supporting emotion control during the transition from middle adolescence into young adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal-cortical functional connectivity during memory encoding and retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Memory encoding and retrieval are critical sub-processes of episodic memory. While the hippocampus is involved in both, its connectivity with the neocortex during memory processing in humans has been elusive. This is partially due to variations in demands in common memory tasks, which inevitably recruit cognitive processes other than episodic memory. Conjunctive analysis of data from different tasks with the same core elements of encoding and retrieval can reduce the intrusion of patterns related to subsidiary perceptual and cognitive processing. Leveraging data from two large-scale functional resonance imaging studies with different episodic memory tasks (514 and 237 participants), we identified core hippocampal-cortical networks active during memory processing. Anterior and posterior hippocampus had distinct connectivity profiles, which were stable across resting state and memory tasks. Whereas no encoding-specific connectome emerged across tasks, during retrieval hippocampal connectivity was increased with areas known to be active during recollection, including medial prefrontal, inferior parietal, and parahippocampal cortices. This indicates that the stable functional connectivity of the hippocampus along its longitudinal axis is superposed by increased functional connectivity with the recollection network during retrieval, while encoding connectivity likely reflects contextual factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A recurrent neural network model of prefrontal brain activity during a working memory task</a></h4>

              
                When multiple items are held in short-term memory, cues that retrospectively prioritise one item over another (retro-cues) can facilitate subsequent recall. However, the neural and computational underpinnings of this effect are poorly understood. One recent study recorded neural signals in the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) during a retro-cueing task, contrasting delay-period activity before (pre-cue) and after (post-cue) retrocue onset. They reported that in the pre-cue delay, the individual stimuli were maintained in independent subspaces of neural population activity, whereas in the post-cue delay, the prioritised items were rotated into a common subspace, potentially allowing a common readout mechanism. To understand how such representational transitions can be learnt through error minimisation, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with supervision to perform an equivalent cued-recall task. RNNs were presented with two inputs denoting conjunctive colour-location stimuli, followed by a pre-cue memory delay, a location retrocue, and a post-cue delay. We found that the orthogonal-to-parallel geometry transformation observed in the macaque LPFC emerged naturally in RNNs trained to perform the task. Interestingly, the parallel geometry only developed when the cued information was required to be maintained in short-term memory for several cycles before readout, suggesting that it might confer robustness during maintenance. We extend these findings by analysing the learning dynamics and connectivity patterns of the RNNs, as well as the behaviour of models trained with probabilistic cues, allowing us to make predictions for future studies. Overall, our findings are consistent with recent theoretical accounts which propose that retrocues transform the prioritised memory items into a prospective, action-oriented format.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Growth hormone receptor (GHR) in AgRP neurons regulatesthermogenesis in aged mice in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Evidence for hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis and thermoregulation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) during aging has been well recognized, yet the central molecular mediators involved in this process are poorly understood. The arcuate hypothalamus (ARC), orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons control nutrient intake, energy homeostasis, and BAT thermogenesis. To determine the roles of growth hormone receptor (GHR) signaling in the AgRP neurons we used mice with the AgRP-specific GHR deletion (AgRP{Delta}GHR). We found that female AgRP{Delta}GHR mice were resistant to temperature adaptation, and their body core temperature remained significantly lower when held at 10{degrees}C, 22{degrees}C, or 30{degrees}C, compared to control mice. Low body core temperature in female AgRP{Delta}GHR mice has been associated with significant reductions in Ucp1 and Pgc1 expression in the BAT. Further, neuronal activity in AgRP in response to cold exposure was blunted in AgRP{Delta}GHR females, while the number of Fos+ AgRP neurons was increased in control females exposed to cold. Global transcriptome from BAT identified increased expression of genes related to immune responses and chemokine activity and decreased expression of genes involved in triglycerides synthesis and metabolic pathways in AgRP{Delta}GHR females. Importantly, these were the same genes that are downregulated by thermoneutrality in control mice but not in the AgRP{triangleup}GHR animals. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel circuit of thermal regulation between the hypothalamic AgRP-GHR and BAT and provide insight into the brain systems that are critical for the thermogenic vitality of the elderly.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal C-Reactive Protein Mediates Neuropathic Pain by Activating Nociceptive FcγRI-Coupled Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat in clinical practice, and the underlying mechanisms are insufficiently elucidated. Previous studies have demonstrated that Fc{gamma} receptor I (Fc{gamma}RI) is expressed in the neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and may be involved in chronic pain. Methods: Chronic constriction injury (CCI) was used to induce neuropathic pain in rats. Primary neuron-specific Fcgr1 conditional knockout (CKO) rats were established by crossing rats carrying a Fcgr1loxP+/+ with the PirtCRE+ line. Behavioral and molecular studies were conducted to evaluate the differences between wild-type and CKO rats after CCI. Results: We first revealed that CCI activated neuronal Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling in the DRG. CCI-induced neuropathic pain was alleviated in CKO rats. C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased in the DRG after nerve injury. Intraganglionic injection or overexpression of the recombinant CRP protein in the DRG evoked pain accompanied and activated neuronal Fc{gamma}RI. CRP-evoked pain was significantly reduced in CKO rats. Furthermore, microinjection of native IgG into the DRG alleviated neuropathic pain and the activation of neuronal Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the activation of neuronal CRP/Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling plays an important role in the development of pain in CCI. Our findings may provide novel insights into the neuroimmune responses after peripheral nerve injury and might suggest potential therapeutic targets for neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ACAT1/SOAT1 Blockade Suppresses LPS-Mediated Neuroinflammation by Modulating the Fate of Toll-Like Receptor 4 in Microglia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cholesterol is essential for growth and maintenance of mammalian cells. It is stored as cholesteryl esters by the enzymes acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases 1 & 2 (ACAT 1 & 2 ) (Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 & 2 ; SOATs in GenBank). ACAT1 blockade (A1B) in macrophages ameliorates various pro-inflammatory responses elicited by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or by cholesterol loading. In mouse and human brains, Acat1 expression dominates over Acat2 and Acat1 is elevated in many neurodegenerative diseases and in acute neuroinflammation. However, the possible effects of ACAT1 blockade in neuroinflammation, regulated by mediators such as Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), has not been studied. Methods: We conducted LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation experiments in control vs myeloid specific or neuron specific Acat1 knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, we evaluated LPS-induced neuroinflammation in the microglial cell line N9 with or without pre-treatment of the small molecule ACAT1-specific inhibitor K-604. Biochemical and microscopy assays were used to monitor inflammatory responses and the fate of TLR4. Results: In vivo studies revealed that Acat1 inactivation in myeloid cell lineage, but not in neurons, markedly attenuated LPS-induced activation of various pro-inflammatory response genes in hippocampus and cortex. Studies in cell culture showed that pre-incubating cells with K-604 significantly ameliorated the pro-inflammatory responses induced by LPS. In cells acutely treated with LPS (for 30 min), pre-incubation with K-604 significantly increased the endocytosis of TLR4, the major transmembrane signaling receptor that mediates LPS-dependent acute neuroinflammation. In cells chronically treated with LPS (for 24-48 hrs), pre-incubation with K-604 significantly decreased the total TLR4 protein content, presumably due to enhanced trafficking of TLR4 to the lysosomes for degradation. For ex vivo evidence, we isolated microglia from adult mice, and found that in mice without LPS stimulation, myeloid Acat1 inactivation altered cellular distribution of TLR4; in mice with LPS stimulation, myeloid Acat1 inactivation decreased the cellular content of TLR4. Conclusion: Blocking ACAT1 in mouse microglia alters the fate of TLR4 and suppresses its ability to participate in pro-inflammatory signaling cascade in response to LPS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic TDP-43 dysregulation impairs memory by modulating antiviral pathways and interferon-inducible chemokines</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 pathology is prevalent in dementia but the cell type-specific effects of TDP-43 are not clear and therapeutic strategies to alleviate TDP-43-linked cognitive decline are lacking. We found that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have aberrant TDP-43 accumulation in hippocampal astrocytes. In mouse models, induction of widespread or hippocampus-targeted accumulation in astrocytic TDP-43 caused progressive memory loss and localized changes in antiviral gene expression. These changes were cell-autonomous and correlated with impaired astrocytic defense against infectious viruses. Among the changes, astrocytes had elevated levels of interferon-inducible chemokines and neurons had elevated levels of the corresponding chemokine receptor CXCR3 in presynaptic terminals. CXCR3 stimulation altered presynaptic function and promoted neuronal hyperexcitability, akin to the effects of astrocytic TDP-43, and blockade of CXCR3 reduced this activity. Ablation of CXCR3 also prevented TDP-43-linked memory loss. Thus, astrocytic TDP-43 dysfunction contributes to cognitive impairment through aberrant chemokine-mediated astrocytic-neuronal interactions.

                The importance of dyslipidemia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients is increasingly recognised as a potential key mechanism driving disease onset, progression and survival. Evidence in familial ALS models suggests that lipid composition is significantly affected, however clinically relevant models have yet to be investigated. Using a powerful lipidomic approach, we uncover significant dysregulation of glycosphingolipid (GSL) metabolism in both the spinal cord and skeletal muscles of transgenic TDP-43Q331K mice. Treatment with the selective glucocerebrosidase 2 (GBA2) inhibitor ambroxol at symptom onset significantly improved motor and gait functions in TDP-43Q331K mice. Ambroxol treatment preserved motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions which was associated with modulation of GSL metabolism. Our study establishes significant lipid dysregulation in a clinically relevant model of ALS. Importantly, we show positive therapeutic outcomes in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy, suggesting that ambroxol may be a promising candidate to treat underlying dyslipidemia and symptoms of ALS.

	<p>Objective: To assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the gait and postural control ability of patients with executive dysfunction (ED) after stroke. Methods: A total of 18 patients with ED after stroke were randomly assigned into two groups, including an experimental group and a sham group. Patients in both groups received routine rehabilitation therapy, and patients in the experimental group underwent rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 2 weeks (5 HZ, 80%MT, 1200 pulses). In the sham group, patients experienced sham stimulation treatment, in which the coil was placed vertically with the head. Before and after treatment, patients in both groups were subjected to Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scoring, Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer assessment of lower extremity (L-FMA), Stroop color-word test (SCWT), gait analysis, foot plantar pressure test, 10-m walking test (10MWT), Berg balance scale (BBS), and timed up and go test (TUGT). In the SCWT, it was attempted to record the time of each card (SCWT-T), the correct number (SCWT-C), Stroop interference effect-time (SIE-T), and SIE correct count (SIE-C). The TUGT was categorized into four stages: getting up (GT), walking straight (WT), turning around (TT), and sitting down (ST), in which the total time of TUGT was calculated. Results: After two weeks of treatment, the evaluation indexes were improved in the two groups, some of which were statistically significant. In the experimental group, SCWT-T, SIE-T, SIE-C, GT, WT, TT, ST, and TUGT were significantly improved after treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). SCWT-C, L-FMA score, 10MWT, GT, WT, stride length, step width, foot plantar pressure, pressure center curve, and activities of daily living were not statistically different from those before treatment (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). After treatment, SCWT-T, SIE-C, SIE-T, BBS score, TT, and ST in the experimental group were significantly shorter than those before treatment, with statistical differences (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Compared with the sham group, SCWT-C, L-FMA score, 10MWT, GT, WT, TUGT, stride length, step width, foot plantar pressure, pressure center curve, and motor skills were not significantly improved (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: It was revealed that post-stroke rTMS treatment of patients with ED could improve executive function, improve postural control function, and reduce the risk of falling. In addition, rTMS of DLPFC could be a therapeutic target for improving postural control ability and reducing the risk of falling.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the association between serum iron (SI) and postoperative delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We retrospectively analyzed 985 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with aSAH. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to assess the association between SI and DCI. Propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis was implemented to reduce confounding. Postoperative DCI developed in 14.38% of patients. Lower SI upon admission was detected in aSAH patients with severe clinical conditions and severe aSAH. SI was negatively correlated with WFNS grade (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.3744, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and modified Fisher (mFisher) grade (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.2520, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed lower SI was independently associated with DCI [odds ratios (OR) 0.281, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.177&amp;amp;ndash;0.448, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001], while WFNS grade and mFisher grade were not. The receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis of SI for DCI gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7 and an optimal cut-off of 7.5 &amp;amp;mu;mol/L (95% CI 0.665 to 0.733, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). PSM demonstrated the DCI group had a significantly lower SI than the non-DCI group (10.91 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.86 vs. 20.34 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.01 &amp;amp;mu;mol/L, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Lower SI remained a significant independent predictor for DCI and an independent poor prognostic factor of aSAH in multivariate analysis (OR 0.363, 95% CI 0.209&amp;amp;ndash;0.630, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The predictive performance of SI for poor outcome had a corresponding AUC of 0.718 after PSM. Lower SI upon admission is significantly associated with WFNS grade, mFisher grade, and predicts postoperative DCI and poor outcome at 90 days following aSAH.</p>

	<p>Prior experience represents a prerequisite for memory consolidation across various memory systems. In the context of olfaction, sleep was found to enhance the consolidation of odors in adults but not in typically developing children (TDC), likely due to differences in pre-experience. Interestingly, unmedicated children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental condition related to dopamine dysfunction, showed lower perceptive thresholds for odors, potentially allowing for more odor experience compared to TDC. We investigated sleep-associated odor memory consolidation in ADHD. Twenty-eight children with ADHD and thirty age-matched TDC participated in an incidental odor recognition task. For the sleep groups (ADHD: n = 14, TDC: n = 15), the encoding of 10 target odorants took place in the evening, and the retention of odorants was tested with 10 target odorants and 10 distractor odorants the next morning. In the wake groups (ADHD: n = 14, TDC: n = 15), the time schedule was reversed. Odor memory consolidation was superior in the ADHD sleep group compared to the TDC sleep and the ADHD wake groups. Intensity and familiarity ratings during encoding were substantially higher in ADHD compared to TDC. Sleep-associated odor memory consolidation in ADHD is superior to TDC. Abundant pre-experience due to lower perceptive thresholds is suggested as a possible explanation. Olfaction might serve as a biomarker in ADHD.</p>

	<p>Collateral status has prognostic and treatment implications in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Unlike CTA, grading collaterals on MRA is not well studied. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of assessing collaterals on pretreatment MRA in AIS patients against DSA. AIS patients with anterior circulation proximal arterial occlusion with baseline MRA and subsequent endovascular treatment were included. MRA collaterals were evaluated by two neuroradiologists independently using the Tan and Maas scoring systems. DSA collaterals were evaluated by using the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology grading system and were used as the reference for comparative analysis against MRA. A total of 104 patients met the inclusion criteria (59 female, age (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD): 70.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.1). The inter-rater agreement (k) for collateral scoring was 0.49, 95% CI 0.37&amp;amp;ndash;0.61 for the Tan score and 0.44, 95% CI 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;0.62 for the Maas score. Total number (%) of sufficient vs. insufficient collaterals based on DSA was 49 (47%) and 55 (53%) respectively. Using the Tan score, 45% of patients with sufficient collaterals and 64% with insufficient collaterals were correctly identified in comparison to DSA, resulting in a poor agreement (0.09, 95% CI 0.1&amp;amp;ndash;0.28). Using the Maas score, only 4% of patients with sufficient collaterals and 93% with insufficient collaterals were correctly identified against DSA, resulting in poor agreement (0.03, 95% CI 0.06&amp;amp;ndash;0.13). Pretreatment MRA in AIS patients has limited concordance with DSA when grading collaterals using the Tan and Maas scoring systems.</p>

	<p>Background: Sketching while narrating is an effective interview technique for eliciting information and cues to deceit. The current research examined the effects of introducing a Model Sketch in investigative interviews andis pre-registered on https://osf.io/kz9mc (accessed on 18 January 2022). Methods: Participants (N = 163) completed a mock mission and were asked to tell the truth or to lie about it in an interview. In Phase 1 of the interview, participants provided either a free recall (control condition), sketched and narrated with exposure to a Model Sketch (Model Sketch-present condition), or sketched and narrated without exposure to a Model Sketch (Model Sketch-absent condition). In Phase 2, all participants provided a free recall without sketching. Results: Truth tellers reported significantly more information than lie tellers. The Model Sketch elicited more location details than a Free recall in Phase 1 and more veracity differences than the other Modality conditions in Phase 2. Conclusion: The Model Sketch seems to enhance the elicitation of information and to have carryover veracity effects in a follow-up free recall.</p>

	<p>Background: Autistic traits are commonly viewed as dimensional in nature, and as continuously distributed in the general population. In this respect, the identification of predictive values of markers such as subtle autism-related alterations in brain morphology for parameter values of autistic traits could increase our understanding of this dimensional occasion. However, currently, very little is known about how these traits correspond to alterations in brain morphology in typically developing individuals, particularly during a time period where changes due to brain development processes do not provide a bias. Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed brain volume, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) in a cohort of 14&amp;amp;ndash;15-year-old adolescents (N = 285, female: N = 162) and tested their predictive value for autistic traits, assessed with the social responsiveness scale (SRS) two years later at the age of 16&amp;amp;ndash;17 years, using a regression-based approach. We found that autistic traits were significantly predicted by volumetric changes in the amygdala (r = 0.181), cerebellum (r = 0.128) and hippocampus (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.181, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.203), both in boys and girls. Moreover, the CT of the superior frontal region was negatively correlated (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.144) with SRS scores. Furthermore, we observed a significant association between the SRS total score and smaller left putamen volume, specifically in boys (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.217), but not in girls. Our findings suggest that neural correlates of autistic traits also seem to lie on a continuum in the general population, are determined by limbic&amp;amp;ndash;striatal neuroanatomical brain areas, and are partly dependent on sex. As we imaged adolescents from a large population-based cohort within a small age range, these data may help to increase the understanding of autistic-like occasions in otherwise typically developing individuals.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Although the association between residential location and survival in patients with different cancer types has been established, the conclusions are contentious, and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we reviewed the impact of residence on the survival of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to compare the impact of rural and urban residence on the survival rates of patients with GBM diagnosed in Riyadh City and outside Riyadh. All patients in this study were treated in a tertiary care hospital, and their survival rates were analyzed in relation to their residence and other related factors, namely radiotherapy timing. Results: Overall, 125 patients were included: 61 from Riyadh City and 64 from outside. The majority of patients in both groups were aged &amp;amp;gt;50 years (p = 0.814). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (p = 0.430), seizure (p = 0.858), or initiation timing of radiotherapy (p = 0.781). Furthermore, the median survival rate in the Riyadh group versus the other group was 14.4 months and 12.2 months, respectively, with no statistical significance (p = 0.187). Conclusions: Our study showed that residential location had no significant effect on GBM prognosis. However, further studies with a larger sample size are required to delineate the other factors of referral within the healthcare system to facilitate the management of these patients within a specific timeframe.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimation of heterogeneous instantaneous reproduction numbers with application to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Massachusetts counties</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhenwei Zhou, Eric D. Kolaczyk, Robin N. Thompson, Laura F. White</p>

The reproductive number is an important metric that has been widely used to quantify the infectiousness of communicable diseases. The time-varying instantaneous reproductive number is useful for monitoring the real-time dynamics of a disease to inform policy making for disease control. Local estimation of this metric, for instance at a county or city level, allows for more targeted interventions to curb transmission. However, simultaneous estimation of local reproductive numbers must account for potential sources of heterogeneity in these time-varying quantities—a key element of which is human mobility. We develop a statistical method that incorporates human mobility between multiple regions for estimating region-specific instantaneous reproductive numbers. The model also can account for exogenous cases imported from outside of the regions of interest. We propose two approaches to estimate the reproductive numbers, with mobility data used to adjust incidence in the first approach and to inform a formal priori distribution in the second (Bayesian) approach. Through a simulation study, we show that region-specific reproductive numbers can be well estimated if human mobility is reasonably well approximated by available data. We use this approach to estimate the instantaneous reproductive numbers of COVID-19 for 14 counties in Massachusetts using CDC case report data and the human mobility data collected by SafeGraph. We found that, accounting for mobility, our method produces estimates of reproductive numbers that are distinct across counties. In contrast, independent estimation of county-level reproductive numbers tends to produce similar values, as trends in county case-counts for the state are fairly concordant. These approaches can also be used to estimate any heterogeneity in transmission, for instance, age-dependent instantaneous reproductive number estimates. As people are more mobile and interact frequently in ways that permit transmission, it is important to account for this in the estimation of the reproductive number.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain-to-brain communication during musical improvisation: a performance case study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Understanding and predicting others' actions in ecological settings is an important research goal in social neuroscience. Here, we deployed a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) methodology to analyze inter-brain communication between professional musicians during a live jazz performance. Specifically, bispectral analysis was conducted to assess the synchronization of scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from three expert musicians during a three-part 45 minute jazz performance, during which a new musician joined every five minutes. The bispectrum was estimated for all musician dyads, electrode combinations, and five frequency bands. The results showed higher bispectrum in the beta and gamma frequency bands (13-50 Hz) when more musicians performed together, and when they played a musical phrase synchronously. Positive bispectrum amplitude changes were found approximately three seconds prior to the identified synchronized performance events suggesting preparatory cortical activity predictive of concerted behavioral action. Moreover, a higher amount of synchronized EEG activity, across electrode regions, was observed as more musicians performed, with inter-brain synchronization between the temporal, parietal, and occipital regions the most frequent. Increased synchrony between the musicians' brain activity reflects shared multi-sensory processing and movement intention in a musical improvisation task.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Birth asphyxia (BA) is the most frequent cause of neonatal death as well as CNS injury. BA is often associated with neonatal seizures, which only poorly respond to anti-seizure medications and may contribute to the adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Using a non-invasive rat model of BA, we have recently reported that the potent benzodiazepine, midazolam, prevents neonatal seizures in ~50% of rat pups. In addition to its anti-seizure effect, midazolam exerts anti-inflammatory actions, which is highly relevant for therapeutic intervention following BA. The two major aims of the present study were to examine (1) whether midazolam reduces the adverse outcome of BA, and (2) whether this effect is different in rats that did or did not exhibit neonatal seizures after drug treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Behavioral and cognitive tests were performed over 14 months after asphyxia, followed by immunohistochemical analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All vehicle-treated rats had seizures after asphyxia and developed behavioral and cognitive abnormalities, neuroinflammation in gray and white matter, neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and thalamus, and hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting in subsequent months. Administration of midazolam (1 mg/kg i.p.) directly after asphyxia prevented post-asphyctic seizures in ~50% of the rats and resulted in the prevention or decrease of neuroinflammation and the behavioral, cognitive, and neurodegenerative consequences of asphyxia. Except for neurodegeneration in the thalamus, seizures did not seem to contribute to the adverse outcome of asphyxia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The disease-modifying effect of midazolam identified here strongly suggests that this drug provides a valuable option for improving the treatment and outcome of BA.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is associated with neuroimaging findings of hemosiderin in a case-control study and whether the addition of hemosiderin markers improves the risk stratification models of PSE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post-hoc analysis of PROgnosis of POST-Stroke Epilepsy (PROPOSE) study enrolling PSE patients at our hospital from November 2014 to September 2019. PSE was diagnosed when one unprovoked seizure was experienced more than 7 days after the index stroke, as proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy. As controls, consecutive acute stroke patients with no history or absence of any late seizure or continuing antiseizure medications at least 3 months after stroke were retrospectively enrolled during the same study period. We examined cortical microbleeds and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) using gradient-echo T2*-weighted images. A logistic regression model with ridge penalties was tuned using 10-fold cross-validation. We added the item of cSS to the existing models (SeLECT and CAVE) for predicting PSE and evaluated performance of new models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 180 patients with PSE (67 women; median age, 74 years) and 1183 controls (440 women; median age, 74 years). The cSS frequency was higher in PSE than control groups (48.9% vs 5.7%, p&lt;0.0001). Compared with the existing models, the new models with cSS (SeLECT-S and CAVE-S) demonstrated significantly better predictive performance of PSE [net reclassification improvement, 0.63 (<i>p</i>=0.004) for SeLECT-S and 0.88 (<i>p</i>=0.001) for CAVE-S at the testing data].</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>cSS was associated with PSE, stratifying stroke survivors at high risk of PSE.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Transverse Myelitis (TM) has recently been associated by health authorities with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), one of the five U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. It is unknown whether a similar association exists for the other FDA or EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer/BioNTech], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1nCov-19 [Oxford–AstraZeneca], and NVX-CoV2373 [Novavax]). This study aimed to evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine class and TM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study examined individual case safety reports from VigiBase®, the World Health Organization’s pharmacovigilance database. We first conducted a disproportionality analysis with the Information Component (IC) using the reports of TM that occurred within 28 days following exposure to FDA or EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, from December 1, 2020 (first adverse event related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) to March 27, 2022. Secondly, we analyzed the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TM cases reported in VigiBase®.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TM was significantly associated both with the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based (n=364; IC<sub>025</sub>=0.62) and vector-based (n=136; IC<sub>025</sub>=0.52) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are authorized by the FDA or the EMA.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Findings from this observational, cross-sectional pharmacovigilance study showed that mRNA-based and vector-based FDA/EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may be associated with TM. However, because TM remains a rare event, with a previously reported rate of 0.28 cases per one million vaccine doses, the risk-benefit ratio in favor of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unchallenged. Rather, this study suggests that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of TM in patients presenting with early signs of spinal cord dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Uncovering natural variation in root system architecture and growth dynamics using a robotics-assisted phenomics platform</a></h4>

              
                The plant kingdom contains a stunning array of complex morphologies easily observed above-ground, but more challenging to visualize below-ground. Understanding the magnitude of diversity in root distribution within the soil, termed root system architecture (RSA), is fundamental to determining how this trait contributes to species adaptation in local environments. Roots are the interface between the soil environment and the shoot system and therefore play a key role in anchorage, resource uptake, and stress resilience. Previously, we presented the GLO-Roots (Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots) system to study the RSA of soil-grown <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants from germination to maturity (Rellán-Álvarez et al. 2015). In this study, we present the automation of GLO-Roots using robotics and the development of image analysis pipelines in order to examine the temporal dynamic regulation of RSA and the broader natural variation of RSA in Arabidopsis, over time. These datasets describe the developmental dynamics of two independent panels of accessions and reveal highly complex and polygenic RSA traits that show significant correlation with climate variables of the accessions' respective origins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ait1 regulates TORC1 signaling and localization in budding yeast</a></h4>

              
                The target of rapamycin complex I (TORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the highly conserved small GTPases, Gtr1/2 (RagA/C in humans), and the GTPase activating complex SEAC/GATOR. However, it remains unclear if, and how, other proteins/pathways regulate TORC1 in simple eukaryotes like yeast. Here we report that the previously unstudied GPCR-like protein, Ait1, binds to TORC1-Gtr1/2 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and holds TORC1 around the vacuole during log-phase growth. Then, during amino acid starvation, Ait1 inhibits TORC1 via Gtr1/2 using a loop that resembles the RagA/C binding domain in the human protein SLC38A9. Importantly, Ait1 is only found in the <i>Saccharomycetaceae/codaceae</i>, two closely related families of yeast that have lost the ancient TORC1 regulators Rheb and TSC1/2. Thus, the TORC1 circuit found in the <i>Saccharomycetaceae/codaceae</i>, and likely other simple eukaryotes, has undergone significant rewiring during evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the ribonucleotide reductase family reveals an ancestral clade</a></h4>

              
                Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are used by all free-living organisms and many viruses to catalyze an essential step in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of DNA precursors. RNRs are remarkably diverse by primary sequence and cofactor requirement, while sharing a conserved fold and radical-based mechanism for nucleotide reduction. Here, we structurally aligned the diverse RNR family by the conserved catalytic barrel to reconstruct the first large-scale phylogeny consisting of 6,779 sequences that unites all extant classes of the RNR family and performed evo-velocity analysis to independently validate our evolutionary model. With a robust phylogeny in-hand, we uncovered a novel, phylogenetically distinct clade that is placed as ancestral to the classes I and II RNRs, which we have termed clade Ø. We employed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and AlphaFold2 to investigate a member of this clade from <i>Synechococcus</i> phage S-CBP4 and report the most minimal RNR architecture to-date. Based on our analyses, we propose an evolutionary model of diversification in the RNR family and delineate how our phylogeny can be used as a roadmap for targeted future study.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Most cancers carry a substantial deleterious load due to Hill-Robertson interference</a></h4>

              
                Cancer genomes exhibit surprisingly weak signatures of negative selection<sup>1,2</sup>. This may be because selective pressures are relaxed or because genome-wide linkage prevents deleterious mutations from being removed (Hill-Robertson interference)<sup>3</sup>. By stratifying tumors by their genome-wide mutational burden, we observe negative selection (dN/dS ~ 0.56) in low mutational burden tumors, while remaining cancers exhibit dN/dS ratios ~1. This suggests that most tumors do not remove deleterious passengers. To buffer against deleterious passengers, tumors upregulate heat shock pathways as their mutational burden increases. Finally, evolutionary modeling finds that Hill-Robertson interference alone can reproduce patterns of attenuated selection and estimates the total fitness cost of passengers to be 46% per cell on average. Collectively, our findings suggest that the lack of observed negative selection in most tumors is not due to relaxed selective pressures, but rather the inability of selection to remove deleterious mutations in the presence of genome-wide linkage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Specific binding of Hsp27 and phosphorylated Tau mitigates abnormal Tau aggregation-induced pathology</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid aggregation of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) into neurofibrillary tangles is closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Several molecular chaperones have been reported to bind Tau and impede its pathological aggregation. Recent findings of elevated levels of Hsp27 in the brains of patients with AD suggested its important role in pTau pathology. However, the molecular mechanism of Hsp27 in pTau aggregation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Hsp27 partially co-localizes with pTau tangles in the brains of patients with AD. Notably, phosphorylation of Tau by microtubule affinity regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), dramatically enhances the binding affinity of Hsp27 to Tau. Moreover, Hsp27 efficiently prevents pTau fibrillation in vitro and mitigates neuropathology of pTau aggregation in a <i>Drosophila</i> tauopathy model. Further mechanistic study reveals that Hsp27 employs its N-terminal domain to directly interact with multiple phosphorylation sites of pTau for specific binding. Our work provides the structural basis for the specific recognition of Hsp27 to pathogenic pTau, and highlights the important role of Hsp27 in preventing abnormal aggregation and pathology of pTau in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chronic neurotransmission increases the susceptibility of lateral-line hair cells to ototoxic insults</a></h4>

              
                Sensory hair cells receive near constant stimulation by omnipresent auditory and vestibular stimuli. To detect and encode these stimuli, hair cells require steady ATP production, which can be accompanied by a buildup of mitochondrial byproducts called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS buildup is thought to sensitize hair cells to ototoxic insults, including the antibiotic neomycin. Work in neurons has shown that neurotransmission is a major driver of ATP production and ROS buildup. Therefore, we tested whether neurotransmission is a significant contributor to ROS buildup in hair cells. Using genetics and pharmacology, we disrupted two key aspects of neurotransmission in zebrafish hair cells: presynaptic calcium influx and the fusion of synaptic vesicles. We find that chronic block of neurotransmission enhances hair-cell survival when challenged with the ototoxin neomycin. This reduction in ototoxin susceptibility is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial activity, likely due to a reduced ATP demand. In addition, we show that mitochondrial oxidation and ROS buildup are reduced when neurotransmission is blocked. Mechanistically, we find that it is the synaptic vesicle cycle rather than presynaptic- or mitochondrial-calcium influx that contributes most significantly to this metabolic stress. Our results comprehensively indicate that, over time, neurotransmission causes ROS buildup that increases the susceptibility of hair cells to ototoxins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The skeletal muscle circadian clock regulates titin splicing through RBM20</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms are maintained by a cell autonomous, transcriptional-translational feedback loop known as the molecular clock. While previous research suggests a role of the molecular clock in regulating skeletal muscle structure and function, no mechanisms have connected the molecular clock to sarcomere filaments. Utilizing inducible, skeletal muscle specific, <i>Bmal1</i> knockout (iMS<i>Bmal1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice, we showed that knocking out skeletal muscle clock function alters titin isoform expression using RNAseq, LC-MS, and SDS-VAGE. This alteration in titin's spring length resulted in sarcomere length heterogeneity. We demonstrate the direct link between altered titin splicing and sarcomere length <i>in vitro</i> using U7 snRNPs that truncate the region of titin altered in iMS<i>Bmal1</i><sup>-/-</sup> muscle. We identified a mechanism whereby the skeletal muscle clock regulates titin isoform expression through transcriptional regulation of <i>Rbm20</i>, a potent splicing regulator of titin. Lastly, we used an environmental model of circadian rhythm disruption and identified significant down-regulation of <i>Rbm20</i> expression. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the skeletal muscle circadian clock in maintaining titin isoform through regulation of RBM20 expression. Because circadian rhythm disruption is a feature of many chronic diseases, our results highlight a novel pathway that could be targeted to maintain skeletal muscle structure and function in a range of pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal Object Representations Rely on Integrative Coding</a></h4>

              
                Combining information from multiple senses is essential to object recognition. Yet how the mind combines sensory input into coherent multimodal representations, the multimodal binding problem, remains poorly understood. Here, we applied multi-echo fMRI across a four-day paradigm, in which participants learned 3-dimensional multimodal object representations created from well-characterized visual shape and sound features. Our novel paradigm decoupled the learned multimodal object representations from their baseline unimodal shape and sound features, thus tracking the emergence of multimodal concepts as they were learned by healthy adults. Critically, the representation for the whole object was different from the combined representation of its individual parts, with evidence of an integrative object code in anterior temporal lobe structures. Intriguingly, the perirhinal cortex, an anterior temporal lobe structure, was by default biased towards visual shape, but this initial shape bias was attenuated with learning. Pattern similarity analyses suggest that after learning the perirhinal cortex orthogonalized combinations of visual shape and sound features, transforming overlapping feature input into distinct multimodal object representations. These results provide evidence of integrative coding in the anterior temporal lobes that is distinct from the distributed sensory features, advancing the age-old question of how the mind constructs multimodal objects from their component features.

                Our current understanding of visual word identification is difficult to extend to text reading; both experiments and theories focus primarily, if not exclusively, on out-of-context individual words. Here, we try to fill this gap by studying cross-word semantic and morphological priming within sentences in natural reading, in a novel coregistration paradigm with simultaneous recording of eye movements and electroencephalography. We report results from both eye tracking measures, and, more importantly, from fixation-related potentials, time-locked to the fixation onset on the target word. In both, semantic facilitation clearly emerged, while we observed no effect of morphological priming. These results may indicate that morphological agreement is at least partially computed outside of the lexical-semantic system which gives rise to semantic priming. These results provide new insight into the neural correlates of semantic and morphological priming in natural reading, revealing lexical dynamics as they likely emerge in our everyday reading experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A cross-species study of sex chromosome dosage effects on mammalian brain anatomy</a></h4>

              
                All eutherian mammals show chromosomal sex determination with contrasting sex chromosome dosages (SCDs) between males (XY) and females (XX). Studies in transgenic mice and humans with sex chromosome trisomy (SCT) have revealed direct SCD effects on regional mammalian brain anatomy, but we lack a formal test for cross-species conservation of these effects. Here, we develop a harmonized framework for comparative structural neuroimaging and apply this to systematically profile SCD effects on regional brain anatomy in both humans and mice by contrasting groups with SCT (XXY and XYY) vs. XY controls. We show that total brain size is substantially altered by SCT in humans (significantly decreased by XXY and increased by XYY), but not in mice. Controlling for global effects reveals robust and spatially convergent effects of XXY and XYY on regional brain volume in humans, but not mice. However, mice do show subtle effects of XXY and XYY on regional volume, although there is not a general spatial convergence in these effects within mice or between species. Notwithstanding this general lack of conservation in SCT effects, we detect several brain regions that show overlapping effects of XXY and XYY both within and between species (cerebellum, parietal, and orbitofrontal cortex) - thereby nominating high priority targets for future translational dissection of SCD effects on the mammalian brain. Our study introduces a generalizable framework for comparative neuroimaging in humans and mice and applies this to achieve a cross-species comparison of SCD effects on the mammalian brain through the lens of SCT.

                We suggest a novel analysis method called the one-to-many dynamic functional connectivity analysis to detect the adaptation of dynamics in a local brain network depending on mental states with a single case study. We collected fMRI BOLD signals from a blind subject whom with advanced ability in episodic memory retrieval while the subject was resting and retrieving a morning routine which is a type of autobiographical episodic memory. The default mode network is known for its high activation in these mental states. By applying the principal components analysis to the partial correlations of a brain region in the default mode network, which are correlations of the brain region to the rest of the network, we compared how congruent first or second principal components of the partial correlations of the brain region the default mode network in the two mental states. Our results showed that the adaption of the dynamics in the default mode network in the two mental states could be well depicted when the partial correlations of the posterior cingulate cortex are considered. Specifically, the correlation of the posterior cingulate cortex and the right parahippocampal cortex contributed mostly to the adaptation of the partial correlations of the posterior cingulate cortex for this single subject case.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Walk the Plank! Using mobile EEG to investigate emotional lateralization of immersive fear in virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                Most studies on emotion processing rely on the presentation of emotional images or films. However, this methodology lacks ecological validity, limiting the extent to which findings can generalize to emotion processing in the wild. More realistic paradigms using Virtual Reality (VR) may be better suited to investigate authentic emotional states and their neuronal correlates. This preregistered study examines the neuronal underpinnings of naturalistic fear, measured using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Seventy five healthy participants entered a simulation in which they walked across a virtual plank which extended from the side of a skyscraper either 80 stories up (the negative condition) or at street level (the neutral condition). Subjective ratings showed that the negative condition induced feelings of fear and presence. Following the VR experience, subjects passively viewed negative and neutral images from the International Affective Picture system (IAPS) outside of VR. We compared frontal alpha asymmetry between the plank and IAPS task and across valence of the conditions. Asymmetry indices (AI) in the plank task revealed greater right-hemispheric lateralization during the negative VR condition, relative to the neutral VR condition and to IAPS viewing. Within the IAPS task, no significant asymmetries were detected, though AIs in the VR task and in the IAPS task were negatively correlated suggesting that stronger right-hemispheric activation in the VR task was associated with stronger left-hemispheric activation during the IAPS task. In summary, our findings indicate that immersive technologies such as VR can advance emotion research by providing more ecologically valid ways to induce emotion.

                Elucidating the coupling between the structure and the function of the brain and its development across maturation has attracted a lot of interest in the field of network neuroscience in the last fifteen years. Mounting evidence support the hypothesis that the interplay between the structural architecture and the functional processes of the brain plays an important role in the onset of certain brain disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. This papers introduces a method called NBS-SNI that integrates both representations into a single framework, and identifies connectivity abnormalities in case-control studies. With this method, significance is given to the properties of the nodes, as well as to the connections between them. This approach builds on the well-established Network-based statistics (NBS) proposed in 2010. We uncover and identify the regimes in which NBS-SNI offers a gain in statistical resolution to identify a contrast of interest using synthetic data. We also apply our method on a real case-control study of individuals diagnosed with autism. Using NBS-SNI and node properties such as the closeness centrality and local information dimension, we found both hypo and hyperconnected subnetworks and show that our method can offer a 9 percentage points gain in prediction power over the standard NBS.

                The 2{delta}3 auxiliary subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels is required for normal synaptic transmission and precise temporal processing of sounds in the auditory brainstem. In mice its loss additionally leads to an inability to distinguish amplitude-modulated (AM) tones. Furthermore, loss of function of 2{delta}3 has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. To investigate possible alterations of network activity in the high-order auditory system in 2{delta}3 KO mice, we analyzed neuronal activity patterns and topography of frequency tuning within networks of the auditory cortex (AC) using two-photon Ca2+ imaging. We found subfield-specific alterations, expressed in overall lower correlations between the network activity patterns in response to different sounds as well as lower reliability of these patterns upon repetitions of the same sound in the primary auditory cortex (A1). Higher AC subfields did not display these alterations but showed a higher amount of well-tuned neurons along with lower local heterogeneity of the neurons' frequency tuning. Our results provide new insight into AC network activity alterations in an ASD-associated mouse model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improving fMRI in Parkinson's Disease by Accounting for Brain Region-Specific Activity Patterns</a></h4>

              
                In functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in Parkinson's disease (PD), a paradigm consisting of blocks of finger tapping and rest along with a corresponding general linear model (GLM) is often used to assess motor activity. However, this method has three limitations: (i) Due to the Strong magnetic field and the confined environment of the cylindrical bore, it is troublesome to accurately monitor motor output and, therefore, variability in the performed movement is typically ignored. (ii) Given the loss of dopaminergic neurons and ongoing compensatory brain mechanisms, motor control is abnormal in PD. Therefore, modeling of patients' tapping with a constant amplitude (using a boxcar function) and the expected Parkinsonian motor output are prone to mismatch. (iii). The motor loop involves structures with distinct hemodynamic responses, for which only one type of modeling (e.g., modeling the whole block of finger tapping) may not suffice to capture these structure's temporal activation. The first two limitations call for considering results from online recordings of the real motor output that may lead to significant sensitivity improvements. This was shown in previous work using a non-magnetic glove to capture details of the patients' finger movements in a so-called kinematic approach. For the third limitation, modeling motion initiation instead of the whole tapping block has been suggested to account for different temporal activation signatures of the motor loop's structures. In the present study we propose improvements to the GLM as a tool to study motor disorders. For this, we test the robustness of the kinematic approach in an expanded cohort (n=31), apply more conservative statistics than in previous work, and evaluate the benefits of an event-related model function. Our findings suggest that the integration of the kinematic approach offers a general improvement in detecting activations in subcortical structures, such as the basal ganglia. Additionally, modeling motion initiation using an event-related design yielded superior performance in capturing medication-related effects in the putamen. Our results may guide adaptations in analysis strategies for functional motor studies related to PD and also in more general applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glycemic challenge is associated with the rapid cellular activation of the locus ceruleus and nucleus of solitary tract: Circumscribed spatial analysis of phosphorylated MAP kinase immunoreactivity in relation to catecholaminergic and cholinergic chemoarc</a></h4>

              
                Research using laboratory rats has shown that impaired glucose utilization or hypoglycemia is associated with cellular activation of neurons in the medulla (Winslow, 1733) (MY) that are implicated in the control of feeding behavior and hormonal counterregulatory responses. Changes in the activation of these neuronal populations are also associated with autonomic dysfunction that manifests itself in the form of blunted counterregulatory responses to repeated episodes of glucoprivation or hypoglycemia. An improved appreciation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of these medullary responses (and the phenotypes of the neurons responsible for them) could lead to the development of rational therapies or diagnostics to address patient complications associated with diabetes management, such as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure. At present, however, cellular-scale neural activation following glycemic challenge has been tracked in rodents primarily within hours of the challenge, rather than sooner, and these responses have been poorly mapped within standardized brain atlases in relation to the locations of cell types known to be present in the medulla and the larger Rhombic brain (His, 1893) (RB). Here, we report that within 15 min of receiving the glycemic challenge, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; 250 mg/kg, i.v.), which is known to produce intracellular glucopenia and trigger glucoprivic feeding behavior, marked elevations were observed in the numbers of RB neuronal cell profiles immunoreactive for the cellular activation marker(s), phosphorylated p44/42 MAP kinases (phospho-ERK1/2). Dual immunostaining experiments showed that some, but not all, of these neurons were catecholaminergic, as identified by immunostaining for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). To begin the process of mapping the locations of these rapidly-activated neurons in relation to known cytoarchitecture with standardized neuroanatomical nomenclature, we performed Nissl- and chemoarchitecture-based plane-of-section analysis to map their distributions at discrete rostrocaudal levels, along with associated basally-activated cholinergic and other catecholaminergic cell groups, within an open-access rat brain atlas. This analysis revealed that neurons of the locus ceruleus (Wenzel & Wenzel, 1812) (LC) and the nucleus of solitary tract (>1840) (NTS) displayed elevated numbers of phospho-ERK1/2+ neurons within 15 min following 2-DG administration. Notably, while catecholaminergic neurons co-labeled with phospho-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity, many non-catecholaminergic NTS neurons also displayed such activation. Both 2-DG and saline-treated groups also displayed phospho-ERK1/2+ neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve (>1840), identified both by Nissl criteria and immunostaining for the cholinergic marker, choline acetyltransferase. Our results show that 2-DG-activation of certain RB catecholaminergic neurons is more rapid than perhaps previously realized, engaging neurons that serve multiple functional systems and are of varying cellular phenotypes. They also place these and other activated populations within standardized maps of cytoarchitectonically-defined RB regions, thereby streamlining their precise targeting and/or comparable mapping in preclinical rodent models of disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The calcineurin regulator Sarah enables acute and chronic forms of homeostatic plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction</a></h4>

              
                The ability of synapses to maintain physiological levels of evoked neurotransmission is essential for neuronal stability. A variety of perturbations can disrupt neurotransmission, but synapses often compensate for disruptions and work to stabilize activity levels, using forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) is one such mechanism that is expressed at the model Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse. In PHP, neurotransmitter release increases in response to challenges to the synapse, resulting in the maintenance of evoked neurotransmission. Prior work separated PHP into two temporal phases, acute and chronic. Those data suggested that cytoplasmic calcium signaling was important for a long-term maintenance of PHP. Here we used a combination of transgenic Drosophila RNA interference and overexpression lines, along with NMJ electrophysiology, synapse imaging, and pharmacology to test if regulators of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin are necessary for the normal expression of acute or chronic forms of PHP. We found that either pre- or postsynaptic dysregulation of a Drosophila gene regulating calcineurin, sarah (sra), blocks PHP. Examination of tissue-specific data showed that increases and decreases in sra expression are both detrimental to PHP. Additionally, the acute and chronic phases of PHP are functionally separable depending entirely upon which sra genetic manipulation is used. Surprisingly, concurrent pre- and postsynaptic sra knockdown or overexpression ameliorated PHP blocks revealed in single tissue experiments. Pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin corroborated this latter finding. Our results suggest that a discrete balance of calcineurin signaling is needed across multiple synapse tissue types and over different temporal phases to stabilize peripheral synaptic outputs.

                Male mating in Caenorhabditis elegans is a complex behavior with a strong mechanosensory component. C. elegans has several characterized mechanotransducer proteins, but few have been shown to contribute to mating. Here, we investigated the roles of PEZO-1, a piezo channel, and TRP-4, a mechanotransducing TRPN channel, in male mating behavior. We show that pezo-1 is expressed in several male-specific neurons with known roles in mating. We show that, among other neurons, trp-4 is expressed in the PCA sensory neuron, which monitors relative sliding between the male and the hermaphrodite and inhibits neurons involved in vulva detection. Mutations in both genes compromise many steps of mating, including initial response to the hermaphrodite, scanning, turning, and vulva detection. We performed pan-neuronal imaging during mating between freely-moving mutant males and hermaphrodites. Both pezo-1 and trp-4 mutants showed spurious activation of the sensory neurons involved in vulva detection. In trp-4 mutants, this spurious activation might be caused by PCA failure to inhibit vulva-detecting neurons during scanning. Indeed, we show that without functional TRP-4, PCA fails to detect the relative sliding between the male and hermaphrodite. Cell-specific TRP-4 expression restores PCA's mechanosensory function. Our results demonstrate new roles for both PEZO-1 and TRP-4 mechanotransducers in C. elegans mating behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CDKL5 deficiency results in atypical subregion-specific expression of perineuronal nets in the mouse primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, where children exhibit motor, speech, cognitive and visual deficits during development as well as early onset of seizures and infantile spasms. CDKL5 disorder results from de novo mutations in CDKL5, which phosphorylates proteins including MECP2, an epigenetic regulator of critical period plasticity. How mutations in CDKL5 gene result in these neurological deficits is unknown. Using a male CDKL5-null mouse model, we systematically characterize the expression of perineuronal nets, which are extracellular matrix structures surrounding parvalbumin+ GABAergic neurons in the primary visual cortex. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are considered to be barriers to synaptic plasticity, particularly at the end of critical period plasticity in binocular zone. In CDKL5-null male visual cortex, here we report an increase in high-intensity PNN expression in the binocular zone, a decrease in overall PNN expression in the monocular zone, and no differences in PNN expression in rostral V1. These results suggest that at the closure of the visual critical period plasticity, subregion-specific variations in PNN expression lead to functional differences in synaptic plasticity and ultimately, changes in visual function in male CDKL5-null mice. Additionally, the systematic characterization of subregion-specific expression patterns of perineuronal nets lay the groundwork for further studies to probe the roles for perineuronal nets beyond the binocular zone of the mouse primary visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Silencing long-descending inter-enlargement propriospinal neurons improves hindlimb stepping after contusive spinal cord injuries</a></h4>

              
                Spinal locomotor circuitry is comprised of rhythm generating centers, one for each limb, that are interconnected by local and long-distance propriospinal neurons thought to carry temporal information necessary for interlimb coordination and gait control. We showed previously that conditional silencing of the long ascending propriospinal neurons (LAPNs) that project from the lumbar to the cervical rhythmogenic centers (L1/L2 to C6), disrupts right-left alternation of both the forelimbs and hindlimbs without significantly disrupting other fundamental aspects of interlimb and speed-dependent coordination (Pocratsky et al., 2020). Subsequently, we showed that silencing the LAPNs after a moderate thoracic contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) resulted in better recovered locomotor function (Shepard et al., 2021). In this research advance, we focus on the descending equivalent to the LAPNs, the long descending propriospinal neurons (LDPNs) that have cell bodies at C6 and terminals at L2. We found that conditional silencing of the LDPNs in the intact adult rat resulted in disrupted alternation of each limb pair (forelimbs and hindlimbs) and after a thoracic contusion SCI significantly improved locomotor function. These observations lead us to speculate that the LAPNs and LDPNs have similar roles in the exchange of temporal information between the cervical and lumbar rhythm generating centers, but that the partial disruption of the pathway after SCI limits the independent function of the lumbar circuitry. Silencing the LAPNs or LDPNs effectively permits or frees-up the lumbar circuitry to function independently.

                Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) represent the most abundant group of proliferating cells in the adult central nervous system. OPCs serve as progenitors for oligodendrocyte (OLs) throughout the life, and contribute to developmental and adaptive myelination, and myelin repair during diseased state. OPCs make synaptic and extra-synaptic contacts with axons, and detect and respond to neuronal activity. How OPCs translate the information relayed by the neuronal activity into Ca2+ signals, which in turn influence their fate and survival, is less understood. We developed novel transgenic mouse lines expressing a cytosolic and membrane anchored variants of genetically encoded Ca2+ sensors (GCaMP6f or mGCaMP6s) in OPCs, performed 2-photon microscopy in the somatosensory cortex of the awake behaving mice, and simultaneously monitored intracellular Ca2+ signals and their cell-fate progression. We found Ca2+ signals in OPCs mainly occur within processes and confine to micrometer-size segments called Ca2+ microdomains. Microdomain Ca2+ signals enhanced in OPCs when mice engage in exploratory behavior. OPCs exhibit distinct Ca2+ signals while they proliferate to maintain their precursor pool or differentiate to generate new OL. When mice engaged in exploratory behavior, the cortical projections of noradrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus showed increased firing rate and norepinephrine release. Norepinephrine activated all three subtypes of alpha1 adrenergic receptor expressed by OPCs and evoked intracellular Ca2+ increase in OPCs. A chemogenetic activation of noradrenergic neurons, promoted differentiation of cortical OPCs into OL, and at the same time suppressed OPC proliferation rate. Hence, we uncovered that various cell types of oligodendrocyte lineage exhibits unique signatures of Ca2+ activity, which these cells might integrate for making their fate decisions, and norepinephrine signaling can be a potent regulator of OPC fate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateral line hair cells integrate mechanical and chemical cues to orient navigation</a></h4>

              
                The lateral line is a superficial sensory system responding to environmental hydrodynamic changes to orient locomotion of aquatic vertebrate species. Whether this system also detects chemical cues is unknown. We find that zebrafish lateral line hair cells express numerous chemoreceptors, including ionotropic receptors for serotonin. We show that the serotonin enriched in skin neuroepithelial cells is released upon injury and that environmental serotonin activates lateral line hair cells. We show that larval zebrafish exposed to serotonin in their environment rely on the lateral line to swim fast and away. These results uncover the sensory versatility of lateral line hair cells and how these properties modulate navigation in response to environmental stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantification of Monosynaptic Rabies Tracing Efficiency</a></h4>

              
                Retrograde monosynaptic tracing using glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus is an important component of the toolkit for investigation of neural circuit structure and connectivity. It allows for the identification of first-order presynaptic connections to cell populations of interest across both the central and peripheral nervous system, helping to decipher the complex connectivity patterns of neural networks that give rise to brain function. Despite its utility, the efficiency with which genetically modified rabies virus spreads retrogradely across synapses remains uncertain. While past studies have revealed conditions that can increase or decrease the numbers of presynaptic cells labeled, it is unknown what proportion of total inputs to a starter cell of interest are labeled. It is also unknown whether synapses that are more proximal or distal to the cell body are labeled with different efficiencies. Here we use a new rabies virus construct that allows for the simultaneous labeling of pre and postsynaptic specializations to quantify efficiency of spread at the synaptic level in mouse primary visual cortex. We demonstrate that with typical conditions about 40% of first-order presynaptic excitatory inputs are labeled. We show that using matched tracing conditions there is similar efficiency of spread from excitatory or inhibitory starter cell types. Furthermore, we find no difference in the efficiency of labeling of excitatory inputs to postsynaptic sites at different subcellular locations.

	<p>After the onset of ischemic stroke, ischemia&amp;amp;ndash;hypoxic cascades cause irreversible neuronal death. Neurons are the fundamental structures of the central nervous system, and mature neurons do not renew or multiply after death. Functional and structural recovery from neurological deficits caused by ischemic attack is a huge task. Hence, there remains a need to replace the lost neurons relying on endogenous neurogenesis or exogenous stem cell-based neuronal differentiation. However, the stem cell source difficulty and the risk of immune rejection of the allogeneic stem cells might hinder the wide clinical application of the above therapy. With the advancement of transdifferentiation induction technology, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes can be converted to neurons through ectopic expression or the knockdown of specific components. The progress and problems of astrocyte transdifferentiation will be discussed in this article.</p>

	<p>Since the hippocampus plays an important role in memory and spatial cognition, the study of spatial computation models inspired by the hippocampus has attracted much attention. This study relies mainly on reward signals for learning environments and planning paths. As reward signals in a complex or large-scale environment attenuate sharply, the spatial cognition and path planning performance of such models will decrease clearly as a result. Aiming to solve this problem, we present a brain-inspired mechanism, a Memory-Replay Mechanism, that is inspired by the reactivation function of place cells in the hippocampus. We classify the path memory according to the reward information and find the overlapping place cells in different categories of path memory to segment and reconstruct the memory to form a &amp;amp;ldquo;virtual path&amp;amp;rdquo;, replaying the memory by associating the reward information. We conducted a series of navigation experiments in a simple environment called a Morris water maze (MWM) and in a complex environment, and we compared our model with a reinforcement learning model and other brain-inspired models. The experimental results show that under the same conditions, our model has a higher rate of environmental exploration and more stable signal transmission, and the average reward obtained under stable conditions was 14.12% higher than RL with random-experience replay. Our model also shows good performance in complex maze environments where signals are easily attenuated. Moreover, the performance of our model at bifurcations is consistent with neurophysiological studies.</p>

	<p>According to DSM 5, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about various topics that occupies the majority of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s time for a period of at least six months. The aforementioned state causes distress and/or functional impairments. This paper presents the outcomes of a pilot study that evaluated the implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and CBT with an SSRIs intervention program. The participants comprised 16 children and adolescents with GAD (8 males and 8 females) matched with 16 typically developing peers (8 males and 8 females) aged from 10 to 16 years old (M = 12.56 SD = 2.18). Baseline assessment consisted of event related potentials (ERPs), which indicated that participants with GAD presented cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as they exhibited longer P300 latencies. Following treatment with the CBT program and/or medication, children and adolescents with GAD did not present statistically significantly longer P300 latencies and reaction times in comparison to the control group. Lastly, children and adolescents who followed the CBT program or the CBT program with psychopharmacological assistance did not reveal statistically significant differences in 13 out of 15 topographic brain areas and in reaction time.</p>

	<p>The cerebellar region has four times as many brain cells as the brain, but whether the cerebellum functions in cognition, and how it does so, remain unexplored. In order to verify whether the cerebellum is involved in cognition, we chose to investigate whether the cerebellum is involved in the process of error judgment. We designed an experiment in which we could activate the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s error-related potentials (ErrP). We recruited 26 subjects and asked them to wear EEG caps with cerebellar regions designed by us to participate in the experiment so that we could record their EEG activity throughout the experiment. We successfully mitigated the majority of noise interference after a series of pre-processing of the data collected from each subject. Our analysis of the preprocessed data revealed that our experiment successfully activated ErrP, and that the EEG signals, including the cerebellum, were significantly different when subjects made errors compared to when they made correct judgments. We designed a feature extraction method that requires selecting channels with large differences under different classifications, firstly by extracting the time-frequency features of these channels, and then screening these features with sequence backward feature (SBS) selection. We use the extracted features as the input and different event types in EEG data as the labels for multiple classifiers to classify the data in the executive and feedback segments, where the average accuracy for two-class classification of executive segments can reach 80.5%. The major contribution of our study is the discovery of the presence of ErrP in cerebellar regions and the extraction of an effective feature extraction method for EEG data.</p>

	<p>This proof-of-concept (PoC) study presents a pipeline made by two blocks: 1. the identification of the network that generates interictal epileptic activity; and 2. the study of the time course of the electrical activity that it generates, called neurodynamics, and the study of its functional connectivity to the other parts of the brain. Network identification is achieved with the Functional Source Separation (FSS) algorithm applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, the neurodynamics quantified through signal complexity with the Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD), and functional connectivity with the Directed Transfer Function (DTF). This PoC is enhanced by the data collected before and after neuromodulation via transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS, both Real and Sham) in a single drug-resistant epileptic person. We observed that the signal complexity of the epileptogenic network, reduced in the pre-Real, pre-Sham, and post-Sham, reached the level of the rest of the brain post-Real tDCS. DTF changes post-Real tDCS were maintained after one month. The proposed approach can represent a valuable tool to enhance understanding of the relationship between brain neurodynamics characteristics, the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation, and epileptic symptoms.</p>

	<p>Leksell stereotactic system-based aspiration biopsy is a common procedure in the neurosurgical treatment of deep-seated or multiple brain lesions. This study aimed to evaluate the benefit of frameless biopsy using VarioGuide compared to frame-based biopsy using the Leksell stereotactic system (LSS). We analyzed all brain biopsies using VarioGuide or LSS at our neurooncological Department of Neurosurgery in the University Hospital of Bonn between January 2018 and August 2020. We analyzed demographic data, duration of surgery, size of lesion, localization, and early complications. Uni-variable analyses were carried out on data from both groups. In total, 109 biopsies were compared (40 VarioGuide vs. 69 LSS). Patients with VarioGuide were significant older (74 (62&amp;amp;ndash;80) years vs. 67 (57&amp;amp;ndash;76) years; p = 0.03) and had a shorter duration of general anesthesia (163 (138&amp;amp;ndash;194) min vs. 193 (167&amp;amp;ndash;215) min, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). We found no significant differences in surgery duration (VarioGuide median 28 min (IQR 20&amp;amp;ndash;38); LSS: median 30 min (IQR 25&amp;amp;ndash;39); p = 0.1352) or in early complication rates (5% vs. 7%; p = 0.644). A slightly higher false negative biopsy rate was registered in the LSS group (3 vs. 1; p = 0.1347). The size of the lesions also did not differ significantly between the two groups (18.31 &amp;amp;plusmn; 26.35 cm3 vs. 12.63 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.62; p = 0.15). Our data showed that biopsies performed using VarioGuide took significantly less time than LSS biopsies and did not differ in complication rates. Both systems offered a high degree of patient safety.</p>

	<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be a risk factor for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to the altered coagulation process and hyperinflammation. This study examined the risk factors, clinical profile, and hospital outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalizations with AIS. This study was a retrospective analysis of data from California State Inpatient Database (SID) during 2019 and 2020. COVID-19 hospitalizations with age &amp;amp;ge; 18 years during 2020 and a historical cohort without COVID-19 from 2019 were included in the analysis. The primary outcomes studied were in-hospital mortality and discharge to destinations other than home. There were 91,420 COVID-19 hospitalizations, of which, 1027 (1.1%) had AIS. The historical control cohort included 58,083 AIS hospitalizations without COVID-19. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of in-hospital mortality, discharge to destinations other than home, DVT, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, and mechanical ventilation were significantly higher among COVID-19 hospitalizations with AIS, compared to those without AIS. The odds of in-hospital mortality, DVT, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, mechanical ventilation, and respiratory failure were significantly higher among COVID-19 hospitalizations with AIS, compared to AIS hospitalizations without COVID-19. Although the prevalence of AIS was low among COVID-19 hospitalizations, it was associated with higher mortality and greater rates of discharges to destinations other than home.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Leptin Promotes Striatal Dopamine Release via Cholinergic Interneurons and Regionally Distinct Signaling Pathways</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dopamine (DA) is a critical regulator of striatal network activity and is essential for motor activation and reward-associated behaviors. Previous work has shown that DA is influenced by the reward value of food, as well as by hormonal factors that reguate food intake and energy expenditure. Changes in striatal DA signaling also have been linked to aberrant eating patterns. Here we test the effect of leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone involved in feeding and energy homeostasis regulation, on striatal DA release and uptake. Immunohistochemical evaluation identified leptin receptor (LepR) expression throughout mouse striatum, including on striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and their extensive processes. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), we found that leptin causes a concentration-dependent increase in evoked extra-cellular DA concentration ([DA]<SUB>o</SUB>) in dorsal striatum (dStr) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell in male mouse striatal slices, and also an increase in the rate of DA uptake. Further, we found that leptin increases ChI excitability, and that the enhancing effect of leptin on evoked [DA]<SUB>o</SUB> is lost when nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors are antagonized or when examined in striatal slices from mice lacking ACh synthesis. Evaluation of signaling pathways underlying leptin's action revealed a requirement for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the involvement of different downstream pathways in dStr and NAc core versus NAc shell. These results provide the first evidence for dynamic regulation of DA release and uptake by leptin within brain motor and reward pathways, and highlight the involvement of ChIs in this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Given the importance of striatal dopamine (DA) in reward, motivation, motor behavior and food intake, identifying the actions of metabolic hormones on DA release in striatal subregions should provide new insight into factors that influence DA-dependent motivated behaviors. We find that one of these hormones, leptin, boosts striatal DA release through a process involving striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Moreover, we find that the intracellular cascades downstream from leptin receptor (LepR) activation that lead to enhanced DA release differ among striatal subregions. Thus, we not only show that leptin regulates DA release, but also identify characteristics of this process that could be harnessed to alter pathologic eating behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APP Genetic Deficiency Alters Intracellular Ca2+ Homeostasis and Delays Axonal Degeneration in Dorsal Root Ganglion Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The activation of self-destructive cellular programs helps sculpt the nervous system during development, but the molecular mechanisms used are not fully understood. Prior studies have investigated the role of the APP in the developmental degeneration of sensory neurons with contradictory results. In this work, we sought to elucidate the impact of APP deletion in the development of the sensory nervous system <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro.</I> Our <I>in vivo</I> data show an increase in the number of sciatic nerve axons in adult male and female <I>APP-null</I> mice, consistent with the hypothesis that APP plays a pro-degenerative role in the development of peripheral axons. <I>In vitro</I>, we show that genetic deletion of APP delays axonal degeneration triggered by nerve growth factor deprivation, indicating that APP does play a pro-degenerative role. Interestingly, APP depletion does not affect caspase-3 levels but significantly attenuates the rise of axoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> that occurs during degeneration. We examined intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mechanisms that could be involved and found that <I>APP-null</I> DRG neurons had increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We also observed that DRG axons lacking APP have more mitochondria than their WT counterparts, but these display a lower mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, we present evidence that APP deficiency causes an increase in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity. Our results support the hypothesis that APP plays a pro-degenerative role in the developmental degeneration of DRG sensory neurons, and unveil the importance of APP in the regulation of calcium signaling in sensory neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The nervous system goes through a phase of pruning and programmed neuronal cell death during development to reach maturity. In such context, the role played by the APP in the peripheral nervous system has been controversial, ranging from pro-survival to pro-degenerative. Here we present evidence <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> supporting the pro-degenerative role of APP, demonstrating the ability of APP to alter intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and mitochondria, critical players of programmed cell death. This work provides a better understanding of the physiological function of APP and its implication in developmental neuronal death in the nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disruption of Dopamine Receptor 1 Localization to Primary Cilia Impairs Signaling in Striatal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>A rod-shaped appendage called a primary cilium projects from the soma of most central neurons in the mammalian brain. The importance of cilia within the nervous system is highlighted by the fact that human syndromes linked to primary cilia dysfunction, collectively termed ciliopathies, are associated with numerous neuropathologies, including hyperphagia-induced obesity, neuropsychiatric disorders, and learning and memory deficits. Neuronal cilia are enriched with signaling molecules, including specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their downstream effectors, suggesting that they act as sensory organelles that respond to neuromodulators in the extracellular space. We previously showed that GPCR ciliary localization is disrupted in neurons from mouse models of the ciliopathy Bardet&ndash;Biedl syndrome (BBS). Based on this finding, we hypothesized that mislocalization of ciliary GPCRs may impact receptor signaling and contribute to the BBS phenotypes. Here, we show that disrupting localization of the ciliary GPCR dopamine receptor 1 (D<SUB>1</SUB>) in male and female mice, either by loss of a BBS protein or loss of the cilium itself, specifically in D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons, results in obesity. Interestingly, the weight gain is associated with reduced locomotor activity, rather than increased food intake. Moreover, the loss of a BBS protein or cilia on D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons leads to a reduction in D<SUB>1</SUB>-mediated signaling. Together, these results indicate that cilia impact D<SUB>1</SUB> activity in the nervous system and underscore the importance of neuronal cilia for proper GPCR signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most mammalian neurons possess solitary appendages called primary cilia. These rod-shaped structures are enriched with signaling proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), suggesting that they respond to neuromodulators. This study examines the consequences of disrupting ciliary localization of the GPCR dopamine receptor 1 (D<SUB>1</SUB>) in D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons. Remarkably, mice that have either an abnormal accumulation of D<SUB>1</SUB> in cilia or a loss of D<SUB>1</SUB> ciliary localization become obese. In both cases, the obesity is associated with lower locomotor activity rather than overeating. As D<SUB>1</SUB> activation increases locomotor activity, these results are consistent with a reduction in D<SUB>1</SUB> signaling. Indeed, we found that D<SUB>1</SUB>-mediated signaling is reduced in brain slices from both mouse models. Thus, cilia impact D<SUB>1</SUB> signaling in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spinal Cord Synaptic Plasticity by GlyR{beta} Release from Receptor Fields and Syndapin I-Dependent Uptake</a></h4>

              
                <p>Glycine receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission is key for spinal cord function. Recent observations suggested that by largely elusive mechanisms also glycinergic synapses display synaptic plasticity. We imaged receptor fields at ultrahigh-resolution at freeze-fractured membranes, tracked surface and internalized glycine receptors (GlyR), and studied differential regulations of GlyR&beta; interactions with the scaffold protein gephyrin and the F-BAR domain protein syndapin I and thereby reveal key principles of this process. S403 phosphorylation of GlyR&beta;, known to be triggered by synaptic signaling, caused a decoupling from gephyrin scaffolds but simultaneously promoted association of syndapin I with GlyR&beta;. In line, kainate treatments used to trigger rearrangements of glycine receptors in murine <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords (mixed sex) showed even more severe receptor field fragmentation than already observed in untreated <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords. Syndapin I deficiency furthermore resulted in more dispersed receptors and increased receptor mobility, also pointing out an important contribution of syndapin I to the organization of GlyR&beta; fields. Strikingly, <I>syndapin I</I> KO also led to a complete disruption of kainate-induced GlyR&beta; internalization. Accompanying quantitative ultrahigh-resolution studies in dissociated spinal cord neurons proved that the defects in GlyR internalization observed in <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords are neuron-intrinsic defects caused by syndapin I deficiency. Together, our results unveiled important mechanisms organizing and altering glycine receptor fields during both steady state and particularly also as a consequence of kainate-induced synaptic rearrangement - principles organizing and fine-tuning synaptic efficacy and plasticity of glycinergic synapses in the spinal cord.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Initial observations suggested that also glycinergic synapses, key for spinal cord and brainstem functions, may display some form of synaptic plasticity. Imaging receptor fields at ultrahigh-resolution at freeze-fractured membranes, tracking surface and internalized glycine receptors (GlyR) and studying regulations of GlyR&beta; interactions, we here reveal key principles of these kainate-inducible adaptations. A switch from gephyrin-mediated receptor scaffolding to syndapin I-mediated GlyR&beta; scaffolding and internalization allows for modulating synaptic receptor availability. In line, kainate-induced GlyR&beta; internalization was completely disrupted and GlyR&beta; receptor fields were distorted by <I>syndapin I</I> KO. These results unveiled important mechanisms during both steady-state and kainate-induced alterations of synaptic GlyR fields, principles underlying synaptic efficacy and plasticity of synapses in the spinal cord.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Electrophysiological Validation of Monosynaptic Connectivity between Premotor Interneurons and the aCC Motoneuron in the Drosophila Larval CNS</a></h4>

              
                <p>The <I>Drosophila</I> connectome project aims to map the synaptic connectivity of entire larval and adult fly neural networks, which is essential for understanding nervous system development and function. So far, the project has produced an impressive amount of electron microscopy data that has facilitated reconstructions of specific synapses, including many in the larval locomotor circuit. While this breakthrough represents a technical tour de force, the data remain underutilized, partly because of a lack of functional validation of reconstructions. Attempts to validate connectivity posited by the connectome project, have mostly relied on behavioral assays and/or GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) or GCaMP imaging. While these techniques are useful, they have limited spatial or temporal resolution. Electrophysiological assays of synaptic connectivity overcome these limitations. Here, we combine patch-clamp recordings with optogenetic stimulation in male and female larvae, to test synaptic connectivity proposed by connectome reconstructions. Specifically, we use multiple driver lines to confirm that several connections between premotor interneurons and the anterior corner cell motoneuron are, as the connectome project suggests, monosynaptic. In contrast, our results also show that conclusions based on GRASP imaging may provide false-positive results regarding connectivity between cells. We also present a novel imaging tool, based on the same technology as our electrophysiology, as a favorable alternative to GRASP imaging. Finally, of eight Gal4 lines tested, five are reliably expressed in the premotor interneurons they are targeted to. Thus, our work highlights the need to confirm functional synaptic connectivity, driver line specificity, and use of appropriate genetic tools to support connectome projects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The <I>Drosophila</I> connectome project aims to provide a complete description of connectivity between neurons in an organism that presents experimental advantages over other models. It has reconstructed hundreds of thousands of synaptic connections of the fly larva by manual identification of anatomic landmarks present in serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volumes of the larval CNS. We use a highly reliable electrophysiological approach to verify these connections, providing useful insight into the accuracy of work based on ssTEM. We also present a novel imaging tool for validating excitatory monosynaptic connections between cells and show that several genetic driver lines designed to target neurons of the larval connectome exhibit nonspecific and/or unreliable expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Clutter Substantially Reduces Selectivity for Peripheral Faces in the Macaque Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>According to a prominent view in neuroscience, visual stimuli are coded by discrete cortical networks that respond preferentially to specific categories, such as faces or objects. However, it remains unclear how these category-selective networks respond when viewing conditions are cluttered, i.e., when there is more than one stimulus in the visual field. Here, we asked three questions: (1) Does clutter reduce the response and selectivity for faces as a function of retinal location? (2) Is the preferential response to faces uniform across the visual field? And (3) Does the ventral visual pathway encode information about the location of cluttered faces? We used fMRI to measure the response of the face-selective network in awake, fixating macaques (two female, five male). Across a series of four experiments, we manipulated the presence and absence of clutter, as well as the location of the faces relative to the fovea. We found that clutter reduces the response to peripheral faces. When presented in isolation, without clutter, the selectivity for faces is fairly uniform across the visual field, but, when clutter is present, there is a marked decrease in the selectivity for peripheral faces. We also found no evidence of a contralateral visual field bias when faces were presented in clutter. Nonetheless, multivariate analyses revealed that the location of cluttered faces could be decoded from the multivoxel response of the face-selective network. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that clutter blunts the selectivity of the face-selective network to peripheral faces, although information about their retinal location is retained.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Numerous studies that have measured brain activity in macaques have found visual regions that respond preferentially to faces. Although these regions are thought to be essential for social behavior, their responses have typically been measured while faces were presented in isolation, a situation atypical of the real world. How do these regions respond when faces are presented with other stimuli? We report that, when clutter is present, the preferential response to foveated faces is spared but preferential response to peripheral faces is reduced. Our results indicate that the presence of clutter changes the response of the face-selective network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Timing-Dependent Potentiation and Depression of Electrical Synapses Contribute to Network Stability in the Crustacean Cardiac Ganglion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Central pattern generators produce many rhythms necessary for survival (e.g., chewing, breathing, locomotion), and doing so often requires coordination of neurons through electrical synapses. Because even neurons of the same type within a network are often differentially tuned, uniformly applied neuromodulators or toxins can result in uncoordinated activity. In the crab (<I>Cancer borealis</I>) cardiac ganglion, potassium channel blockers and serotonin cause increased depolarization of the five electrically coupled motor neurons as well as loss of the normally completely synchronous activity. Given time, compensation occurs that restores excitability and synchrony. One of the underlying mechanisms of this compensation is an increase in coupling among neurons. However, the salient physiological signal that initiates increased coupling has not been determined. Using male <I>C. borealis</I>, we show that it is the loss of synchronous voltage signals between coupled neurons that is at least partly responsible for plasticity in coupling. Shorter offsets in naturalistic activity across a gap junction enhance coupling, whereas longer delays depress coupling. We also provide evidence on why a desynchronization-specific potentiation or depression of the synapse could ultimately be adaptive through using a hybrid network created by artificially coupling two cardiac ganglia. Specifically, a stray neuron may be brought back in line by increasing coupling if its activity is closer to the remainder of the network. However, if a the activity of a neuron is far outside network parameters, it is detrimental to increase coupling, and therefore depression of the synapse removes a potentially harmful influence on the network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding how neural networks maintain output over years despite environmental and physiological challenges requires understanding the regulatory principles of these networks. Here, we study how cells that are synchronously active at baseline respond to becoming desynchronized. In this system, a loss of synchrony causes different parts of the heart to receive uncoordinated stimulation. We find a calcium-dependent control mechanism that alters the strength of electrical connections between motor neurons. Although others have described similar control mechanisms, here, we demonstrate that voltage changes are sufficient to elicit regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong connections in a sufficiently perturbed network can prevent any neuron from producing its target activity, thus suggesting why the connections are not constitutively as strong as possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structural Covariance and Heritability of the Optic Tract and Primary Visual Cortex in Living Human Brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>Individual differences among human brains exist at many scales, spanning gene expression, white matter tissue properties, and the size and shape of cortical areas. One notable example is an approximately 3-fold range in the size of human primary visual cortex (V1), a much larger range than is found in overall brain size. A previous study (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Andrews et al., 1997</cross-ref>) reported a correlation between optic tract (OT) cross-section area and V1 size in postmortem human brains, suggesting that there may be a common developmental mechanism for multiple components of the visual pathways. We evaluated the relationship between properties of the OT and V1 in a much larger sample of living human brains by analyzing the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7 Tesla Retinotopy Dataset (including 107 females and 71 males). This dataset includes retinotopic maps measured with functional MRI (fMRI) and fiber tract data measured with diffusion MRI (dMRI). We found a negative correlation between OT fractional anisotropy (FA) and V1 surface area (<I>r</I> = &ndash;0.19). This correlation, although small, was consistent across multiple dMRI datasets differing in acquisition parameters. Further, we found that both V1 surface area and OT properties were correlated among twins, with higher correlations for monozygotic (MZ) than dizygotic (DZ) twins, indicating a high degree of heritability for both properties. Together, these results demonstrate covariation across individuals in properties of the retina (OT) and cortex (V1) and show that each is influenced by genetic factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The size of human primary visual cortex (V1) has large interindividual differences. These differences do not scale with overall brain size. A previous postmortem study reported a correlation between the size of the human optic tract (OT) and V1. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the OT and V1 in living humans by analyzing a neuroimaging dataset that included functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. We found a small, but robust correlation between OT tissue properties and V1 size, supporting the existence of structural covariance between the OT and V1 in living humans. The results suggest that characteristics of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), reflected in OT measurements, are correlated with individual differences in human V1.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">High-Definition Transcranial Stimulation over the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Alters the Sunk Cost Effect: A Mental Accounting Framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sunk cost effect refers to the fact that human decisions are consistently influenced by previous irrecoverable and irrelevant costs. Recent neuroimaging experiments suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) plays a pivotal role in the sunk cost effect yet the causal and neurocomputational role of the dlPFC remains elusive. In this study, two cohorts of healthy human male and female adults were recruited to complete a novel two-step decision-making task during the anodal-sham or cathodal-sham high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over the dlPFC, respectively. Consistent with previous studies, we showed that the sunk cost deterred participants from making further investment and therefore engendered a de-escalation effect. Such behavior can be captured by a weighted mental accounting model with a recalibrated reference point in which the direction and magnitude of the sunk cost effects hinge on the decision weights apportioned to the option values. Interestingly, transcranial stimulation did not influence participants' initial willingness to incur sunk costs but only altered sunk costs' downstream effects. Specifically, anodal stimulation over the right dlPFC amplified the de-escalation effect of sunk costs whereas cathodal stimulation yielded the opposite result. HD-tDCS also changed the decision weights of the mental accounting model, providing a causal and computational link between PFC and sunk cost effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traditional economic theory assumes that decisions only concern the marginal costs and benefits yet human choices are notoriously susceptible to previously-incurred costs (termed the sunk cost effect). In the current study, we showed that direct current stimulation (DCS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) altered sunk cost effects in participants' subsequent choices. Such effects can be captured by a mental accounting model where transcranial stimulation modulates the decision weights assigned to different options in the value integration process. These findings help elucidate the computational and causal role of the dlPFC in the context of sunk costs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task-Dependent Warping of Semantic Representations during Search for Visual Action Categories</a></h4>

              
                <p>Object and action perception in cluttered dynamic natural scenes relies on efficient allocation of limited brain resources to prioritize the attended targets over distractors. It has been suggested that during visual search for objects, distributed semantic representation of hundreds of object categories is warped to expand the representation of targets. Yet, little is known about whether and where in the brain visual search for action categories modulates semantic representations. To address this fundamental question, we studied brain activity recorded from five subjects (one female) via functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed natural movies and searched for either communication or locomotion actions. We find that attention directed to action categories elicits tuning shifts that warp semantic representations broadly across neocortex and that these shifts interact with intrinsic selectivity of cortical voxels for target actions. These results suggest that attention serves to facilitate task performance during social interactions by dynamically shifting semantic selectivity toward target actions and that tuning shifts are a general feature of conceptual representations in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to swiftly perceive the actions and intentions of others is a crucial skill for humans that relies on efficient allocation of limited brain resources to prioritize the attended targets over distractors. However, little is known about the nature of high-level semantic representations during natural visual search for action categories. Here, we provide the first evidence showing that attention significantly warps semantic representations by inducing tuning shifts in single cortical voxels, broadly spread across occipitotemporal, parietal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices. This dynamic attentional mechanism can facilitate action perception by efficiently allocating neural resources to accentuate the representation of task-relevant action categories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decoding the Specificity of Post-Error Adjustments Using EEG-Based Multivariate Pattern Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Errors can elicit post-error adjustments that serve to optimize performance by preventing further errors. An essential but unsolved issue is that whether post-error adjustments are domain-general or domain-specific, which was investigated in the present study through eliciting different types of errors. Behavioral and electrophysiological data were recorded when male and female subjects performed the Eriksen flanker task. For this study, we examined the aforementioned issue by combining event-related potential and multivariate pattern analysis. The results indicated that post-error slowing, error-related negativity, and error positivity were comparable between congruent and incongruent errors, indicating that errors triggered domain-general interference mechanisms, whereas post-error accuracy and late positive potential elicited by incongruent errors were larger than those elicited by congruent errors, exhibiting domain-specific control adjustment mechanisms. Importantly, no successful decoding soon after errors was found between congruent and incongruent errors, but above-chance decoding was observed between these two types of errors with increasing time, which further support that domain-general adjustments occurred in the early stage, whereas domain-specific adjustments appeared in the late stage. Furthermore, brain-behavior correlation results suggested that the late post-error adjustments predicted subsequent behavior performance. Together, this study revealed that early domain-general interference adjustments induced by errors are reflected in error detection and error awareness, which are independent of error types; on the contrary, late domain-specific control adjustments are reflected in attentional adjustments, which are modulated by error types.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To date, clear evidence on the specificity of post-error adjustments is lacking. The present study provides neurophysiological evidence that post-error adjustments simultaneously rely on both domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms. Event-related potential results indicated that domain-general adjustments were accompanied by the interference of error detection and error awareness. In contrast, domain-specific adjustments were associated with attentional adjustments. Multivariate pattern analysis further decoded the two features of post-error adjustments in the early stage matching the time patterns of error-related negativity and error positivity and in the late stage corresponding to the late positive potential. Temporal generalization analysis showed that domain-specific processing appeared stably in late post-error adjustments. Hence, we propose that post-error different stages may determine the specificity of post-error adjustments.</p>

                <p>The complex pathophysiology of post-traumatic brain damage might need a polypharmacological strategy with a combination of drugs that target multiple, synergistic mechanisms. We currently tested a combination of apocynin (curtails formation of reactive oxygen species), tert-butylhydroquinone (promotes disposal of reactive oxygen species), and salubrinal (prevents endoplasmic reticulum stress) following a moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced by controlled cortical impact in adult mice. Adult mice of both sexes treated with the above tri-combo showed alleviated motor and cognitive deficits, attenuated secondary lesion volume, and decreased oxidative DNA damage. Concomitantly, tri-combo treatment regulated post-TBI inflammatory response by decreasing the infiltration of T cells and neutrophils and activation of microglia in both sexes. Interestingly, sexual dimorphism was seen in the case of TBI-induced microgliosis and infiltration of macrophages in the tri-combo&ndash;treated mice. Moreover, the tri-combo treatment prevented TBI-induced white matter volume loss in both sexes. The beneficial effects of tri-combo treatment were long-lasting and were also seen in aged mice. Thus, the present study supports the tri-combo treatment to curtail oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress concomitantly as a therapeutic strategy to improve TBI outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Of the several mechanisms that contribute to TBI pathophysiology, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation play a major role. The present study shows the therapeutic potential of a combination of apocynin, tert-butylhydroquinone, and salubrinal to prevent oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress and the interrelated inflammatory response in mice subjected to TBI. The beneficial effects of the tri-combo include alleviation of TBI-induced motor and cognitive deficits and lesion volume. The neuroprotective effects of the tri-combo are also linked to its ability to prevent TBI-induced white matter damage. Importantly, neuroprotection by the tri-combo treatment was observed to be not dependent on sex or age. Our data demonstrate that a polypharmacological strategy is efficacious after TBI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inflammatory markers in patients who presented with acute coronary syndrome and history of COVID-19 infection: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of patients who have developed acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has soared rapidly, cardiovascular disease and mortality are influenced by the elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The aim of this study is to compare inflammatory markers between patients with ACS who hadn’t previously had COVID-19 and those who’d be infected within the preceding three months; as well as, evaluating the effect of statins on inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: This is a comparative cross-sectional study of 42 patients who presented with ACS and had previously had COVID-19 and 48 patient who had never had COVID-19, who were admitted to the coronary care unit at the Iraqi Center for Heart Disease and Baghdad Teaching Hospital, Iraq. Inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IL-6, and HS-CRP) levels were determined in serum samples of all patients at admission to these centers then one month later, after administration of statins daily using the Sandwich-ELISA Principle, and Immunofluorescence technique for these markers. Result: The baseline for patients who had ACS and COVID-19 three months previously, were IL6 (85.87 ±45.80), HS-CRP (23.19 ± 14.49), and TNF-α (161.94± 240.96) were higher than patients that had ACS but not COVID-19; IL6 (50.77±22.48), HS-CRP (13.64± 12.09), and TNF-α (117.73 ±71.23),(p<0.0001), (p=0.003) and (p=0.201) for IL6, HS-CRP, and TNF-α respectively. Rosuvastatin showed a significant reduction in HS-CRP and IL6 (P<0.001), while Atorvastatin a significant reduction in HS-CRP (P<0.001) after one month of therapy. Yet there was no significant difference in the level of TNF α in these two groups at the end of this study.     Conclusions: The patients with previous COVID-19 still had higher inflammatory markers than those who didn’t. Rosuvastatin 40mg had a more reduction in IL6 than Atorvastatin 40mg after one month and both of them could reduce HS-CRP, but neither could reduce TNF-α in this short period.

This study quantifies the proportion of myenteric nerve cell bodies along the mouse colon that are immunoreactive to CGRP. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Quantitative data of biological systems provide valuable baseline information for understanding pathology, experimental perturbations, and computational modeling. In mouse colon, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed by myenteric neurons with multiaxonal (Dogiel type II) morphology, characteristic of intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs). Analogous neurons in other species and gut regions represent 5–35% of myenteric neurons. We aimed to quantify proportions of CGRP-immunopositive (CGRP+) myenteric neurons. Colchicine-treated wholemount preparations of proximal, mid, and distal colon were labeled for HuC/D, CGRP, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and peripherin (Per). The pan-neuronal markers (Hu+/Per+) co-labeled 94% of neurons. Hu+/Per– neurons comprised ∼6%, but Hu-/Per+ cells were rare. Thus, quantification was based on Hu+ myenteric neurons (8576 total; 1225 ± 239 per animal, <i>n</i> = 7). CGRP+ cell bodies were significantly larger than the average of all Hu+ neurons (329 ± 13 vs. 261 ± 12 μm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> &lt; .0001). CGRP+ neurons comprised 19% ± 3% of myenteric neurons without significant regional variation. NOS+ neurons comprised 42% ± 2% of myenteric neurons overall, representing a lower proportion in proximal colon, compared to mid and distal colon (38% ± 2%, 44% ± 2%, and 44% ± 3%, respectively). Peripherin immunolabeling revealed cell body and axonal morphology in some myenteric neurons. Whether all CGRP+ neurons were multiaxonal could not be addressed using peripherin immunolabeling. However, of 118 putatively multiaxonal neurons first identified based on peripherin immunoreactivity, all were CGRP+ (<i>n</i> = 4). In conclusion, CGRP+ myenteric neurons in mouse colon were comprehensively quantified, occurring within a range expected of a putative IPAN marker. All Per+ multiaxonal neurons, characteristic of Dogiel type II/IPAN morphology, were CGRP+.</p>

                Primary cardiac tumors (PCTs) are extremely rare entities. More than half of PCTs are benign, with myxoma being the most common tumor. Generally, simple tumor resection is the treatment of choice for benign PCTs since it has promising results that yield low complication and recurrence rates. However, in the COVID-19 pandemic era, the mitigation protocols and/or concurrent COVID-19 infection should be taken into account in patient management for the best overall outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with a left atrial myxoma and systemic embolism complication in the form of an ischemic stroke, with a concurrent confirmed COVID-19 delta variant infection.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To test e-ASPECTS software in patients with stroke. Marketed as a decision-support tool, e-ASPECTS may detect features of ischemia or hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) imaging and quantify ischemic extent using ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using CT from nine stroke studies, we compared software with masked experts. As per indications for software use, we assessed e-ASPECTS results for patients with/without middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemia but no other cause of stroke. In an analysis outside the intended use of software, we enriched our dataset with non-MCA ischemia, hemorrhage, and mimics to simulate a representative ‘front door’ hospital population. With final diagnosis as the reference standard, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS for identifying stroke features (ischemia, hyperattenuated arteries, hemorrhage) in the representative population.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 4100 patients (51% female, median age 78 years, NIHSS 10, onset to scan 2·5 hours). Final diagnosis was ischemia (78%), hemorrhage (14%), or mimic (8%). From 3035 CTs with expert-rated ASPECTS, most (2084/3035, 69%) e-ASPECTS results were within one point of experts. In the representative population, the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS was 71% (95% confidence interval, 70-72%) for detecting ischemic features, 85% (83-86%) for hemorrhage. Software identified more false positive ischemia (12% vs 2%) and hemorrhage (14% vs &lt;1%) than experts.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>On independent testing, e-ASPECTS provided moderate agreement with experts and overcalled stroke features. Therefore, future prospective trials testing impacts of AI software on patient care and outcome are required before widespread implementation of stroke decision-support software.</p>

                Recent allostatic–interoceptive explanations using predictive coding models propose that efficient regulation of the body’s internal milieu is necessary to correctly anticipate environmental needs. We review this framework applied to understanding behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) considering both allostatic overload and interoceptive deficits. First, we show how this framework could explain divergent deficits in bvFTD (cognitive impairments, behavioral maladjustment, brain atrophy, fronto-insular-temporal network atypicality, aberrant interoceptive electrophysiological activity, and autonomic disbalance).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diverse states and stimuli tune olfactory receptor expression levels to modulate food-seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                Animals must weigh competing needs and states to generate adaptive behavioral responses to the environment. Sensorimotor circuits are thus tasked with integrating diverse external and internal cues relevant to these needs to generate context-appropriate behaviors. However, the mechanisms that underlie this integration are largely unknown. Here, we show that a wide range of states and stimuli converge upon a single <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> olfactory neuron to modulate food-seeking behavior. Using an unbiased ribotagging approach, we find that the expression of olfactory receptor genes in the AWA olfactory neuron is influenced by a wide array of states and stimuli, including feeding state, physiological stress, and recent sensory cues. We identify odorants that activate these state-dependent olfactory receptors and show that altered expression of these receptors influences food-seeking and foraging. Further, we dissect the molecular and neural circuit pathways through which external sensory information and internal nutritional state are integrated by AWA. This reveals a modular organization in which sensory and state-related signals arising from different cell types in the body converge on AWA and independently control chemoreceptor expression. The synthesis of these signals by AWA allows animals to generate sensorimotor responses that reflect the animal’s overall state. Our findings suggest a general model in which sensory- and state-dependent transcriptional changes at the sensory periphery modulate animals’ sensorimotor responses to meet their ongoing needs and states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of sequence determinants of enhancer function using natural genetic variation</a></h4>

              
                Sequence variation in enhancers that control cell type-specific gene transcription contributes significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations. However, it remains difficult to predict precisely the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor (TF) binding to enhancers in their native genomic context. Using F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice, we identified thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. We find that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. We observe that the AP-1 family of TFs (Fos/Jun) are frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function, including sequences flanking core TF motifs and AP-1 half sites. Taken together, these data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific TF binding and enhancer function to date and reveal how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Arabidopsis SAC9 enzyme is enriched in a cortical population of early endosomes and restricts PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane</a></h4>

              
                Membrane lipids, and especially phosphoinositides, are differentially enriched within the eukaryotic endomembrane system. This generates a landmark code by modulating the properties of each membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] specifically accumulates at the plasma membrane in yeast, animal, and plant cells, where it regulates a wide range of cellular processes including endocytic trafficking. However, the functional consequences of mispatterning PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plants are unknown. Here, we functionally characterized the putative phosphoinositide phosphatase <i>SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9</i> (SAC9) in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<i>Arabidopsis</i>). We found that SAC9 depletion led to the ectopic localization of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on cortical intracellular compartments, which depends on PI4P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production at the plasma membrane. SAC9 localizes to a subpopulation of <i>trans</i>-Golgi Network/early endosomes that are enriched in a region close to the cell cortex and that are coated with clathrin. Furthermore, it interacts and colocalizes with Src Homology 3 Domain Protein 2 (SH3P2), a protein involved in endocytic trafficking. In the absence of SAC9, SH3P2 localization is altered and the clathrin-mediated endocytosis rate is reduced. Together, our results highlight the importance of restricting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane and illustrate that one of the consequences of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> misspatterning in plants is to impact the endocytic trafficking.

                Omics-based technologies are driving major advances in precision medicine, but efforts are still required to consolidate their use in drug discovery. In this work, we exemplify the use of multi-omics to support the development of 3-chloropiperidines, a new class of candidate anticancer agents. Combined analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility elucidated the mechanisms underlying sensitivity to test agents. Furthermore, we implemented a new versatile strategy for the integration of RNA- and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) data, able to accelerate and extend the standalone analyses of distinct omic layers. This platform guided the construction of a perturbation-informed basal signature predicting cancer cell lines’ sensitivity and to further direct compound development against specific tumor types. Overall, this approach offers a scalable pipeline to support the early phases of drug discovery, understanding of mechanisms, and potentially inform the positioning of therapeutics in the clinic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human WDR5 promotes breast cancer growth and metastasis via KMT2-independent translation regulation</a></h4>

              
                Metastatic breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer related deaths in women and there are few effective therapies against this advanced disease. Emerging evidence suggests that key steps of tumor progression and metastasis are controlled by reversible epigenetic mechanisms. Using an <i>in vivo</i> genetic screen, we identified WDR5 as an actionable epigenetic regulator that is required for metastatic progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer. We found that knockdown of WDR5 in breast cancer cells independently impaired their tumorigenic as well as metastatic capabilities. Mechanistically, WDR5 promotes cell growth by increasing ribosomal gene expression and translation efficiency in a KMT2-independent manner. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition or degradation of WDR5 impedes cellular translation rate and the clonogenic ability of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, combination of WDR5-targeting with mTOR inhibitors leads to potent suppression of translation and proliferation of breast cancer cells. These results reveal novel therapeutic strategies to treat metastatic breast cancer.

                Facial affect is expressed dynamically – a giggle, grimace, or an agitated frown. However, the characterisation of human affect has relied almost exclusively on static images. This approach cannot capture the nuances of human communication or support the naturalistic assessment of affective disorders. Using the latest in machine vision and systems modelling, we studied dynamic facial expressions of people viewing emotionally salient film clips. We found that the apparent complexity of dynamic facial expressions can be captured by a small number of simple spatiotemporal states – composites of distinct facial actions, each expressed with a unique spectral fingerprint. Sequential expression of these states is common across individuals viewing the same film stimuli but varies in those with the melancholic subtype of major depressive disorder. This approach provides a platform for translational research, capturing dynamic facial expressions under naturalistic conditions and enabling new quantitative tools for the study of affective disorders and related mental illnesses.

                Cortical circuits are composed predominantly of pyramidal-to-pyramidal neuron connections, yet their assembly during embryonic development is not well understood. We show that embryonic layer 5 pyramidal neurons, identified through single cell transcriptomics, display two phases of circuit assembly in vivo. At E14.5, a multi-layered circuit motif, composed of a single layer 5 cell type, forms. This motif is transient, switching to a second circuit motif, involving all three types, by E17.5. In vivo targeted single cell recordings and two-photon calcium imaging of embryonic layer 5 neurons reveal that, in both phases, neurons have active somas and neurites, tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated conductances, and functional glutamatergic synapses. Embryonic layer 5 neurons strongly express autism-associated genes, and perturbing these genes disrupts the switch between the two motifs. Hence, layer 5 pyramidal neurons form transient active pyramidal-to-pyramidal circuits, at the inception of neocortex, and studying these circuits could yield insights into the etiology of autism.

                Mechanisms of neuromodulatory transmission in the brain remain ambiguous. Dopamine is a prototypical neuromodulator, and it was recently found that its secretion relies on active zone-like release site assemblies. Here, we use in vivo biotin-identification (iBioID) proximity proteomics in mouse striatum to isolate dopamine release site proteins enriched over the general dopamine axonal protein content. Using three bait proteins, we identified 527 proteins that fall into several synaptic protein classes, including active zone, calcium regulatory and synaptic vesicle proteins. We also detected many proteins not previously associated with synaptic exocytosis. Knockout of the presynaptic organizer protein RIM profoundly disrupted dopamine release site composition assessed by iBioID, while Synaptotagmin-1 knockout did not. Alpha-synuclein, a protein linked to Parkinson's disease, was enriched at release sites, and this enrichment was lost in both tested mutants. We conclude that RIM organizes scaffolded dopamine release sites and we define the protein composition of these sites.

	<p>The cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is a highly complex anatomical compartment consisting of numerous nervous and vascular structures that present mutual and intricate spatial relationships. CPA surgery represents, therefore, a constant challenge for neurosurgeons. Over the years, neurosurgeons have developed and refined several solutions with the aim of maximizing the surgical treatment effects while minimizing the invasiveness and risks for the patient. In this paper, we present our integrated approach to CPA surgery, describing its advantages in treating pathologies in this anatomical district. Our approach incorporates the use of technology, such as neuronavigation, along with advanced and multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) techniques, with the final goal of making this surgery safe and effective.</p>

	<p>Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is one of the least studied and understood developmental disorders. One area that has been minimally investigated in DCD is potential issues with sensory modulation. Further, in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) sensory modulation is related to many other challenges (e.g., social issues, repetitive behaviors, anxiety); however, such potential relationships in children with DCD have been largely unexplored. The purpose of this study is to explore sensory modulation differences in DCD and to understand the relationships between sensory modulation and social emotional measures, behavior, and motor skills in DCD in comparison to ASD and typically developing (TD) peers. Participants (aged 8&amp;amp;ndash;17) and their caregivers (DCD, N = 26; ASD, N = 57; and TD, N = 53) completed behavioral and clinical measures. The results indicated that 31% of the DCD group showed sensory modulation difficulties, with the DCD group falling between the ASD and TD groups. In the DCD group, sensory modulation was significantly associated with anxiety, empathic concern, repetitive behaviors, and motor skills. Data are compared to patterns seen in ASD and TD groups and implications for interventions are discussed.</p>

	<p>Background: Although there is increasing knowledge about adjustment disorder (AjD) based on the new diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), less is known on AjD in adolescents. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of AjD and its risk factors in Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. Methods: The cross-sectional study sample comprised 1745 adolescents from Japan (n = 913) and Lithuania (n = 832). AjD was assessed using the Adjustment Disorder New Module-8 (ADNM-8). We compared the prevalence of AjD in Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. Using multinominal logistic regression analysis, we examined the effects of age, gender, socioeconomic status, and cumulative stressors as societal and cultural factors, resilience as an intrapersonal factor, and loneliness and perceived support as interpersonal factors on adolescent AjD. Results: The prevalence of probable AjD was 11.7% in Lithuanian adolescents and 6.9% in Japanese adolescents. Gender, socioeconomic status, cumulative stressors, resilience, loneliness, and perceived positive social support were each significantly associated with AjD risk. Conclusions: This cross-cultural comparative study revealed characteristics of the stressors and prevalence of AjD among Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. In terms of the socio-interpersonal framework model for the stress&amp;amp;ndash;response syndrome, sociocultural, intrapersonal, and interpersonal factors were found to be risk factors associated with AjD in adolescents.</p>
