              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09034">Recovering Whole-Brain Causal Connectivity under Indirect Observation with Applications to Human EEG and fMRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring directed connectivity from neuroimaging is an ill-posed inverse problem: recorded signals are distorted by hemodynamic filtering and volume conduction, which can mask true neural interactions. Many existing methods conflate these observation artifacts with genuine neural influence, risking spurious causal graphs driven by the measurement process. We introduce INCAMA (INdirect CAusal MAmba), a latent-space causal discovery framework that explicitly accounts for measurement physics to separate neural dynamics from indirect observations. INCAMA integrates a physics-aware inversion module with a nonstationarity-driven, delay-sensitive causal discovery model based on selective state-space sequences. Leveraging nonstationary mechanism shifts as soft interventions, we establish identifiability of delayed causal structure from indirect measurements and a stability bound that quantifies how inversion error affects graph recovery. We validate INCAMA on large-scale biophysical simulations across EEG and fMRI, where it significantly outperforms standard pipelines. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to real-world fMRI from the Human Connectome Project: without domain-specific fine-tuning, INCAMA recovers canonical visuo-motor pathways (e.g., $V1 \to V2$ and $M1 \leftrightarrow S1$) consistent with established neuroanatomy, supporting its use for whole-brain causal inference.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09852">Open diffusion MRI and connectivity data for epilepsy and surgery: The IDEAS II release</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epileptic seizures are generated in cerebral networks that propagate ictal and interictal activity. The structure of cerebral networks underpinning epileptic activity can be inferred from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI). However, publicly available DWI data in individuals with epilepsy are scarce, and processing is technically challenging due to scan-specific artifacts, limiting research progress. Here, we release raw DWI data from 216 individuals with epilepsy and 98 healthy controls. Subject identifiers align with our previous data release (IDEAS), which includes T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI, surgical details, and long-term seizure outcomes after surgery. Preprocessing reduced distortions and artifacts, while fully processed data include diffusion metric maps in native and template space. We also provide parcellated structural connectomes using multiple atlases and connectivity measures. To illustrate the utility of this IDEAS II data, we replicated ENIGMA consortium findings, observing widespread reductions of fractional anisotropy, particularly ipsilateral to the area of seizure onset. We further demonstrate localised abnormality, and network connectivity using streamline tractography in a patient who subsequently underwent temporal lobe resection. This open dataset offers a comprehensive resource to advance research on structural connectivity and surgical outcomes in epilepsy.

                arXiv:2602.09491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitivity to small changes in the environment is crucial for many real-world tasks, enabling living and artificial systems to make correct behavioral decisions. It has been shown that such sensitivity is maximized when a system operates near the critical point of a phase transition. However, proximity to criticality introduces large fluctuations and diverging timescales. Hence, to leverage the maximal sensitivity, it would require impractically long integration periods. Here, we analytically and computationally demonstrate how the optimal tuning of a recurrent neural network is determined given a finite integration time. Rather than maximizing the theoretically available sensitivity, we find networks attain different sensitivities depending on the available time. Consequently, the optimal dynamic regime can shift away from criticality when integration times are finite, highlighting the necessity of incorporating finite-time considerations into studies of information processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09997">Popularity Feedback Constrains Innovation in Cultural Markets</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world creative processes ranging from art to science rely on social feedback-loops between selection and creation. Yet, the effects of popularity feedback on collective creativity remain poorly understood. We investigate how popularity ratings influence cultural dynamics in a large-scale online experiment where participants ($N = 1\,008$) iteratively \textit{select} images from evolving markets and \textit{produce} their own modifications. Results show that exposing the popularity of images reduces cultural diversity and slows innovation, delaying aesthetic improvements. These findings are mediated by alterations of both selection and creation. During selection, popularity information triggers cumulative advantage, with participants preferentially building upon popular images, reducing diversity. During creation, participants make less disruptive changes, and are more likely to expand existing visual patterns. Feedback loops in cultural markets thus not only shape selection, but also, directly or indirectly, the form and direction of cultural innovation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14046">Clarifying the conceptual dimensions of representation in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.14046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the centrality of the notion of representation in neuroscience, the field lacks a unified framework for the concepts used to characterize representation, leading to disparate use of both terminology and measures associated with it. To offer clarification, we propose a core set of conceptual dimensions that characterize representations in neuroscience. These dimensions describe relations between a neural response, features that may be represented, and downstream effects of the neural response. A neural response may be shown to be sensitive or specific to a feature, invariant to other features, or functional (it is used downstream in the brain). We use information-theoretic measures to illustrate these conceptual dimensions and explain how they relate to data analysis methods such as correlational analyses, decoding and encoding models, representational similarity analysis, and tests of statistical dependence or adaptation. We consider several canonical examples, including models of the representation of orientation, numerosity, and spatial location, which illustrate how the evidence put forth in support or criticism of these models is systematized by our framework. By offering a unified conceptual framework to characterize representation in neuroscience, we hope to aid the comparison and integration of results across studies and research groups and to help determine when evidence for a neural representation is strong.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02044">A Brain Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training and Prompt-Tuning across Broad Atlases and Disorders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.02044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13638">State Space Models Naturally Produce Time Cell and Oscillatory Behaviors and Scale to Abstract Cognitive Functions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, how these low-level phenomena eventually produce abstract behaviors remains largely unresolved. Here, we propose that a model based on State Space Models, an emerging class of deep learning architectures, can be a potential biological model for analysis. We suggest that the differential equations governing elements in a State Space Model are conceptually consistent with the dynamics of biophysical processes, while the model offers a scalable framework to build on the dynamics to produce emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this model by training a network employing a diagonal state transition matrix on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that neural behaviors such as time cells naturally emerge from two fundamental principles: optimal pre-configuration and rotational dynamics. These features are shown mathematically to optimize history compression, and naturally generate structured temporal dynamics even prior to training, mirroring recent findings in biological circuits. We show that learning acts primarily as a selection mechanism that fine-tunes these pre-configured oscillatory modes, rather than constructing temporal codes de novo. The model can be readily scaled to abstract cognitive functions such as event counting, supporting the use of State Space Models as a computationally tractable framework for understanding neural activities.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07342">Beyond Grid-Locked Voxels: Neural Response Functions for Continuous Brain Encoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.07342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural encoding models aim to predict fMRI-measured brain responses to natural images. fMRI data is acquired as a 3D volume of voxels, where each voxel has a defined spatial location in the brain. However, conventional encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid. We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses: (1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns; modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D space.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07816">Beyond Expertise: Stable Individual Differences in Predictive Eye-Hand Coordination</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.07816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human eye-hand coordination relies on internal forward models that predict future states and compensate for sensory delays. During line tracing, the gaze typically leads the hand through predictive saccades, yet the extent to which this predictive window reflects expertise or intrinsic individual traits remains unclear. In this study, I examined eye-hand coordination in professional calligraphers and non-experts performing a controlled line tracing task. The temporal coupling between saccade distance (SD) and pen speed (PS) revealed substantial interpersonal variability: SD-PS peak times ranged from approximately -50 to 400 ms, forming stable, participant-specific predictive windows that were consistent across trials. These predictive windows closely matched each individual's pen catch-up time, indicating that the oculomotor system stabilizes fixation in anticipation of the hand's future velocity rather than relying on reactive pursuit. Neither the spatial indices (mean gaze-pen distance, mean saccade distance) nor the temporal index (SD-PS peak time) differed between calligraphers and non-calligraphers, and none of these predictive parameters correlated with tracing accuracy. These findings suggest that diverse predictive strategies can achieve equivalent performance, consistent with the minimum intervention principle of optimal feedback control. Together, the results indicate that predictive timing in eye-hand coordination reflects a stable, idiosyncratic Predictive Protocol shaped by individual neuromotor constraints rather than by expertise or training history.

Abstract: The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests it accesses internal world models (IWMs). We employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) via imagination vividness ratings, distinguishing offline world models (persistent memory structures accessed independent of immediate goals) from online models (task-specific representations). Analyzing 2,743 humans across three populations and six LLM variants, we find human imagination networks exhibit robust structural consistency, with high centrality correlations and aligned clustering. LLMs show minimal clustering and weak correlations with human networks, even with conversational memory, across environmental and sensory contexts. These differences highlight disparities in how biological and artificial systems organize internal representations. Our framework offers quantitative metrics for evaluating offline world models in cognitive agents.

Abstract: This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI) architecture intended to simulate the iterative updating of the human working memory system. It features several interconnected neural networks designed to emulate the specialized modules of the cerebral cortex. These are structured hierarchically and integrated into a global workspace. They are capable of temporarily maintaining high-level representational patterns akin to the psychological items maintained in working memory. This maintenance is made possible by persistent neural activity in the form of two modalities: sustained neural firing (resulting in a focus of attention) and synaptic potentiation (resulting in a short-term store). Representations held in persistent activity are recursively replaced resulting in incremental changes to the content of the working memory system. As this content gradually evolves, successive processing states overlap and are continuous with one another. The present article will explore how this architecture can lead to iterative shift in the distribution of coactive representations, ultimately leading to mental continuity between processing states, and thus to human-like thought and cognition. Taken together, these components outline a biologically motivated route toward synthetic consciousness or artificial sentience and subjectivity.

                arXiv:2511.02241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.

                arXiv:2602.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training transmission delays in spiking neural networks (SNNs) has been shown to substantially improve their performance on complex temporal tasks. In this work, we show that learning either axonal or dendritic delays enables deep feedforward SNNs composed of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons to reach accuracy comparable to existing synaptic delay learning approaches, while significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. SNN models with either axonal or dendritic delays achieve up to $95.58\%$ on the Google Speech Command (GSC) and $80.97\%$ on the Spiking Speech Command (SSC) datasets, matching or exceeding prior methods based on synaptic delays or more complex neuron models. By adjusting the delay parameters, we obtain improved performance for synaptic delay learning baselines, strengthening the comparison. We find that axonal delays offer the most favorable trade-off, combining lower buffering requirements with slightly higher accuracy than dendritic delays. We further show that the performance of axonal and dendritic delay models is largely preserved under strong delay sparsity, with as few as $20\%$ of delays remaining active, further reducing buffering requirements. Overall, our results indicate that learnable axonal and dendritic delays provide a resource-efficient and effective mechanism for temporal representation in SNNs.

                arXiv:2602.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.

                arXiv:2601.02411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting in domains like traffic management and industrial monitoring often requires real-time, energy-efficient processing on edge devices with limited resources. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power and have been proposed for use in this space. Unfortunately, existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often use complex transformer blocks. To address this issue, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via spiking selective scanning. Further, we introduce PTsoftplus and PTSiLU, two efficient approximations of SiLU and Softplus that replace costly exponential and division operations with simple bit-shifts. Evaluated on four multivariate time-series benchmarks, SpikySpace outperforms the leading SNN in terms of accuracy by up to 3.0% while reducing energy consumption by over 96.1%. As the first fully spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, opening a practical path toward efficient time series forecasting systems. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpikySpace.

Abstract: Nowadays, neural networks act as a synonym for artificial intelligence. Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency. Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms. We hope that a framework compatible with traditional ML pipelines may accelerate research in the area, specifically for continuous and unbatched learning, akin to the one animals exhibit.

                arXiv:2405.09351v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Besides classical feed-forward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) have gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated with a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps an affine linear transformation of the input to an affine linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that, depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller than or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that except for a Lebesgue measure zero set in the weight space, each critical point is non-degenerate if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the affine linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and infinite depth cases. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding and universal approximation, i.e., on the exact and approximate representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs.

                arXiv:2506.13865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.

Abstract: Decoding speech-related information from non-invasive MEG is a key step toward scalable brain-computer interfaces. We present compact Conformer-based decoders on the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL benchmark for two core tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, winning the Phoneme Classification Standard track.

                arXiv:2601.01082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms are typically limited to low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the state-of-the-art CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and hence receive the same discount value. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new capabilities for QD algorithms by introducing two new domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other existing black-box QD algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03970">Statistical Guarantees for Reasoning Probes on Looped Boolean Circuits</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.03970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical behaviour of reasoning probes in a stylized model of looped reasoning, given by Boolean circuits whose computational graph is a perfect $\nu$-ary tree ($\nu\ge 2$) and whose output is appended to the input and fed back iteratively for subsequent computation rounds. A reasoning probe has access to a sampled subset of internal computation nodes, possibly without covering the entire graph, and seeks to infer which $\nu$-ary Boolean gate is executed at each queried node, representing uncertainty via a probability distribution over a fixed collection of $\mathtt{m}$ admissible $\nu$-ary gates. This partial observability induces a generalization problem, which we analyze in a realizable, transductive setting.
  We show that, when the reasoning probe is parameterized by a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis class and queries $N$ nodes, the worst-case generalization error attains the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log(2/\delta)}/\sqrt{N})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$, for $\delta\in (0,1)$. Our analysis combines snowflake metric embedding techniques with tools from statistical optimal transport. A key insight is that this optimal rate is achievable independently of graph size, owing to the existence of a low-distortion one-dimensional snowflake embedding of the induced graph metric. As a consequence, our results provide a sharp characterization of how structural properties of the computational graph govern the statistical efficiency of reasoning under partial access.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal regulators of drug resistance and sensitivity in cancer cells, functioning as tumor suppressors or oncogenes that modulate the cellular response to anticancer drugs. While experimental identification of miRNA-mediated drug resistance and sensitivity is both costly and laborious, computational methods present a promising alternative. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) offer new opportunities to leverage large-scale unlabeled biomolecular data for enhanced relationship prediction. In this study, we introduce PLMF-MDA, a PLM-based cross-modal fusion model designed to predict miRNA-drug resistance (MDR) and miRNA-drug sensitivity (MDS) associations. PLMF-MDA integrates miRNA and drug multimodal embeddings derived from PLMs and intrinsic feature extractors, and employs a cross-modal attention fusion module to adaptively capture key interactions between modalities. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we manually constructed two benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the PLMF-MDA achieves superior prediction performance. Furthermore, case studies on anticancer drug docetaxel demonstrate its potential in discovering novel MDR (MDS) associations. All data and source code are available on GitHub: https://github.com/sheng-n/PLMF-MDA.

                <p>by David Hart, Kylie Cashwell, Anita Bhandari, Jayath Premasinghe, Cameron Schmidt</p>

Since the 1980s, semi-automated sperm motility analysis of phase contrast microscopy videos has been used to measure and categorize sperm motility patterns. Motility categories are determined from various kinematic parameters such as Curvilinear Velocity (VCL) and Beat Cross Frequency (BCF). These measures ultimately rely on the quality of the tracking for each individual sperm in the microscopy video. However, common approaches to sperm tracking require sample dilution and shortening the time window of observation (less than 1 to 2 seconds) to avoid tracking errors that occur when sperm cross paths. The post-ejaculatory lifespan of sperm can exceed several hours to days in some species, and long-term adaptive changes in motility pattern may be an important distinguishing factor for predictive modeling of sperm fertilizing competence. Improving the predictive value of computer assisted semen analysis will require accurate tracking of sperm trajectories over physiologically-relevant time scales and at the high cell densities typically found in semen. In this work, we identify a framework for accurately assessing the quality of sperm trajectory tracking that is independent of standard motility measures. We utilize cell tracking metrics adapted from the more common task of tracking adherent somatic cells and propose modifications based on the unique challenges of sperm video-microscopy. We also provide a small dataset of microscopy videos that includes 340 labeled sperm trajectories to allow for future comparisons and developments. Finally, we demonstrate that variations in configuration can lead to as much as a 30% improvement on metrics, showcasing their effectiveness at analyzing tracking quality.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide powerful tools for analyzing spatial distribution patterns of gene expression in tissue samples. However, they are limited by sparse gene detection and incomplete expression coverage. Several computational approaches based on reference scRNA-seq have been proposed to impute ST data and have achieved impressive results. However, these methods fail to fully explore latent temporal dependencies among cells and cannot accurately capture hidden gene-level regulatory mechanisms. To overcome those limitations, we propose SpaLSTF, a novel method for enhancing ST gene expression using a conditional diffusion model guided by scRNA-seq data. SpaLSTF captures gene expression relationships through a dual Markov process: one progressively perturbs scRNA-seq data with noise, while the other denoises it to reconstruct the original distribution. To effectively model contextual dependencies among cell states, we adopt a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. Furthermore, we design a cross-covariance attention mechanism within a Transformer (XCA-Transformer) to efficiently compute attention coefficients between gene expression and accurately predict the noise added at each step. In addition, we introduce a variational lower bound (VLB) objective and introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a regularization term, along with mean squared error loss, to ensure that the generated noise follows the target distribution. We compared the performance of SpaLSTF with seven state-of-the-art methods on twelve cross-platform datasets covering a variety of tissues and organs using nine evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrated that SpaLSTF outperforms competing methods in gene expression imputation, cell population identification, and spatial structure preservation.

                <p>by Jie Hu, Marius Moisa, Christian C. Ruff</p>

Cooperation, productivity, and cohesion in human societies depend on altruism, the tendency to share resources with others even though this is costly. While altruism is a widely shared social norm, people vary strongly in their inclination to behave altruistically, in particular across situations with different types of inequality in resource distribution. What neurobiological factors underlie this variability? And can these be targeted by interventions to enhance altruistic behavior? Here, we build on electroencephalography (EEG) evidence that altruistic choices during disadvantageous inequality correlate with oscillatory gamma-band coherence between frontal regions (representing other’s interest) and parietal regions (representing neural evidence accumulation). We apply a transcranial alternating current stimulation protocol designed to exogenously enhance this fronto-parietal coherence and find that this leads to increased altruism, specifically during disadvantageous inequality as hypothesized based on the EEG findings. Computational modeling reveals that this transcranial entrainment does not just add noise to the decision process but specifically increases the weight individuals assign to other-regarding concerns during choices. Our findings show that altruism can be enhanced by neurostimulation designed to enhance oscillatory synchronization between frontal and parietal areas. This establishes a neural basis for altruism and identifies a neural target for interventions aimed at improving prosocial behavior.

                Background Drawing on the literature on Strategic Management and the Entrepreneurial University approach, particularly through the lens of the Resource-Based View, this study explores how the Dynamic Managerial Capabilities (DMC) of campus leaders foster institutional capacity building in the context of post-conflict higher education. This study aims to develop a clear and detailed understanding of the current status of the University of Fallujah to support post-ISIS recovery efforts while enhancing overall institutional quality. An additional motivation is to assist university administrators in optimally using limited funds and resources by prioritizing core rebuilding areas that can improve institutional performance. Methods This study adopts a qualitative case study approach and employs a Higher Education Institutional Capacity Assessment Tool (HEICAT). This study aims to generate specific and concrete evidence on institutional needs that can inform the development efforts of scholars and stakeholders. It also seeks to build capacity among local administrators by supporting their ability to conduct ongoing institutional self-assessments using internationally recognized good practices. Results The findings reveal that institutional performance challenges in the case study stem less from material scarcity and more from underdeveloped human, social, and cognitive capital among the campus leaders. Conclusions Strengthening the managerial capabilities of campus leaders is essential for advancing institutional adaptability, improving quality assurance, and aligning with international academic standards in post-conflict higher education environments.

                Background Public sector organisations operating under decentralised governance systems increasingly rely on change management strategies to enhance employee performance. Limited empirical evidence explains how specific change management strategies influence employee performance within local governments in developing country contexts. This study examined the relationship between change management strategies and employee performance in Kasese and Kabarole District Local Governments in Western Uganda, drawing on Complexity Theory and Public Policy Theory to conceptualise performance as an outcome of interacting behavioural, motivational, and systemic forces within public institutions. Methods The study adopted a convergent parallel mixed-methods design that integrated descriptive and correlational quantitative approaches with qualitative case study and phenomenological inquiry. The target population comprised 252 permanent district employees, from whom a sample of 155 respondents was selected using Yamane’s formula. Quantitative data were collected using self-administered questionnaires and analysed using SPSS version 28. Qualitative data were generated through unstructured interviews. Pilot testing was conducted in Mitooma District to ensure instrument validity and reliability. Results Regression analysis demonstrated that change management strategies had a statistically significant positive effect on employee performance (B = 0.262, Beta = 0.441, t = 6.080, p < 0.001). Qualitative findings corroborated the quantitative results, revealing that leadership support, flexible organisational rules, and enhanced staff motivation played a critical role in improving employee performance within the district local governments. Conclusions The study concludes that effective change management strategies are central to improving employee performance in decentralised public institutions. Policy and practice implications include strengthening staff motivation and performance appraisal systems, promoting equitable employment opportunities, enhancing institutional flexibility, reducing excessive central government interference, and increasing fiscal support to local governments. The study contributes to public administration scholarship by extending the application of Complexity Theory and Public Policy Theory to decentralised governance contexts and advancing empirical evidence on the role of change management strategies in shaping employee performance outcomes within Sub-Saharan African local governments.

                Background Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN) is a standard practice for kidney donor transplantation due to fewer complications associated with the treatment. Retroperitoneal approach to LLDN is thought to be more advantageous in preventing injuries to various abdominal organs. However, the transition process from transperitoneal to retroperitoneal LLDN is important to ensure the best outcome for the patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the learning curve for retroperitoneal approach in LLDN among urologists in an individual and team-based approach. Methods A prospective analysis of retroperitoneal LLDN was performed on procedures performed by a kidney donor team consisting of four urologists from January 2019 to January 2022 at Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital, Indonesia. The data were taken from pre-existing medical records. The learning curve for the operation time, warm ischemic time, and estimated blood loss was analyzed using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. Phase 1 represents the initial learning curve, the phase 2 plateau represents the period of proficiency, while phase 3 represents the mastery period. Results A total of 127 retroperitoneal LLDN procedures were done during the study period by four operators with various experience. The average procedure needed to achieve proficiency was 16.5 procedures. Meanwhile, the average procedure needed to achieve mastery was 28 procedures. Shorter learning curve was achieved by operators with more experience in other laparoscopic procedures. Conclusions The learning curve for transition from transperitoneal to retroperitoneal approach to LLDN is relatively short and feasible for both individuals and teams of urologists. Therefore, transition to retroperitoneal approach is a feasible option to reduce the complication rate of LLDN.

                Background This study establishes a mathematically consistent and computational framework for the simultaneous identification of two time-dependent coefficients in a one-dimensional second-order parabolic partial differential equation. The considered problem is governed by nonlocal initial, boundary, and integral overdetermination conditions. Methods The direct problem is solved using the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method (FDM), which ensures unconditional stability and second-order accuracy in both spatial and temporal discretizations. The corresponding inverse problem is reformulated as a nonlinear regularized least-squares optimization problem and efficiently solved used the MATLAB subroutine lsqnonlin from the optimization Toolbox. Due to the intrinsic, ill-posedness of the inverse formulation, small input data errors lead to big output errors. Then, Tikhonov regularization, is employed to enhance numerical stability and robustness. Results Extensive numerical experiments are carried out under exact and noisy data to evaluate the numerical accuracy and convergence behavior of the method. The results confirm that the regularization technique effectively damps numerical oscillations, minimizes reconstruction error, and ensures reliable recovery of the unknown coefficients. Sensitivity analysis further reveals the essential role of the regularization parameter in controlling the trade-off between stability and accuracy. Conclusions The proposed approach provides an accurate and computationally efficient tool for IP in heat transfer, diffusion processes, and related applied sciences.

                This study employs a meta-analytic approach to synthesize empirical evidence on the psychological and behavioral determinants of fast fashion consumption. Integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with brand-related constructs—perceived scarcity, perceived quality, and self-congruity—this research examines how these factors shape consumer attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, consumption intentions, brand loyalty, and word-of-mouth. Using studies published between 2004 and 2024, a random-effects meta-analysis reveals that brand attitude is the strongest predictor of purchase intention, while self-congruity with fashion brands significantly enhances all TPB components. Perceived quality exerts a cross-cutting influence on both cognitive and social evaluations, reinforcing the multidimensional nature of consumer judgments. The findings extend the TPB framework by embedding symbolic and perceptual brand dimensions, offering a more comprehensive explanatory model of fashion consumption. From a managerial perspective, the results suggest that marketing strategies emphasizing authentic scarcity cues and alignment with consumers’ self-identity can strengthen emotional attachment, perceived control, and loyalty. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for designing culturally sensitive and identity-driven branding strategies in the fast fashion sector.

                This study maps global research trends on creative pathways in the development of scientific literacy in higher education during the period 2020–2024. The study is grounded in the growing demand for graduates who are not only scientifically literate but also capable of creative, critical, and interdisciplinary thinking in response to rapid transformations in 21st-century education. A bibliometric-based Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was employed, utilizing Publish or Perish and VOSviewer as the main analytical tools. Data were retrieved from the Google Scholar database and limited to peer-reviewed publications published between 2020 and 2024. The analysis included keyword co-occurrence mapping, temporal publication trends, and geographic and institutional contribution analysis, supported by Microsoft Excel and NVivo 14 for data classification and thematic synthesis. The results indicate a steady growth in publications addressing creative approaches to scientific literacy, with a marked increase in both publication volume and citation impact in 2023–2024. Major contributions originated from the United Kingdom, the United States, India, Indonesia, and Spain. Dominant conceptual clusters were formed around keywords such as creative thinking, scientific literacy, higher education, and educational technology. Bibliometric visualizations further reveal strong linkages between creative pathways, digital transformation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and reflective learning practices. By integrating bibliometric analysis with spatial and temporal mapping, this study provides a structured overview of the evolving research landscape. The findings offer valuable insights for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers seeking evidence-based directions for advancing innovation in scientific literacy within higher education.

                Background The genus Betta (family Osphronemidae) comprises over 70 species, many of which are endemic to Southeast Asia and highly vulnerable to habitat loss. While Betta splendens is well studied due to its importance in the ornamental fish trade, most wild Betta species remain poorly characterized, particularly at the genomic level. The Bangka Islands of Indonesia harbor several endemic Betta species threatened by peatland degradation. Methods We conducted an integrated meristic and genomic comparison of three endemic Bangka Island species—Betta burdigala, B. chloropharynx, and B. schalleri. Specimens were collected from peatland waters in Bangka, and meristic traits were examined to confirm diagnostic characteristics. High-molecular-weight DNA was extracted and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore PromethION technology, followed by de novo assembly and reference-guided scaffolding using the Betta splendens genome. Results The meristic analysis confirmed features consistent with their taxonomic placement within the coccina, waseri, and pugnax groups. Genome assembljies were highly contiguous and complete (BUSCO >97%), with B. chloropharynx showing the largest genome size, highest scaffold N50, and elevated retrotransposon content. Gene duplication analysis revealed dispersed duplications as the dominant category across all genomes, with variation in tandem and proximal duplicates. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated high collinearity, with B. chloropharynx and B. schalleri showing the closest relationship, while B. burdigala diverged earlier. The Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor A (CSF1RA) protein phylogenetic tree closely resembles the phylogenetic tree of nine fish species based on NCBI taxonomic data. We also identified two massive protein insertions in the CSF1RA of B. burdigala. Conclusions This study provides morphological and genomic evidence supporting the distinctiveness of Bangka’s endemic Betta species and delivers essential genomic resources for evolutionary research and conservation of these endangered freshwater fishes.

                Background While ivermectin is a common antiparasitic drug used in veterinary medicine, the effects of repeated administration at therapeutic doses have not been well studied. Of particular interest is the impact of ivermectin on electrolyte balance, blood biochemistry, and oxidation-related markers in rabbits, as these animals are known to be sensitive to drug-related metabolic disturbances and side effects. Methods A total of 10 clinically healthy adult male rabbits (1.5-2 kg) were randomly assigned to a control group with no treatment or to a treatment group receiving ivermectin subcutaneously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg once weekly for 30 days. The animals were housed in the physiological laboratory of the University of Fallujah under controlled environmental conditions. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected, and serum was analyzed for electrolytes, biochemical and oxidative markers, and liver enzyme activity using established laboratory methods. Results Repeated administration of ivermectin caused a statistically significant increase in potassium, sodium, chloride, and phosphate concentrations (P≤0.05) compared with baseline, while calcium and magnesium levels remained unchanged. Glucose, total protein, creatinine, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels increased statistically significantly (P≤0.05) compared with the control group, while albumin concentration decreased. Oxidative stress indicators showed increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity were also noted. Conclusions Repeated administration of ivermectin at therapeutic doses at short intervals causes disturbance in blood electrolyte balance, biochemical profile, and antioxidant system in rabbits, and may also negatively impact liver and kidney functions. These results indicate the need for cautions use of the drug, preferably limited to single administration at long intervals, to minimize the risk of side effects.

                In this review, we critically examine how e-leadership and workforce digital skills interact to enhance healthcare performance in post-COVID settings within emerging economies, addressing a knowledge gap concerning the joint influence of leadership behaviours and employee competencies on organisational outcomes in resource-constrained contexts. We anchored this review on the Upper Echelons Theory, which emphasises that leaders’ characteristics and cognitive frames shape strategic decisions, and the Technology-Organisation-Environment framework, which highlights the interplay of technological, organisational, and environmental factors in digital adoption. Employing a qualitative thematic review of empirical studies published between 2020 and 2025 and sourced from databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar, our review synthesises evidence on effective digital transformation strategies in healthcare. Our findings indicate that strategic e-leadership combined with workforce digital competence significantly improves efficiency, quality of care, innovation, remote collaboration, and organisational resilience. Successful interventions identified include digital dashboards, telehealth platforms, cloud-based patient management systems, and structured training programs, demonstrating the importance of aligning leadership vision, staff capability, and organisational resources. Persistent challenges encompass uneven distribution of digital skills among healthcare staff, limited assessment of leadership competence, infrastructural constraints, and insufficient longitudinal evidence on the sustainability and scalability of digital initiatives. Our review concludes that coordinated integration of leadership, workforce skills, and supportive organisational and technological infrastructures is essential for achieving resilient healthcare services. Policy implications involve institutionalising digital leadership frameworks, promoting continuous professional development, and investing in interoperable digital systems. Theoretical contributions reinforce the combined application of Upper Echelons and Technology-Organisation-Environment frameworks in explaining digital performance, while empirical contributions provide contextualised evidence of effective strategies and interventions. This review offers guidance for healthcare organisations, policymakers, and researchers seeking to enhance post-pandemic digital healthcare performance in emerging economies, emphasising the critical role of leadership, workforce capability, and organisational readiness in achieving sustainable outcomes.

                The Iraqi economy’s performance is impacted by the rivalry between public and private investment, which raises the country’s debt and reduces private investment, which in turn slows economic growth. As a result, the subject of crowding out is closely tied to both the public and private sectors and how they affect the country’s economy. To determine whether financial crowding out has occurred and whether there is a reciprocal relationship between government credit and private credit, this research focused on confirming the existence of financial crowding out through the levels of government credit and private credit in Iraq. Imbalances in the dynamic term of the agreement result in the long-term achievement of the difference, and the existence of integration implies the existence of a different economic connection. In both the short and long terms, there was a considerable inverse relationship between government credit and private credit, according to trends and conventional tests like the direction of the error limit mitigation (VECM) and (Wald). Due to the rise in government credit at the expense of private credit in the Iraqi economy, it produces outcomes that are comparable to those of a crowding-out model for financial credit.

                Abstract* This paper presents a new probability distribution known as the “Neutrosophic New Odd Weibull-Weibull Distribution (NNOWW)” by combining the proposed New Odd Weibull-Weibull (NOWW) distribution with the neutrosophic logic (the direct method of this logic). The distribution is presented in two theoretical frameworks. The derivation of several main distribution functions, along with their properties, is presented, accompanied by both theoretical and graphical representations of these properties. Parameters are estimated using three different methods, with Monte Carlo simulations conducted for various sample sizes to determine the estimation efficiency and the most suitable sample size for applying the distribution to real data. An applied framework tests its efficiency on real data representing the heart rate of 50 patients. The model was developed within this logic framework to define truth, falsity, and uncertainty in the data. The model was compared with five other neutrosophic distributions using criteria such as AIC, BIC, CAIC, and HQIC. The results showed a clear superiority of the NNOWW model across all indicators, confirming its accuracy and ability to represent uncertain data. Analytical graphs support this superiority. This model is recommended for use in medical fields and for analyzing Neutrosophic data.

                Before and after being exposed to fire, concrete-filled double-skin steel tubular (CFDST) beams were tested. Six square beams with outer tube thicknesses of 1.3, 1.7, and 2.6 mm were made and then put through pure torsion until they broke. Half of the samples were tested in normal conditions, and the other half were tested after being exposed to the ISO 834 standard fire for 90 minutes. The results showed that all the beams had stable and ductile torque–rotation behavior up to about 55° of twist, and there was no sign of brittle failure. After the heating and cooling cycles, the beams still had most of their torsional rigidity. The stiffness values were about two-thirds to nine-tenths of what they were before the fire. It was noted that making the outer steel wall thicker helped the beams keep more of their stiffness after being exposed to fire. The thicker walls clearly made the section less likely to lose torsional strength, which shows that wall thickness has a big effect on how things behave after a fire. The results showed that CFDST beams could still safely handle torsional loads after being in a fire. Because of this, they are good for use in bridge beams, transfer beams, and building cores, where both fire resistance and torsional strength are needed.

                Background Research on personality and vocational interests has reached a plateau, with correlations stabilising around r ≈ .48. This plateau occurs because dominant models, such as Holland’s RIASEC (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional) theory, treat interests as fixed matches to environments, rather than as dynamic outcomes of an individual’s psychology. This study introduces the Personality-Interest Motivational Sequences (PIMS) framework, which reinterprets vocational interests as emergent properties of facet-level personality trait configurations. Methods We analysed data from 504 final-year South African university students assessed with the Townsend Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and the O*NET Interest Profiler. A multinomial logistic regression model, trained on a subset of 404 participants and tested on a holdout set of 100, was used to predict primary RIASEC categories from 30 TPQ facet-level traits. Results The PIMS model predicted primary RIASEC categories with 60.0% accuracy, substantially exceeding the chance level of 16.7%. Investigative interests were predicted most effectively, with distinct facet-level sequences identified for this and other types. For example, an Investigative profile was characterised by low Resilience and Sociability facets coupled with high Thrill-seeking and Competence. Notably, the model found no single, consistent personality profile for Social interests, which reveals potential heterogeneity within this RIASEC category. Conclusions The findings support the PIMS framework, demonstrating that vocational interests are systematic outcomes of facet-level personality architecture. This moves the field from describing static correlations to modelling generative psychological mechanisms. The framework provides a foundation for moving beyond typological matching towards dynamic, personalised career pathwaying.

                Background Phacoemulsification is one of the most frequent surgeries in the world. However, prolonged use of phacoemulsification machines produces reactive oxygen species which will damage corneal endothelial cells. Ascorbic acid has an antioxidant capacity to neutralize oxidative stress in the anterior chamber. This study will investigate the protective effect of ascorbic acid on corneal endothelial cells in patients with hard nuclear cataracts. Methods This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Samples will be divided into three groups, and 500 mg of vitamin C, tid, or placebo will be received for seven weeks. Clinical characteristics, ascorbic acid, malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant capacity of patients in serum and aqueous humor will be measured before and after intervention and phacoemulsification. Conclusions Data from this study will reveal the protective effect of oral vitamin C supplementation on the corneal endothelial cells in patients with hard nucleus cataracts. This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT06781970; registered on 17 January 2025).

                Background This study examines the influence of auxiliary lighting configurations and artificial surface textures on the quality of 3D models generated using Structure from Motion (SfM) in an indoor laboratory setting. Method Experiments were conducted by capturing images of concrete, metal, and wooden specimens at a one-meter distance. Various lighting setups, including vertical and adjacent auxiliary lighting models, were tested to determine their impact on model accuracy. In addition, complex artificial textures, such as checkerboard patterns, were applied to the specimens to assess their effect on 3D model precision. Results Our results demonstrate that optimal lighting and artificial textures significantly enhance the accuracy of 3D models, especially for materials with uniform textures, such as painted metal. For materials with more varied textures, such as concrete and wood, improvements were notable but less pronounced. The combination of auxiliary lighting and artificial textures improved model quality by approximately 40% for high-texture materials and up to 60% for uniform-texture materials. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of image file formats in the SfM process. While RAW images stored in TIFF format offered a slight advantage over lossless JPEG in terms of model accuracy, the difference may not be substantial enough to justify the larger file size in situations where submillimeter precision is not required. Conclusions Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of tailored lighting and texturing strategies for achieving high-precision 3D models in SfM applications. These results are particularly relevant for structural testing and other applications that demand high-fidelity 3D reconstructions, providing a foundation for more accurate and reliable models.

                Berdugo-Vega et al. combine partial reprogramming and engram technologies to achieve molecular rejuvenation of learning-associated neuronal ensembles. Engram reprogramming counteracts molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological signs of aging and disease and is associated with behavioral improvements that are consistent with a rejuvenation of learning and memory capacities.

                Mg2+ is crucial for various cellular functions, but the effect of intracellular Mg2+ decrease remains obscure. Kawamura et al. show that the decrease triggers massive cell death by activating the NF-κB signal. Furthermore, cell death is distinct from the known types of regulated cell death, which are characterized by actin-driven protrusions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106439">map3k1 is required for spatial restriction of progenitor differentiation in planarians</a></h4>

              
                Planarian regeneration and tissue turnover involve fate specification in pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts. Neoblasts select fates through the expression of fate-specific transcription factors, generating specialized neoblasts. Specialized neoblasts are spatially intermingled and can be dispersed broadly, frequently being present far from their target tissue. The post-mitotic progeny of neoblasts, serving as progenitors, can migrate and differentiate into mature cell types. Pattern formation is thus strongly influenced by the migratory assortment and differentiation of fate-specified progenitors in precise locations, which we refer to as progenitor targeting. This central step of pattern maintenance and formation, however, is poorly understood. Here, we describe a requirement for the conserved <i>map3k1</i> gene in targeting, restricting post-mitotic progenitor differentiation to precise locations. RNAi of <i>map3k1</i> causes ectopic differentiation of eye progenitors along their migratory path, resulting in dispersed, ectopic eye cells and eyes. Other neural tissues similarly display ectopic posterior differentiation, and ectopic pharynx cells emerge dispersed laterally and anteriorly in <i>map3k1</i> RNAi animals. Ectopic differentiated cells are also found within the incorrect organs after <i>map3k1</i> RNAi, and ultimately, teratomas form. These findings implicate <i>map3k1</i> signaling in controlling the positional regulation of progenitor behavior – restricting progenitor differentiation to targeted locations in response to external cues in the local tissue environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105025">Sense of control buffers against stress</a></h4>

              
                Stress is one of the most pervasive causes of mental ill health across the lifespan. Subjective dimensions of stress perception, such as perceived control, are especially potent in shaping stress responses. While the impact of reduced or no control over stress is well understood, much less is known about whether heightened feelings of control buffer against the negative impact of later stress. We designed a novel paradigm with excellent psychometric properties to sensitively capture and induce different states of subjective control. Across two studies with a non-clinical sample of 768 adults, we show a robust association between sense of control and stress as well as symptoms of mental ill health. More importantly, in a subsample of 295 participants, we show that compared to a neutral control group, inducing a heightened state of subjective control buffers against the impact of later stress. These findings demonstrate a causal role for a heightened sense of control in mitigating the negative impact of stressful experiences and spell out important directions for future preventative interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97340">Compressed sensing-based approach identifies modular neural circuitry driving learned pathogen avoidance</a></h4>

              
                An animal’s survival hinges on its ability to integrate past information to modify future behavior. The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> adapts its behavior based on prior experiences with pathogen exposure, transitioning from attraction to avoidance of the pathogen. A systematic screen for the neural circuits that integrate the information of previous pathogen exposure to modify behavior has not been feasible because of the lack of tools for neuron type-specific perturbations. We overcame this challenge using methods based on compressed sensing to efficiently determine the roles of individual neuron types in learned avoidance behavior. Our screen revealed that distinct sets of neurons drive exit from lawns of pathogenic bacteria and prevent lawn re-entry. Using calcium imaging of freely behaving animals and optogenetic perturbations, we determined the neural dynamics that regulate one key behavioral transition after infection: stalled re-entry into bacterial lawns. We find that key neuron types govern pathogen lawn-specific stalling but allow the animal to enter nonpathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> lawns. Our study shows that learned pathogen avoidance requires coordinated transitions in discrete neural circuits and reveals the modular structure of this complex adaptive behavioral response to infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98283">Sex peptide targets distinct higher order processing neurons in the brain to induce the female post-mating response</a></h4>

              
                Sex peptide (SP) transferred during mating induces female post-mating responses including refractoriness to re-mate and increased oviposition in <i>Drosophila</i>. Yet, where SP-target neurons reside remained uncertain. Here, we show that expression of membrane-tethered SP (mSP) predominantly in the head or trunk either reduces receptivity or increases oviposition, respectively. Using fragments from large regulatory regions of <i>Sex Peptide Receptor</i>, <i>fruitless,</i> and <i>doublesex</i> genes together with intersectional expression of mSP, we identified distinct interneurons in the brain and abdominal ganglion controlling receptivity and oviposition. These SP response-inducing neurons (SPRINz) can induce post-mating responses through SP received by mating. Trans-synaptic mapping of neuronal connections reveals input from sensory processing neurons and two post-synaptic trajectories as output. Hence, SP-target neurons operate as key integrators of sensory information for decision-making of behavioural outputs. Multi-modularity of SP-targets further allows females to adjust SP-mediated male manipulation to physiological state and environmental conditions for maximising reproductive success.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102923">Progressive overfilling of readily releasable pool underlies short-term facilitation at recurrent excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Short-term facilitation of recurrent excitatory synapses within the cortical network has been proposed to support persistent activity during working memory tasks, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We characterized short-term plasticity at the local excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat medial prefrontal cortex and studied its presynaptic mechanisms. Low-frequency stimulation induced slowly developing facilitation, whereas high-frequency stimulation initially induced strong depression followed by rapid facilitation. This non-monotonic delayed facilitation after a brief depression resulted from a high vesicular fusion probability and slow activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle replenishment, which led to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal occupancy. Pharmacological and gene knockdown (KD) experiments revealed that the facilitation was mediated by phospholipase C/diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7). Notably, Syt7 KD abolished facilitation and slowed the refilling rate of vesicles with high fusion probability. Furthermore, Syt7 deficiency in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos activity. In conclusion, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at layer 2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108719">Backward conditioning reveals flexibility in infralimbic cortex inhibitory memories</a></h4>

              
                While the infralimbic cortex (IL) is recognized as critical for behavioral inhibition, the content of the inhibitory memories stored in this region remains elusive. To probe this content, we examined some of the conditions that allow retrieval and facilitation of an inhibitory memory stored in the IL using optogenetic stimulation in female and male rats. We found that IL stimulation did not facilitate an initial fear extinction session. However, prior experience with fear extinction enabled IL stimulation to facilitate subsequent fear extinction. Importantly, the facilitative effects of IL stimulation were not limited to fear extinction experience, as prior exposure to backward fear conditioning also enabled IL stimulation to enhance later fear extinction. The effects were stimulus-specific and did not depend on the motivational context present during the prior experience, as backward appetitive conditioning allowed IL stimulation to facilitate later fear extinction. Additional experiments ruled out stimulus familiarity as an explanation for the facilitative effects of IL stimulation and demonstrated that IL-mediated facilitations occur in procedures other than fear extinction. Together, these findings demonstrate that the IL stores inhibitory memories that are extremely flexible since they can be retrieved and used across many inhibitory procedures and distinct motivational contexts. These features establish the IL as a critical hub for the flexible application of inhibitory knowledge that allows adaptive responses in dynamic environments.

">Tonic REM sleep EEG components predict better mood, cognition and reduce cortical excitability overnight</a></h4>

              
                Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep makes up approximately 20% of sleep in the adult human and is altered in psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. REM sleep comprises two substates, during which eye movements do (phasic REM) and do not (tonic REM) occur. Tonic REM makes up 70-90% of REM sleep but its role in regulating brain function, mood and cognition remain underexplored. We investigated how seven nights of insufficient sleep (6 h time in bed), compared to sufficient sleep, alter periodic and aperiodic components of the phasic and tonic REM sleep electroencephalography (EEG), in 542 sleep recordings of 36 young adults. Associations between phasic and tonic REM sleep EEG and mood, cognitive performance, and overnight changes in cortical excitability as indexed by 1/f spectral slopes were assessed. Insufficient sleep predominantly affected tonic REM EEG components, specifically the density of theta, the amplitude, density, and frequency of alpha oscillations and the 1/f slope in the 30 to 45 Hz range. These changes associated with mood and cognitive performances, and with overnight reductions in cortical excitability. These results provide evidence for a role of tonic REM sleep in regulating mood and counteracting cognitive deterioration and excitability changes associated with insufficient sleep.

                Intracortical microstimulation is an essential tool for basic neuroscience and sensory restoration, yet the spatiotemporal effects of advanced multielectrode stimulation strategies on cortical networks remain poorly understood. This study presents a versatile experimental platform featuring polymer-based, flexible multi-shank electrode arrays integrated with a custom high-density neurostimulator. The polyimide penetrating probes contain densely spaced iridium oxide microelectrodes on thin, flexible shanks with sharp tips designed to minimize mechanical mismatch, tissue damage, and brain dimpling. The system was validated in transgenic GCaMP6 mice through simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging and electrical stimulation in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex. Monopolar stimulation reliably evoked robust, parameter-dependent neuronal activation, with neuronal recruitment increasing as a function of current intensity and pulse duration. Bipolar stimulation produced activation patterns distinct from monopolar stimulation, with neuronal responses that were more spatially confined when bipolar electrodes were positioned in close proximity. Furthermore, static current steering - implemented by varying the current ratio between the selected electrode pair - successfully shifted the centroid of activated neuronal populations, enabling fine spatial control over the site of activation. The developed platform provides a flexible framework for investigating local neuronal responses to complex electrical stimulation paradigms, facilitating the development of neural prostheses with higher spatial precision.

">AI System Using Unsupervised Learning to Discover Novel Subtypes in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Early Alzheimer's disease often evades timely detection because typical diagnostics are based on symptomatic thinking rather than intrinsic neurodegeneration. Here, we use unsupervised machine learning to identify latent Alzheimer's phenotypes from structural MRI-derived volumetric features and neuropsychological scores, without using diagnosis labels or predefined subtype definitions. We analyzed participants (18-96 years) from the OASIS-1 study using intracranial, normalized, global, and regional volumetric MRI features together with MMSE and CDR measurements. After dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis, we identified five stable clusters using K-Means clustering. Here, one cluster exhibited salient cortical atrophy but intact preserved cognitive function, indicative of an independent preclinical subtype. As a reproducibility check, random forest and logistic regression models trained to predict cluster membership achieved >90% cross validated accuracy, indicating that the clusters were consistently separable in the learned feature space. Age and education did not fully explain this structural-functional dissociation, suggesting a subgroup with relative cognitive resilience despite measurable atrophy. Our findings challenge the assumption of a uniform atrophy-cognition relationship and suggest that data-driven phenotyping may reveal clinically relevant subgroups not captured by conventional diagnostic frameworks. Future work will apply validation to longitudinal cohorts, in addition to incorporating multimodal biomarkers.

">Asynchronous cortical recovery from sleep inertia: region- and frequency-specific dynamics following deep NREM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep inertia (SI) is a transient state of impaired alertness and cognition after awakening, typically exacerbated by prior deep sleep. Despite its prevalence, the fine-grained temporal dynamics of brain activity during this transition remains poorly understood. We employed trial-by-trial behavioral assessment (20-second resolution) to map the recovery trajectories of 44 participants following awakenings from either shallow (N1/N2) or deep (N3) NREM sleep. We found that awakening from deep NREM sleep resulted in a significantly slower return to baseline working-memory performance. This behavioral deficit was mirrored by specific EEG signatures: frontal low-frequency activity (delta/theta) returned to baseline levels within minutes, whereas posterior high-frequency activity (alpha/beta) remained altered for a prolonged period. These findings reveal that the human brain reboots asynchronously following deep NREM sleep, with a "frontal-first, posterior-last" gradient that dictates the time course of behavioral restoration.

">Multi-scale transcriptomic integration reveals cell-type immune networks and lncRNA remodeling in Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) displays pronounced regional heterogeneity, yet how transcriptional changes across brain regions converge into coordinated cellular and molecular programs remains unclear. Here, we integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptomics with network modeling to characterize gene expression remodeling across cortical and hippocampal subregions in APP/PS1-21 mice. We show that amyloid pathology follows distinct regional trajectories, with early cortical activation, delayed but robust remodeling in CA1, and a late-stage shift toward widespread transcriptional repression in the dentate gyrus. Despite these differences, cross-region analyses revealed a conserved immune activation core spanning cortical and hippocampal circuits. Network-level modeling further demonstrated that disease-associated transcriptional changes organize into immune-enriched modules that map onto specific cellular compartments, predominantly associated with microglia in cortex, astrocytes in CA1, and coordinated multi-lineage remodeling in the dentate gyrus. Notably, long noncoding RNAs were consistently embedded within disease-associated networks despite weak single-cell differential expression signals, suggesting their involvement in coordinated regulatory programs. Together, these findings link regional transcriptomic remodeling to cell-type resolved network architecture and identify convergent immune-driven programs underlying amyloid-associated neurodegeneration.

">Functional Reorganization of Motor Subcircuits in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease disrupts motor control across multiple body parts, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these impairments remain incompletely defined. We compared resting-state functional connectivity in people with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease (n = 58) and neurotypical older adults (n = 24), focusing on regions implicated in internally generated (IG) and externally generated (EG) movement pathways. For our analysis, we leveraged the reproducible NeuroMark independent component template and motor effector-specific mapping of primary motor cortex (M1). Our results reveal both increased and decreased connectivity patterns in Parkinson's disease: M1 subregions associated with control of the leg, hand, and larynx showed robust increases in connectivity exclusively with cerebellar territories, particularly Crus II and Lobules VIIIa/VIIIb. The postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex) showed primarily increased connectivity with cerebellar regions and the insula. In contrast, the caudate nucleus displayed a mixed profile, with increased connectivity to the superior temporal gyrus and decreased connectivity to the superior medial frontal gyrus and cerebellar Crus II. Our motor effector-specific analysis of disease severity scores (MDS-UPDRS) in people with Parkinson's disease revealed mild impairments across all categories (leg, hand, larynx) but disproportionately greater hand-related deficits, suggesting that some of the observed M1 connectivity differences may be influenced by these behavioral asymmetries. These anatomically precise, effector-specific alterations suggest compensatory recruitment of cerebellar circuits in Parkinson's disease and provide a framework for targeting motor subcircuits in rehabilitation, including dance-based interventions.

                Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal organoids provide an in vitro system for generating retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), yet the cellular composition and developmental fidelity of RGC-enriched cultures remain insufficiently characterised. Here, we tested an RGC-enriched approach involving dissociation of hPSC-derived retinal organoids at day 40, corresponding to peak expression of RGC markers, followed by two-dimensional culture conditions intended to enrich for RGC survival. Flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of RGC markers, including POU4F, ISL1, SNCG, and THY1. Across four samples, POU4F expression ranged from 79-95%, ISL1 from 18-58%, SNCG from 22%-91% and THY1 from 3%-29%, indicating substantial variability between markers and samples. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 73,642 cells identified multiple retinal lineages, including retinal progenitors, RGCs, photoreceptor-committed cells, amacrine and horizontal cells, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), as well as off-target populations comprising HOX-enriched posterior neural cells and other cell types. Cellular composition varied across samples. Transcriptomically defined RGCs accounted for 19-45% of cells across samples, with different subtypes identified. These findings indicate that marker-based assessments alone may overestimate RGC identity and provide a detailed single-cell characterisation of cellular heterogeneity in RGC-enriched retinal organoid cultures.

">Ketamine attenuates habenula activity in response to aversive outcomes during Pavlovian learning</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with rapid-antidepressant properties when administered at a sub-anesthetic dose. Preclinical models indicate that a direct injection of ketamine into lateral habenula (Hb), a small midbrain structure with an evolutionarily preserved role in aversive learning across mammals, can rapidly relieve depression-like behavior. However, there is limited evidence to explain how ketamine acts on the function of the human habenula. In a translational computational neuroscience study, 70 healthy adult volunteers were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive ketamine or placebo (NaCl 0.9%). We used an aversive Pavlovian conditioning paradigm combined with 7-Tesla functional neuroimaging to show that ketamine attenuates habenula response during aversive stimuli expectations and outcomes 24 hours post-infusion. We further present preliminary evidence suggesting that when aversive learning occurs after ketamine infusion, reduced habenula activity during the learning process may lead to downstream effects that diminish the aversive impact of negative affective memories. These findings provide translational support for preclinical models of ketamine's mechanisms in humans.

">Interoception Network in the Rat Brain</a></h4>

              
                The brain is never truly at rest. Even in the absence of external stimuli or cognitive tasks, the central nervous system continuously receives peripheral signals from visceral organs, such as the heart, lungs, and stomach, and sends motor commands to regulate organ physiology. This bidirectional brain-body interaction, also known as interoception, engages neural pathways via a hierarchical set of brain regions, including the nucleus of the solitary tract, hypothalamus, paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, among others. However, it is largely unclear to what extent interoceptive signaling shapes ongoing fluctuations and correlations of brain activity. To address this question, we recorded resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 34 anesthetized rats, examined intrinsic correlations (or functional connectivity), and tested their dependence on the body's digestive state and peripheral nerve integrity. We observed reciprocal functional connectivity among brain regions situated along established interoceptive pathways, revealing a cohesive network, which we refer to as the interoception network. This network showed stronger functional connectivity in the fed condition (digestive phase) compared to the fasted condition (inter-digestive phase), suggesting its dependence on distinct states of gastrointestinal interoception without apparent cardiac or respiratory confounds. Importantly, we found that the interoception network relied on the integrity of the vagus nerve, a primary component of the peripheral nervous system for visceral sensation and parasympathetic control. When vagal signaling was surgically severed by bilateral cervical vagotomy, functional connectivity within the interoception network was notably reduced. Given these findings, we conclude that resting state functional connectivity is not sustained by the central nervous system alone, but relies on interoceptive signaling mediated through peripheral nerves that connect the brain and viscera.

">Rigorous Validation of Paw Preference Using Three Complementary Behavioral Assays in Sprague Dawley Rats</a></h4>

              
                Paw preference, or handedness, is a widely studied behavioral trait used to assess lateralization and motor function in rodents. This study aimed to determine the consistency and reliability of three commonly used behavioral tests to rigorously assess paw preference: the Collins Test, the Staircase Test, and the Pawedness Trait Test. Thirty Sprague Dawley rats (12-48 weeks; 20 females, 10 males) were subjected to all three behavioral tests. Paw uses were recorded, and the laterality index was calculated for each test. Additional cohorts of younger rats (6-9 weeks; 45 females, 45 males) and older rats (12-48 weeks; 38 females, 45 males) were tested to assess the effects of age and sex on paw preference. ANOVA, Fleiss and pairwise Cohen kappa statistics were used for statistical analysis. All three tests yielded comparable measures of paw preference (ANOVA, p = 0.801). Substantial inter-test agreement was demonstrated by Fleiss kappa (k = 0.761, p = 3.93 x 10^-12). Paw preference did not significantly vary by age or sex, and the distribution of left, right, and ambidextrous preference categories aligned with existing literature. The Collins, Staircase, and Pawedness Trait Tests provide consistent and reliable assessments of paw preference in Sprague Dawley rats. These validated behavioral assays can serve as essential tools for preclinical research, including models of motor asymmetry observed in stroke, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, language lateralization, and neurodegenerative disease.

">Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Integration Identifies Mural Cell Oxidative Stress Genes Clu and Gria2 as Key Biomarkers in Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress (OS) is a key factor in ischemic stroke (IS), but the characterization of OS-related genes in IS remains largely unexplored. Identifying key OS-associated genes could improve our understanding of OS in IS. We analysed single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and utilized AUCell, Ucell, singscore, ssgsea, and AddModuleScore algorithms, along with correlation analysis, identified 167 OS-related genes potentially linked to IS. Furthermore, we used seven machine learning algorithms, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, XGBoost, Boruta, random forest, gradient boosting machines, decision trees, and support vector machine recursive feature elimination, to identify the optimal feature genes: Clusterin (Clu) and Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor AMPA Type Subunit 2 (Gria2). Bulk RNA-sequencing showed that Clu expression was upregulated and Gria2 expression was downregulated in IS tissues. Single-cell analysis further revealed that these expression changes predominantly occurred in mural cells, emphasizing their cell-specific roles in IS. Subsequently, we validated these findings through spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis and animal model experiments. These results suggest that Clu and Gria2 may participate in the progression of IS by altering the OS activity of mural cells. However, further research is needed to validate its clinical efficacy and ensure its application in the treatment of IS.

">Paw Preference in Rats Across Tests, Strains, Sex, and Age: A PRISMA-Compliant Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Paw preference in rats is widely used to study hemispheric lateralization, but many individual studies are underpowered and employ inconsistent methods, leading to conflicting reports of population level bias. We conducted a PRISMA compliant systematic review and meta analysis to determine whether rats consistently display paw preference at the individual and population levels, and to evaluate the influence of behavioral test type, strain, sex, and age. Studies published between 1930 and 2025 were identified through PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Data were extracted on strain, age, sex, behavioral paradigm, and paw preference classification. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled prevalence, with subgroup analyses for key variables. Forty studies (n = 1609 rats) met inclusion criteria. At the individual level, 84 percent of rats displayed consistent paw preference (95% CI 78-89%, p < 0.0001), demonstrating robust individual level lateralization. However, population level analyses showed no universal directional bias. Right paw use occurred in 48 percent of rats (95% CI 43-54%) and left paw use in 39 percent (95% CI 34-44%). Ambidextrous classification thresholds were standardized across studies to ensure comparability. Subgroup analyses indicated modest strain and test dependent effects, with Sprague Dawley rats tending toward balanced paw use, while other strains showed slight rightward bias. Skilled reaching tasks produced slightly stronger asymmetry than the Collins test. Sex and age related differences were subtle and inconsistent. Overall, rats exhibit reliable individual level paw preference without species wide directional asymmetry, distinguishing them from humans. Standardized testing protocols and balanced cohort designs will enhance reproducibility and translational relevance in lateralization research.

">Facial Expressions of Emotion are Infrequent in Toddlers' and Caregivers' Egocentric Views: An Ecological Study</a></h4>

              
                Toddlerhood is a critical period in the development of facial expression processing. Prior research suggests that in the natural environment, the frequency of faces in the toddlers' egocentric view declines relative to infancy. However, the specific statistics of the emotional facial expressions available to the developing toddler remain unknown. This study implemented a dual-perspective set-up to record the egocentric view of toddlers and their caregivers during everyday situations at home (N = 26 families). Using automated computer vision models, we quantified both the frequency of faces and the emotional expressions displayed. Confirming our hypotheses, faces were sparse in toddler views and significantly less frequent than in caregiver views. Across both perspectives, happiness was the dominant expression, while negative facial expressions were extremely rare. Notably, faces expressing surprise were frequent in toddler view, whereas caregivers encountered significantly more happy and sad facial displays than their children. This is the first ecological study to objectively quantify the occurrence of emotional facial expressions in the home environment. These findings challenge the assumption of an abundance of emotional signals in the early development. Instead, they demonstrate that toddlers develop face representations based on sparse input that is biased towards positive expressions (e.g., happy), suggesting high efficiency in extracting and generalizing information from limited input.

">Sex-dependent changes in insular cortex connectivity in a rat model of comorbid pain</a></h4>

              
                Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are two highly comorbid, nociplastic pain conditions that belong to a broader group of commonly co-occurring chronic pain conditions. Most of these chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs), including TMD and IBS, disproportionately affect females and are highly stress sensitive. Our previous study illustrated sex differences in brain activity during colorectal distension specific to our model of comorbid pain hypersensitivity (CPH), in which masseter muscle inflammation followed by restraint stress elicits IBS-like visceral hypersensitivity. Since insular cortex (Ins) activity increased in female CPH rats only and abnormal Ins activity has been identified in TMD and IBS patients, we sought to characterize patterns of Ins-based functional connectivity (FC) by performing functional MRI (fMRI) scans at baseline, 1 week, and 7 weeks post-injury/stress in groups of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats randomized to the following conditions: CPH, stress-induced hypersensitivity (SIH), Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced masseter muscle inflammation, and naive. CPH females displayed extensive Ins FC with brain regions in the cortex and limbic system, including the thalamus. Compared to CPH males, CPH females showed robust insular-thalamo connectivity at week seven, a time point where visceral hypersensitivity and referred pain-like behavior persists in CPH females but not males. This trend is also apparent in CPH females' week seven versus week one Ins FC, whereas CPH males tend to decrease Ins FC broadly. These findings potentially suggest sensitization within the insular-thalamo and -cortical networks in CPH females, warranting future investigation of Ins circuit involvement in comorbid pain.

">Top-down corticostriatal gating of adaptive restraint during motivational conflict</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior under threat requires withholding reward pursuit when past experiences predict danger. Here, we identified a corticostriatal circuit that enables behavioral restraint during motivational conflict. Using a semi-naturalistic foraging task in male rats, we found that inactivation of the prelimbic cortex (PL) abolished restraint without impairing memory, and single-unit recordings revealed transient PL firing increases at decision points in conflict trials. c-Fos mapping showed selective engagement of the PL and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) but not the shell. Inactivation further revealed that the anterior nucleus accumbens (aNAcC), but not posterior NAcC, is necessary for restraint, as posterior disruption broadly reduced reward-seeking regardless of threat. Silencing PL[-&gt;]aNAcC projections reproduced anterior NAcC effects without affecting memory or motivation, and this pathway was required under learned, but not innate, threats. These findings define a top-down corticostriatal mechanism in which prefrontal control of striatal activity specifically integrates learned threat and reward signals, enabling flexible decision-making and adaptive restraint in the face of danger.

">Distinct Molecular Mechanisms Regulate Feeding State-Dependent CO2 Chemotaxis Plasticity During Different Life Stages in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Across developmental stages, animals modulate their behavioural responses to external cues according to intrinsic physiological states. During development, particularly in juvenile stages, nervous systems undergo extensive changes at multiple levels. However, it remains unclear whether nervous systems at different developmental stages employ the same underlying molecular mechanisms to produce equivalent behavioural modulations in response to intrinsic or extrinsic cues. Using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, we identify here that animals employ distinct molecular mechanisms to achieve equivalent modulation of CO2-chemosensory behaviour at different developmental stages. Ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated downregulation of the insulin/IGF receptor, DAF-2 by the conserved quality-control ubiquitin ligase CHN-1/CHIP promotes attraction to environmental CO2 during the starvation-induced L1-arrest stage. In contrast, CO2-attaction in dauer animals is independent of CHN-1/CHIP activity. Furthermore, the feeding-induced reversal of CO2-chemotaxis to avoidance during L1-arrest exit requires the insulin/IGF pathway and the conserved CRH-1/CREB1 transcription factor activity in the CO2-sensing BAG neurons. However, induction CO2-avoidance during dauer exit is independent of CRH-1/CREB1 activity. These findings suggest that neural circuits at different life stages may utilize distinct, stage-specific molecular mechanisms to induce identical plasticity in chemosensory behaviour.

                High spatial resolution sodium (23Na) imaging of brain lesions remains challenging due to the intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 23Na-MRI compared with conventional proton (1H) MRI. In this study, we established a high-resolution 23Na-MRI platform based on 14 T preclinical scanner using a dual-tuned head-implanted RF coil. This configuration enables the acquisition of 1H-based T2-weighted anatomical and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as 23Na-MRI, from the same animal. Brain-wide 23Na-MRI with 300x300 m2 in-plane resolution was performed within the first 4 hours after acute middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced ischemic stroke induction. Hyperintense 23Na-MRI signals were observed in the ischemic brain regions, presenting a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) that exceeded that of T2-weighted images. Infarct regions can be well-identified in the elevated 23Na signal, which is spatially consistent with regions of reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, indicating water restriction in the ischemic core. This work established implanted double-tuned 1H/23Na RF coils as a powerful approach for high-resolution 23Na-MRI readout, facilitating the early detection of ischemic brain injury.

">Identification of a neural basis for anorexia nervosa</a></h4>

              
                Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a debilitating, often lethal, restrictive-type eating disorder without an effective cure. The underlying neural basis of AN has remained elusive without an animal model that has represented all typical AN symptoms. Here we show that aberrant activation of mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) glutamatergic neurons led to lethal self-starvation, hyperactivity, anhedonia, social phobia, and increased anxiety, all of which represent typical symptoms of AN. These symptoms were selectively exhibited by targeted activation of MBH neurons expressing steroidogenic factor (SF1) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERa). Moreover, the elicited AN symptoms by activation of MBH glutamatergic or SF1/ERa neurons were rescued by removing release of glutamate or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from these neurons. Importantly, BDNF overexpression in SF1/ERa neurons promoted typical AN symptoms, which were suppressed by removing glutamate release. Thus, our findings identify aberrantly enhanced BDNF and consequent augmented glutamate release from SF1/ERa neurons as a neural basis underlying AN.

">Relationship between X chromosome mosaicism, neuroanatomy and cognitive performance in females</a></h4>

              
                Females have two X chromosomes, one of which is inactivated early in development with specific regions and genes 'escaping' inactivation. Thus, X chromosome loss putatively results in decreased 'dosage' of X chromosome escapee and pseudoautosomal genes, impacting downstream pathways. Evidence from Turner syndrome indicates that X chromosome monosomy results in consistent neuroanatomical and cognitive phenotypes. However, it remains unclear whether mosaic karyotypes, with mixed proportions of 45X and 46XX cells, attenuate these phenotypes. We examined whether X chromosome mosaicism is predicted by neuroanatomical and cognitive features. Higher proportion of 46XX cells was significantly predicted by structural properties in somatosensory, motor, visual, and language brain areas, and by performance in visuospatial, fine-motor, and language tasks. Thus, mosaicism partially 'rescues' phenotypes linked to full 45X monosomy and may explain the role of the X chromosome not only across heterogeneous phenotypic expression in females, but also in sex differences observed in neuropsychiatric conditions.

">Metaplastic neuronal state transition regulates species-specific interoceptive processing in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Interoceptive processing, which involves the sensing and integration of internal physiological states, is fundamental to maintaining homeostasis. However, how species-specific interoceptive features arise from the underlying biophysical properties of neural circuit physiology remains unclear. We investigate the biophysical basis of species-specific interoception by examining protein-hunger dopamine neurons (DA-WED) in two Drosophila species with divergent dietary ecologies. We find that DA-WED neurons in D. melanogaster exhibit weak persistence of internal states, enabling flexible behavioral transitions during nutrient stress. In contrast, D. sechellia shows strong state persistence, locking neurons into a "preferred" configuration during protein deprivation. This divergence is supported by distinct intrinsic membrane properties, including protein deprivation-induced rebound spikes unique to D. sechellia. Analysis of synaptic dynamics and cardiomyocyte electrophysiology reveals species-specific physiological regulations coordinating central and peripheral systems. Behavioral assays confirm corresponding differences in protein consumption strategies, directly linking neural state geometry to ecologically relevant feeding behavior. Our findings establish metaplastic regulation of neural state transitions as a fundamental mechanism through which ecological specialization shapes interoceptive processing and brain-body coordination.

">In vivo aberration measurement and correction for ultrafast FACED two-photon fluorescence microscopy of the brain</a></h4>

              
                Ultrafast two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PFM) based on free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay (FACED) enables megahertz line scanning and kilohertz frame rates for in vivo brain imaging. However, optical aberrations from the imaging system and brain tissue degrade spatial resolution, signal, and contrast at depth. Here we integrate adaptive optics (AO) with FACED 2PFM to achieve synapse-resolving ultrafast imaging in the living mouse brain. Because FACED generates a one-dimensional array of temporally delayed, spatially separated excitation foci at 1 gigahertz, we developed a focus-averaging, frequency-multiplexed aberration measurement method that simultaneously measures and corrects the average aberration across all FACED foci using a segmented deformable mirror. We validated the accuracy of our method in correcting both system and artificial aberrations. When applied to in vivo morphological imaging of the mouse brain, AO enhances resolution, signal, contrast of dendritic shafts, spines, and boutons. Functionally, AO improves cerebral blood flow imaging by increasing plasma signal and kymograph contrast over large fields of view; when used for glutamate imaging, it amplifies transient amplitudes and reveals visually evoked glutamate release that were undetectable without correction. Together, these results establish AO-FACED 2PFM as a powerful approach that combines ultrafast imaging with high spatial resolution for structural and functional imaging in the living mouse brain.

">GABAergic TH2 Amacrine Cells Participate in Spontaneous Wave Activity in the Developing Retina</a></h4>

              
                Amacrine cells (ACs) are retinal interneurons that regulate synaptic transmission from bipolar cells to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and play essential roles in object motion detection, contrast sensitivity, and light adaptation. A subtype of GABAergic ACs identified using a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) mouse line has been termed TH2 amacrine cells (TH2-ACs). Although TH2-ACs contribute to the feature selectivity of object-motion signals in the adult retina, their functional properties during early postnatal development remain unclear. Using genetic mouse models, electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and calcium imaging, we show that TH2-ACs exhibit spontaneous rhythmic depolarizations during development. In the first postnatal week, these depolarizations were abolished by acetylcholine receptor antagonists, indicating that TH2-ACs are excited by starburst amacrine cells (SACs) via spontaneous cholinergic retinal waves. During the second postnatal week, rhythmic depolarizations persisted but were blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists, demonstrating that TH2-ACs are subsequently driven by bipolar cells through glutamatergic waves. Calcium imaging further revealed that this activity propagates across the TH2-AC network in a wave-like manner, potentially resulting in spatially and temporally patterned GABA release. Pharmacological blockades of GABAA receptors significantly enhanced glutamatergic wave activity in SACs and RGCs, indicating that GABAergic signaling from TH2-ACs participates in exerting inhibitory control over retinal waves. Together, these findings identify TH2-ACs as active participants in the development of retinal wave circuits and suggest that this participation via GABA signaling could contribute to activity-dependent refinement of retinal circuits underlying object motion processing.

                The brain's capabilities rely on both the molecular properties of individual cells and their interactions across brain-wide networks. However, relating gene expression to activity in individual neurons across the entire brain remains elusive. Here we developed an experimental-computational platform, WARP, for whole-brain imaging of neuronal activity during behavior, expansion-assisted spatial transcriptomics, and cellular-level registration of these two modalities. Through joint analysis of whole-brain neuronal activity during multiple behaviors, cellular gene expression, and anatomy, we identified functions of molecularly defined populations -- including luminance coding in a cckb-pou4f2 midbrain population and task-structured activity in pvalb7-eomesa hippocampal-like neurons -- and defined over 2,000 other function-gene-anatomy subpopulations. Analysis of this unprecedented multimodal dataset also revealed that most gene-matched neurons showed stronger activity correlations, highlighting a brain-wide role for gene expression in functional organization. WARP establishes a foundational platform and open-access dataset for cross-experiment discovery, high-throughput function-to-gene mapping, unification of cell biology and systems neuroscience, and scalable circuit modeling at the whole-brain scale.

">Low-intensity sub-threshold rhythmic 10Hz median nerve stimulation modulates mu-band EEG oscillations in individuals with Tourette syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterised by the occurrence of vocal and motor tics. Rhythmic median nerve stimulation (MNS) at 10Hz has been shown to cause a substantial reduction in tic frequency in individuals with Tourette Syndrome. The mechanism of action is currently unknown but has been hypothesised to involve entrainment of cortical oscillations within the sensorimotor cortex linked to the initiation of movement. An important methodological detail of these studies is that MNS is delivered at or above threshold (i.e., the minimum stimulation level required to elicit a visible muscle twitch). This is important issue as it means that the observed effects of rMNS could be driven primarily by afferent signals in response to stimulation, the re-afferent signals arising from the muscle, or a combination of these signals. To examine this further, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the effect of delivering 1s trains of sub-threshold rhythmic 10Hz MNS in a group of 15 adults with TS compared to a matched group of 20 neurotypical control participants. The results demonstrate that the EEG response (somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) to rMNS increased linearly with increasing stimulation amplitude. This was paralleled by substantially increased inter-trial coherence (ITC) during rMNS. Importantly, the duration of increased ITC was reduced for the TS group compared to controls. Importantly, these results were largely similar when analyses were restricted only to sub-threshold trials in which no visible muscle twitch was elicited by MNS. These results confirm that sub-threshold rhythmic MNS is sufficient to modulate somatosensory physiology and may also be sufficient to elicit the clinical benefits previously observed for MNS.

                Parkinson's disease is increasingly recognized as a systemic disorder involving pathological communication along the brain-gut axis, yet the cellular mechanisms underlying inter-organ -synuclein propagation remain poorly defined. Here, we establish a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain-intestinal assembloid that integrates a developmentally specified medullary hindbrain organoid with an enteric neuron-enriched intestinal organoid. Using this model, we show the propagation of -synuclein from brainstem neurons to enteric neurons. Ligand-receptor analysis combined with genetic perturbation identifies NRXN1-NLGN2 signaling as a key mediator of brain-to-gut -synuclein propagation, with NRXN1 being upregulated in Parkinson's disease patient datasets in vivo. Together, these findings establish a human stem cell-based platform for investigating brain-gut communication and uncover molecular mechanisms underlying -synuclein propagation in Parkinson's disease.

">When attention falters: brain, breathing, and behavioral signals of lapses in interoceptive attention</a></h4>

              
                Mind-body practices like meditation and yoga, which are widely used to support mental health, involve paying attention to internal bodily sensations like the breath. During these practices, individuals often report "interoceptive lapses," moments when attention drifts away from the body. While lapses in attention to the external world have been widely studied, far less is known about physiological and neural signals that temporally predict when attention to internal sensations falters. Interoceptive lapses may share markers with exteroceptive attention lapses -- such as reaction time variability and changes in default-mode network (DMN) connectivity--but may also depend on distinct brain systems and breathing physiology. To test these possibilities, we examined behavioral, physiological and neural changes preceding lapses in a convenience sample of 93 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Participants performed a 20-minute breath counting task in the fMRI scanner with simultaneous breath recordings. Lapses were defined as moments when counting errors occurred. The sample was split into a training and validation sample, and machine learning models predicting attentional lapses were tested. The strongest predictors were timing and variability of button responses (AUCs > 0.75). Breathing variability and breathing-behavior coupling showed smaller but generalizable predictive value (AUCs < 0.65). Whole-brain connectivity models also predicted lapses (AUC {approx} 0.65) and incorporated regions within the DMN, dorsal, and ventral attention networks--overlapping with systems implicated in exteroceptive attention--as well as the somatomotor network. Further, models that included brain connectivity marginally outperformed behavior-only models. Together, these findings suggest that interoceptive lapses reflect both shared mechanisms with exteroceptive attention failures and additional contributions from brain systems involved in bodily representation and sensory pathways. Although generalizability is limited by the clinical sample and absence of an exteroceptive comparison task, these results highlight candidate brain-body markers of interoceptive attention that may inform real-time monitoring during mind-body interventions and improve understanding of interoceptive disturbance in affective disorders.

                Pathogenic variants in KCNH1, encoding the human ether-a-go-go voltage-gated potassium channel (EAG1, Kv10.1), are associated with the neurodevelopmental disorders Temple-Baraitser syndrome (TBS), Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS), and epileptic encephalopathy. Investigating the functional consequences of KCNH1 variants can provide information about molecular and cellular pathophysiological mechanisms, and help guide therapeutic directions. In this study, we determined the functional properties of 26 disease-associated KCNH1 variants including three recurrent and five that were previously unpublished. Findings were compared to the wildtype (WT) channel along with six rare population variants. Our approach used automated patch clamp recording of heterologously expressed KCNH1 variants in both the homozygous state (variant alone) and the clinically-relevant heterozygous state (variant co-expressed with WT channels). We also examined the impact of alternative splice isoforms on functional consequences of specific variants. We demonstrated that the majority of disease-associated KCNH1 variants exhibit features consistent with gain-of-function including hyperpolarized voltage-dependence of activation, accelerated activation kinetics, or both that promote hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. By contrast, one unique variant discovered previously in an autism cohort had a depolarized voltage-dependence of activation and was associated with a depolarized resting potential in cells. Pharmacological testing of KCNH1 variants demonstrated differences in potency for channel block by imipramine and an investigational non-selective potassium channel blocker (LY97241) for specific variants. Collectively, our findings support gain-of-function as the most common, albeit not exclusive, molecular mechanism underlying KCNH1-related disorders and suggest opportunities for potential therapeutic drug repurposing strategies for these conditions.

">Self-supervised learning yields representational signatures of category-selective cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ventral visual stream contains category-selective regions with distinct feature tuning, most prominently the fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Why do these brain regions exhibit distinct tuning properties? Here, we test the hypothesis that brain-like category-selective features naturally emerge from a general visual learning mechanism without domain-specific biases. Applying a functional localizer approach to both humans and self-supervised neural networks, we identified face- and scene-selective units in the brain and in models. We then measured fMRI and model responses to a broad stimulus set probing classic representational signatures of the FFA and PPA, including preferences relating to curvature, animacy, real-world size, mid-level features, face shapes, and spatial layout information. Category-selective model units largely recapitulate the distinct representational signatures of category-selective brain regions, capturing most of the effects in our test battery. Our findings demonstrate that domain-general learning objectives are sufficient to create humanlike category-selectivity, suggesting that the distinct representational signatures of category-selective cortex may emerge from a unified computational goal akin to self-supervised learning.

">MAMBAxBrain: A Multi-task Neural Framework Linking Brain Functional Dynamics to Individual Fingerprints, Cognitive and Disease States</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) contains rich individual, cognitive, and pathological information, yet no universal model exists for multi-task modeling of these dimensions. Here, we introduce MAMBAxBrain, a multi-task neural framework that integrates Mamba architecture with functional connectivity analysis to jointly model the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of neural activity. MAMBAxBrain achieves high accuracy across four distinct fMRI objectives - brain fingerprinting, cognitive task decoding, reaction time prediction, and schizophrenia classification- consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods with robust cross-session generalization. Interpretability analyses show that each task engages distinct, biologically plausible circuitry-from higher-order association cortex for identity to subcortical-motor loops for reaction time and disrupted control-sensory connectivity for schizophrenia. These findings inform a longstanding debate: rather than operating through wholly separate or entirely shared systems, the brain preferentially recruits task-specific circuits while retaining common representational structure across functions.

However, the cognitive and neural underpinnings of such self–other shifts in risk preference—and the mechanisms driving individual differences—remain unclear. To address this, we employed a mixed gambling task with feedback in which participants made risky decisions for themselves and for others while electroencephalography was recorded. Although individuals generally exhibited similar patterns across agents, decisions made for others were associated with a higher degree of risk-taking compared to those made for oneself. In terms of individual heterogeneity, predispositions and decision weights derived from the drift-diffusion model accounted for individual differences and agent-specific shifts in risk preferences. The event-related potential (ERP) component P300 was significantly modulated by the agent, valence, and risk attitude. Critically, risk-averse individuals showed larger P300 deflections and greater amplitude differences between the self and other conditions, whereas risk-seeking individuals exhibited smaller and more uniform P300 responses across agents. Together, these findings highlight both shared and distinct behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying risky decision-making for self and others and underscore the potential of ERP components as neural markers of decision-making under risk in social contexts.</span>

Here, we investigated whether interindividual variability in SICI correlates with resting-state functional connectivity (FC) derived from high-density EEG (HD-EEG).Eighteen healthy volunteers underwent HD-EEG followed by pp-TMS based assessment of SICI and intracortical facilitation. FC was computed in source space across canonical frequency bands using the weighted phase lag index, and its association with conditioned motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) was tested using network-based statistics.Stronger FC in β and high-γ bands was positively associated with reduced inhibition (ie larger conditioned MEPs) at ISI 2 ms.

<p>In the visual cortex of adolescent and adult mice, CB1R shows a distinct laminar distribution pattern in primary compared with higher-order visual areas. At the cellular level, <i>cnr1</i> is broadly expressed among cortical interneurons, including the majority of 5ht3ar interneurons and a smaller portion of somatostatin and parvalbumin interneurons. Age-dependent changes in CB1R and <i>cnr1</i> distribution point toward a still immature endocannabinoid signaling within the visual cortex during adolescence.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The efficient processing of visual information relies on a mature visual cortex, characterized by hierarchically organized areas and a broad diversity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. A tightly regulated excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance is essential for the optimal processing of visual inputs. A known regulator of the cortical E/I balance is the endocannabinoid (ECB) system, which relies on the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) to perform its functions. To better understand the embedding of the CB1R in the neuronal networks of the visual cortex in adolescence and adulthood, we characterized the distribution of the receptor protein and its mRNA (<i>cnr1</i>) across layers, areas, and interneuron subtypes. We describe a specific laminar distribution of CB1R in the mature visual cortex along the full extent of the rostrocaudal brain axis. Moreover, <i>cnr1</i> is expressed in the three main nonoverlapping subtypes of interneurons and is predominantly enriched in the 5ht3ar subtypes. Comparison of adolescent and adult visual cortex revealed a higher number of <i>cnr1</i>+ reelin interneurons in layer 1 and a lower number of <i>cnr1</i>+ somatostatin interneurons in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1) in adolescence compared with adulthood. Overall, our findings confirm a distinct distribution of the receptor in V1 compared with higher-order visual areas based on a lower CB1R expression in layer 4, a broad <i>cnr1</i> expression across cortical interneurons in key locations of top-down modulation, and a still immature ECB system in adolescence, making it potentially vulnerable to exogenous cannabinoids during this life period.</p>

                Background In an increasingly dynamic and competitive business environment, organizations are required to continuously adapt their intangible resources to sustain performance. While prior studies have emphasized the roles of transformational leadership, organizational culture, and human resource management (HRM) practices in enhancing organizational performance, limited attention has been given to the mechanisms through which these resources are transformed into dynamic capabilities. Methods This study employed a quantitative research design using survey data collected from 263 managers and supervisors of regional banks in Indonesia. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS was applied to examine the direct and indirect relationships among transformational leadership, organizational culture, HRM practices, organizational capital agility, and organizational performance. Mediation effects were tested using bootstrapping procedures to assess the significance of indirect relationships. Results The findings reveal that transformational leadership and organizational culture have significant positive effects on both organizational capital agility and organizational performance. Organizational capital agility was found to strongly influence organizational performance and significantly mediate the relationships between transformational leadership and performance, as well as between organizational culture and performance. In contrast, while HRM practices directly enhance organizational performance, they do not have a significant effect on organizational capital agility, nor is their impact on performance mediated by OCA. Conclusions This study highlights Organizational Capital Agility as a key dynamic capability that translates leadership and cultural resources into improved organizational performance. The results extend the Resource-Based View and Dynamic Capability Theory by demonstrating the mediating role of agility in resource transformation processes. Practically, the findings suggest that banking institutions should prioritize the development of transformational leadership and adaptive organizational cultures to foster agility, while aligning HRM practices with broader agility-oriented strategies to sustain performance in turbulent environments.

                <p>by Weiwen Wang, Xiwen Zhang, Yuanyan Xiong</p>

Recent advancements in computational pathology have greatly improved automated histopathological analysis. A compelling question in the field is how morphological traits are associated with genetic characteristics or molecular phenotypes. Here we propose TEMI, a novel framework for molecular subtype classification of cancers using whole-slide images (WSIs), augmented with transcriptomic data during training. TEMI aims to extract molecular-level signals from WSIs and make efficient use of available multimodal data. To this end, TEMI introduces a patch fusion network that captures dependencies among local patches of gigapixel WSIs to produce global representations and aligns them with transcriptomic embeddings attained from a masked transcriptomic autoencoder. TEMI achieves superior performance compared with existing methods in molecular subtype classification, owing to its effective integration of transcriptomic information achieved by the two developed alignment strategies. Guided by discriminative transcriptomic data, TEMI learns invariant WSI representations, while morphological features also enhance gene expression prediction. These findings suggest that histological features encode latent molecular signals, highlighting the interplay between the tumor microenvironment and cancer transcriptomics. Our study demonstrates how multimodal learning can bridge morphology and molecular biology, providing an effective tool to advance precision medicine.

Transposon Sequencing (Tn-Seq) is a high-throughput technique that utilizes transposon mutant libraries to assess gene fitness or essentiality under specific conditions potentially identifying novel therapeutic targets. However, the diversity of statistical methods, bioinformatics tools, and parameters complicates the selection of the most appropriate and reliable analysis pipeline for a given dataset. A significant limitation of existing studies is the absence of a gold-standard set of essential genes (EGs) for evaluating the analysis process. Relying on the original study as a gold-standard is suboptimal, as these results may have been obtained using non-optimal tools. Here, we introduce reliable EG datasets for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> to enhance Tn-Seq analyses. By utilizing literature data and sequencing of six samples from PA14 Wild-Type (WT) and PA14 OprD-deficient (Δ<i>oprD</i>), grown in LB medium, we compared EG lists generated by several statistical methods of TRANSIT2 and by the FiTnEss tools. We established a reference dataset of 84 genes found in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and another gold-standard set composed of 115 genes specific to PA14 grown in LB. Our findings revealed that depending on the analysis method used, retrieval rates of gold-standard genes ranged from 0% to 100%. The Hidden-Markov Model (HMM) method available in TRANSIT2 identified approximately 90% of gold-standard EGs, while FiTnEss identified up to 100%. This study addressed a critical gap in the field by providing gold-standard sets of EGs, enabling comparative evaluation of Tn-Seq analysis methods to help researcher select the most suitable bioinformatics pipeline for a given Tn-Seq dataset. We anticipate that our results will facilitate Tn-Seq analysis comparisons, harmonize <i>P. aeruginosa</i>-related studies, promote standardization and enhance reproducibility. Ultimately, this will lead to more reliable identification of EGs and potential therapeutic targets in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, advancing our understanding of this important pathogen.

It is widely acknowledged that development shapes phenotypes, yet the extent to which genes with similar expression patterns during development lead to equivalent organismal phenotypes when mutated remains unclear. Here, we propose addressing this issue, which we term the 𝒟evelopment–to–𝒫henotype, or 𝒟–𝒫, rule, by leveraging single-cell gene expression atlases and phenotypic ontologies, using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model system. This framework quantifies the proportionality between developmental expression and phenotypic similarities, demonstrating that the relationship holds on average. Genes that strongly fulfill the rule exhibit broad “housekeeping” expression and are associated with systemic phenotypes, whereas weak similarities correspond to specific expression patterns and specialized phenotypes. Deviations from the 𝒟–𝒫 rule provide insights into developmental divergence and phenotypic degeneracy, highlighting genes with narrow functional roles but systemic phenotypic impact. Furthermore, genes that closely adhere to the rule exhibit the highest pleiotropic impact on organismal traits. Our analysis also identifies cell types, such as ASK neurons, as key mediators of phenotype-specific gene contributions, exemplified by their association with chemosensory behavior and chemotaxis. These findings validate the 𝒟–𝒫 rule and underscore the role of cells as critical mediators of the genotype-phenotype map, offering a unified framework to understand the developmental origins of phenotypic complexity.

Protein language models (PLMs) pretrained via a masked language modeling objective have proven effective across a range of structure-related tasks, including high-resolution structure prediction. However, it remains unclear to what extent these models factorize protein structural categories among their learned parameters. In this work, we introduce trainable subnetworks, which mask out the PLM weights responsible for language modeling performance on a structural category of proteins. We systematically trained 39 PLM subnetworks targeting both sequence- and residue-level features at varying degrees of resolution using annotations defined by the CATH taxonomy and secondary structure elements. Using these PLM subnetworks, we assessed how structural factorization in PLMs influences downstream structure prediction. Our results show that PLMs are highly sensitive to sequence-level features and can predominantly disentangle extremely coarse or fine-grained information. Furthermore, we observe that structure prediction is highly responsive to factorized PLM representations and that small changes in language modeling performance can significantly impair PLM-based structure prediction capabilities. Our work presents a framework for studying feature entanglement within pretrained PLMs and can be leveraged to improve the alignment of learned PLM representations with known biological concepts.

Zimin words are words that have the same prefix and suffix. They are unavoidable patterns, with all sufficiently large strings encompassing them. Here, we examine for the first time the presence of k-mers not containing any Zimin patterns, defined hereafter as Zimin avoidmers, in the human genome. We report that in the reference human genome all k-mers above 104 base-pairs contain Zimin words. We find that Zimin avoidmers are most enriched in coding and Human Satellite 1 regions in the human genome. Zimin avoidmers display a depletion of germline insertions and deletions relative to surrounding genomic areas. We also apply our methodology in the genomes of another eight model organisms from all three domains of life, finding large differences in their Zimin avoidmer frequencies and their genomic localization preferences. We observe that Zimin avoidmers exhibit the highest genomic density in prokaryotic organisms, with <i>E. coli</i> showing particularly high levels, while the lowest density is found in eukaryotic organisms, with <i>D. rerio</i> having the lowest. Among the studied genomes the longest k-mer length at which Zimin avoidmers are observed is that of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> at k-mer length of 115 base-pairs. We conclude that Zimin avoidmers display inhomogeneous distributions in organismal genomes, have intricate properties including lower insertion and deletion rates, and disappear faster than the theoretical expected k-mer length, across the organismal genomes studied.

                <p>by Xincheng Gao, Yanchao Yu, Jiayin Sun, Huayuan Zhao, Yongqiang You, Xin Shi, Kang Wang, Sijia Hong, Xing Xiong, Chao Huang, Hui Zhang, Guosong Jiang</p>

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are capable of specifically targeting and eliminating malignant tumor cells, but tumor cells can develop resistance mechanisms to escape CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated killing. Here, we performed a whole genome CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen under CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells pressure and identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL5 as an essential factor required for escaping CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells killing in bladder cancer cells. We found that CUL5 knockout promoted the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated killing both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CUL5 loss reduced the ubiquitination of PTBP1, which regulated alternative splicing of RUBCN pre-mRNA and led to an increase in the levels of the RUBCN-S isoform, thereby preventing immune evasion of bladder cancer cells by inhibiting autophagy. Importantly, CUL5 knockout significantly enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in a xenograft model. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel mechanism of bladder cancer immune evasion, providing potential targets for cancer immunotherapy.

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent, chronic inflammatory skin disease with diverse clinical presentations, often overlapping with other dermatoses. Its diagnosis remains largely dependent on clinical expertise, leading to variability and limited diagnostic accuracy, particularly among general practitioners. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model that integrates lesion image analysis and structured anamnesis to improve AD diagnosis. Methods This diagnostic study was conducted in two phases: Phase 1 used retrospective data from 2021–2024, and Phase 2 involved prospective external validation from multiple hospitals in 2025. Patients with AD or related skin conditions were included, with diagnoses based on AAD 2014 criteria. Multimodal fusion combined ResNet50-extracted image features and MPNet-based anamnesis text features using a late fusion model. This approach mimics clinical reasoning by integrating visual and contextual clinical information to classify cases as AD or non-AD. Results and Discussion The multimodal AI model integrating ResNet50 (image) and MPNet (anamnesis) achieved 98.28% accuracy in classifying AD vs non-AD, outperforming image-or text-only models. It offers clinical advantages by mimicking physician reasoning, improving diagnostic consistency, reducing subjectivity, and enabling mass triage. However, real-world generalizability remains a challenge due to limited training diversity, potential language constraints (Bahasa Indonesia), and narrow differential diagnoses. External validation and explainable AI (XAI) are critical for broader application. Despite limitations, the model aligns with emerging literature, showing multimodal AI can approach or surpass expert-level performance in dermatological diagnosis when rigorously validated. Conclusions The multimodal ResNet50-MPNet model shows near-perfect accuracy in diagnosing AD by mimicking clinician reasoning. It offers consistent, holistic assessment but requires external validation and improved interpretability for clinical adoption. Continued AI-clinician collaboration is vital to translating this promising technology into real-world dermatological care.

                Fixed-point iterative methods play a fundamental role in nonlinear analysis and its applications. They provides a unified framework for establishing existence and uniqueness results for a wide class of nonlinear problems. In this paper, working in a real uniformly convex Banach space, we propose an accelerated four-step iterative scheme for approximating fixed-point of a class of mapping known as total asymptotically nonexpansive TAN-mappings. Weak and strong convergence results for proposed algorithm are established. The weak convergence analysis is obtained under Opial’s condition, while the strong convergence results require in addition a semi-compactness assumption on the underlying mapping. Furthermore, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and to compare its performance with existing iterative methods. The obtained results extend and refine several recent contributions in the literature. Finally, an application to two-dimensional equations is provided.

                The most typical bacterial species that may be associated with infections of the eye are Staphylococcus because they normally reside on the skin and eyelid margins; therefore, an easy transmission to the eye can take place whenever there is a lesion or abrasion. Apart from this, these bacteria have several virulence factors among which include adhesin and biofilm forming capacity which enhance their resistance against treatment. In addition, mecA gene carries resistance determinant against methicillin as well as many other β-lactam antibiotics. The current study was designed to characterize the factors and molecular mechanisms that facilitate pathogenicity and therapeutic resistance in these bacteria. A total of one hundred samples were obtained from patients who had visited Samarra General Hospital during the period extending from October 2024 to December 2024. As per the results of culture, all isolates were Gram-positive, and forty-nine belonged to the genus Staphylococcus. Amongst these, Staphylococcus aureus was the major species followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis and some other isolates. All isolates showed 100% resistance to Methicillin. They were sensitive to Vancomycin. Other antibiotics expressed variable sensitivity patterns among the isolates. The five isolates that expressed the highest levels of antibiotic resistance were selected, and one was excluded during analysis. All the remaining isolates, being coagulase-negative staphylococci, were tested for mecA, icaA, and tetK genes. The molecular results showed that all four tested isolates carried the mecA gene (100%), and only one isolate carried the icaA and tetK genes, hence its high level of antibiotic resistance.

                Objectives Comprehensive educational supervision is essential for ensuring quality teaching, fostering professional development, and supporting institutional capacity building. However, its implementation encounters numerous structural, technical, and human resource challenges. This study aimed to identify, validate, rank, and cluster the technical barriers affecting comprehensive educational supervision in Amanat Al Asimah, Yemen. This aligns with national reform goals by offering strategic insights to improve supervisory systems, thereby enhancing teaching quality, institutional performance, and educational resilience in fragile contexts Methods This study employed a three-phase mixed-methods approach. Initially, a literature review identified 11 key barriers to effective supervision. These were validated using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM), involving 16 experienced educational supervisors to assess the consensus and suitability of the items. Subsequently, a quantitative survey targeting 370 teachers was conducted to evaluate their perceived severity. Fuzzy set theory was used to aggregate and defuzzify the responses, generating crisp scores for prioritization. Finally, K-means clustering was applied to segment the barriers based on their impacts. Results FDM analysis confirmed the validity of all 11 identified barriers, with a domain-level threshold of 0.093 and an average expert consensus of 89.77%, indicating strong agreement. The fuzzy set-based evaluation highlighted three top-priority challenges: weak supervisory competencies, limited ability to develop effective supervisory plans, and poor supervisor-teacher relationships. K-means clustering grouped the barriers into three segments: one high-priority barrier, seven moderate-priority concerns, and three low-priority issues. Notably, weak supervisory competencies emerged as the most critical barrier, isolated in a high-priority cluster. Conclusion These findings provide evidence-based guidance for policy and strategic interventions aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of supervision systems in fragile educational settings. The study concludes with recommendations for strengthening supervisory competencies, improving resource allocation, and fostering trust-based supervisor-teacher relationships, thereby contributing to the quality of education and institutional resilience in Yemen.

                Neutrosophic crisp sets are an important and recent topic that has entered both pure and applied mathematics, especially general topology. A neutrosophic crisp topological space is defined as a generalization of classical topology in a broad sense, without specifying the type of neutrosophic crisp family or the algebraic operations of union and intersection, in addition to the kind of complement and the kinds of inclusion. In this research on the neutrosophic crisp topological space, we constructed such a space in which the intersection is fixed as Type I, the union as Type II, and the complement as Type II for all kinds of neutrosophic crisp families, and we considered the two kinds of inclusion. Within this framework, we defined two kinds of closure for a neutrosophic crisp set and two kinds of interior for a neutrosophic crisp set. We studied all relations, results, and theorems from general topology on them, as well as the properties related to them and the relationship between the closure and the interior of a neutrosophic crisp set. We proved all relations, results, and theorems that hold and gave examples of those that do not; however, many properties failed to hold. We also defined continuity in the constructed neutrosophic crisp topological space and proved all corresponding relations, results, and theorems in topology that hold, while providing examples of those that do not hold.

                Shoulder dislocation of the posterior variety is a rare condition, representing less than 2% of all dislocation types of the Shoulder Joint. During the acute presentation of posterior shoulder dislocation, the rate of misdiagnosis is high 50%-80% because acute posterior shoulder dislocation is not diagnosed during the initial presentation. The causes of this high rate of misdiagnosis are a lack of clarity regarding the signs of this type of dislocation and inadequate radiological assessment. A delayed diagnosis can result in painful and stiff shoulders, leading to chronic shoulder dislocation. The resulting decrease in joint motion and loss of many activities, instability, recurrent shoulder dislocation, and delay in diagnosis may result in Osteoarthritis or AVN of the humeral head. The chronicity of posterior shoulder dislocation may necessitate a complex surgical procedure for reduction with an unpredictable rate of success. The purpose of this case series was to clarify the difficulties in the diagnosis and management of chronic posterior shoulder dislocation by presenting three cases of posterior shoulder dislocation from the Orthopaedic Department at Fallujah Teaching Hospital in Iraq.

                Background Residential investment projects play a vital economic and social role in Iraq; however, delays are a persistent problem that negatively affects project performance. Identifying and prioritizing the main causes of delay is challenging due to uncertainty and differences in expert judgment. Therefore, a systematic quantitative approach is required to evaluate these causes and their associated risks. Methods This study aimed to identify, classify, and prioritize the causes of delay in residential investment projects in Iraq. A questionnaire survey was conducted with experts specializing in residential projects. Fifteen main delay causes were identified and grouped into three categories: general causes, project parties–related causes, and resource-related causes. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process was applied to determine the relative importance weights of the delay causes under uncertainty. The degree of delay risk for each cause was calculated by combining its relative weight with the probability of occurrence and impact. Results The results indicated that, within the general causes category, management-related and political causes were the most significant, each accounting for 14.6%. In the project parties–related category, owner-related causes had the highest importance, with a relative weight of 50.6%. For the resource-related category, labor-related causes were found to be the most influential, with a relative importance of 61.2%. The risk assessment highlighted variations in delay severity depending on both uncertainty and impact levels. Conclusions The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process in prioritizing delay causes under uncertainty in residential investment projects. The proposed framework supports decision-makers in identifying critical delay factors, improving risk management, and reducing delays in future residential projects in Iraq.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-213/v1?src=rss">Analysis of Maternal Serum PLGF, VEGF, and sFlt-1 in Placenta Accreta Spectrum and Normal Pregnancy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a severe obstetric condition characterized by abnormal placental trophoblast invasion into the myometrium, leading to significant maternal morbidity and mortality. While imaging remains the cornerstone of prenatal diagnosis, limitations in sensitivity and availability necessitate the exploration of adjunctive biomarkers. Dysregulation of angiogenic pathways has been implicated in PAS pathogenesis. To evaluate maternal serum levels of angiogenic biomarkers—placental growth factor (PlGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)—and to compare their expression between PAS and normal pregnancies. Methods This prospective case–control study was conducted at RSUP Dr. M. Djamil Padang between March and November 2025. Eighty-eight pregnant women were enrolled, comprising 44 PAS cases and 44 gestational age–matched controls with normal placentation. Maternal serum samples were collected at 32–34 weeks of gestation and analyzed for PlGF, VEGF, and sFlt-1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Demographic, obstetric, ultrasound, laboratory, and neonatal data were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results Maternal demographic characteristics, fetal biometric parameters, neonatal outcomes, and baseline biochemical profiles were comparable between groups. Median maternal serum PlGF and VEGF levels were significantly lower in the PAS group compared with controls (PlGF: 3.825.660 vs 4.086.680 pg/mL, p = 0.032; VEGF: 8.713.645 vs 12.524.675 pg/mL, p = 0.008). Although sFlt-1 levels showed a decreasing trend in PAS cases, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.102). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.114). Conclusion PAS is associated with significant reductions in maternal serum PlGF and VEGF, reflecting angiogenic dysregulation and abnormal placental invasion. These biomarkers may serve as complementary tools to imaging modalities for improving prenatal detection of PAS. Larger studies are warranted to validate their clinical utility and integration into diagnostic algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-212/v1?src=rss">Choroid Plexus Tumors: Insights from a 13-Year Single-Institution Series [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) are rare intraventricular neoplasms with diverse clinical and histopathological features. Their variable presentation and surgical challenges, particularly in pediatric patients, make detailed institutional experiences valuable for guiding management and understanding outcomes. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for CPTs at the Neurosurgery Department of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2023. Clinical, radiological, surgical, histopathological, and outcome data were analyzed. Imaging included CT and MRI; histopathology assessed cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic activity, necrosis, and immunohistochemistry. Surgical approach, cerebrospinal fluid diversion, perioperative complications, adjuvant therapy, and long-term outcomes were recorded. Results Seven patients were included (median age 2 years, range 2 months–28 years; 5 females). Histology revealed four choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) and three choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs). Tumor locations were lateral ventricles (n=5), third ventricle (n=1), and fourth ventricle/CPA (n=1). Gross total resection was achieved in all CPPs, with favorable long-term outcomes and minimal morbidity. CPCs were more vascular and complex to resect; one patient died intraoperatively, another shortly postoperatively, and the third developed severe postoperative complications before adjuvant therapy. Ki-67 indices ranged from <1% in CPPs to 40% in CPCs. CSF diversion was required in two patients. Conclusions CPTs demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in presentation, histology, and outcomes. Complete surgical resection is associated with excellent prognosis in CPPs, whereas CPCs present greater surgical and postoperative challenges. This series underscores the importance of early diagnosis, careful surgical planning, and multidisciplinary management to optimize outcomes across the CPT spectrum.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95854">Mouse skeletal muscle satellite cells co-opt the tenogenic gene Scleraxis to instruct regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal muscles connect bones and tendons for locomotion and posture. Understanding the regenerative processes of muscle, bone, and tendon is of importance to basic research and clinical applications. Despite their interconnections, distinct transcription factors have been reported to orchestrate each tissue’s developmental and regenerative processes. Here, using adult mouse skeletal muscles, we show that <i>Scx</i> expression is not detectable in adult muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells, SCs) during quiescence. <i>Scx</i> expression begins in activated SCs and continues throughout regenerative myogenesis after injury. By SC-specific <i>Scx</i> gene inactivation (<i>Scx</i> cKO), we show that <i>Scx</i> function is required for SC expansion/renewal and robust new myofiber formation after injury. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and CUT&amp;RUN to identify direct Scx target genes during muscle regeneration. These target genes help explain the muscle regeneration defects of <i>Scx</i> cKO and are not overlapping with <i>Scx</i>-target genes identified in tendon development. Together with a recent finding of a subpopulation of <i>Scx</i>-expressing connective tissue fibroblasts with myogenic potential during early embryogenesis, we propose that regenerative and developmental myogenesis co-opt the <i>Scx</i> gene via different mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109308">Accessibility of the unstructured α-tubulin C-terminal tail is controlled by microtubule lattice conformation</a></h4>

              
                Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that self-assemble from the protein tubulin, a heterodimer of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, and are important for cell mechanics, migration, and division. Much work has focused on how the nucleotide state of β-tubulin regulates the structure and dynamics of microtubules. In contrast, less is known about the structure and function of the C-terminal tails (CTTs) of α- and β-tubulin which are thought to freely protrude from the surface of the microtubule. To study the CTT of α-tubulin, we developed three different biosensors that bind the tyrosinated α-tubulin CTT (Y-αCTT). Surprisingly, live imaging of the probes indicates that the Y-αCTT is minimally accessible along the microtubule lattice under normal cellular conditions. Lattice binding of the Y-αCTT probes can be increased by three different ways of changing the tubulin conformational state: the drug Taxol, expression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that recognize or promote an expanded tubulin conformation, or expression of tubulin that cannot hydrolyze GTP. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Y-αCTT undergoes numerous transient interactions with the bodies of α-tubulin and β-tubulin in the lattice, and that the frequency of these interactions is regulated by the tubulin nucleotide state. These findings suggest that accessibility of the Y-αCTT is locally governed by nucleotide- and MAP-dependent conformational changes to tubulin subunits within the microtubule lattice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106270">Mouse sensorimotor cortex reflects complex kinematic details during reaching and grasping</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated forelimb actions, such as reaching and grasping, rely on motor commands that span a spectrum from abstract target selection to detailed instantaneous muscle control. The sensorimotor cortex is central to controlling these complex movements, yet how the detailed command signals are distributed across its numerous subregions remains unclear. In particular, in mice, it is unknown if the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices represent low-level joint angle details in addition to high-level signals like movement direction. Here, we combine high-quality markerless tracking and two-photon imaging during a reach-to-grasp task to quantify movement-related activity in the mouse forelimb M1 (M1-fl) and forelimb S1 (S1-fl). Linear decoding models reveal a strong representation of proximal and distal joint angles in both areas, and both areas support joint angle decoding with comparable fidelity. Despite shared low-level encoding, the time course of high-level target-specific information varied across areas. M1-fl exhibited early onset and sustained encoding of target-specific signals, while S1-fl was more transiently modulated around lift onset. These results reveal both shared and unique contributions of M1-fl and S1-fl to reaching and grasping, implicating a more distributed cortical circuit for mouse forelimb control than has been previously considered.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106040">In vivo autofluorescence lifetime imaging of spatial metabolic heterogeneities and learning-induced changes in the Drosophila mushroom body</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal energy regulation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor underlying brain functions and their pathological alterations, yet the metabolic dynamics that accompany cognitive processes remain poorly understood. As a label-free and minimally invasive technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of coenzymes NADH and NADPH (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H) offers the possibility to resolve cellular metabolic profiles with high spatial precision. However, NAD(P)H FLIM’s capacity to detect subtle variations in neuronal metabolism has not been demonstrated. In this study, we applied NAD(P)H FLIM to map the metabolic profiles of <i>Drosophila</i> neurons in vivo across multiple scales, focusing on the primary centers for associative memory: the mushroom bodies (MBs). At a broad scale, we obtained an overview of the metabolic signatures of the main brain tissue and identified a marked difference between neuropil and cortex areas. At a finer scale, our findings revealed notable heterogeneity in the basal metabolic profiles of distinct MB neuron subtypes. Measurements performed after associative olfactory learning also uncovered a low-magnitude subtype-specific metabolic shift associated with memory formation, suggesting the utility of NAD(P)H FLIM in detecting physiology-driven changes linked to brain function. These results establish a promising framework for studying the spatial heterogeneities and the dynamics of cerebral energy metabolism in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106156">Aggregation-dependent epitope sequence and modification fingerprints of anti-Aβ antibodies</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides across distinct brain regions. Anti-Aβ antibodies (Aβ-Abs) targeting specific Aβ variants are essential tools for AD research, diagnostics, and therapy. The monoclonal antibodies Aducanumab, Lecanemab, and Donanemab have recently been approved as the first disease-modifying treatments for early AD, highlighting the clinical importance of their exact binding profiles. In this study, we systematically characterized the binding and modification requirements of 20 Aβ-Abs, including biosimilars of Aducanumab, Lecanemab, and Donanemab, across monomeric, oligomeric, and aggregated Aβ forms. Array-based analysis of 20,000 modified Aβ peptides defined binding epitopes at single-residue resolution and revealed the impact of sequence variation, including familial AD mutations, as well as diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs). Notably, genetic variants, such as H6R, impaired binding of therapeutic Aβ-Abs like Aducanumab. Donanemab showed strong preference for pyroglutamate-modified AβpE3–17, while Lecanemab and Aducanumab exhibited aggregation- and sequence-context-dependent binding requirements. Comparison of peptide binding profiles with binding of full-length and aggregated Aβ via immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, capillary immunoassays, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry on AD brain tissue revealed distinct aggregation-dependent binding behaviours. The valency- and context-dependence of Aducanumab binding, together with its preference for Ser8-phosphorylated Aβ, supports a dimerization-mediated binding mechanism. For Lecanemab, our data suggest that additional structural contributions beyond the minimal N-terminal epitope are required for binding to aggregated Aβ, which remain to be fully resolved. Together, this work provides the most comprehensive dataset to date on aggregation-dependent sequence and modification selectivity of Aβ-Abs. By integrating mutational, PTM, and aggregation contexts in a unified experimental framework, we establish a resource that enables rational selection of antibodies for research and diagnostic applications and offers mechanistic insights that may inform the design and optimization of future therapeutic antibodies in AD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103016">Citalopram exhibits immune-dependent anti-tumor effects by modulating C5aR1+ TAMs</a></h4>

              
                Administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with a reduced cancer risk and shows significant anti-tumor effects across multiple tumor types, suggesting the potential for repurposing SSRIs in cancer therapy. Nonetheless, the specific molecular target and mechanism of action of SSRIs remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we reveal that citalopram exerts an immune-dependent anti-tumor effect in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, the anti-HCC effects of citalopram are not reliant on its conventional target, the serotonin transporter. Through various drug repurposing approaches, including global reverse gene expression profiling, drug affinity responsive target stability assay, and molecular docking, the complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) is identified as a new target of citalopram. C5aR1 is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages, and citalopram treatment enhances local macrophage phagocytosis and elicits CD8<sup>+</sup> T anti-tumor immunity. C5aR1 deficiency or depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells hinders the anti-HCC effects of citalopram. Collectively, our study reveals the immunomodulatory roles of citalopram in inducing anti-tumor immunity and provides a basis for considering the repurposing of SSRIs as promising anticancer agents for HCC treatment.

">Between- and Within-subject Variability in Actigraphy Data: A Case Study on Sleep Patterns in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Variability in longitudinal health outcomes provides critical insight into disease dynamics, yet most statistical analyses continue to prioritize mean trajectories. This limitation is particularly consequential in psychiatric and mobile health (mHealth) research, where intensive repeated measurements increasingly reveal pronounced heterogeneity and temporal instability that cannot be captured by average responses alone. Standard mixed-effects models typically impose homoscedastic variance assumptions and relegate variability to a nuisance component, despite mounting evidence that both variability information, at both between- and within-subject level, carry independent clinical significance. Here, we describe an improved mixed-effects location-scale model for longitudinal outcomes that simultaneously characterizes mean structure, between-subject heterogeneity, and within-subject fluctuations. The proposed framework explicitly links variance components to both time-invariant and time-varying covariates, extending classical mixed-effects models to accommodate heteroscedastic and dynamically evolving variability. By jointly modeling location and scale parameters, the method enables direct inference on variability (or stability) of the data alongside mean trends. We evaluated the approach using an actigraphy-based mHealth case study of sleep patterns in schizophrenia. Our results demonstrate that explicitly modeling variability uncovers clinically relevant structure obscured by mean-based analyses, underscoring the importance of variability-aware modeling for modern longitudinal and mHealth research.

                This paper explores how smart governance can reduce financial risks in the Iraqi banking industry by focusing on the adoption of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to increase financial stability and operational efficiency. The study uses a combination of quantitative indicators of the dimensions of smart governance (standards, policies, practices, information, technologies, and skills) and financial risk dimensions (market, credit, operational, and investment portfolio risks) based on the secondary data provided by the Central Bank of Iraq covering the years 2023 and 2024. The results reveal a strong progression in all aspects of smart governance during the study time in the form of the rising number of licensed electronic payment providers, the rise of the percentage of current deposits, and the further use of bank accounts and electronic wallets. Also, the human resources in the banking industry have been enhanced with expertise in professional development initiatives. In the financial risk sector, the outcomes are a decline in non-performing loans, an upward trend in the ratio of credit to deposits and an increase in total deposits and total credit facilities, hence, an indication of an improvement in the ability to handle risk. The testing of hypothesis confirms that a strong governing process, including standards, policies, practices, information management, technology adoption and development of human skills, has a positive influence on financial risk management in the AI environment. The research suggests enhancing regulatory systems, increasing digital transformation programs, investing in human-capital growth, and introducing AI-based analytical solutions to guarantee long run sustainability and stability of the financial sector.

                Background After witnessing the implementations of Banach fixed point theory which is stated that a mapping T: X→X has always a unique fixed point in X in giving the existence and uniqueness solutions for many integral and differential equations, various extensions of Banach fixed point theory were established. Consequently, the theory has evolved to encompass diverse extensions and is fruitful in many fields. One of the most significant advances in pure and applied mathematics is the discovery of solutions for linear and nonlinear systems as well fractal graphics, optimization theory, approximation theory, discrete dynamics and numerous other areas. Our main outcomes in this manuscript represent one of the most important of these extensions. Methods and Results Vital concepts such as D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces and weakly compatible maps are reviewed to establish the framework for our main results. The major objective of the present study is to investigate and verify the uniqueness of some common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced categories of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. Our first main outcomes were established by applying the concepts of weak compatibility and common limit in the range property, whereas we obtained our second major results by utilizing the notion of occasionally weakly compatible mapping. Additionally, various common fixed point outcomes for the two pairs of self-maps were determined. Conclusion This manuscript explores novel outcomes regarding the uniqueness of various common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced types of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. We anticipate that the discoveries in this manuscript will aid scientists in enhancing the authors on popularized extended symmetric-spaces to elevate a universal framework for their practical implementations in each advanced branches of science.

                <p>Dementia-causing diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are one of the greatest health concerns facing the aging world population. A key feature of AD is excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta, leading to synapse and cell loss in brain structures, such as the hippocampus. This neurodegeneration is preceded by impaired neuron function, notably reduced synaptic inhibition. Metabotropic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs) may be modulated by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are reported to be progressively lost from neuronal membranes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, it remains unknown whether functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated signaling changes over aging and whether or not pharmacological intervention can prevent receptor loss. In this study, we combine electrophysiological and biochemical analysis of hippocampal neurons in the Amyloid Precursor Protein/Presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD from acute brain slices and organotypic slice cultures prepared from male and female mice to determine if functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs are lost and the effect of pharmacological modulation. Overall, we found that GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R expression decreased with age, independent of genotype, with no evidence for postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R loss in CA1 pyramidal cells at any age. We did observe a genotype-dependent reorganization of postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated IPSCs, which was independent of age. Presynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated inhibition was impaired in APP/PS1 mice, also independent of age. We observed that chronic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R modulation differentially regulated function but was independent of genotype. Overall, our data show that functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signaling is altered in APP/PS1 mice, independent of age, increasing our understanding of amyloidopathy-induced dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-32/v2?src=rss">The paradox of food production, expenditure, poverty and stunting  in Tanzania: an ecological study design [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background There have been claims amongst nutrition stakeholders in Tanzania that the food basket regions, are the regions most affected by stunting among children. However, this study could not find evidence that combines food production and stunting levels, to substantiate this claim. Therefore, this study aims to compare data on stunting, food production and consumption within administrative regions of the Tanzania mainland. Methods The study used an ecological study design to show the relationship between stunting, poverty, food production and food and non-food consumption expenditure across administrative regions in Tanzania mainland. The study used data from three national wide surveys: 2017/2018 Household Budget Survey (HBS), Tanzania National Nutrition Survey (TNNS) 2018 and Agriculture Statistics for Food Security report 2018/2019. Results The study showed that there is a positive relationship between the prevalence of stunting and food production (r=0.43, p=0.03), while there is a negative relationship between stunting and the level of both the average monthly household food consumption expenditure (r = -0.51, p = 0.01) and average monthly household non-food consumption expenditure (r = -0.51, p = 0.01). It was further found that some regions which have higher levels of stunting such as Njombe, have the lowest level of basic need poverty. Conclusion The study found a positive relationship between food production and the prevalence of stunting using data across regions in mainland Tanzania. This is an indication that regional food production may not entail nutrition outcomes, hence a call for more advocacy on nutrition-sensitive agriculture.

                Background Digital transformation and artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly important in enhancing the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies, particularly through improved economic data management and more efficient targeting of vulnerable groups. Poverty reduction remains one of the most critical challenges for policymakers in Iraq due to its wide economic and social implications. Addressing this challenge requires a comprehensive mix of macroeconomic policies tailored to the national context. This study examines the effectiveness of key macroeconomic policy instruments in reducing poverty in Iraq during the period (2004–2024). Methods The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is employed, along with the Bounds Testing approach, to investigate the existence of a long-run cointegration relationship between the absolute poverty line and major macroeconomic policy variables, including broad money supply, inflation rate, government expenditure, and per capita foreign trade. Annual time-series data for the period were analyzed to estimate both short-run and long-run dynamics. Results The results indicate a statistically significant long-run equilibrium relationship at the (1%) level between macroeconomic policy instruments and the absolute poverty line. The empirical findings show that monetary policy exerts the strongest influence on poverty levels, with broad money supply, inflation, and per capita foreign trade displaying significant effects. Government expenditure plays a meaningful role in reducing poverty in both the short and long run. Conclusions The study concludes that integrating digital transformation and AI technologies into the design and implementation of macroeconomic policies can substantially enhance their effectiveness in reducing poverty. Key recommendations include establishing a National Council for Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence within the Ministry of Planning, strengthening digital infrastructure through public–private partnerships, activating electronic interlinkages among ministries via unified databases, enhancing financial inclusion platforms targeting vulnerable groups, improving government spending efficiency, and encouraging investments that generate sustainable employment opportunities.

                <p>by Yu Wang, Lanxi Wu, Lin Zhang, Yongming Dong, Aaradhya Pant, Yan Liu, Jihong Bai</p>

Neuronal communication relies on neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles. The endocytic protein AP180 is critical for efficient vesicle recycling at presynaptic terminals, and its loss impairs neurotransmission, producing reduced release frequency, enlarged synaptic vesicles, and increased quantal amplitude. Yet how AP180 controls vesicle size and whether vesicle size influences release remains unclear. Here, we show that the C-terminal Assembly domain (AD) of AP180 determines vesicle size and thereby regulates release properties in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. An AP180 variant lacking the AD (AP180∆AD) increases release frequency, contrasting sharply with the reduced transmission in <i>ap180</i> null mutants, yet fails to correct the vesicle size or quantal amplitude. These enlarged vesicles evade curvature-dependent inhibition by complexin, a presynaptic regulator of fusion, while remaining dependent on complexin for evoked responses. This selective escape reveals that vesicle size influences release dynamics through curvature-sensing proteins. Replacing the AP180 AD with actin-binding motifs restores normal vesicle size, quantal amplitude, and release frequency, indicating that actin interactions are both necessary and sufficient for AD function. Biochemically, we show that the intrinsically disordered AD forms condensates that enrich actin monomers and nucleate filament assembly, while full-length AP180 couples PIP2-rich membranes to actin filaments. Together, these findings reveal that the AP180 AD regulates synaptic vesicle size through actin binding, establishing vesicle morphology as a key influencer of curvature-dependent release control.

Macrophages are essential for host defense, yet how parenchyma-residing macrophages detect pathogens without direct contact remains unclear. <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that infects the brain. Using in situ imaging of mouse model, we showed that brain-resident microglia vigilantly detect capillary-residing <i>C. neoformans</i> prior to its blood–brain barrier transmigration, but are less responsive to nonencapsulated fungi or parenchyma-injected <i>C. neoformans</i>. Microglia migrate to and enwrap leaky capillaries harboring fungi, leading to fungal uptake but not clearance, instead promoting fungal growth. Microglial response is triggered by released capsule components, rather than the assembled capsule. In particular, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) plays a critical role by activating endothelial cells to release nucleotides which act on microglia P2Y12. Our findings revealed a novel paradigm by which microglia detect pathogens without direct contact, offering new insights for microglia-directed antifungal therapies.

                Background Sentence-embedding models transform sentences into dense vector representations that capture their semantic meanings. These representations enable deep learning to perform many tasks efficiently, such as similarity measurement, retrieval, and summarization, with improved semantic understanding. Existing sentence embedding models often struggle to capture the semantic richness and morphological complexity of Arabic, limiting their effectiveness in tasks such as semantic similarity, question answering, summarization, and information retrieval. Objectives This study aims to develop a novel sentence-embedding framework tailored for Arabic that addresses the shortcomings of current models by integrating contextual and linguistic features. Methods We propose a multimodal architecture that combines a fine-tuned Sentence-AraBERT (SAraBERT) model with pre-trained FastText embeddings. The model is evaluated on standard Arabic Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Results Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines, achieving lower MSE values (0.0355) and higher correlation scores (0.8053), indicating a stronger alignment with human-annotated similarity judgments on the ATrD dataset. Conclusion The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal SAraBERT-based embeddings in enhancing sentence-level semantic understanding of Arabic. This study advances Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for underrepresented languages and provides a foundation for future research on Arabic language understanding using deep learning techniques.

                Background A neutrosophic ring represents an algebraic generalization of the classical ring structure by introducing an indeterminacy element I , enabling the modeling of truth, falsity, and indeterminacy simultaneously, as established within Smarandache’s neutrosophic framework. In contrast, a Boolean ring is a commutative algebraic structure in which every element is idempotent ( αI ) ² = αI reflecting the logical principles of Boolean algebras and possessing characteristic two Combining these concepts, the neutrosophic Boolean ring extends the Boolean ring by embedding neutrosophic logic parameters—truth (T), indeterminacy (I), and falsity (F)—into its elements and operations. This hybrid structure allows for the representation of algebraic uncertainty and incomplete information while preserving Boolean idempotent properties, thus providing a flexible framework for studying systems with uncertain or partially defined information in algebraic and logical contexts Methods The research defines the Indeterminacy ring R I = { α + βI : α , β ∈ R } and explores its algebraic properties through examples from integers, rationals, and reals. It then formulates the Indeterminacy Boolean Ring (B-Ring) characterized by idempotency ( αI ) ² = αI , and establishes several theorems proving its core algebraic features. Results Findings reveal that Indeterminacy B-Rings are commutative and have characteristic two, ensuring 2 αI = 0 . Each maximal Indeterminacy ideal is also prime, and these rings are semisimple and reduced, containing no nonzero nilpotent elements. Furthermore, any Indeterminacy B-Ring can be represented as a direct product of copies of Z ₂ I , known as the Indeterminacy Boolean field. The quotient rings preserve Boolean and Indeterminacy properties, confirming their structural consistency. Conclusions The study successfully extends Boolean ring theory to the Indeterminacy domain, establishing a strong algebraic foundation for modeling uncertainty. Indeterminacy B-Rings maintain the essential Boolean properties of idempotency and commutativity while incorporating indeterminate behavior through I ² = I . These results open new perspectives for future applications in neutrosophic logic, fuzzy systems, and abstract algebra dealing with indeterminate information.

                Background Oxidative stress and inflammation are mutually reinforcing physiological processes. The transcription factor Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) acts as the master regulator of redox homeostasis and anti-inflammatory signaling. To overcome the off-target limitations of conventional electrophilic Nrf2 activators, this study investigates selective peptide-based modulators. We present data indicating that an innate defense regulator (IDR)-1002 peptide is able to activate the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response and mitigate inflammation in an endothelial cell model. Methods We first screened several IDR peptides IDR-1 (Lys-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Pro-Ala-Ile-Pro-Val-Ser-Leu-Leu), IDR-1018 (Val-Arg-Leu-Ile-Val-Ala-Val-Arg-Ile-Trp-Arg-Arg), HH2 (Val-Gln-Leu-Arg-Ile-Arg-Val-Ala-Val-Ile-Arg-Ala) and IDR-1002 (Val-Gln-Arg-Trp-Leu-Ile-Val-Trp-Arg-Ile-Arg-Lys) for their ability to induce Nrf2 nuclear translocation in HEK293 and bovine endothelial cells (BEC) via Western blot and ELISA. Transcriptional activity was assessed in HepG2 cells using an ARE (Antioxidant Response Element)-luciferase reporter assay to determine the EC50. Downstream expression of antioxidant enzymes, including HO-1 (Heme Oxygenase-1), NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1), and GCLM (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase Modifier Subunit), was quantified by ELISA. GST (Glutathione S-Transferase) activity induced by IDR-1002 was measured using a CDNB-GSH conjugation assay. Finally, the functional capacity to reduce H2O2-induced ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) and TNF-stimulated inflammation was measured in BECs. Results Among the tested peptides, IDR-1002 induced the most potent concentration-dependent nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in both cell lines. IDR-1002 activated ARE-dependent transcription with an EC50 of 18.57 μM. This activation led to a significant time-dependent increase in HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM protein levels, alongside enhanced GST activity. Functionally, IDR-1002 pre-treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of intracellular ROS (up to 5.4-fold at 50 μM) and a significant decrease in TNF-α expression in stimulated BECs. Conclusions IDR-1002 acts as a potent dual-function regulator that simultaneously activates the Nrf2 antioxidant response and inhibits NF-κB-mediated inflammation. These findings highlight IDR-1002 as a promising therapeutic candidate for chronic diseases characterized by the interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-203/v1?src=rss">A Unified Validation Framework for Assessing Green Skills Implementation from Basic to Vocational Education: A Measurement Invariance Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The transition toward greener economies has heightened the need for education systems to cultivate green skills from early schooling through vocational pathways. Despite growing interest, existing assessments remain fragmented and lack validation across educational levels. This study develops and validates a unified measurement framework for assessing green skills implementation across basic, lower-secondary, and vocational education. A multi-phase quantitative design was employed, including item development, expert review, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and multi-group measurement invariance testing. The final instrument comprised 36 items across six constructs: environmental awareness, sustainable behaviour, critical sustainability thinking, sustainability participation, resource management skills, and technical green practices. Using data from 215 students, the six-factor CFA model demonstrated excellent fit (CFI = .953; RMSEA = .052) and strong reliability and convergent validity across all constructs. Multi-group CFA supported configural and metric invariance, while partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing four intercepts, enabling valid latent mean comparisons across educational levels. Results indicated a clear developmental progression of green skills, with foundational competencies stronger in primary education and technical competencies highest in vocational students. These findings confirm that green skills evolve along a continuum and can be measured consistently across schooling stages. The validated framework provides a robust tool for curriculum alignment, professional development, and monitoring sustainability competencies within national education systems. This study advances psychometric approaches in sustainability education and offers empirical guidance for policymakers seeking coherent strategies to support future green workforces.

                Introduction Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by persistent or new symptoms lasting three months or more after acute infection. Approximately 4% of U.S. adults are affected, with fatigue and muscle weakness among the most common symptoms. Chronic inflammation and nutritional imbalances are thought to contribute to long-COVID symptomatology. The Long-COVIDiet Study was designed to test the effectiveness of a whole-diet approach—grounded in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025—that emphasizes nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods and select supplements. The trial evaluates the impact of this dietary intervention, quantified through a diet quality score, on fatigue, muscle strength, physical function, and biomarkers of nutritional and inflammatory status in older adults with long COVID. Methods and analysis Fifty-six participants aged ≥50 years with long COVID, moderate-to-severe fatigue, and suboptimal diet quality will be recruited from the Baltimore, Maryland area. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either a dietary intervention arm or an attention-control arm. The intervention includes individualized dietary counseling (eight biweekly sessions) and 16 weekly online group sessions with a registered dietitian, emphasizing anti-inflammatory and nutrient-rich foods. The control group attends matched weekly sessions on non-dietary healthy aging topics. Primary outcomes are fatigue and diet quality, assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes include muscle mass, grip strength, and physical function; exploratory outcomes include nutritional and inflammatory biomarkers. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, with linear regression and mixed-effects models evaluating changes across timepoints. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional Review Board (HP-00106745). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences, and plain-language summaries on the study website. Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05977179.
