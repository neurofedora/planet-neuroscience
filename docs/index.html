              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cerebellar modulation of memory encoding in the periaqueductal grey and fear behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The pivotal role of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) in fear learning is reinforced by the identification of neurons in male rat ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) that encode fear memory through signalling the onset and offset of an auditory-conditioned stimulus during presentation of the unreinforced conditioned tone (CS+) during retrieval. Some units only display CS+ onset or offset responses, and the two signals differ in extinction sensitivity, suggesting that they are independent of each other. In addition, understanding cerebellar contributions to survival circuits is advanced by the discovery that (i) reversible inactivation of the medial cerebellar nucleus (MCN) during fear consolidation leads in subsequent retrieval to (a) disruption of the temporal precision of vlPAG offset, but not onset responses to CS+, and (b) an increase in duration of freezing behaviour. And (ii) chemogenetic manipulation of the MCN-vlPAG projection during fear acquisition (a) reduces the occurrence of fear-related ultrasonic vocalisations, and (b) during subsequent retrieval, slows the extinction rate of fear-related freezing. These findings show that the cerebellum is part of the survival network that regulates fear memory processes at multiple timescales and in multiple ways, raising the possibility that dysfunctional interactions in the cerebellar-survival network may underlie fear-related disorders and comorbidities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Correlation between leukocyte phenotypes and prognosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                The prognostic role of immune cells in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains undetermined. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal cohort study including 288 ALS patients with up to 5-year follow-up during 2015–2020 recruited at the only tertiary referral center for ALS in Stockholm, Sweden, and measured the levels of differential leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations. The primary outcome was risk of death after diagnosis of ALS and the secondary outcomes included functional status and disease progression rate. Cox model was used to evaluate the associations between leukocytes and risk of death. Generalized estimating equation model was used to assess the correlation between leukocytes and functional status and disease progression rate. We found that leukocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes increased gradually over time since diagnosis and were negatively correlated with functional status, but not associated with risk of death or disease progression rate. For lymphocyte subpopulations, NK cells (HR= 0.61, 95% CI = [0.42–0.88] per SD increase) and Th2-diffrentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> central memory T cells (HR= 0.64, 95% CI = [0.48–0.85] per SD increase) were negatively associated with risk of death, while CD4<sup>+</sup> effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (EMRA) T cells (HR= 1.39, 95% CI = [1.01–1.92] per SD increase) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (HR= 1.38, 95% CI = [1.03–1.86] per SD increase) were positively associated with risk of death. None of the lymphocyte subpopulations was correlated with functional status or disease progression rate. Our findings suggest a dual role of immune cells in ALS prognosis, where neutrophils and monocytes primarily reflect functional status whereas NK cells and different T lymphocyte populations act as prognostic markers for survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">C-type natriuretic peptide facilitates autonomic Ca2+ entry in growth plate chondrocytes for stimulating bone growth</a></h4>

              
                The growth plates are cartilage tissues found at both ends of developing bones, and vital proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes are primarily responsible for bone growth. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) stimulates bone growth by activating natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) which is equipped with guanylate cyclase on the cytoplasmic side, but its signaling pathway is unclear in growth plate chondrocytes. We previously reported that transient receptor potential melastatin-like 7 (TRPM7) channels mediate intermissive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in growth plate chondrocytes, leading to activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) for promoting bone growth. In this report, we provide evidence from experiments using mutant mice, indicating a functional link between CNP and TRPM7 channels. Our pharmacological data suggest that CNP-evoked NPR2 activation elevates cellular cGMP content and stimulates big-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels as a substrate for cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). BK channel-induced hyperpolarization likely enhances the driving force of TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and seems to accordingly activate CaMKII. Indeed, ex vivo organ culture analysis indicates that CNP-facilitated bone growth is abolished by chondrocyte-specific <i>Trpm7</i> gene ablation. The defined CNP signaling pathway, the NPR2-PKG-BK channel–TRPM7 channel–CaMKII axis, likely pinpoints promising target proteins for developing new therapeutic treatments for divergent growth disorders.

	<p>Gender differences in psychiatric disorders and drug use are well known. Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug among young people. In recent years, its use has been related to the development of psychiatric pathologies; however, few studies have incorporated the gender perspective as of yet. The present work analyses the literature to determine the existence of gender differences in the development of psychotic, depressive and anxious symptoms associated with cannabis use. First, we describe cannabis misuse and its consequences, paying special attention to adolescent subjects. Second, the main gender differences in psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, depression, anxiety and cannabis use disorders, are enumerated. Subsequently, we discuss the studies that have evaluated gender differences in the association between cannabis use and the appearance of psychotic, depressive and anxious symptoms; moreover, we consider the possible explanations for the identified gender differences. In conclusion, the studies referred to in this review reveal the existence of gender differences in psychiatric symptoms associated with cannabis use, although the direction of such differences is not always clear. Future research is necessary to discern the causal relationship between cannabis use and the development of psychiatric symptoms, as well as the gender differences found.</p>

	<p>Hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by monoallelic activating mutations in the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1) gene. While hyperinsulinism may be explained by a reduction in the allosteric inhibition of GLUD1, the pathogenesis of HA in HI/HA remains uncertain; interestingly, HA in the HI/HA syndrome is not associated with acute hyperammonemic intoxication events. We obtained a brain magnetic resonance (MR) in a woman with HI/HA syndrome with chronic asymptomatic HA. On MR spectroscopy, choline and myoinositol were decreased as in other HA disorders. In contrast, distinct from other HA disorders, combined glutamate and glutamine levels were normal (not increased). This observation suggests that brain biochemistry in HI/HA may differ from that of other HA disorders. In HI/HA, ammonia overproduction may come to the expense of glutamate levels, and this seems to prevent the condensation of ammonia with glutamate to produce glutamine that is typical of the other HA disorders. The absence of combined glutamate and glutamine elevation might be correlated to the absence of acute cerebral ammonia toxicity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Nonuniformity of Whole-Cerebral Neural Resource Allocation, a Neuromarker of the Broad-Task Attention</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The neural basis of attention is thought to involve the allocation of limited neural resources. However, the quantitative validation of this hypothesis remains challenging. Here, we provide quantitative evidence that the nonuniform allocation of neural resources across the whole cerebral gray matter reflects the broad-task process of sustained attention. We propose a neural measure for the nonuniformity of whole-cerebral allocation using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that this measure was significantly correlated with conventional indicators of attention level, such as task difficulty and pupil dilation. We further found that the broad-task neural correlates of the measure belong to frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. Finally, we found that patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder showed abnormal decreases in the level of the proposed measure, reflecting the executive dysfunction. This study proposes a neuromarker suggesting that the nonuniform allocation of neural resources may be the broad-task neural basis of sustained attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hop Mice Display Synchronous Hindlimb Locomotion and a Ventrally Fused Lumbar Spinal Cord Caused by a Point Mutation in Ttc26</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Identifying the spinal circuits controlling locomotion is critical for unravelling the mechanisms controlling the production of gaits. Development of the circuits governing left-right coordination relies on axon guidance molecules such as ephrins and netrins. To date, no other class of proteins have been shown to play a role during this process. Here, we have analyzed <I>hop</I> mice, which walk with a characteristic hopping gait using their hindlimbs in synchrony. Fictive locomotion experiments suggest that a local defect in the ventral spinal cord contributes to the aberrant locomotor phenotype. <I>Hop</I> mutant spinal cords had severe morphologic defects, including the absence of the ventral midline and a poorly defined border between white and gray matter. The <I>hop</I> mice represent the first model where, exclusively found in the lumbar domain, the left and right components of the central pattern generators (CPGs) are fused with a synchronous hindlimb gait as a functional consequence. These defects were associated with abnormal developmental processes, including a misplaced notochord and reduced induction of ventral progenitor domains. Whereas the underlying mutation in <I>hop</I> mice has been suggested to lie within the <I>Ttc26</I> gene, other genes in close vicinity have been associated with gait defects. Mouse embryos carrying a CRISPR replicated point mutation within <I>Ttc26</I> displayed an identical morphologic phenotype. Thus, our data suggest that the assembly of the lumbar CPG network is dependent on fully functional TTC26 protein.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictors of social response to COVID-19 among health care workers caring for individuals with confirmed COVID-19 in Jordan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 forced public health authorities around the world to call for national emergency plans. Public responses, in the form of social discrimination and stigmatizing behaviors, are increasingly being observed against individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for those individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the perception of social discrimination and coping strategies, and explore predictors of social discrimination and coping with COVID-19 among HCWs and individuals with confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional descriptive-comparative design to collect data, using a convenience sample of 105 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and 109 HCWs using a web-based survey format. Results: In this study, individuals confirmed with COVID-19 reported a high level of social discrimination compared with HCWs (t = 2.62, p < 0.01), while HCWs reported a high level of coping with COVID-19 compared to individuals with COVID-19 (t = -3.91, p < 0.001). Educational level, age, monthly income, and taking over-the-counter medication were predictors of social discrimination and coping with COVID-19 among HCWs and individuals with confirmed COVID-19. Conclusions: The findings showed that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to face social discrimination, and HCWs cope with COVID-19 better than ordinary individuals with confirmed COVID-19.

                Purpose: The research evaluates if teachers can achieve better teaching outcomes by using a proposed mobile interactive system (MIS) developed for this study as an additional approach to enhancing teachers’ proficiency in Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) in the virtual classroom.   Background: According to previous studies, teachers’ self-assessment on TPACK might be affected by their ego because they have autonomy over the students in the classroom. Some studies suggest that utilisation of an interactive whiteboard (IWB) promotes creativity in teaching and learning but that it is unsuitable for a virtual environment due to its large size and the high maintenance costs associated with owning one in a teacher’s residence. Besides, some studies also reveal that allowing the students to assess their teachers through TPACK  is able to reduce potential errors which might result from the TPACK self-assessment done by teachers.   Methods: Pre- and post- experiments were conducted with the developed MIS integrated into teaching process. Synchronous display (SD) and whiteboard-like freehand writing (WFW) were features of the MIS integrated into the experimental group. Questionnaires were distributed to the students, and a reflective measurement model was formed using SmartPLS and IBM SPSS Statistics.   Findings: Based on our findings, teachers’ Technological Content Knowledge had a significant positive effect on TPACK with the inclusion of MIS in online teaching. Predictive relevance was also evaluated through a Q2 value to predict the endogenous construct of the constructed model. The Q2 value was greater than zero, indicating that the model possesses a predictive relevance.   Conclusion: The integration of the developed MIS in the virtual classroom has a significant positive impact on the students’ academic performance relating to concept learning and knowledge acquisition of subject matter.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in frailty and its associated factors in the community dwelling elderly Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective analytical study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is a scarcity of quality literature on the prevalence of frailty among community dwelling elderly in India. This study was originally planned to analyze the longitudinal trends in frailty status of community dwelling elderly in an Indian population as well to identify factors associated with frailty in the Indian context. However, the recruitment phase of this study coincided with one of the largest lockdowns in history, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and this gave us a unique opportunity to study the effects this pandemic enforced, as a result of the necessary restrictions, on the frailty status as well the factors affecting frailty in the elderly. Methods: A prospective observational study was designed and conducted amongst 19 community dwelling elderly of Dakshina Kannada District, in Karnataka India. Outcome variables of frailty (EFIP), physical activity (PASE), functional mobility (TUG), gait speed (10-meter walk test), nutritional status (MNA®-SF) body composition (BIA), and strength (dynamometry), were measured at baseline and on follow-up after three months. The changes occurring in these variables over the three-month period were analyzed and the change in frailty was independently correlated with changes in each of the other outcomes. Results: We couldn’t identify any statistically significant difference in frailty over a period of three months. However, there was a highly significant change in the physical activity status, lower extremity muscle strength, body composition, functional mobility, gait speed, and cognitive function in the same time period. Conclusions: Though individual determinants of frailty in community dwelling changed over a three-month period, these changes failed to produce any observable/measurable difference in frailty status.

                <p>by Thierry Pécot, Maria C. Cuitiño, Roger H. Johnson, Cynthia Timmers, Gustavo Leone</p>

Automatic characterization of fluorescent labeling in intact mammalian tissues remains a challenge due to the lack of quantifying techniques capable of segregating densely packed nuclei and intricate tissue patterns. Here, we describe a powerful deep learning-based approach that couples remarkably precise nuclear segmentation with quantitation of fluorescent labeling intensity within segmented nuclei, and then apply it to the analysis of cell cycle dependent protein concentration in mouse tissues using 2D fluorescent still images. First, several existing deep learning-based methods were evaluated to accurately segment nuclei using different imaging modalities with a small training dataset. Next, we developed a deep learning-based approach to identify and measure fluorescent labels within segmented nuclei, and created an ImageJ plugin to allow for efficient manual correction of nuclear segmentation and label identification. Lastly, using fluorescence intensity as a readout for protein concentration, a three-step global estimation method was applied to the characterization of the cell cycle dependent expression of E2F proteins in the developing mouse intestine.

                <p>by Jianle Sun, Ruiqi Lyu, Luojia Deng, Qianwen Li, Yang Zhao, Yue Zhang</p>

Bayesian methods are widely used in the GWAS meta-analysis. But the considerable consumption in both computing time and memory space poses great challenges for large-scale meta-analyses. In this research, we propose an algorithm named SMetABF to rapidly obtain the optimal ABF in the GWAS meta-analysis, where shotgun stochastic search (SSS) is introduced to improve the Bayesian GWAS meta-analysis framework, MetABF. Simulation studies confirm that SMetABF performs well in both speed and accuracy, compared to exhaustive methods and MCMC. SMetABF is applied to real GWAS datasets to find several essential loci related to Parkinson’s disease (PD) and the results support the underlying relationship between PD and other autoimmune disorders. Developed as an R package and a web tool, SMetABF will become a useful tool to integrate different studies and identify more variants associated with complex traits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution of innate behavioral strategies through competitive population dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tong Liang, Braden A. W. Brinkman</p>

Many organism behaviors are innate or instinctual and have been “hard-coded” through evolution. Current approaches to understanding these behaviors model evolution as an optimization problem in which the traits of organisms are assumed to optimize an objective function representing evolutionary fitness. Here, we use a mechanistic birth-death dynamics approach to study the evolution of innate behavioral strategies in a simulated population of organisms. In particular, we performed agent-based stochastic simulations and mean-field analyses of organisms exploring random environments and competing with each other to find locations with plentiful resources. We find that when organism density is low, the mean-field model allows us to derive an effective objective function, predicting how the most competitive phenotypes depend on the exploration-exploitation trade-off between the scarcity of high-resource sites and the increase in birth rate those sites offer organisms. However, increasing organism density alters the most competitive behavioral strategies and precludes the derivation of a well-defined objective function. Moreover, there exists a range of densities for which the coexistence of many phenotypes persists for evolutionarily long times.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Motor-related signals support localization invariance for stable visual perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrea Benucci</p>

Our ability to perceive a stable visual world in the presence of continuous movements of the body, head, and eyes has puzzled researchers in the neuroscience field for a long time. We reformulated this problem in the context of hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNN)—whose architectures have been inspired by the hierarchical signal processing of the mammalian visual system—and examined perceptual stability as an optimization process that identifies image-defining features for accurate image classification in the presence of movements. Movement signals, multiplexed with visual inputs along overlapping convolutional layers, aided classification invariance of shifted images by making the classification faster to learn and more robust relative to input noise. Classification invariance was reflected in activity manifolds associated with image categories emerging in late CNN layers and with network units acquiring movement-associated activity modulations as observed experimentally during saccadic eye movements. Our findings provide a computational framework that unifies a multitude of biological observations on perceptual stability under optimality principles for image classification in artificial neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Does plasmid-based beta-lactam resistance increase E. coli infections: Modelling addition and replacement mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noortje G. Godijk, Martin C. J. Bootsma, Henri C. van Werkhoven, Valentijn A. Schweitzer, Sabine C. de Greeff, Annelot F. Schoffelen, Marc J. M. Bonten</p>

Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become more prevalent during past decades. Yet, it is unknown whether such infections occur in addition to infections with antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, thereby increasing the incidence of infections, or whether they replace such infections, leaving the total incidence unaffected. Observational longitudinal studies cannot separate both mechanisms. Using plasmid-based beta-lactam resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> as example we applied mathematical modelling to investigate whether seven biological mechanisms would lead to replacement or addition of infections. We use a mathematical neutral null model of individuals colonized with susceptible and/or resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, with two mechanisms implying a fitness cost, i.e., increased clearance and decreased growth of resistant strains, and five mechanisms benefitting resistance, i.e., 1) increased virulence, 2) increased transmission, 3) decreased clearance of resistant strains, 4) increased rate of horizontal plasmid transfer, and 5) increased clearance of susceptible <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> due to antibiotics. Each mechanism is modelled separately to estimate addition to or replacement of antibiotic-susceptible infections. Fitness costs cause resistant strains to die out if other strain characteristics are maintained equal. Under the assumptions tested, increased virulence is the only mechanism that increases the total number of infections. Other benefits of resistance lead to replacement of susceptible infections without changing the total number of infections. As there is no biological evidence that plasmid-based beta-lactam resistance increases virulence, these findings suggest that the burden of disease is determined by attributable effects of resistance rather than by an increase in the number of infections.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The role of cell geometry and cell-cell communication in gradient sensing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan Fiorentino, Antonio Scialdone</p>

Cells can measure shallow gradients of external signals to initiate and accomplish a migration or a morphogenetic process. Recently, starting from mathematical models like the local-excitation global-inhibition (LEGI) model and with the support of empirical evidence, it has been proposed that cellular communication improves the measurement of an external gradient. However, the mathematical models that have been used have over-simplified geometries (e.g., they are uni-dimensional) or assumptions about cellular communication, which limit the possibility to analyze the gradient sensing ability of more complex cellular systems. Here, we generalize the existing models to study the effects on gradient sensing of cell number, geometry and of long- versus short-range cellular communication in 2D systems representing epithelial tissues. We find that increasing the cell number can be detrimental for gradient sensing when the communication is weak and limited to nearest neighbour cells, while it is beneficial when there is long-range communication. We also find that, with long-range communication, the gradient sensing ability improves for tissues with more disordered geometries; on the other hand, an ordered structure with mostly hexagonal cells is advantageous with nearest neighbour communication. Our results considerably extend the current models of gradient sensing by epithelial tissues, making a step further toward predicting the mechanism of communication and its putative mediator in many biological processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A network-based approach to integrate nutrient microenvironment in the prediction of synthetic lethality in cancer metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Iñigo Apaolaza, Edurne San José-Enériz, Luis V. Valcarcel, Xabier Agirre, Felipe Prosper, Francisco J. Planes</p>

Synthetic Lethality (SL) is currently defined as a type of genetic interaction in which the loss of function of either of two genes individually has limited effect in cell viability but inactivation of both genes simultaneously leads to cell death. Given the profound genomic aberrations acquired by tumor cells, which can be systematically identified with -omics data, SL is a promising concept in cancer research. In particular, SL has received much attention in the area of cancer metabolism, due to the fact that relevant functional alterations concentrate on key metabolic pathways that promote cellular proliferation. With the extensive prior knowledge about human metabolic networks, a number of computational methods have been developed to predict SL in cancer metabolism, including the genetic Minimal Cut Sets (gMCSs) approach. A major challenge in the application of SL approaches to cancer metabolism is to systematically integrate tumor microenvironment, given that genetic interactions and nutritional availability are interconnected to support proliferation. Here, we propose a more general definition of SL for cancer metabolism that combines genetic and environmental interactions, namely loss of gene functions and absence of nutrients in the environment. We extend our gMCSs approach to determine this new family of metabolic synthetic lethal interactions. A computational and experimental proof-of-concept is presented for predicting the lethality of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition in different environments. Finally, our approach is applied to identify extracellular nutrient dependences of tumor cells, elucidating cholesterol and myo-inositol depletion as potential vulnerabilities in different malignancies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">An estimation of the absolute number of axons indicates that human cortical areas are sparsely connected</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Burke Q. Rosen, Eric Halgren</p>

The tracts between cortical areas are conceived as playing a central role in cortical information processing, but their actual numbers have never been determined in humans. Here, we estimate the absolute number of axons linking cortical areas from a whole-cortex diffusion MRI (dMRI) connectome, calibrated using the histologically measured callosal fiber density. Median connectivity is estimated as approximately 6,200 axons between cortical areas within hemisphere and approximately 1,300 axons interhemispherically, with axons connecting functionally related areas surprisingly sparse. For example, we estimate that <5% of the axons in the trunk of the arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi connect Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas. These results suggest that detailed information is transmitted between cortical areas either via linkage of the dense local connections or via rare, extraordinarily privileged long-range connections.

                Background: One of the vital issues in promoting the sustainable tourism industry in developing countries, including Azerbaijan, is the well-grounded selection of tourism sites. Applying traditional approaches as a solution to this task, does not provide a relevant result in all cases in these countries due to local specifics of the tourism, the incompleteness of statistical data, the high-level uncertainty of the internal and external environment, and the questionable reliability of the available information. Methods: Since the statistical data are limited, and conventional formalization tools used for uncertainty description do not consider the reliability degree of the data, it is suggested to make decisions based on the Z-extension of fuzzy logic. A Delphi panel with the expert group is conducted to obtain the information required for the model development. Fuzzy Z-information-based TOPSIS and PROMETHEE methods are applied for the problem solution. Within these approaches Z-number-based procedures of the decision matrix normalization, defining the distance between solutions and the preference function, and swing weights determination are realized. Direct computations with Z-numbers are implemented.  Results: By applying Z-number-based multi-criteria decision-making methods, five potential regions of Azerbaijan have been evaluated for six criteria. The criteria reflect government policy to the development of the regions, economical, geographical, environmental factors, and infrastructure of the locations. Derived solutions are comparable in sense of sites ranking, and similar results were obtained using both methods. Direct calculations allow obtaining results based on the linguistic Z-evaluations of experts without distorting transformations. Conclusion: The managerial decision-making problems in the tourism sector, raised due to the aforementioned barriers, can be successfully resolved by applying Z-number-based multi-criteria approaches. The obtained results allow increasing a range of the decision-making tasks under a high degree of uncertainty to be solved for sustainable development studies and other areas.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Deep Brain Stimulation for Arm Tremor: A Randomized Trial Comparing Two Targets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) effectively suppresses arm tremor. Uncontrolled studies suggest the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) may be superior. We compared the intra-individual efficacy of VIM- versus PSA-DBS on tremor suppression and arm function.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial at Oslo University Hospital in patients (18–80 years) with isolated or combined action tremor affecting at least one arm. Four-contact DBS leads were implanted (bi- or unilaterally) with a trajectory to cover the VIM (upper two contacts) and PSA (lower two contacts). Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) post-surgery to: Group 1, VIM-stimulation months 0–3 (period 1), then PSA-stimulation months 4–6 (period 2); Group 2, PSA-stimulation first, then VIM-stimulation. Primary endpoint was the difference in improvement from baseline to the end of the VIM- versus PSA-period in the sum of the dominant arm tremor scores of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), items 5/6 + 10−14.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-five patients were randomized to Group 1 (<i>n</i> = 23) or 2 (<i>n</i> = 22). In the primary endpoint per-protocol analysis (mixed model, n = 40), mean difference in the sum FTMTRS score improvement for the dominant arm was −2.65 points (95% CI −4.33 to −0.97; <i>p</i> = 0.002). The difference in favour of PSA stimulation was highly significant in period 2, but not period 1.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our randomized trial demonstrated that PSA stimulation provided superior tremor suppression compared with VIM stimulation. A period effect reducing tremor for up to three months in both groups was most likely attributed to a post-surgery stun effect. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Cardiac metastases from phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare. Herein, we report a case of a 37-year-old female patient with a history of borderline breast PTs, admitted to the cardiology department for acute cardiac failure revealing concomitant cardiac and pulmonary metastases of malignant PTs. Cardiac metastasis occurred through direct extension from pulmonary metastasis to the left atrium via the right inferior pulmonary vein, causing severe mitral valve obstruction. Although the metastasis was surgically removed, the patient had an uncommon complication, which led to acute heart failure and huge relapse resulting in her death.

                We developed a new time-calibrated tree incorporating primarily endemic along with some cryptic Ryukyu islands cicada data, following the recent publication of global cicada data by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021).  A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1. X software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations as old as Triassic were adopted largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), and a Quaternary geological event calibration was adopted following Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b) and input into BEAST v1. X. Our timetree suggests that Tettigarctidae had a cicada basal lineage as old as 200.63 Ma, with Derotettiginae the next oldest lineage at 99.2 Ma. Tibicininae is a sister of the remaining subfamilies of Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae, and their species level differentiation and radiation began at 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of specific tribes with parapheletic relationship, and the vicariance and adaptive radiation generated many cryptic species in each tribe. We estimated base substitution rate as a function of age, and the result strongly indicates an exponential increase of base substitution rate in recent geologic time. The consequent increase in cicada biodiversity, including generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surroundings, may have been driven by the generation and spreading of C4 grasses and coeval Quaternary climate change.

                Background: Caesarean sections have become the most popular method for delivering twin babies because of the safety concerns associated with a natural birth. This study aims to identify the maternal characteristics and obstetric parameters that serve as risk factors influencing caesarean delivery in twin pregnancies by comparing women delivering via caesarean section and vaginal birth. Methods: A retrospective chart review design was used to analyse 47 women with multiple pregnancies from the medical records at a primary referral hospital in East Java, Indonesia. Women delivering vaginally were then compared with women who underwent a caesarean section to identify any differences between the groups. Results: In our study, more women delivered by caesarean section than by vaginal birth. Women were more likely to undergo a caesarean section if they had a previous history of undergoing a caesarean section. Similar to previous studies, we found that foetal malpresentation significantly increase the risk of caesarean delivery, while labour augmentation decrease the likelihood of caesarean section. There was also a significant difference in maternal age between groups. Conclusions: The percentage of multiple pregnancies delivered via caesarean section is quite high. Other larger cohort study are warranted, since many factors were involved in the decision of caesarean section.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The accuracy of Infrared sensor detection in a smart toilet [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Infrared (IR) sensors are useful tools for detecting distance and proximity. However, these sensors are not good at detecting edges of an area, therefore when used in a smart toilet it has difficulty in detecting the orientation and position of the user’s body. The aim of this study was to design an IR sensor for a smart toilet with a more accurate and consistent detection.  Methods: A total of 12(six men and six women) participants with different body types were involved in this study. IR sensor detection was tested in the sitting and squatting toilets. For the best accuracy, the  IR sensor's angle was measured. Red, blue, and red-blue plastic covers were used, as these colors improve precision. The microcontroller was  set up to calculate the participant’s distance and presence in the cubicle.    Results:  Toilet positioning varied greatly depending on whether one is sitting or squatting. For sitting toilet, the red cover was close to the accurate distance at a 172˚ angle. IR detected a man but not a woman's body. The blue cover provided the same best angle of 172˚ with a higher sensor distance. When the red and blue cover combination was applied, the reading of 141cm detected both men and women, at 172˚  angle. The actual distance for squatting toilets  was 158cm. The optimal angle for both red and blue covers was 176˚, however the sensor distance was greater for the blue cover. Finally, the red and blue cover combination gave a more accurate distance of up to 163cm from the actual reading, when detecting both genders at a normal angle of 76˚.  Conclusion: The combination of red and blue cover gave the most accurate detection for the squatting and sitting toilets. The best angle for sitting was 172˚, and for squatting was 176˚.

                Background: Spirulina platensis contains several bioactive molecules such as phenol, flavonoid and phycocyanin pigments. This study unveils total phenol, flavonoid, antioxidant activity, phycocyanin content and evaluated encapsulation efficiency from Ocimum basilicum intervention on S. platensis. O. basilicum intervention aims to reduce unpleasant odors from S. platensis that will increase consumption and increase bioactive compounds.   Methods: The intervention was carried out by soaking a S. platensis control sample (SP) in O. basilicum with a ratio of 1:4 (w/v) and it was then dried (DSB) and microencapsulated by freeze drying methods (MSB) using a combination of maltodextrin and gelatin. Total flavonoid and phenolic analysis with curve fitting analysis used a linear regression approach. Antioxidant activity of samples was analysed with the 2,2’-azino-bis-3-3thylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) method. Data were analysed using ANOVA at significance level (p < 0.05) followed by Tukey test models using SPSS v.22.  Results: The result of this study indicated that O. basilicum intervention treatment (DSB) has the potential to increase bioactive compounds such as total phenol, antioxidant activity and phycocyanin, and flavonoid content. Intervention of O. basilicum on S. platensis (DSB) significantly increases total phenol by 49.5% and phycocyanin by 40.7%. This is due to the phenol and azulene compounds in O. basilicum which have a synergistic effect on phenol and phycocyanin in S. platensis. Microencapsulation using a maltodexrin and gelatin coating is effective in phycocyanin protection and antioxidant activity with an encapsulation efficiency value of 71.58% and 80.5%.   Conclusion: The intervention of O. basilicum on S. platensis improved the total phenol and phycocyanin content and there is potential for a pharmaceutical product for a functional food and pharmaceutical product.

                Background: IT tools assist in creating a more participative and independent learning environment. They have brought a new perspective to collaborative learning where students do not just sit in a chair and swallow lecture content but instead participate in creating and sharing knowledge. However, interactivity promoted through the implementation of technology is limited in many cases.    Purpose: This research develops an interactive application for learning calculus that promotes human-system interaction via augmented reality (AR) and human-human interaction through chat functions. The study examines the effect of both interactivities on learning experience and how that learning experience affects the performance of learning.   Methods: The research adopted a quasi-experimental study design and pre-post test data analysis to evaluate the effect of interactivities on learning experience and consequently the effect of learning experience on learning performance. The subjects were exposed to the developed application for learning the calculus chapter ‘Revolution of Solids” in a controlled environment. The study validated its research framework through partial least squares path modelling and tested three hypotheses via pre-and post-test evaluation.   Conclusions: The results found that both interactivities affect learning experience positively; human-human interactivity has a higher impact than human-system interactivity. It was also found that learning performance as part of the learning experience increased from pre-test to post-test.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the utility of Tmax-based target mismatch on CT perfusion (CTP) in predicting radiological and clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) selected for endovascular treatment (EVT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>AIS patients underwent CTP within 24 hours from onset followed by EVT. Critically hypoperfused tissue and ischemic core volumes were automatically calculated using Tmax thresholds &gt;9.5 s and &gt; 16 s, respectively. The difference between Tmax&gt;9.5 s and Tmax&gt;16 s volumes and the ratio between Tmax&gt;9.5 s and Tmax&gt;16 s volumes were considered ischemic penumbra and Tmax mismatch ratio, respectively. Final infarct volume (FIV) was measured on follow-up non-contrast CT at 24 hours. Favorable clinical outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale 0–2. Predictors of FIV and outcome were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Optimal Tmax volumes for identification of good outcome was defined using receiver operating curves.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 393 patients were included, of whom 298 (75.8%) achieved successful recanalization and 258 (65.5%) achieved good outcome. In multivariable analyses, all Tmax parameters were independent predictors of FIV and outcome. Tmax&gt;16 s volume had the strongest association with FIV (beta coefficient = 0.596, p &lt;0.001) and good outcome (OR = 0.96 per 1 mL increase, 95% CI = 0.95–0.97, p &lt;0.001). Tmax&gt;16 s volume had the highest discriminative ability for good outcome (AUC = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.842–0.909). A Tmax&gt;16 s volume of ≤67 mL best identified subjects with favorable outcome (sensitivity = 0.91, specificity = 0.73).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Nonpermissive skin environment impairs nerve regeneration in diabetes via Sec31a</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although the microenvironment for peripheral nerve regeneration is permissive, such a mechanism is defective in diabetes, and the molecular mediators remain elusive. This study aimed to (1) investigate the relationship between skin innervation and collagen pathology in diabetic neuropathy and to (2) clarify the molecular alterations that occur in response to hyperglycemia and their effects on axon regeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We addressed this issue using two complementary systems: (1) human skin from patients with diabetic neuropathy and to (2) a coculture model of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons in the context of intrinsic neuronal factor and extrinsic microenvironmental collagen and its biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In diabetic neuropathy, the skin innervation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFd), a measure of sensory nerve degeneration, was reduced with similar expression of a growth associated protein 43, a marker of nerve regeneration. In contrast, the content and packing of collagen in the diabetic skin became more rigid than the control skin. Sec31a, a protein that regulates the collagen biosynthetic pathway, was upregulated and inversely correlated with IENFd. In the cell model, activated HDFs exposed to high-glucose medium enhanced the expression of Sec31a and collagen I through the activation of transforming growth factor β, a profibrotic molecule. Sec31a upregulation impaired neurite outgrowth. This effect was reversed by silencing Sec31a expression and neurite outgrowth was resumed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The current study provides evidence that Sec31a plays a key role in inhibiting nerve regeneration in diabetic neuropathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Greater diffusion restriction in white matter in Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>The Alzheimer’s Continuum is biologically defined by beta-amyloid deposition which, at the earliest stages, is superimposed upon white matter degeneration in aging. However, the extent to which these co-occurring changes are characterized is relatively under-explored. The goal of this study was to use Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) and biophysical modeling to detect and describe amyloid-related white matter changes in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</p>
<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>Cognitively unimpaired participants ages 45-85 completed brain MRI, amyloid PET (florbetapir), neuropsychological testing, and other clinical measures at baseline in a cohort study. We tested whether beta amyloid-negative (AB-) and -positive (AB+) participants differed on DKI-based conventional (i.e. Fractional Anisotropy [FA], Mean Diffusivity [MD], Mean Kurtosis [MK]) and modeling (i.e. Axonal Water Fraction [AWF], extra-axonal radial diffusivity [<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>]) metrics, and whether these metrics were associated with other biomarkers.</p>
<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>We found significantly greater diffusion restriction (higher FA/AWF, lower MD/ <i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>) in white matter in AB+ than AB- (partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.08-0.19), more notably in the extra-axonal space within primarily late-myelinating tracts. Diffusion metrics predicted amyloid status incrementally over age (AUC=0.84) with modest yet selective associations, where AWF (a marker of axonal density) correlated with speed/executive functions and neurodegeneration, whereas <i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub> (a marker of gliosis/myelin repair) correlated with amyloid deposition and white matter hyperintensity volume.</p>
<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>These results support prior evidence of a non-monotonic change in diffusion behavior, where an early increase in diffusion restriction is hypothesized to reflect inflammation and myelin repair prior to an ensuing decrease in diffusion restriction, indicating glial and neuronal degeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Decreasing Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Expenditures and Improving Quality at the Health System Level</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate a multi-component health system intervention designed to reduce escalating disease-modifying treatment (DMT) expenditures and improve multiple sclerosis (MS) outcomes by increasing use of preferred formulary, and highly effective DMTs (HET).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a trend study of treatment utilization and expenditure outcomes prior to (2009-2011) and during (2012-2018) MS Treatment Optimization Program (MSTOP) implementation in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) compared to a KP region of similar size. Annual relapse rates (ARR) were obtained from KPSC’s electronic health records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adherence to preferred formulary DMTs increased from 25.4% in 2011 to 72.2% in 2017 following MSTOP implementation in KPSC and 22.1% to 43.8%, respectively in the comparator. KPSC’s annual DMT expenditures in 2018 were less than in 2011 despite 11.3% increase in DMT-treated members. The decline in average per-patient-per-year of treatment expenditures from a peak of $43.1K in 2014 to $26.3K in 2018 in KSPC was greater than the comparator, which peaked at $52.1K and declined to $40.0K in 2018. Over the 7 years following initiation of MSTOP, cumulative MS DMT expenditures were $161.6 million less than the comparator. HET use increased to 62.5% of per-patient-treatment-years versus 32.4% in the comparator. This corresponded to a 69% decline in adjusted ARR (95%CI 64.1-73.2%; p&lt;0.0001) among DMT-treated patients at KPSC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A novel, expert-led health system intervention reduced MS DMT expenditures despite rising prices while simultaneously reducing MS relapse rates. Our focus on health system progress toward meaningful, measurable targets could serve as a model to improve quality and affordability of MS care in other settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">APOE antibody inhibits Aβ‐associated tau seeding and spreading in a mouse model</a></h4>

              
                <p><i>APOE</i> is the strongest genetic factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A specific conformation of the ApoE protein is present in amyloid-β (Aβ) containing plaques. Immunotherapy targeting ApoE in plaques reduces brain Aβ deposits in mice. Here, we evaluated the effects of the anti-human APOE antibody HAE-4 on amyloid plaques, Aβ-mediated tau seeding and spreading, and neuritic dystrophy in the 5XFAD amyloid mice expressing human ApoE4. HAE-4 reduced Aβ plaques as well as Aβ-driven tau seeding/spreading and neuritic dystrophy. These results demonstrate that HAE-4 may provide therapeutic effects on amyloid removal and Aβ driven downstream consequences such as tauopathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">SARS‐CoV‐2 and mitochondrial proteins in neural‐derived exosomes of COVID‐19</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>As SARS-CoV-2 is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, a plasma system for quantifying central nervous system proteins in living humans was used to investigate neuropathogenic mechanisms of long-COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins (MPs) in enriched plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) were quantified in resolved acute COVID-19 without post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), PASC without neuropsychiatric manifestations (NP), PASC with NP and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NDEV and ADEV mean levels of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were higher in all PASC sub-groups than controls, but only N levels were higher in PASC with than without NP. Exosome marker CD81-normalized NDEV mean levels of subunit 6 of MP respiratory chain complex I and subunit 10 of complex III, and neuroprotective MPs Humanin and mitochondrial open-reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c (MOTS-c) all were decreased significantly in PASC with NP but not in PASC without NP relative to controls. NDEV levels of MPs voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) were decreased in PASC without and with NP, whereas those of calcium channel MPs mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX) and leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane 1 protein (LETM1) were decreased only in PASC with NP. ADEV levels of MCU and NCLX only were increased in PASC without and with NP.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Abnormal NDEV and ADEV levels of SARS-CoV-2 N and S1 protein and MPs correlate with NP and may be biomarkers for long-COVID prognostics and therapeutic trials.</p>

                By combining calcium imaging and synaptic connectivity analysis, Klapoetke et al. reveal that optic glomeruli in the fly central brain form a topographic visual map, with glomeruli anatomically ordered by visual feature selectivity. Downstream circuits appear to exploit this map by integrating primarily from nearby glomeruli encoding similar features.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Associative learning drives longitudinally-graded presynaptic plasticity of neurotransmitter release along axonal compartments</a></h4>

              
                Anatomical and physiological compartmentalization of neurons is a mechanism to increase the computational capacity of a circuit, and a major question is what role axonal compartmentalization plays. Axonal compartmentalization may enable localized, presynaptic plasticity to alter neuronal output in a flexible, experience-dependent manner. Here we show that olfactory learning generates compartmentalized, bidirectional plasticity of acetylcholine release that varies across the longitudinal compartments of <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body (MB) axons. The directionality of the learning-induced plasticity depends on the valence of the learning event (aversive vs. appetitive), varies linearly across proximal to distal compartments following appetitive conditioning, and correlates with learning-induced changes in downstream mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that modulate behavioral action selection. Potentiation of acetylcholine release was dependent on the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 calcium channel subunit <i>cacophony</i>. In addition, contrast between the positive conditioned stimulus and other odors required the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R), which maintained responsivity to odors upon repeated presentations, preventing adaptation. Downstream from the mushroom body, a set of MBONs that receive their input from the g3 MB compartment were required for normal appetitive learning, suggesting that they represent a key node through which reward learning influences decision-making. These data demonstrate that learning drives valence-correlated, compartmentalized, bidirectional potentiation and depression of synaptic neurotransmitter release, which rely on distinct mechanisms and are distributed across axonal compartments in a learning circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dysregulated heparan sulfate proteoglycan metabolism promotes Ewing sarcoma tumor growth</a></h4>

              
                The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is a group of malignant small round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs) that affects children, adolescents, and young adults. The tumors are characterized by reciprocal chromosomal translocations that generate chimeric fusion oncogenes, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. Survival is extremely poor for patients with metastatic or relapsed disease, and no molecularly-targeted therapy for this disease currently exists. The absence of a reliable genetic animal model of Ewing sarcoma has impaired investigation of tumor cell/microenvironmental interactions <i>in vivo</i>. We have developed a new genetic model of Ewing sarcoma based on Cre-inducible expression of human <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> in wild type zebrafish, which causes rapid onset of SRBCTs at high penetrance. The tumors express canonical EWSR1-FLI1 target genes and stain for known Ewing sarcoma markers including CD99. Growth of tumors is associated with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, which we link to dysregulated extracellular matrix metabolism in general and heparan sulfate catabolism in particular. Targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycans with the specific heparan sulfate antagonist Surfen reduces ERK1/2 signaling and decreases tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These results highlight the important role of the extracellular matrix in Ewing sarcoma tumor growth and the potential of agents targeting proteoglycan metabolism as novel therapies for this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nuclear Hormone Receptor NHR-49 acts in parallel with HIF-1 to promote hypoxia adaptation in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Caenorhabditis elegans Nuclear Hormone Receptor NHR-49, an orthologue of mammalian Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha (PPARα). We show that <i>nhr-49</i> is required for animal survival in hypoxia and is synthetic lethal with <i>hif-1</i> in this context, demonstrating that these factors act in parallel. RNA-seq analysis shows that in hypoxia <i>nhr-49</i> regulates a set of genes that are <i>hif-1-</i>independent, including autophagy genes that promote hypoxia survival. We further show that Nuclear Hormone Receptor <i>nhr-67</i> is a negative regulator and Homeodomain-interacting Protein Kinase <i>hpk-1 </i>is a positive regulator of the NHR-49 pathway. Together, our experiments define a new, essential hypoxia response pathway that acts in parallel with the well-known HIF-mediated hypoxia response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Monkey plays Pac-Man with compositional strategies and hierarchical decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Humans can often handle daunting tasks with ease by developing a set of strategies to reduce decision making into simpler problems. The ability to use heuristic strategies demands an advanced level of intelligence and has not been demonstrated in animals. Here, we trained macaque monkeys to play the classic video game Pac-Man. The monkeys' decision-making may be described with a strategy-based hierarchical decision-making model with over 90% accuracy. The model reveals that the monkeys adopted the take-the-best heuristic by using one dominating strategy for their decision-making at a time and formed compound strategies by assembling the basis strategies to handle particular game situations. With the model, the computationally complex but fully quantifiable Pac-Man behavior paradigm provides a new approach to understanding animals’ advanced cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pericyte-mediated constriction of renal capillaries evokes no-reflow and kidney injury following ischaemia</a></h4>

              
                Acute kidney injury is common, with ~13 million cases and 1.7 million deaths/year worldwide. A major cause is renal ischaemia, typically following cardiac surgery, renal transplant or severe hemorrhage. We examined the cause of the sustained reduction in renal blood flow ('no-reflow'), which exacerbates kidney injury even after an initial cause of compromised blood supply is removed. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, or NG2-dsRed male mice were used in this study. After 60 min kidney ischaemia and 30-60 min reperfusion, renal blood flow remained reduced, especially in the medulla, and kidney tubule damage was detected as Kim-1 expression. Constriction of the medullary descending vasa recta and cortical peritubular capillaries occurred near pericyte somata, and led to capillary blockages, yet glomerular arterioles and perfusion were unaffected, implying that the long-lasting decrease of renal blood flow contributing to kidney damage was generated by pericytes. Blocking Rho kinase to decrease pericyte contractility from the start of reperfusion increased the post-ischaemic diameter of the descending vasa recta capillaries at pericytes, reduced the percentage of capillaries that remained blocked, increased medullary blood flow and reduced kidney injury. Thus, post-ischaemic renal no-reflow, contributing to acute kidney injury, reflects pericytes constricting the descending vasa recta and peritubular capillaries. Pericytes are therefore an important therapeutic target for treating acute kidney injury.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation in cone photoreceptors contributes to an unexpected insensitivity of primate On parasol retinal ganglion cells to spatial structure in natural images</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits are constructed from nonlinear building blocks, and not surprisingly overall circuit behavior is often strongly nonlinear. But neural circuits can also behave near linearly, and some circuits shift from linear to nonlinear behavior depending on stimulus conditions. Such control of nonlinear circuit behavior is fundamental to neural computation. Here, we study a surprising stimulus dependence of the responses of macaque On (but not Off) parasol retinal ganglion cells: these cells respond nonlinearly to spatial structure in some stimuli but near-linearly to spatial structure in others, including natural inputs. We show that these differences in the linearity of the integration of spatial inputs can be explained by a shift in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that originates at least partially from adaptation in the cone photoreceptors. More generally, this highlights how subtle asymmetries in signaling - here in the cone signals - can qualitatively alter circuit computation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis of dynamic P5CS filaments</a></h4>

              
                The bifunctional enzyme Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) is vital to the synthesis of proline and ornithine, playing an essential role in human health and agriculture. Pathogenic mutations in P5CS gene (ALDH18A1) lead to neurocutaneous syndrome and skin relaxation connective tissue disease in humans, and P5CS deficiency seriously damages the ability to resist adversity in plants. We have recently found that P5CS forms the cytoophidium in vivo and filaments in vitro. However, it is difficult to appreciate the function of P5CS filamentation without precise structures. Using cryo-electron microscopy, here we solve structures of <i>Drosophila</i> full-length P5CS in three states at resolution from 3.1 to 4.3 Å. We observe distinct ligand-binding states and conformational changes for the GK and GPR domains, respectively. Divergent helical filaments are assembled by P5CS tetramers and stabilized by multiple interfaces. Point mutations disturbing those interfaces prevent P5CS filamentation and greatly reduce the enzymatic activity. Our findings reveal that filamentation is crucial for the coordination between the GK and GPR domains, providing structural basis for catalytic function of P5CS filaments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activation of the CaMKII-Sarm1-ASK1-p38 MAP kinase pathway protects against axon degeneration caused by loss of mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial defects are tightly linked to axon degeneration, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans,</i> PVQ axons that lack mitochondria degenerate spontaneously with age. Using an unbiased genetic screen, we found that cell-specific activation of CaMKII/UNC-43 suppresses axon degeneration due to loss of mitochondria. Unexpectedly, CaMKII/UNC-43 activates the conserved Sarm1/TIR-1-ASK1/NSY-1-p38 MAPK pathway and eventually the transcription factor CEBP-1 to protect against degeneration. In addition, we show that disrupting a trafficking complex composed of calsyntenin/CASY-1, Mint/LIN-10, and kinesin suppresses axon degeneration. Further analysis indicates that disruption of this trafficking complex activates the CaMKII-Sarm1-MAPK pathway through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Our findings identify CaMKII as a pivot point between mitochondrial defects and axon degeneration, describe how it is regulated, and uncover a surprising neuroprotective role for the Sarm1-p38 MAPK pathway in this context.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantification of protein abundance and interaction defines a mechanism for operation of the circadian clock</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian circadian clock exerts control of daily gene expression through cycles of DNA binding. Here we develop a quantitative model of how a finite pool of BMAL1 protein can regulate thousands of target sites over daily time scales. We used quantitative imaging to track dynamic changes in endogenous labelled proteins across peripheral tissues and the SCN. We determine the contribution of multiple rhythmic processes coordinating BMAL1 DNA binding, including cycling molecular abundance, binding affinities and repression. We find nuclear BMAL1 concentration determines corresponding CLOCK through heterodimerization and define a DNA residence time of this complex. Repression of CLOCK:BMAL1 is achieved through rhythmic changes to BMAL1:CRY1 association and high affinity interactions between PER2:CRY1 which mediates CLOCK:BMAL1 displacement from DNA. Finally, stochastic modelling reveals a dual role for PER:CRY complexes in which increasing concentrations of PER2:CRY1 promotes removal of BMAL1:CLOCK from genes consequently enhancing ability to move to new target sites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early lock-in of structured and specialised information flows during neural development</a></h4>

              
                The brains of many organisms are capable of complicated distributed computation underpinned by a highly advanced information processing capacity. Although substantial progress has been made towards characterising the information flow component of this capacity in mature brains, there is a distinct lack of work characterising its emergence during neural development. This lack of progress has been largely driven by the lack of effective estimators of information processing operations for the spiking data available for developing neural networks. Here, we leverage recent advances in this estimation task in order to quantify the changes in transfer entropy during development. We do so by studying the changes in the intrinsic dynamics of the spontaneous activity of developing dissociated neural cell cultures.  We find that the quantity of information flowing across these networks undergoes a dramatic increase across development. Moreover, the spatial structure of these flows exhibits a tendency to lock in at the point when they arise, after which there is a substantial temporal correlation in the information flows across recording days. We analyse the flow of information during the crucial periods of population bursts. We find that, during these bursts, nodes tend to undertake specialised computational roles as either transmitters, mediators or receivers of information, with these roles tending to align with their average spike ordering - either early, mid or late in the bursts. Further, we find that the specialised computational roles occupied by nodes during bursts are regularly locked-in when the information flows are established. Finally, we briefly compare these results to information flows in a model network developing according to an STDP learning rule from a state of independent firing to synchronous bursting. The phenomena of large increases in information flow, early lock-in of information flow spatial structure and computational roles based on burst position were also observed in this model, hinting at the broader generality of these phenomena.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selective YAP activation in Procr cells is essential for ovarian stem/progenitor expansion and epithelium repair</a></h4>

              
                Ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) undergoes recurring ovulatory rupture and OSE stem cells rapidly generate new cells for the repair. How the stem cell activation is triggered by the rupture and promptly turns on proliferation is unclear. Our previous study has identified that Protein C Receptor (Procr) marks OSE progenitors. In this study, we observed decreased adherent junction and selective activation of YAP signaling in Procr progenitors at OSE rupture site. OSE repair is impeded upon deletion of Yap1 in these progenitors. Interestingly, Procr+ progenitors show lower expression of Vgll4, an antagonist of YAP signaling. Overexpression of Vgll4 in Procr+ cells hampers OSE repair and progenitor proliferation, indicating that selective low Vgll4 expression in Procr+ progenitors is critical for OSE repair. In addition, YAP activation promotes transcription of the OSE stemness gene <i>Procr</i>. The combination of increased cell division and Procr expression leads to expansion of Procr+ progenitors surrounding the rupture site. These results illustrate a YAP-dependent mechanism by which the stem/progenitor cells recognize the murine ovulatory rupture, and rapidly multiply their numbers, highlighting a YAP-induced stem cell expansion strategy.

                TDP-43 mediates proper Stathmin-2 (STMN2) mRNA splicing, and STMN2 protein is reduced in the spinal cord of most ALS patients. To test the hypothesis that STMN2 loss contributes to ALS pathogenesis, we generated constitutive and conditional STMN2 knockout mice. Constitutive STMN2 loss results in early-onset sensory and motor neuropathy featuring impaired motor behavior and dramatic distal neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation of fast-fatigable motor units, which are selectively vulnerable in ALS, without axon or motoneuron degeneration. Selective excision of STMN2 in motoneurons leads to similar NMJ pathology. STMN2 KO heterozygous mice, which better model the partial loss of STMN2 protein found in ALS patients, display a slowly progressive, motor-selective neuropathy with functional deficits and NMJ denervation. Thus, our findings strongly support the hypothesis that STMN2 reduction due to TDP-43 pathology contributes to ALS pathogenesis.

                In low oxygen conditions, increases in cerebral blood flow maintain brain oxygen delivery but the mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced dilations of cerebral vasculature are incompletely understood. Here we show that astrocytes accumulate nitrite and in response to hypoxia produce nitric oxide via mitochondrial reduction of nitrite by a molybdenum-containing enzyme sulfite oxidase. These data suggest that astrocytes can modulate cerebral blood flow in accord with brain tissue oxygenation via mitochondrial production of nitric oxide.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal theta and episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of rodent physiology implicate hippocampal theta as a key modulator of learning and memory (Buzsaki & Moser, 2013; J.E. Lisman & Jensen, 2013), yet human hippocampal recordings have shown divergent theta correlates of memory formation. Herweg et al. (2020) suggest that decreases in memory-related broadband power mask narrowband theta increases. Their survey also suggests that theta's role in memory appears strongest in contrasts that isolate associative retrieval processes and when aggregating signals across large brain regions. We evaluate these hypotheses by analyzing human hippocampal recordings captured as 161 neurosurgical patients performed a free recall task. Using the irregular-resampling auto-spectral analysis to separate broad and narrow-band components of the field potential we show: 1) Broadband and narrowband components of theta exhibit opposite effects, with broadband signals decreasing and narrow-band theta increasing during successful encoding; 2) Whereas low-frequency theta oscillations increase prior to successful recall, higher-frequency theta and alpha oscillations decrease, masking theta's positive effect when aggregating across the full band; 3) Theta's effects on memory encoding and retrieval do not differ between reference schemes that accentuate local signals (bipolar) and those that aggregate across large reference (whole brain average). In line with computational models that ascribe a fundamental role for hippocampal theta in memory our large-scale study of human hippocampal recordings shows that 3-4 Hz theta oscillations reliably increase during successful memory encoding and prior to spontaneous recall of previously studied items.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">N-Terminomic Changes of Neurons During Excitotoxicity Reveals Proteolytic Events Associated with Synaptic Dysfunctions and Potential Targets for Neuroprotection</a></h4>

              
                Excitotoxicity is a neuronal death process initiated by over-stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Although dysregulation of proteolysis and protein phosphorylation signaling networks is critical for excitotoxicity, the identity of affected proteins and mechanisms by which they induce neuronal cell death remains unclear. To address this, we used quantitative N-terminomics to identify proteins modified by proteolysis in neurons undergoing excitotoxic cell death. Our investigation led to the discovery of proteins that, upon proteolysis by calpains, perturb synaptic organization and function. These included key synaptic regulatory proteins including CRMP2, doublecortin-like kinase I, Src tyrosine kinase and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II{beta} (CaMKII{beta}), which we found to undergo calpain-catalyzed proteolytic processing to generate stable truncated fragments with altered activities. We further show that blockade of proteolysis of Src by calpains could protect against neuronal loss in a rat model of neurotoxicity, and that CaMKII{beta} and its isoform CaMKII undergo differential processing by calpains in mouse brains under physiological conditions and during ischemic stroke. Our findings thus reveal new insights into excitotoxic neuronal death mechanisms and suggest potential therapeutic targets for neurological disorders.

                Variations in size and complexity of the cerebral cortex result from differences in neuron number and composition, which are rooted in evolutionary changes in direct and indirect neurogenesis (dNG and iNG) mediated by radial glial progenitors and intermediate progenitors, respectively. How dNG and iNG differentially contribute to cortical neuronal number, diversity, and connectivity are unknown. Establishing a genetic fate-mapping method to differentially visualize dNG and iNG in mice, we found that while both dNG and iNG contribute to all cortical structures, iNG contributes the largest relative proportions to the hippocampus and neocortex compared to insular and piriform cortex, claustrum, and the pallial amygdala. Within the neocortex, whereas dNG generates all major glutamatergic projection neuron (PN) classes, iNG differentially amplifies and diversifies PNs within each class; the two neurogenic pathways generate distinct PN types and assemble fine mosaics of lineage-based cortical subnetworks. Our results establish a ground-level lineage framework for understanding cortical development and evolution by linking foundational progenitor types and neurogenic pathways to PN types.

                When data is pooled across multiple sites, the extracted features are confounded by site effects. Harmonization methods attempt to correct these site effects while preserving the biological variability within the features. However, little is known about the sample size requirement for effectively learning the harmonization parameters and their relationship with the increasing number of sites. In this study, we performed experiments to find the minimum sample size required to achieve multisite harmonization (using neuroHarmonize) using volumetric and surface features by leveraging the concept of learning curves. Our first two experiments show that site-effects are effectively removed in a univariate and multivariate manner; however, it is essential to regress the effect of covariates from the harmonized data additionally. Our following two experiments with actual and simulated data showed that the minimum sample size required for achieving harmonization grows with the increasing average Mahalanobis distances between the sites and their reference distribution. We conclude by positing a general framework to understand the site effects using the Mahalanobis distance. Further, we provide insights on the various factors in a cross-validation design to achieve optimal inter-site harmonization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Examination of diurnal variation and sex differences in hippocampal neurophysiology and spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms are biological processes that cycle across 24 hours and regulate many facets of neurophysiology, including learning and memory. Circadian variation in performance on spatial memory tasks is well-documented; however, the effect of sex across circadian time remains unclear. Additionally, little is known regarding the impact of time-of-day on hippocampal neuronal physiology. Here, we investigated the influence of both sex and time-of-day on hippocampal neurophysiology and memory. Performance on the object location memory (OLM) task depended on both circadian time and sex, with memory enhanced at night in males but during the day in females. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) magnitude at CA3-CA1 synapses was greater at night compared to day in both sexes. Next, we measured spontaneous synaptic excitation and inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. Frequency and amplitude of inhibition was greater during the day compared to night, regardless of sex. Frequency and amplitude of excitation was larger in females, compared to males, independent of time-of-day, although both time-of-day and sex influenced presynaptic release probability. At night, CA1 pyramidal neurons showed enhanced excitability (action potential firing and/or baseline potential) that was dependent on synaptic excitation and inhibition, regardless of sex. This study emphasizes the importance of sex and time-of- day in hippocampal physiology, especially given that many neurological disorders impacting the hippocampus are linked to circadian disruption and present differently in men and women. Knowledge about how sex and circadian rhythms affect hippocampal physiology can improve the translational relevancy of therapeutics and inform the appropriate timing of existing treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Associations between locus coeruleus MRI contrast and physiological responses to acute stress in younger and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Acute stress robustly activates the brain's noradrenergic system, the hub of which is the locus coeruleus (LC). Recent studies have indicated that structural integrity of the LC, assessed through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is associated with better cognitive outcomes in later life. However, no studies have examined whether MRI-assessed LC integrity is related to arousal responses to acute stress in either younger or older adults, despite the LC's documented role in promoting physiological arousal as part of the acute stress response. In this study, 102 younger and 51 older adults completed an acute stress induction task while we assessed multiple measures of physiological arousal (heart rate, breathing rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, sympathetic tone, and heart rate variability, HRV). We used turbo spin echo MRI scans to quantify LC MRI contrast as a measure of LC integrity. Using univariate and multivariate approaches, we assessed how LC MRI contrast was associated with arousal at rest and during acute stress reactivity and recovery. We found that in older adults, having higher caudal LC MRI contrast was associated with greater stress-related increases in systolic blood pressure and decreases in HRV, as well as lower HRV during recovery from acute stress. These results suggest that having higher caudal LC integrity in older adulthood is associated with more pronounced physiological responses to acute stress. Further work is needed to confirm these patterns in larger samples of older adults.

                Fear-based disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) steepen age-related cognitive decline and doubles the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. Due to the seemingly hyperactive properties of fear memories, PTSD symptoms can worsen with age. Perturbations in the synaptic circuitry supporting fear memory extinction are key neural substrates of PTSD. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a medial temporal lobe structure critical in the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of fear memories. As little is known about fear extinction memory and BLA synaptic dysfunction within the context of aging and AD, the goal of this study was to investigate how fear extinction memory deficits and basal amygdaloid nucleus (BA) synaptic dysfunction differentially associate in non-pathological aging and AD in the TgF344AD (TgAD) rat model of AD. Young, middle-aged, and older-aged WT and TgAD rats were trained on a delay fear conditioning and extinction procedure prior to ex vivo extracellular field potential recording experiments in the BA. Relative to young WT rats, long-term extinction memory was impaired, and in general, associated with a hyperexcitable BA and impaired LTP in TgAD rats at all ages. In contrast, long-term extinction memory was impaired in aged WT rats and associated with impaired LTP but not BA hyperexcitability. Interestingly, the middle-aged TgAD rats showed intact short-term extinction and BA LTP, suggestive of a compensatory mechanism, whereas differential neural recruitment in older-aged WT rats may have facilitated short-term extinction. As such, associations between fear extinction memory and amygdala deficits in non-pathological aging and AD are dissociable.

                We present a functionally relevant, quantitative characterization of the neural circuitry of Drosophila melanogaster at the mesoscopic level of neuron types as classified exclusively based on network connectivity. Starting from a large neuron-to-neuron brain-wide connectome of the fruit fly, we use stochastic block modeling and spectral graph clustering to group neurons together into a common 'cell class' if they connect to neurons of other classes according to the same probability distributions. Thus, nodes of the identified circuit represent cell classes, while the directed edges represent the connection probabilities between neurons in those respective classes. We then characterize the connectivity-based cell classes with standard neuronal biomarkers, including neurotransmitters, developmental birthtimes, morphological features, spatial embedding, and functional anatomy. Mutual information indicates that connectivity-based classification reveals aspects of neurons that are not adequately captured by traditional classification schemes. Next, using graph-theoretic and random walk analyses to identify neuron classes as hubs, sources, or destinations, we detect patterns of directional connectivity and information flow that potentially underpin specific functional interactions in the Drosophila brain. We uncover a core of highly interconnected dopaminergic cell classes functioning as the backbone information highway for multisensory integration. We also recognize glutamatergic-dominant connections between the motor and optic regions, possibly facilitating circadian rhythmic activity. Additional predicted pathways pertain to spatial orientation, fight-or-flight response, and olfactory learning. Mapping the developmental birthtimes of neurons also pinpoints the temporal change of the circuit blueprint over the fly lifespan, revealing distinct critical growth periods of individual pathways. Our analysis provides experimentally testable hypotheses critically deconstructing complex brain function from organized connectomic architecture.

                Our ability to enact successful goal-directed actions involves multiple learning processes. Among these processes, implicit motor adaptation ensures that the sensorimotor system remains finely tuned in response to changes in the body and environment. Whether Parkinson's Disease (PD) impacts implicit motor adaptation remains a contentious area of research: whereas multiple reports show impaired performance in this population, many others show intact performance. While there is a range of methodological differences across studies, one critical issue is that performance in many of the studies may reflect a combination of implicit adaptation and strategic re-aiming. Here, we revisited this controversy using a visuomotor task designed to isolate implicit adaptation. In two experiments, we found that adaptation in response to a wide range of visual perturbations (3{degrees} - 45{degrees}) was similar in PD and matched control participants. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of previously published work, we found that the mean effect size contrasting PD and controls across 16 experiments was not significant. Together, these analyses indicate that implicit adaptation is preserved in PD, offering a fresh perspective on the role of the basal ganglia in sensorimotor learning.

                Calcium imaging has been widely adopted for its ability to record from large neuronal populations. To summarize the time course of neural activity, dimensionality reduction methods, which have been applied extensively to population spiking activity, may be particularly useful. However, it is unclear if the dimensionality reduction methods applied to spiking activity are appropriate for calcium imaging. We thus carried out a systematic study of design choices based on standard dimensionality reduction methods. We also developed a novel method to perform deconvolution and dimensionality reduction simultaneously (termed CILDS). CILDS most accurately recovered the single-trial, low-dimensional time courses from calcium imaging that would have been recovered from spiking activity. CILDS also outperformed the other methods on calcium imaging recordings from larval zebrafish and mice. More broadly, this study represents a foundation for summarizing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal populations using dimensionality reduction in diverse experimental settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurons in inferior temporal cortex are sensitive to motion trajectory during degraded object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Our brains continuously acquire sensory information and make judgments even when visual information is limited. In some circumstances, an ambiguous object can be recognized from how it moves, such as an animal hopping or a plane flying overhead. Yet it remains unclear how movement is processed by brain areas involved in visual object recognition. Here we investigate whether inferior temporal cortex, an area traditionally known for shape processing, has access to motion information during degraded shape recognition. We developed a matching task that required monkeys to recognize moving shapes with variable levels of shape degradation. Neural recordings in area IT showed that, surprisingly, some IT neurons preferred blurry shapes over clear ones. Further, many of the neurons exhibited motion sensitivity at different times during the presentation of the blurry target. Population decoding analyses showed that motion pattern could be decoded from IT neuron pseudo-populations. Contrary to previous findings, these results suggest that neurons in IT can integrate visual motion and shape information, particularly when shape information is degraded, in a way that has been previously overlooked. Our results highlight the importance of using challenging multi-feature recognition tasks to understand the role of area IT in naturalistic visual object recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chemogenetic enhancement of cAMP signaling renders hippocampal synaptic plasticity resilient to the impact of acute sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep facilitates memory storage and even brief periods of sleep loss lead to impairments in memory, particularly memories that are hippocampus dependent. In previous studies, we have shown that the deficit in memory seen after sleep loss is accompanied by deficits in synaptic plasticity. Our previous work has also found that sleep deprivation is associated with reduced levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the hippocampus, and that the reduction of cAMP mediates the diminished memory performance. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that cAMP acts as a mediator for not only the cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation, but also the observed deficits in synaptic plasticity. In this study, we expressed the heterologous Drosophila melanogaster Gs-protein coupled octopamine receptor (DmOct{beta}1R) in mouse hippocampal neurons. This receptor is selectively activated by the systemically injected ligand (octopamine), thus allowing us to increase cAMP levels in hippocampal neurons during a five-hour sleep deprivation period. Our results show that chemogenetic enhancement of cAMP during the period of sleep deprivation prevents deficits in a persistent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that is induced at the Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region. We also found that elevating cAMP levels only in the early or later half of sleep deprivation successfully prevented LTP deficits. These findings reveal that cAMP-dependent signaling pathways are key mediators of sleep deprivation at the synaptic level. Targeting these pathways could be useful in designing strategies to prevent the impact of sleep loss.

                Background: The development of therapeutics for Parkinsons disease (PD) requires the establishment of biomarker assays to enable stratifying patients, monitoring disease progression and assessing target engagement. Attempts to develop diagnostic assays based on detecting levels of the alpha-synuclein (aSYN) protein, a central player in the pathogenesis of PD, have yielded inconsistent results. Objective: To determine whether the three commercial kits that have been extensively used for total aSYN quantification in human biological fluids (from Euroimmun, MSD, and Biolegend) are capable of capturing the diversity and complexity of relevant aSYN proteoforms. Methods: We investigated and compared the ability of the different assays to detect the diversity of aSYN proteoform using a library of aSYN proteins that compromise the majority of disease-relevant aSYN variants and post-translational modification. Results: Our findings showed that none of the three tested immunoassays accurately capture the totality of relevant aSYN species and are unable to recognize most disease-associated C-terminally truncated variants of aSYN. Moreover, several N-terminal truncations and phosphorylation/nitration differentially modify the level of aSYN detection and recovery by different immunoassays, and a CSF matrix effect was observed for most of the aSYN proteoforms analyzed by the three immunoassays. Conclusions: Our results showed that these immunoassays do not capture the totality of the relevant aSYN species and therefore may not be appropriate tools to provide an accurate measure of total aSYN levels in samples containing modified forms of the protein. This highlights the need for next-generation aSYN immunoassays that capture the diversity of aSYN proteoforms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coherent network oscillations regulate quiescence and behavioral responsiveness in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Quiescent states such as sleep restore vital physiological functions across phyla and are characterized by reduced locomotion and diminished behavioral responsiveness to external stimuli. In humans, synchronous activity across cortical networks is a hallmark of deep sleep, but how network coherence elevates arousal thresholds to maintain quiescent states remains largely unclear. Here, we build on our recent discovery of slow wave activity (SWA) mediating sleep need in the R5 ring network of Drosophila and investigate interactions across sleep- and arousal mediating networks. We demonstrate that information of sleep need travels across a recently described recurrent network for sleep regulation (dFSB-helicon-R5) and elicits oscillatory Ca2+ signatures in the presynaptic terminals of the interconnected networks. Subject to circadian modulation, the sleep need mediating circuits within this network (dFSB and R5) reciprocally promote these oscillatory signatures. Optogenetically imposing slow rhythms (1 Hz) on R5 and dFSB induces entrainable quiescent states while high-frequency stimulation of R5 (10 Hz) leads to flies losing postural control. We further discover that increased excitability in the master sleep homeostat (dFSB) likely acts as a switch that synchronizes the presynaptic electrical patterns of R5 and arousal mediating neurons (helicon) at night. Exposing the behavioral significance by optogenetically mimicking coherent activity we show that R5/helicon synchronization facilitates suppression of responsiveness to visual stimuli in sleeping flies. Moreover, neural activity in downstream head-direction neurons targeted by both helicon and R5 can be completely inhibited through activation of the R5 network. We therefore propose that sleep need mediating circuits promote coherent SWA to induce quiescent states by rhythmically associating neural networks that mediate locomotion, arousal and postural control.

                Neurotransmitters are released by exocytosis from synaptic vesicles at the active zone in the presynaptic terminal. The scaffold of the active zone consists of only a few evolutionarily conserved proteins, including RIM, CAST/ELKS, and RIM-BP, and tethers Munc13 and Ca2+ channels. The molecular principles that enable these proteins to mediate synaptic diversity have remained unclear. Here, we identified synapse type-specific molecular nanoconfigurations in the active zone by systematic quantification of active zone proteins using nanoscopy at two types of excitatory synapses and two types of inhibitory synapses in the rat hippocampal CA3 region. Quantitative analysis revealed that Munc13 content was particularly varied among the various synapse types and that the physical proximity of Ca2+ channels to the active zone scaffolds correlated with the efficacy of neurotransmitter release. We propose that the active zone is a flexible supramolecular assembly that can tune its composition and spatial configuration to adjust neurotransmitter release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel automated morphological analysis of microglia activation using a deep learning assisted model</a></h4>

              
                There is growing evidence for the key role of microglial activation in brain pathophysiology. Consequently, there is a need for efficient automated methods to measure the morphological changes distinctive of microglia functional states in research settings. Currently, many commonly used automated methods can be subject to sample representation bias, time consuming imaging, specific hardware requirements, and difficulty in maintaining an accurate comparison across research environments. To overcome these issues, we use commercially available deep learning tools (Aiforia(R) Cloud (Aifoira Inc., Cambridge, United States ) to quantify microglial morphology and cell counts from histopathological slides of Iba1 stained tissue sections. We provide evidence for the effective application of this method across a range of independently collected datasets in mouse models of viral infection and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive workflow with training details and annotation strategies by feature layer that can be used as a guide to generate new models. In addition, all models described in this work are shared within the Aiforia(R) platform and are available for study-specific adaptation and validation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BrainQCNet: a Deep Learning attention-based model for multi-scale detection of artifacts in brain structural MRI scans</a></h4>

              
                Analyses of structural MRI (sMRI) data depend on robust upstream data quality control (QC). It is also crucial that researchers retain the maximum amount of usable data to ensure reproducible, generalisable models. The time-consuming task of manual QC evaluation has prompted the development of tools for the automatic assessment of brain sMRI scans. Such tools are particularly valuable in this age of big data. One limitation of the most commonly used tools is that execution time is long, which poses a challenge in terms of duration and resource usage, particularly when processing large datasets. Further, evaluation is global (pass/fail) rather than localized. Having a tool that localizes areas of low quality could prevent unnecessary data loss. To address these issues, we trained a Deep Learning model, ProtoPNet, to classify minimally preprocessed 2D slices of scans that were manually annotated with a refined quality assessment (ABIDE 1 n = 980 scans). To validate the best model, we assessed 2141 ABCD scans for which gold-standard manual QC annotations were available. We obtained excellent accuracy: 82.4% for good quality scans (Pass), 91.4% for medium to low quality scans (Fail). Further validation using 799 scans from ABIDE 2 and 751 scans from ADHD-200 confirmed the reliability of our model. Accuracy was comparable to or exceeded that of another commonly used tool (MRIQC), but with dramatically reduced processing and prediction time (1 min per scan, GPU machine, CUDA-compatible). To facilitate faster and more accurate QC prediction for the neuroimaging community, we have shared the model that returned the most reliable global quality scores, local predictions of quality, and maps and prototypes of local artifacts as a BIDS-app (https://github.com/garciaml/BrainQCNet).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A robust Reeb graph model of white matter fibers with application to Alzheimer's disease progression</a></h4>

              
                Tractography generates billions of complex curvilinear fibers (streamlines) in 3D that exhibit the geometry of white matter pathways. Analysis of raw streamlines on such a large scale is time-consuming and intractable. Further, it is well known that tractography computations produce noisy streamlines, and this in turn severely affect their use in structural brain connectivity analysis. Prompted by these challenges, we propose a novel method to model the bundling structures of streamlines using the construct of a Reeb graph. Three key parameters in our method capture the geometry and topology of the streamlines: (i) {varepsilon} - distance between a pair of streamlines in a bundle that defines its sparsity; (ii)  - spatial length of the bundle that introduces persistence; and (iii) {delta} - the bundle thickness. Together, these parameters control the robustness and granularity of the model to provide a compact signature of the streamlines and their underlying anatomic fiber structure. We validate the robustness of the bundling structure using synthetic and ISMRM datasets. Next, we demonstrate the potential of this approach as a tool for efficient tractogram comparison by quantifying the fiber densities in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Our results on ADNI data localize the maximal bundles of various brain regions and show a significant depletion in the fiber density as Alzheimer's disease progresses. The source code for the implementation is available on GitHub.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synapse-type-specific competitive Hebbian learning forms functional recurrent networks</a></h4>

              
                Cortical networks exhibit complex stimulus-response patterns. Previous work has identified the balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents as a central component of cortical computations, but has not considered how the required synaptic connectivity emerges from biologically plausible plasticity rules. Using theory and modeling, we demonstrate how a wide range of cortical response properties can arise from Hebbian learning that is stabilized by the synapse-type-specific competition for synaptic resources. In fully plastic recurrent circuits, this competition enables the development and decorrelation of inhibition-balanced receptive fields. Networks develop an assembly structure with stronger connections between similarly tuned neurons and exhibit response normalization and surround suppression. These results demonstrate how neurons can self-organize into functional circuits and provide a foundational understanding of plasticity in recurrent networks.

	<p>Background: Although Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent worldwide, treating this condition remains challenging. Further, potential treatments for AUD do not fully address alcohol-induced neuroadaptive changes. Understanding the effects of pharmacotherapies for AUD on the human brain may lead to tailored, more effective treatments, and improved individual clinical outcomes. Objectives: We systematically reviewed the literature for studies investigating pharmacotherapies for AUD that included neuroimaging-based treatment outcomes. We searched the PubMed, Scielo, and PsycINFO databases up to January 2021. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: Eligible studies included those investigating pharmacotherapies for AUD and employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and/or proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two independent reviewers screened studies&amp;amp;rsquo; titles and abstracts for inclusion. Data extraction forms were shared among all the authors to standardize data collection. We gathered information on the following variables: sample size; mean age; sociodemographic and clinical characteristics; alcohol use status; study design and methodology; main neuroimaging findings and brain-regions of interest (i.e., brain areas activated by alcohol use and possible pharmacological interactions); and limitations of each study. Results: Out of 177 studies selected, 20 studies provided relevant data for the research topic. Findings indicate that: (1) Acamprosate and gabapentin may selectively modulate limbic regions and the anterior cingulate cortex; (2) Naltrexone and disulfiram effects may involve prefrontal, premotor, and cerebellar regions; (3) Pharmacotherapies acting on glutamate and GABA neurotransmission involve primarily areas underpinning reward and negative affective states, and; (4) Pharmacotherapies acting on opioid and dopamine systems may affect areas responsible for the cognitive and motor factors of AUD. Limitations: Most of the studies were focused on naltrexone. A small number of studies investigated the action of disulfiram and gabapentin, and no neuroimaging studies investigated topiramate. In addition, the time between medication and neuroimaging scans varied widely across studies. Conclusions: We identified key-brain regions modulated by treatments available for AUD. Some of the regions modulated by naltrexone are not specific to the brain reward system, such as the parahippocampal gyrus (temporal lobe), parietal and occipital lobes. Other treatments also modulate not specific regions of the reward system, but play a role in the addictive behaviors, including the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The role of these brain regions in mediating the AUD pharmacotherapy response warrants investigation in future research studies.</p>

	<p>Background: Both depressive disorders (DD) and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) are caused by immune system dysfunction. Affected individuals show increased proinflammatory cytokine concentration levels. Also, it has been hypothesized that DD and PTSD might be associated with a generalized proinflammatory cytokine signature. The study assessed the concentration of IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-10 in depression alone and with PTSD. Methods: The study involved 460 participants. Out of them, 420 subjects comprised a study group and 40 subjects comprised a control group. Each study group consisted of 60 patients with mild depression (MD), moderate depression (MOD), severe depression (SeD), MD and PTSD (MD + PTSD), MOD and PTSD (MOD + PTSD), SeD and PTSD (SeD + PTSD), and with PTSD alone. All patients had serum concentration of IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-10 measured with ELISA. Results: DD and PTSD are reflected in IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-10 concentration levels. It was reported that mean levels of IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-4, IL-8 increase as depression became more severe. A regular decrease in IL-10 concentration levels was noted with the onset and exacerbation of depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The findings might be useful when considering chronic inflammation as a potential target or biomarker in depression and PTSD treatment.</p>

                We developed a new family of genetically encoded serotonin (5-HT) sensors (sDarken) on the basis of the native 5-HT1A receptor and circularly permuted GFP. sDarken 5-HT sensors are bright in the unbound state and diminish their fluorescence upon binding of 5-HT. Sensor variants with different affinities for serotonin were engineered to increase the versatility in imaging of serotonin dynamics. Experiments in vitro and in vivo showed the feasibility of imaging serotonin dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution. As demonstrated here, the designed sensors showed excellent membrane expression, have high specificity, a superior signal-to-noise ratio, detect the endogenous release of serotonin and are suitable for two-photon in vivo imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the normative advantages of dopamine and striatal opponency for learning and choice</a></h4>

              
                Much research focuses on how the basal ganglia (BG) and dopamine (DA) contribute to reward-driven behavior. But BG circuitry is notoriously complex, with two opponent pathways interacting via several disinhibitory mechanisms, which are in turn modulated by DA. Building on earlier models, we propose a new model, OpAL*, to assess the normative advantages of such circuitry in cost-benefit decision making. OpAL* dynamically modulates DA as a function of learned reward statistics, differentially amplifying the striatal pathway most specialized for the environment. OpAL* exhibits robust advantages over traditional and alternative BG models across a range of environments, particularly those with sparse reward. These advantages depend on opponent and nonlinear Hebbian plasticity mechanisms previously thought to be pathological. Finally, OpAL* captures patterns of risky choice arising from manipulations of DA and environmental richness across species, suggesting that such choice patterns result from a normative biological mechanism.

                Aims: CLN2 disease is a fatal inherited childhood neurodegenerative disorder. Although a disease-modifying therapy now exists, a fundamental lack of understanding of disease pathogenesis has hampered development of more effective therapies. To better understand the cellular pathophysiology of CLN2 disease, we investigated the nature and progression of neuropathological and neurological changes in the recently generated Cln2R207X mouse. Methods: We have detailed microglial activation, astrogliosis, cytokine and chemokine expression, and neuron loss across the forebrain and spinal cords of Cln2R207X mice, along with quantitative gait analysis. We also performed long-term electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to characterize seizure activity, a clinically-relevant phenotype yet to be defined in any CLN2 disease model. Results: Histology revealed early localized microglial activation months before neuron loss in the thalamocortical system and spinal cord, which was accompanied by astrogliosis. These pathological changes were more pronounced and occurred in the cortex before the thalamus or spinal cord. There were early-onset and progressive changes in the expression of specific chemokines and cytokines including IL-33, IP-10, and MIP-1. Gait analysis revealed impaired performance only at disease end stage. EEG recordings revealed robust and progressive epileptiform activity from disease mid-stage including spontaneous seizures, which were accompanied by a profound loss of cortical GABAergic interneurons. Conclusions: Our data reveal novel phenotypes in Cln2R207X mice that differ markedly in their timing and progression through the CNS from other NCL mouse models. Our findings provide new insights on CLN2 disease pathogenesis and clinically-relevant readouts for future therapeutic studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics of brain-fluid circulation are altered in the mature-onset Tet-off APP mouse model of amyloidosis</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is an incurable brain disorder characterised by the progressive build-up of toxic amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau protein aggregates. AD gradually inflicts cognitive functions of an individual such as memory, thinking, reasoning, and language by degrading synaptic function and the integrity of neuronal networks. It has been recently suggested that the efficacy of different brain-clearance systems like the glymphatic system (GS), involved in the removal of toxic waste and homeostatic balance, plays a key role in the pathology of AD. Moreover, the observed coupling between brain fluid movement and global brain activity implies that an alteration of the neuronal network integrity can impact brain fluid circulation throughout the brain and thereby the efficacy of the GS. Here, we investigated the dynamics of brain fluid circulation in Tet-Off APP (AD) mice, a mature-onset model of amyloidosis in which we have recently shown a deterioration of neuronal network integrity by resting-state fMRI. By utilizing dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI and gadoteric acid (Gd-DOTA) T1 contrast agent injected into the cisterna magna, we demonstrated that brain fluid exchange was significantly altered in 14-month-old AD mice compared to control littermates. More specifically, AD mice showed higher Gd-DOTA accumulation in areas proximal to the injection cite and computational modeling of time courses demonstrated significantly lower inflow time constants relative to the controls. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated abundant amyloid plaque burden in the forebrain of the AD group coinciding with extensive astrogliosis and microgliosis. The neuroinflammatory responses were also found in plaque-devoid regions, potentially impacting brain fluid circulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A distinct subset of oligodendrocyte lineage cells interact with the developing dorsal root entry during its genesis</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cell of the CNS and are critical for the functionality of the nervous system. In the packed CNS, we know distinct profiles of oligodendrocytes are present. Here, we used intravital imaging in zebrafish to identify a distinct oligodendrocyte lineage cell (OLC) that resides on the dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons in the spinal cord. Our profiling of OLC cellular dynamics revealed a distinct cell cluster that interacts with peripheral sensory neurons at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ). With pharmacological, physical and genetic manipulations, we show that the entry of dorsal root ganglia pioneer axons across the DREZ is important to produce sensory located oligodendrocyte lineage cells. These oligodendrocyte lineage cells on peripherally derived sensory neurons display distinct processes that are stable and do not express mbp. Upon their removal, sensory behavior related to the DRG neurons is abolished. Together, these data support the hypothesis that peripheral neurons at the DREZ can also impact oligodendrocyte development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating spatial and network properties of NMDA-dependent neuronal connectivity in mixed cortical cultures</a></h4>

              
                A technique combining fluorescence imaging with Ca2+ indicators and single-cell laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate (LSPS) allows identification of functional connections between individual neurons in mixed cultures of rat neocortical cells as well as observation of synchronous spontaneous activity among neurons. LSPS performed on large numbers of neurons yielded maps of functional connections between neurons and allowed calculation of neuronal network parameters. LSPS also provided an indirect measure of excitability of neurons targeted for photostimulation. By repeating LSPS sessions with the same neurons, stability of connections and change in the number and strength of connections were also determined. Experiments were conducted in the presence of bicuculline to study the properties of excitatory neurotransmission. The AMPA receptor inhibitor, 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), abolished synchronous neuronal activity but had no effect on connections mapped by LSPS. In contrast, the NMDA receptor inhibitor, 2-Amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (APV), dramatically decreased the number of functional connections between neurons while also affecting synchronous spontaneous activity. Functional connections were also decreased by increasing extracellular Mg2+ concentration. These data demonstrated that LSPS mapping interrogates NMDA receptor-dependent connectivity between neurons in the network. A GluN2A-specific inhibitor, NVP-AAM077, decreased the number and strength of connections between neurons as well as neuron excitability. Conversely, the GluN2A-specific positive modulator, GNE-0723, increased these same properties. These data showed that LSPS can be used to directly study perturbations in the properties of NMDA receptor-dependent connectivity in neuronal networks. This approach should be applicable in a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo experimental preparations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability of M1-P15 as a cortical marker for transcallosal inhibition: a preregistered TMS-EEG study</a></h4>

              
                Background: In a recently published study combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), we provided first evidence of M1-P15, an early component of TMS-evoked potentials, as a measure of transcallosal inhibition between motor cortices. However, considering the technical challenges of TMS-EEG recordings, further evidence is needed before M1-P15 can be considered a reliable index. Objective: Here, we aimed at validating M1-P15 as a cortical index of transcallosal inhibition, by replicating previous findings on its relationship with the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) and with performance in bimanual coordination. Moreover, we aimed at inducing a task-dependent modulation of transcallosal inhibition. Methods: A new sample of 32 healthy right-handed participants underwent behavioral motor tasks and TMS-EEG recording, in which left and right M1 were stimulated during bimanual tasks and during an iSP paradigm. Hypotheses and methods were preregistered before data collection. Results: We successfully replicated our previous findings on the positive relationship between M1-P15 amplitude and the iSP normalized area. However, we did not confirm the relationship between M1-P15 latency and bimanual coordination. Finally, we show a task-dependent modulation of M1-P15 amplitude, which was affected by the characteristics of the bimanual task the participants were performing, but not by the contralateral hand activity during the iSP paradigm. Conclusions: The present results corroborate our previous findings in validating the M1-P15 as a reliable cortical marker of transcallosal inhibition, and provide novel evidence of its task-dependent modulation. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of a preregistration approach in the TMS-EEG field to increase methodological rigor and transparency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan 4,6 sulfation regulates sympathetic nerve regeneration after myocardial infarction</a></h4>

              
                Sympathetic denervation of the heart following myocardial infarction (MI) is sustained by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the cardiac scar, and denervation predicts risk of sudden cardiac death. Blocking CSPG signaling restores sympathetic axon outgrowth into the cardiac scar, decreasing arrhythmia susceptibility. Axon growth inhibition by CSPGs is thought to depend on the sulfation status of the glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) attached to the core protein. Tandem sulfation of CS-GAGs at the 4th (4S) and 6th (6S) positions of n-acetyl-galactosamine inhibits outgrowth in several types of neurons within the central nervous system, but it is not known if sulfation is similarly critical during peripheral nerve regeneration. We asked if CSPG sulfation prevented sympathetic axon outgrowth. Sympathetic neurite outgrowth across purified CSPGs is restored in vitro by reducing 4S with the 4- sulfatase enzyme Arylsulfatase-B (ARSB). Additionally, we co-cultured cardiac scar tissue with sympathetic ganglia ex vivo and found that reducing 4S with ARSB restored axon outgrowth to control levels. We examined levels of the enzymes responsible for adding and removing sulfation to CS-GAGs by western blot to determine if they were altered in the left ventricle after MI. We found that CHST15 (4S dependent 6- sulfotransferase) was upregulated, and ARSB was downregulated after MI. Increased CHST15 combined with decreased ARSB suggests a mechanism for production and maintenance of sulfated CSPGs in the cardiac scar. We altered tandem sulfated 4S,6S CS-GAGs in vivo by transient siRNA knockdown of Chst15 and found that reducing 4S,6S restored Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) positive sympathetic nerve fibers in the cardiac scar after MI and reduced arrhythmias. Overall, our results suggest that modulating CSPG-sulfation after MI may be a therapeutic target to promote sympathetic nerve regeneration in the cardiac scar and reduce post-MI cardiac arrhythmias.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Co-release of histamine and GABA in prefrontal cortex excites fast-spiking interneurons and causes divisive gain change in pyramidal cells; an effect that is enhanced in older mice</a></h4>

              
                We studied how co-release of histamine/GABA from axons originating from the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and projecting to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) influences circuit processing. We opto-stimulated histamine/GABA co-release from genetically defined TMN axons that express the histidine decarboxylase gene (TMNHDC axons). Whole-cell recordings were used to monitor excitability of visually identified PFC neurons in layer 2/3 of prelimbic (PL), anterior cingulate (AC) and infralimbic (IL) regions before and after opto-stimulated histamine/GABA release. We found that histamine-GABA co-release influences the PFC through actions on distinct neuronal types: histamine stimulates fast-spiking interneurons; and co-released GABA enhances tonic (extrasynaptic) inhibition on pyramidal cells (PyrNs). For fast spiking non-accommodating interneurons, opto-stimulation increased excitability, an effect blocked by histamine H1 and H2 receptor antagonists. The excitability of other interneuron types in the PFC was not altered. In contrast, the combined action of histamine and GABA co-release from TMNHDC axons produced predominantly divisive gain changes in PyrNs, increasing their resting input conductance, and decreasing the slope of the input-output relationship. The direct inhibitory effect of TMNHDC axon activation on PyrNs was not blocked by histamine receptor antagonists but was blocked by GABAA receptor antagonists. Across the adult lifespan (from 3 months to over 2 years of age), stimulation of TMNHDCaxons in the PFC inhibited PyrN excitability significantly more in older mice. For individuals that maintain cognitive performance into later life, increases in TMNHDC modulation of PyrNs could enhance information processing and be an adaptive mechanism to buttress cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Activity in Afferent Projections to the Infralimbic Cortex is Associated with Individual Differences in the Recall of Fear Extinction.</a></h4>

              
                Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by an impaired ability to extinguish fear responses to trauma-associated cues. Studies in humans and non-human animals point to differences in the engagement of certain frontal cortical regions as key mediators determining whether or not fear extinction is successful, however the neural circuit interactions that dictate the differential involvement of these regions are not well understood. To better understand how individual differences in extinction recall are reflected in differences in neural circuit activity, we labeled projections to the infralimbic cortex (IL) in rats using a retrograde tracer and compared neural activity within, and outside, of IL-projecting neurons. We analyzed these data in groups separated on the basis of how well rats retained extinction memory. We found that within IL-projecting cells, neurons in the posterior paraventricular thalamus showed heightened activity in rats that showed good extinction recall. Outside of the IL-projecting cells, increased Fos activity was observed in good extinction rats in select regions of the claustrum and ventral hippocampus. Our results indicate that differences in extinction recall are associated with a specific pattern of neural activity both within and outside of projections to the IL.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The rostral medial frontal cortex is crucial for engagement in consummatory behavior</a></h4>

              
                The medial frontal cortex (MFC) in rodents emits rhythmic activity that is entrained to the animal's licking cycle during consumption and encodes the value of consumed fluids (Horst and Laubach, 2013; Amarante et al., 2017; Amarante and Laubach, 2021). These signals are especially prominent in the rostral half of the MFC. This region is located above an orbitofrontal region where mu opioid receptors regulate intake (Mena et al., 2011; Castro and Berridge, 2017) and reversible inactivation reduces behavioral measures associated with the incentive value and palatability of liquid sucrose (Parent et al., 2015a). Here, we examined the effects of reversible inactivation and stimulation of mu opioid receptors in rostral MFC on behavior in an incentive contrast licking task. Adult male rats licked to receive access to liquid sucrose, which alternated between high (16%) and low (4%) values over 30 sec periods. Bilateral infusion of muscimol reduced the total number of licks emitted over the 30 min test sessions, the time spent actively consuming sucrose, and the ratio of licks for the higher and lower value fluids. Inactivation did not alter licking frequency or variability or microstructural measures such as the duration of licking bouts that are classically associated with the palatability of a liquid reward. Infusions of DAMGO (1ug/uL) at the same sites had inconsistent behavioral effects across different subjects. Our findings suggest that the rostral MFC has a distinct role in the control of consummatory behavior and contributes to peristent consumption and not to the expression of palatability.

	<p>Linguistic phenotypes of individuals with Fragile X (FXS) and Williams (WS) syndromes exhibit various degrees of pragmatic impairment, involving difficulties in social communication and in adapting to conversational principles. The goal of the present study was to explore syndrome-specific pragmatic profiles of adults with FXS and WS based on the assessment of the observance of Gricean maxims of conversation. The participants were 12 Spanish-speaking adults (6 FXS/6 WS), without a diagnosis of ASD, whose extensive naturalistic conversations (71,859 words) were transcribed and coded with the CHILDES/TALKBANK tools and the PREP-CORP pragmatic protocol. Violations of the maxims of conversation were analyzed, and indexes of cooperation and conversational response were obtained. Both groups showed reduced verbal production and repetitive dysfluencies; prominent features in the FXS profile were higher proportion of non-contingent language, perseverations of topic and form, and impulsive conversational responses; in the WS profile, salient characteristics were higher proportion of tangential utterances, reformulations, and conversational responses reflecting overly literal interpretation. Pragmatic profiles of violation of conversational maxims reflect specific communication skills impaired in adults with FXS and WS and raise the need for assessment and intervention methods that specifically address their social communication abilities.</p>

	<p>We present a case of a woman who reported to the emergency unit due to recurrent episodes of severe headache and collapse. MRI examination revealed no relevant findings apart from small meningioma of the right parietal region. The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy and received outpatient treatment, which was changed due to poor toleration. A follow-up MRI was performed which revealed an isolated, focal lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient underwent extensive laboratory testing and antiseizure medications were started again. Another MRI indicated substantial regression of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) lesion. Both the complete clinical image and results of the diagnostic evaluation spoke in favor of cytotoxicity of the corpus callosum associated with anti-epileptic drug treatment. Pathologies involving the corpus callosum include congenital, demyelination, infection, neoplasm, trauma and vascular changes. Isolated, non-specific lesions of the splenium of corpus callosum usually indicate multiple sclerosis; however, other pathologies should be considered. Anti-epileptic drugs may evoke cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs).</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bilateral synchronous cortical activity occurs during sleep, attention, and seizures. Canonical models place the thalamus at the center of bilateral cortical synchronization because it generates bilateral sleep spindle oscillations and primarily generalized absence seizures. However, classical studies suggest that the corpus callosum mediates bilateral cortical synchronization.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We mapped the spread of right frontal lobe-onset, focal to bilateral seizures in mice and modified it using chemo and optogenetic suppression of motor thalamic nucleus and corpus callosotomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seizures from the right cortex spread faster to the left cortex than to the left thalamus. The 2 thalami have minimal monosynaptic commissural connections compared to the massive commissure corpus callosum. Chemogenetic and closed-loop optogenetic inhibition of the right ventrolateral thalamic nucleus did not alter inter-hemispheric seizure spread.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Effects of adropin on learning and memory in rats tested in the Morris water maze</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adropin is a secreted peptide, which is composed of 43 amino acids and shows an effective role in regulating energy metabolism and insulin resistance. Motor coordination and locomotor activity were improved by adropin in the cerebellum. However, it is not known whether adropin administration has an effect on spatial learning and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of adropin on spatial learning and memory and characterized the biochemical properties of adropin in the hippocampus. Thirty male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups as control and adropin groups. The control group received 0.9% NaCl intracerebroventricular for 6 days, while the adropin groups received 1 nmol of adropin dissolved in 0.9% NaCl (for 6 days). The Morris water maze, Y maze, and object location recognition tests were performed to evaluate learning and memory. Also, the locomotor activity tests were measured to assess the motor function. The expression of Akt, phospho-Akt, CREB, phospho-CREB, Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), phospho-GSK3β, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit were determined in the hippocampal tissues by using western blot. Behavior tests showed that adropin significantly increase spatial memory performance. Meanwhile, the western blot analyses revealed that the phosphorylated form of the Akt and CREB were enhanced with adropin administration in the hippocampus. Also, the expression of BDNF showed an enhancement in adropin group in comparison to the control group. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that adropin exerts its enhancing effect on spatial memory capacity through Akt/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Contextual features in the developing hippocampus: A representational similarity analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Functional divisions of labor in support of memory have been reported along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. However, little is known about how the developing hippocampus represents associative memories along this axis. The present research employed representational similarity analysis to ask whether developmental differences exist in the extent to which the anterior versus the posterior hippocampus represent features of the context and associative memories. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected during the retrieval phase of an associative recognition task from 8-year-olds, 10-year-olds, and adults (<i>N</i> = 58). Participants were asked to retrieve pairs of items, which were presented either in the same location as during encoding or in a flipped location. In the anterior hippocampus and only for adults, pattern similarity between the two studied pair conditions was greater than pattern similarity between studied pairs presented in the same location and novel pairs. In contrast, this difference was not significant in the posterior hippocampus. Older, but not younger, children showed a similar, albeit attenuated, similarity pattern to that of adults, but measures of patterns similarity predicted associative recognition across ages. In addition, exploratory analyses showed that similarity patterns in the adult posterior, but not anterior, hippocampus tracked the order of the runs. Overall, the results suggest functional and developmental dissociations in processing different contextual features, with the anterior hippocampus responding to salient and rapid-changing features and the posterior hippocampus responding to slower-changing features of the context.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Novel measures of Morris water maze performance that use vector field maps to assess accuracy, uncertainty, and intention of navigational searches</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Most commonly used behavioral measures for testing learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) involve comparisons of an animal's residence time in different quadrants of the pool. Such measures are limited in their ability to test different aspects of the animal's performance. Here, we describe novel measures of performance in the MWM that use vector fields to capture the motion of mice as well as their search pattern in the maze. Using these vector fields, we develop quantitative measures of performance that are intuitive and more sensitive than classical measures. First, we describe search patterns in terms of vector field properties and use these properties to define three metrics of spatial memory namely Spatial Accuracy, Uncertainty and, Intensity of Search. We demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using four different data sets including comparisons between different strains of mice, an analysis of two mouse models of Noonan syndrome (NS; <i>Ptpn11</i> D61G and <i>Ptpn11</i> N308D/+), and a study of goal reversal training. Importantly, besides highlighting novel aspects of performance in this widely used spatial task, our measures were able to uncover previously undetected differences, including in an animal model of NS, which we rescued with the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor SL327. Thus, our results show that our approach breaks down performance in the MWM into sensitive measurable independent components that highlight differences in spatial learning and memory in the MWM that were undetected by conventional measures.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A growing body of research details spatial representation in bat hippocampus, and experiments have yet to explore hippocampal neuron responses to sonar signals in animals that rely on echolocation for spatial navigation. To bridge this gap, we investigated bat hippocampal responses to natural echolocation sounds in a non-spatial context. In this experiment, we recorded from CA1 of the hippocampus of three awake bats that listened passively to single echolocation calls, call-echo pairs, or natural echolocation sequences. Our data analysis identified a subset of neurons showing response selectivity to the duration of single echolocation calls. However, the sampled population of CA1 neurons did not respond selectively to call-echo delay, a stimulus dimension posited to simulate target distance in recordings from auditory brain regions of bats. A population analysis revealed ensemble coding of call duration and sequence identity. These findings open the door to many new investigations of auditory coding in the mammalian hippocampus.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Information processing in cortical circuits, including the hippocampus, relies on the dynamic control of neuronal activity by GABAergic interneurons (INs). INs form a heterogenous population with defined types displaying distinct morphological, molecular, and physiological characteristics. In the major input region of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG), a number of IN types have been described which provide synaptic inhibition to distinct compartments of excitatory principal cells (PrCs) and other INs. In this study, we perform an unbiased classification of GABAergic INs in the DG by combining in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, intracellular labeling, morphological analysis, and unsupervised cluster analysis to better define IN type diversity in this region. This analysis reveals that DG INs divide into at least 13 distinct morpho-physiological types which reflect the complexity of the local IN network and serve as a basis for further network analyses.</p>

                The structure of natural scenes is signaled by many visual cues. Principal amongst them are the binocular disparities created by the laterally separated viewpoints of the two eyes. Disparity cues are believed to be processed hierarchically, first in terms of local measurements of absolute disparity and second in terms of more global measurements of relative disparity that allow extraction of the depth structure of a scene. Psychophysical and oculomotor studies have suggested that relative disparities are particularly relevant to perception, whilst absolute disparities are not. Here, we compare neural responses to stimuli that isolate the absolute disparity cue with stimuli that contain additional relative disparity cues, using the high temporal resolution of EEG to determine the temporal order of absolute and relative disparity processing. By varying the observers' task, we assess the extent to which each cue is cognitively penetrable. We find that absolute disparity is extracted before relative disparity, and that task effects arise only at or after the extraction of relative disparity. Our results indicate a hierarchy of disparity processing stages leading to the formation of a proto-object representation upon which higher cognitive processes can act.

                The nose of most animals comprises multiple sensory subsystems, which are defined by the expression of different olfactory receptor families. Drosophila melanogaster antennae comprise two morphologically and functionally distinct subsystems that express Odorant receptors (Ors) or Ionotropic receptors (Irs). Although these receptors have been thoroughly characterized in this species, the subsystem-specific expression and roles of other genes are much less well-understood. Here we generate subsystem-specific transcriptomic datasets to identify hundreds of genes, encoding diverse protein classes, that are selectively enriched in either Or or Ir subsystems. Using single-cell antennal transcriptomic data and RNA in situ hybridization, we find most neuronal genes - other than sensory receptor genes - are broadly expressed within the subsystems. By contrast, we identify many non-neuronal genes that exhibit highly selective cell-type expression, revealing substantial molecular heterogeneity in the non-neuronal cellular components of these olfactory subsystems. We characterize one Or subsystem-specific non-neuronal molecule, Osiris 8 (Osi8), a conserved member of a large family of insect transmembrane proteins. Osi8 is expressed in tormogen support cells that are associated with pheromone sensing neurons. Loss of Osi8 abolishes high sensitivity neuronal responses to pheromone ligands. Together this work identifies a new protein required for insect pheromone detection, emphasizes the importance of support cells in sensory responses, and provides a resource for future characterization of other olfactory subsystem-specific genes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Purinergic P2X7 Receptor-mediated inflammation precedes PTSD-related Behaviors in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Clinical evidence has linked increased peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, whether inflammation contributes to or is a consequence of PTSD is still unclear. Previous research shows that stress can activate P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) on microglia to induce inflammation and behavioral changes. In this investigation, we examined whether P2X7Rs contribute to the development of PTSD-like behaviors induced by single prolonged stress (SPS) exposure in rats. Consistent with the literature, exposing adult male and female rats to SPS produced a PTSD-like phenotype of impaired fear extinction and increased anxiety-like behavior one week after exposure. In addition, SPS-exposed animals had more Iba1-positive microglia expressing the P2X7R in the ventral hippocampus, a structure that regulates fear extinction and anxiety-like behavior. Next, we examined if inflammation precedes the behavioral manifestations. Three days after SPS exposure, increased inflammatory cytokines were found in the blood and hippocampal microglia showed increased expression of the P2X7R, IL-1{beta}, and TNF-, suggesting increased peripheral and central inflammation before behavioral testing. To determine whether P2X7Rs contribute to the PTSD-related behaviors induced by SPS exposure, we gave ICV infusions of the P2X7R antagonist, A-438079, for one week starting the day of SPS exposure. Blocking P2X7Rs prevented the SPS-induced impaired fear extinction and increased anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats, suggesting that SPS activates P2X7Rs which increase inflammation to produce a PTSD-like phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing the potential of microglia preparations generated using different human iPSC-based differentiation methods to model microglia-mediated mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the resident immune cells of nervous system. In healthy conditions, microglia actively patrol neural tissues in a homeostatic state, which can rapidly change to an activated state in response to local injury/disease. Dysregulated microglia activation is a hallmark of disorders and diseases of the nervous system, including motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The elucidation of the roles of microglia in human biology and disease has recently benefitted from the development of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based approaches to generate microglia-like cells. Microglia represent a heterogenous group of cells with spatial diversity in both health and disease. This situation poses a considerable challenge along the path towards establishing the most pathologically-relevant human iPSC-derived microglia preparations to investigate the complex roles of microglia in ALS and other neurological diseases. The success of these approaches must account for microglia diversity in different regions of the brain and spinal cord. In this study, we compared the transcriptomes of human iPSC-derived microglia generated using different methods to determine whether or not separate strategies can be used to generate microglia with distinct transcriptional signatures in vitro. We show that different derivation methods give rise to preparations comprising human microglia with distinct transcriptomic signatures resembling the gene profiles of specific microglia subpopulations in vivo. These findings suggest that a careful, and coordinated, implementation of multiple microglia differentiation methods from human iPSCs can be an effective approach towards the goal of generating multiple microglia subtypes that will offer enhanced model systems to account for microglia heterogeneity in vivo. Spatially-defined human iPSC-derived microglia would represent an enhanced tool to study the multiple levels of involvement of microglia in mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS, as well as other neurological diseases and disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Familial ALS-associated SFPQ variants promote the formation of SFPQ cytoplasmic aggregates that reduce surface AMPA receptor expression in primary neurons</a></h4>

              
                SFPQ is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that is involved in a wide range of physiological processes including neuronal development and homeostasis. However, the mislocalization and cytoplasmic aggregation of SFPQ are associated with the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have previously reported that zinc mediates SFPQ polymerization and promotes the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates in neurons. Here we characterize two familial ALS (fALS)-associated SFPQ variants, which cause amino acid substitutions in the proximity of the SFPQ zinc-coordinating center (N533H and L534I). Both mutants display increased zinc-binding affinities, which can be explained by the presence of a secondary zinc-binding site revealed by the 1.83[A] crystal structure of the human SFPQ L534I mutant. Overexpression of these fALS-associated mutants significantly increases the number of SFPQ cytoplasmic aggregates in primary neurons. Although they do not affect the density of dendritic spines, the presence of SFPQ cytoplasmic aggregates causes a marked reduction in the levels of the GluA1, but not the GluA2 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors on the neuronal surface. Taken together, our data demonstrate that fALS-associated mutations enhance the propensity of SFPQ to bind zinc and form aggregates, leading to the dysregulation of AMPA receptor subunit composition, which may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in ALS.

                Oxidative stress generating DNA damage has been shown to be a key characteristic in AlzheimerOxidative stress generating DNA damage has been shown to be a key characteristic in AlzheimerOxidative stress generating DNA damage has been shown to be a key characteristic in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how it affects the pathogenesis of AD is not yet fully understood. Neil3 is a DNA glycosylase initiating repair of oxidative DNA base lesions and with a distinct expression pattern in proliferating cells. In brain, its function has been linked to hippocampal-dependent memory and to induction of neurogenesis after stroke and in prion disease. Here, we generated a novel AD mouse model deficient for Neil3 to study the impact of impaired oxidative base lesion repair on the pathogenesis of AD. Our results demonstrate an age-dependent decrease in amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaque deposition in female Neil3-deficient AD mice, whereas no significant difference was observed in male mice. Furthermore, male but not female Neil3-deficient AD mice show reduced neural stem cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus and impaired working memory compared to controls. These effects seem to be independent of DNA repair as both sexes show increased level of oxidative base lesions in the hippocampus upon loss of Neil3. Thus, our findings suggest an age- and sex-dependent role of Neil3 in the progression of AD by altering cerebral A{beta} accumulation and promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis to maintain cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling the modulation of cortical Up-Down state switching by astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Converging experimental reports have shown that the firing dynamics of neural networks in several cortical brain areas can exhibit Up-Down synchronization regimes, spontaneously alternating between long periods of high collective firing activity (Up state) and long periods of relative silence (Down state). The molecular or cellular mechanisms that support the emergence of these reversible transitions are still uncertain. In addition to intrinsic mechanisms supported by the local neurons of the network, recent experimental studies have suggested that the astrocytes of the local network can actually control the emergence of Up-Down regimes. Here we propose and study a neural network model to explore the implication of astrocytes in this dynamical phenomenon. We consider three populations of cells: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astrocytes, interconnected by gliotransmission events, from neurons to astrocytes and back. We derive two models for this three-population system: a rate model and a stochastic spiking neural network with thousands of neurons and astrocytes. In numerical simulations of these three-population models, the presence of astrocytes is indeed observed to promote the emergence of Up-Down regimes with realistic characteristics. Linear stability analysis reveals that astrocytes in these models do not change the bifurcation structure of these systems, but change the localization of the bifurcations in the parameter space. Accordingly, with the addition of astrocytes, the network can enter a bistability region of the dynamics, where the Up-Down dynamical regime emerges. Simulations of the stochastic network model further evidence that astrocytes provide a stationary and stable background of gliotransmission events to the neurons, that triggers spontaneous transitions between synchronized Up and Down phases of neuronal firing. Taken together, our work provides a theoretical framework to test scenarios and hypotheses on the modulation of Up-Down dynamics by gliotransmission from astrocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Syntaxin-1A modulates vesicle fusion in mammalian neurons via juxtamembrane domain dependent palmitoylation of its transmembrane domain</a></h4>

              
                SNAREs are undoubtedly one of the core elements of synaptic transmission. On the contrary to the well characterized function of their SNARE domains bringing the plasma and vesicular membranes together, the level of contribution of their juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) to the vesicle fusion is still under debate. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed three groups of STX1A mutations: 1) elongation of STX1As JMD by three amino acid insertions in the junction of SNARE-JMD or JMD-TMD; 2) charge reversal mutations in STX1As JMD; and 3) palmitoylation deficiency mutations in STX1As TMD. We found that both JMD elongations and charge reversal mutations have position dependent differential effects on Ca2+-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release in cultured murine hippocampal neurons. Importantly, we show that STX1As JMD regulates the palmitoylation of STX1As TMD and loss of STX1A palmitoylation either through charge reversal mutation K260E or by loss of TMD cysteines particularly inhibits spontaneous vesicle fusion. Interestingly, the retinal ribbon specific STX3B has a glutamate in the position corresponding to the K260E mutation in STX1A and mutating it with E259K acts as a molecular on-switch. Furthermore, palmitoylation of post-synaptic STX3A can be induced by the exchange of its JMD with STX1As JMD together with the incorporation of two cysteines into its TMD. Forced palmitoylation of STX3A dramatically enhances spontaneous vesicle fusion suggesting that STX1A regulates spontaneous release through two distinct mechanisms: one through the C-terminal half of its SNARE domain and the other through the palmitoylation of its TMD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic mapping of APP and amyloid-β biology modulation by trisomy 21</a></h4>

              
                People who have Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21 and thus also an additional copy of APP; this genetic change drives the early development of Alzheimers disease in these individuals. Here we use a combination of next-generation mouse models of Down syndrome (Tc1, Dp3Tyb, Dp(10)2Yey and Dp(17)3Yey) and a knockin mouse model of amyloid-beta accumulation (AppNLF) to determine how chromosome 21 genes other than APP modulate APP/amyloid-beta in the brain when in three copies. We demonstrate that three copies of other chromosome 21 genes are sufficient to partially ameliorate amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain. We go on to identify a subregion of chromosome 21 that contains the gene/genes causing this decrease in amyloid-beta accumulation and investigate the role of two lead candidate genes Dyrk1a and Bace2. Thus an additional copy of chromosome 21 genes, other than APP, can modulate APP/amyloid-beta in the brain under physiological conditions. This work provides critical mechanistic insight into the development of disease and an explanation for the typically later age of onset of dementia in people who have AD-DS compared to those who have familial AD caused by triplication of APP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A connectomics-based taxonomy of mammals</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian taxonomies are conventionally defined by morphological traits and genetics. How species differ in terms of neural circuits and whether inter-species differences in neural circuit organization conform to these taxonomies is unknown. The main obstacle for the comparison of neural architectures have been differences in network reconstruction techniques, yielding species-specific connectomes that are not directly comparable to one another. Here we comprehensively chart connectome organization across the mammalian phylogenetic spectrum using a common reconstruction protocol. We analyze the mammalian MRI (MaMI) data set, a database that encompasses high-resolution ex vivo structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 124 species across 12 taxonomic orders and 5 superorders, collected using a single protocol on a single scanner. We assess similarity between species connectomes using two methods: similarity of Laplacian eigenspectra and similarity of multiscale topological features. We find greater inter-species similarities among species within the same taxonomic order, suggesting the connectome organization recapitulates traditional taxonomies defined by morphology and genetics. While all connectomes retain hallmark global features and relative proportions of connection classes, inter-species variation is driven by local regional connectivity profiles. By encoding connectomes into a common frame of reference, these findings establish a foundation for investigating how neural circuits change over phylogeny, forging a link from genes to circuits to behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The maternal X chromosome impairs cognition and accelerates brain aging through epigenetic modulation in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Female mammalian cells harbor two X chromosomes, one of maternal and one of paternal origin. During development, one X randomly inactivates. This renders either the maternal or paternal X active, causing X mosaicism that varies among individual females, with some showing considerable or complete skew in the general female population. Parent-of-X-origin can modify epigenetics via DNA methylation and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in aging and disease. However, whether X skewing - or its mosaicism - alters functions in females is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew toward the maternal X (Xm) influences key functions of the body. Among cardiac, bone, metabolic, and brain functions, Xm selectively impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by Xm-mediated acceleration of biologic or epigenetic aging of the female hippocampus, a key center for learning and memory. Xm showed epigenetic imprinting of several genes within hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. Thus, the maternal X chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain aging, and silenced genes. Understanding how the maternal X impairs brain function could lead to new understanding of female heterogeneity in cognitive heath and to X chromosome-derived pathways against cognitive deficits and brain aging.

                Despite abundant research on the role of Broca's area in language processing, there is still no consensus on language specificity of this region and its connectivity network. The present study employed the meta-analytic connectivity modeling procedure to identify and compare domain-specific (language-related) and domain-general (non-language) functional connectivity patterns of three subdivisions within the broadly defined Broca's area: pars opercularis (IFGop), pars triangularis (IFGtri) and pars orbitalis (IFGorb) of the left inferior frontal gyrus. The findings revealed a left-lateralized frontotemporal network for all regions of interest underlying domain-specific linguistic functions. The domain-general network and its conjunction with the domain- specific network, however, spanned frontoparietal regions that overlap with the multiple-demand network. The findings suggest that language-specificity of Broca's area emerges within a left-lateralized frontotemporal network, and that domain-general resources are garnered from the frontoparietal network when required by task demands.

                The endocannabinoid signalling (ECS) system is a complex lipid signalling pathway that modulates diverse physiological processes in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems. In nematodes, knowledge of endocannabinoid (EC) biology is derived primarily from the free-living model species Caenorhabditis elegans, where ECS has been linked to key aspects of nematode biology. The conservation and complexity of nematode ECS beyond C. elegans is largely uncharacterised, undermining the understanding of ECS biology in nematodes including species with key importance to human, veterinary and plant health. In this study we exploited publicly available omics datasets, in silico bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses to examine the presence, conservation and life-stage expression profiles of EC-effectors across phylum Nematoda. Our data demonstrate that: (i) ECS is broadly conserved across phylum Nematoda, including in therapeutically and agriculturally relevant species; (ii) EC-effectors appear to display clade and lifestyle-specific conservation patterns; (iii) filarial species possess a reduced EC-effector complement; (iv) there are key differences between nematode and vertebrate EC-effectors; (v) life stage-, tissue- and sex-specific EC-effector expression profiles suggest a role for ECS in therapeutically relevant parasitic nematodes. These data also highlight putative novel targets for anthelmintic therapies. To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive characterisation of ECS pathways in phylum Nematoda and inform our understanding of nematode ECS complexity. Fundamental knowledge of nematode ECS systems will seed follow-on functional studies in key nematode parasites to underpin novel drug target discovery efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of UBE3A in the autism and epilepsy-related Dup15q syndrome using patient-derived, CRISPR-corrected neurons</a></h4>

              
                Chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (Dup15q) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by maternal duplications of this region. Autism and epilepsy are key features of Dup15q, but affected individuals also exhibit intellectual disability and developmental delay. UBE3A, the gene encoding the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, is likely a major driver of Dup15q because individuals with maternal, but not paternal 15q duplications have the disorder, and UBE3A is the only imprinted gene expressed solely from the maternal allele in mature neurons. Nevertheless, the exact role of UBE3A is yet to be determined. To establish whether UBE3A overexpression is required for Dup15q neuronal deficits, UBE3A expression was manipulated in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines using antisense oligonucleotides. Dup15q neurons exhibited hyperexcitability features compared to genome-edited isogenic control neurons, and this phenotype was generally prevented by normalizing UBE3A levels throughout in vitro development. Overexpression of UBE3A in an iPSC line with a paternal duplication resulted in a profile similar to that of Dup15q neurons except for synaptic phenotypes. These results indicate that UBE3A overexpression is necessary for most Dup15q cellular phenotypes. However, the inability of UBE3A overexpression to recapitulate synaptic phenotypes suggests an important role for non-imprinted genes in the disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electroencephalographic dynamics of rhythmicbreath-based meditation</a></h4>

              
                Meditation has been practised for millennia but the neuroscientific understanding of the dynamics is still lacking. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is an evidence based breathing based meditation technique that utilizes rhythmic breathing to induce a deep state of relaxation and calm. Multiple studies have found benefits of the SKY technique from genetic, physiological, psychological to behaviour levels. We collected Electroencephalographic (EEG) data in 43 subjects who underwent the SKY technique and analysed the brain rhythms at different stages of the technique namely preparatory breathing (Pranayama), rhythmic breathing (Kriya) and meditation (Yoga Nidra) using newly developed methods to analyse periodic and aperiodic components. Alpha waves amplitude in the parieto-occipital region decreased as the rhythmic breathing progressed and dropped sharply during the meditation period. Theta amplitudes and peak frequency increased in the centro-frontal region during the rhythmic breathing period but were marked by sustained low theta waves during the meditation period. The delta wave amplitude was not affected by breathing but both delta band power and peak frequency increased during the meditation period in the centro-frontal region. We also saw a decrease in the 1/f aperiodic signal across the brain during the meditation period suggesting a modification of excitation-inhibition balance. We see an overall slowing down of brain oscillations from alpha to theta to delta as the meditation progressed. The paper studies in depth the transitional dynamics of the SKY technique analysing the alpha, theta, delta waves and aperiodic signals and demonstrates that each phase in a breathing based meditation has a unique electrophysiological signature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of a PET radioligand for α2δ-1 subunit of calcium channels for imaging neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain affects 7-10% of the adult population. Being able to accurately monitor biological changes underlying neuropathic pain will improve our understanding of neuropathic pain mechanisms and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive molecular imaging technique that can provide quantitative information of biochemical changes at the whole-body level by using radiolabeled ligands. One important biological change underlying the development of neuropathic pain is the overexpression of 2{delta}-1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels (the target of gabapentin). Thus, we hypothesized that a radiolabeled form of gabapentin may allow imaging changes in 2{delta}-1 for monitoring the underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Here, we report the development of two 18F-labeled derivatives of gabapentin (trans-4-[18F]fluorogabapentin and cis-4-[18F]fluorogabapentin) and their evaluation in healthy rats and a rat model of neuropathic pain (spinal nerve ligation model). Both isomers were found to selectively bind to the 2{delta}-1 receptor with trans-4-[18F]fluorogabapentin having a higher affinity. Both tracers displayed around 1.5- to 2-fold increased uptake in injured nerves over the contralateral uninjured nerves when measured by gamma counting ex vivo. Although the small size of the nerves and the signal from surrounding muscle prevented visualizing these changes using PET, this work demonstrates that fluorinated derivatives of gabapentin retain binding to 2{delta}-1 and that their radiolabeled forms can be used to detect pathological changes in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, this work confirms that 2{delta}-1 is a promising target for imaging specific features of neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromodulation of striatal D1 cells shapes BOLD fluctuations in anatomically connected thalamic and cortical regions</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain's macroscale dynamics are shaped by underlying microscale mechanisms is a key problem in neuroscience. In animal models, we can now investigate this relationship in unprecedented detail by directly manipulating cellular-level properties while measuring the whole-brain response using resting-state fMRI. Here we focused on understanding how blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) dynamics, measured within a structurally well-defined striato-thalamo-cortical circuit, are shaped by chemogenetically exciting or inhibiting D1 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the right dorsomedial striatum (CPdm). We characterize changes in both the BOLD dynamics of individual cortical and subcortical brain areas, and patterns of inter-regional coupling (functional connectivity) between pairs of areas. Using a classification approach based on a large and diverse set of time-series properties, we found that CPdm neuromodulation alters BOLD dynamics within thalamic subregions that project back to dorsomedial striatum. In the cortex, the strongest changes in local dynamics were observed in unimodal regions, i.e., regions that process information from a single sensory modality, while changes in the local dynamics weakened along a putative cortical hierarchical gradient towards transmodal regions. In contrast, a decrease in functional connectivity was observed only for cortico-striatal connections after D1 excitation. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of how targeted cellular-level manipulations affect local BOLD dynamics at the macroscale, including the role of a circuit's structural characteristics and hierarchical cortical level in shaping those dynamics. These findings contribute to ongoing attempts to understand the influence of structure-function relationships in shaping inter regional communication at subcortical and cortical levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Organization of thalamocortical structural covariance and a corresponding 3D atlas of the mouse thalamus</a></h4>

              
                For information from sensory organs to be processed by the brain, it is usually passed to appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex. Almost all of this information passes through the thalamus, a relay structure that reciprocally connects to the vast majority of the cortex. The thalamus facilitates this information transfer through a set of thalamocortical connections that vary in cellular structure, molecular profiles, innervation patterns, and firing rates. Additionally, corticothalamic connections allow for intracortical information transfer through the thalamus. These efferent and afferent connections between the thalamus and cortex have been the focus of many studies, and the importance of cortical connectivity in defining thalamus anatomy is demonstrated by multiple studies that parcellate the thalamus based on cortical connectivity profiles. Here, we examine correlated morphological variation between the thalamus and cortex, or thalamocortical structural covariance. For each voxel in the thalamus as a seed, we construct a cortical structural covariance map that represents correlated cortical volume variation, and examine whether high structural covariance is observed in cortical areas that are functionally relevant to the seed. Then, using these cortical structural covariance maps as features, we subdivide the thalamus into six non-overlapping regions (clusters of voxels), and assess whether cortical structural covariance is associated with cortical connectivity that specifically originates from these regions. We show that cortical structural covariance is high in areas of the cortex that are functionally related to the seed voxel, cortical structural covariance varies along cortical depth, and sharp transitions in cortical structural covariance profiles are observed when varying seed locations in the thalamus. Subdividing the thalamus based on structural covariance, we additionally demonstrate that the six thalamic clusters of voxels stratify cortical structural covariance along the dorsal-ventral, medial-lateral, and anterior-posterior axes. These cluster-associated structural covariance patterns are prominently detected in cortical regions innervated by fibers projecting out of their related thalamic subdivisions. Together, these results advance our understanding of how the thalamus and the cortex couple in their volumes. Our results indicate that these volume correlations reflect functional organization and structural connectivity, and further provides a novel segmentation of the mouse thalamus that can be used to examine thalamic structural variation and thalamocortical structural covariation in disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Trem2*R47H mouse model without cryptic splicing drives age- and disease-dependent tissue damage and synaptic loss in response to plaques</a></h4>

              
                Genome-Wide Association Studies revealed the TREM2 R47H variant as one of the strongest genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Unfortunately, many current TREM2*R47H mouse models are associated with cryptic mRNA splicing of the mutant allele that produces a confounding reduction in protein product. We have developed the Trem2R47H NSS (Normal Splice Site) mouse model where the Trem2 allele is expressed at a similar level to the wild-type Trem2 allele, without evidence of cryptic splicing products, and appropriate inflammatory responses to cuprizone challenge. Utilizing the 5xFAD mouse model, we report age- and disease-dependent changes in response to pathology. At an early disease stage (4 mo), homozygous Trem2R47H NSS; hemizygous 5xFAD (Trem2R47H NSS ; 5xFAD) mice have reduced size and number of microglia plus impaired interaction with plaques, that is associated with increased dystrophic neurites and axonal damage detected through plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) level and suppressed inflammation. However, homozygosity for Trem2R47H NSS suppressed LTP deficits and presynaptic puncta loss caused by the 5xFAD transgene array. At a more advanced disease stage (12 mo,) Trem2R47H NSS ; 5xFAD mice no longer display impaired plaque-microglia interaction or suppressed inflammatory gene expression, although NfL levels remain elevated, and a unique interferon-related gene expression signature is seen. Furthermore, (age) Trem2R47H NSS ; 5xFAD mice also display robust LTP deficits and exacerbated presynaptic loss. Collectively, we provide a Trem2R47H variant mouse without cryptic splicing, and demonstrate it has disease stage dependent effects when combined with a plaque bearing model, with an initial loss of function that ultimately resolves, giving rise to a unique interferon signature and associated tissue damage.

                Organoids enable disease modeling in complex and structured human tissue, in vitro. Like most 3D models, they lack sufficient oxygen supply, leading to cellular stress. These negative effects are particularly prominent in complex models, like brain organoids, where they can prevent proper lineage commitment. Here, we analyze brain organoid and fetal single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from published and new datasets totaling over 190,000 cells. We describe a unique stress signature found in all organoid samples, but not in fetal samples. We demonstrate that cell stress is limited to a defined organoid cell population, and present Gruffi, an algorithm that uses granular functional filtering to identify and remove stressed cells from any organoid scRNAseq dataset in an unbiased manner. Our data show that adverse effects of cell stress can be corrected by bioinformatic analysis, improving developmental trajectories and resemblance to fetal data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BLMM: Parallelised Computing for Big Linear Mixed Models</a></h4>

              
                Within neuroimaging large-scale, shared datasets are becoming increasingly commonplace, challenging existing tools both in terms of overall scale and complexity of the study designs. As sample sizes grow, researchers are presented with new opportunities to detect and account for grouping factors and covariance structure present in large experimental designs. In particular, standard linear model methods cannot account for the covariance and grouping structures present in large datasets, and the existing linear mixed models (LMM) tools are neither scalable nor exploit the computational speed-ups afforded by vectorisation of computations over voxels. Further, nearly all existing tools for imaging (fixed or mixed effect) do not account for variability in the patterns of missing data near cortical boundaries and the edge of the brain, and instead omit any voxels with any missing data. Yet in the large-n setting, such a voxel-wise deletion missing data strategy leads to severe shrinkage of the final analysis mask. To counter these issues, we describe the "Big" Linear Mixed Models (BLMM) toolbox, an efficient Python package for large-scale fMRI LMM analyses. BLMM is designed for use on high performance computing clusters and utilizes a Fisher Scoring procedure made possible by derivations for the LMM Fisher information matrix and score vectors derived in our previous work, Maullin-Sapey and Nichols (2021).

                Odors are intimately tied to the taste system to aid food selection and determine the sensory experience of food. However, how smell and taste are integrated in the nervous system to drive feeding behavior remains largely unknown. We show in Drosophila that odors alone activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) and trigger proboscis extension reflex (PER), a canonical taste-evoked feeding behavior. Odor-evoked PER requires the function of sugar-sensing GRNs but not the olfactory organs. Calcium imaging shows that GRNs directly respond to odors. Odor-evoked PER is mediated by the Gr5a receptor, and is bidirectionally modulated by specific olfactory binding proteins. Finally, odors and sucrose co-applied to GRNs synergistically enhance PER. These results reveal a cell-intrinsic mechanism for odor-taste multimodal integration that takes place as early as in GRNs, indicating that unified chemosensory experience is a product of layered integration in peripheral neurons and in the brain.

	<p>Obstructive sleep apnea is highly prevalent in the post-stroke population, and has been shown to affect cognitive, neurological, and functional status. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment is one of the most effective interventions for obstructive sleep apnea, but compliance is often low due to confounding effects of co-occurring conditions, side effects of treatment titration procedures, and individual patient personality characteristics, perceptions, and social factors. Current research suggests that CPAP treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is not associated with significant risk and can subsequently improve post-stroke motor and neurocognitive function. However, effects of CPAP treatment on post-stroke speech and language recovery remain unclear. Post-stroke communication disorders (e.g., aphasia, dysarthria, and apraxia) are also highly prevalent in this population. Knowledge of the potential positive impact of CPAP on language recovery could contribute to patients&amp;amp;rsquo; motivation to comply with CPAP treatment and provide incentive for speech-language pathologists to refer patients to sleep medicine specialists. In this review of the literature, we examine the question of what effect CPAP treatment may have on post-stroke speech and language function and recovery, as well as summarize the current knowledge on cognitive, neurological, and functional effects. While this review of the literature found CPAP to have varying effects on different cognitive domains, there was not sufficient evidence to determine effects on language recovery. Further research is necessary to determine the potential effects of CPAP treatment on speech and language recovery among stroke patients.</p>

	<p>The objective of this study was to characterize network-level changes in nonfluent/agrammatic Primary Progressive Aphasia (agPPA) and Primary Progressive Apraxia of Speech (PPAOS) with graph theory (GT) measures derived from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. EEGs of 15 agPPA and 7 PPAOS patients were collected during relaxed wakefulness with eyes closed (21 electrodes, 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 positions, 256 Hz sampling rate, 1&amp;amp;ndash;200 Hz bandpass filter). Eight artifact-free, non-overlapping 1024-point epochs were selected. Via Brainwave software, GT weighted connectivity and minimum spanning tree (MST) measures were calculated for theta and upper and lower alpha frequency bands. Differences in GT and MST measures between agPPA and PPAOS were assessed with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Of greatest interest, Spearman correlations were computed between behavioral and network measures in all frequency bands across all patients. There were no statistically significant differences in GT or MST measures between agPPA and PPAOS. There were significant correlations between several network and behavioral variables. The correlations demonstrate a relationship between reduced global efficiency and clinical symptom severity (e.g., parkinsonism, AOS). This preliminary, exploratory study demonstrates potential for EEG GT measures to quantify network changes associated with degenerative speech&amp;amp;ndash;language disorders.</p>

	<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric illness that disproportionately affects military personnel, veterans, and public safety personnel (PSP). Evidence demonstrates that PTSD is significantly associated with difficulties with emotion regulation (ER) and difficulties with cognitive functioning, including difficulties with attention, working memory, and executive functioning. A wide body of evidence suggests a dynamic interplay among cognitive dysfunction, difficulties with ER, and symptoms of PTSD, where numerous studies have identified overlapping patterns of alterations in activation among neuroanatomical regions and neural circuitry. Little work has examined interventions that may target these symptoms collectively. The primary objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel experimental design was to assess the effectiveness of goal management training (GMT), a cognitive remediation intervention, in reducing difficulties with cognitive functioning, and to determine its effects on PTSD symptoms and symptoms associated with PTSD, including difficulties with ER, dissociation, and functioning among military personnel, veterans, and PSP. Forty-two military personnel, veterans, and PSP between the ages of 18 and 70 with symptoms of PTSD were recruited across Ontario, Canada between October 2017 and August 2019. Participants were randomized to either the waitlist (WL) (n = 18) or the GMT (n = 22) condition. Participants in both conditions received self-report measures and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Following their completion of the 3-month follow-up, participants in the WL condition were given the opportunity to participate in GMT. Assessors and participants were blind to intervention allocation during the initial assessment. A series of 2 (time) &amp;amp;times; 2 (group) ANOVAs were conducted to assess the differences between the WL and GMT conditions from pre- to post-intervention for the self-report and neuropsychological measures. The results demonstrated significant improvements in measures of executive functioning (e.g., verbal fluency, planning, impulsivity, cognitive shifting, and discrimination of targets) and trending improvements in short-term declarative memory for participants in the GMT condition. Participants in the GMT condition also demonstrated significant improvements from pre- to post-testing in measures of subjective cognition, functioning, PTSD symptom severity, difficulties with ER, dissociative symptom severity, and depression and anxiety symptoms. No adverse effects were reported as a result of participating in GMT. The results of this pilot RCT show promise that GMT may be a useful intervention to improve symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, symptoms of PTSD, and symptoms associated with PTSD within military personnel, veterans, and PSP. Future work is needed to address the small sample size and the durability of these findings.</p>

	<p>Patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) can improve some non-motor symptoms (NMS) after starting treatment with opicapone. The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of opicapone on global NMS burden in PD. OPEN-PD (Opicapone Effectiveness on Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease) is a prospective open-label single-arm study conducted in 5 centers from Spain. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline (V0) to the end of the observational period (6 months &amp;amp;plusmn; 30 days) (V2) in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) total score. Different scales were used for analyzing the change in motor, NMS, quality of life (QoL), and disability. Thirty-three patients were included between JUL/2019 and JUN/2021 (age 63.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.91; 60.6% males; 7.48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.22 years from symptoms onset). At 6 months, 30 patients completed the follow-up (90.9%). The NMSS total score was reduced by 27.3% (from 71.67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 37.12 at V0 to 52.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 34.76 at V2; Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size = &amp;amp;minus;0.97; p = 0.002). By domains, improvement was observed in sleep/fatigue (&amp;amp;minus;40.1%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), mood/apathy (&amp;amp;minus;46.6%; p = 0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms (&amp;amp;minus;20.7%; p = 0.029), and miscellaneous (&amp;amp;minus;44.94%; p = 0.021). QoL also improved with a 18.4% reduction in the 39-item Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire Summary Index (from 26.67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 17.61 at V0 to 21.75 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.9 at V2; p = 0.001). A total of 13 adverse events in 11 patients (33.3%) were reported, 1 of which was severe (not related to opicapone). Dyskinesias and nausea were the most frequent (6.1%). Opicapone is well tolerated and improves global NMS burden and QoL in PD patients at 6 months.</p>

	<p>Eating disorders (EDs) are serious, life-threatening psychiatric conditions associated with physical and psychosocial impairment, as well as high morbidity and mortality. Given the chronic refractory nature of EDs and the paucity of evidence-based treatments, there is a pressing need to identify novel approaches for this population. The noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonist, ketamine, has recently been approved for treatment-resistant depression, exerting rapid and robust antidepressant effects. It is now being investigated for several new indications, including obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive, post-traumatic, and substance use disorder, and shows transdiagnostic potential for EDs, particularly among clinical nonresponders. Hence, the aim of this review is to examine contemporary findings on the treatment of EDs with ketamine, whether used as a primary, adjunctive, or combination psychopharmacotherapy. Avenues for future research are also discussed. Overall, results are encouraging and point to therapeutic value; however, are limited to case series and reports on anorexia nervosa. Further empirical research is thus needed to explore ketamine efficacy across ED subgroups, establish safety profiles and optimize dosing, and develop theory-driven, targeted treatment strategies at the individual patient level.</p>

	<p>Background: The locus coeruleus (LC) plays a critical role in modulating emotional memory performance via widespread connections to the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Interestingly, both the LC and MTL are affected during aging. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether worry during cognitive aging changes the relationship between memory performance and the neural activity patterns during an emotional memory task. Methods: Twenty-eight participants aged 60&amp;amp;ndash;83 years from the Maastricht Aging study conducted an emotional mnemonic discrimination task during a 7T fMRI-scan. We performed a robust multiple linear regression to examine the association between worry and mnemonic memory performance under different levels of arousal. Subsequently, we examined if worry modifies the relationship between neuronal activity and mnemonic memory performance. Results: We observed that under low arousal, only participants with low compared to high levels of worry benefitted from additional LC activity. Under high arousal, additional LC activity was associated with lower mnemonic memory performance. Conclusion: Our results suggest there might be an optimal involvement of the NA-system for optimal memory discrimination performance, as we observed that under low levels of worry and with lower levels of arousal, higher LC activity might be needed to achieve similar levels of optimal memory performance as achieved under higher arousal when LC activity remained lower.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is a common brain disorder characterized by a heterogenous etiology. Its main features are recurrent seizures. Despite many clinical studies, about 30% of cases are refractory to treatment. Recent studies suggested the important role of immune-system elements in its pathogenesis. It was suggested that a deregulated inflammatory process may lead to aberrant neural connectivity and the hyperexcitability of the neuronal network. The aim of our study was the analysis of the expression of inflammatory mediators in a mouse model of epilepsy and their impact on the neurodegeneration process located in the brain. We used the KA-induced model of epilepsy in SJL/J mice and performed the analysis of gene expression and protein levels. We observed the upregulation of IL1&amp;amp;beta; and CXCL12 in the early phase of KA-induced epilepsy and elevated levels of CCL5 at a later time point, compared with control animals. The most important result obtained in our study is the elevation of CXCL2 expression at both studied time points and its correlation with the neurodegeneration observed in mouse brain. Increasing experimental and clinical data suggest the influence of peripheral inflammation on epileptogenesis. Thus, studies focused on the molecular markers of neuroinflammation are of great value and may help deepen our knowledge about epilepsy, leading to the discovery of new drugs.</p>

                <p>Understanding the human brain is a "Grand Challenge" for 21st century research. Computational approaches enable large and complex datasets to be addressed efficiently, supported by artificial neural networks, modeling and simulation. Dynamic generative multiscale models, which enable the investigation of causation across scales and are guided by principles and theories of brain function, are instrumental for linking brain structure and function. An example of a resource enabling such an integrated approach to neuroscientific discovery is the BigBrain, which spatially anchors tissue models and data across different scales and ensures that multiscale models are supported by the data, making the bridge to both basic neuroscience and medicine. Research at the intersection of neuroscience, computing and robotics has the potential to advance neuro-inspired technologies by taking advantage of a growing body of insights into perception, plasticity and learning. To render data, tools and methods, theories, basic principles and concepts interoperable, the Human Brain Project (HBP) has launched EBRAINS, a digital neuroscience research infrastructure, which brings together a transdisciplinary community of researchers united by the quest to understand the brain, with fascinating insights and perspectives for societal benefits.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Here, we reveal an unbiased view of the brain regions that provide specific inputs to aromatase-expressing cells in the medial amygdala, neurons that play an outsized role in the production of sex-specific social behaviors, using rabies tracing and light sheet microscopy. While the downstream projections from these cells are known, the specific inputs to the aromatase-expressing cells in the medial amygdala remained unknown. We observed established connections to the medial amygdala (e.g., bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and accessory olfactory bulb) indicating that aromatase neurons are a major target cell type for efferent input including from regions associated with parenting and aggression. We also identified novel and unexpected inputs from areas involved in metabolism, fear and anxiety, and memory and cognition. These results confirm the central role of the medial amygdala in sex-specific social recognition and social behavior, and point to an expanded role for its aromatase-expressing neurons in the integration of multiple sensory and homeostatic factors, which are likely used to modulate many other social behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Individualized Assays of Temporal Coding in the Ascending Human Auditory System</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neural phase-locking to temporal fluctuations is a fundamental and unique mechanism by which acoustic information is encoded by the auditory system. The perceptual role of this metabolically expensive mechanism, the neural phase-locking to temporal fine structure (TFS) in particular, is debated. Although hypothesized, it is unclear whether auditory perceptual deficits in certain clinical populations are attributable to deficits in TFS coding. Efforts to uncover the role of TFS have been impeded by the fact that there are no established assays for quantifying the fidelity of TFS coding at the individual level. While many candidates have been proposed, for an assay to be useful, it should not only intrinsically depend on TFS coding, but should also have the property that individual differences in the assay reflect TFS coding per se over and beyond other sources of variance. Here, we evaluate a range of behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based measures as candidate individualized measures of TFS sensitivity. Our comparisons of behavioral and EEG-based metrics suggest that extraneous variables dominate both behavioral scores and EEG amplitude metrics, rendering them ineffective. After adjusting behavioral scores using lapse rates, and extracting latency or percent-growth metrics from EEG, interaural timing sensitivity measures exhibit robust behavior-EEG correlations. Together with the fact that unambiguous theoretical links can be made relating binaural measures and phase-locking to TFS, our results suggest that these "adjusted" binaural assays may be well suited for quantifying individual TFS processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Pupil Correlates of Decision Variables in Mice Playing a Competitive Mixed-Strategy Game</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a competitive game involving an animal and an opponent, the outcome is contingent on the choices of both players. To succeed, the animal must continually adapt to competitive pressure, or else risk being exploited and lose out on rewards. In this study, we demonstrate that head-fixed male mice can be trained to play the iterative competitive game "matching pennies" against a virtual computer opponent. We find that the animals&rsquo; performance is well described by a hybrid computational model that includes Q-learning and choice kernels. Comparing between matching pennies and a non-competitive two-armed bandit task, we show that the tasks encourage animals to operate at different regimes of reinforcement learning. To understand the involvement of neuromodulatory mechanisms, we measure fluctuations in pupil size and use multiple linear regression to relate the trial-by-trial transient pupil responses to decision-related variables. The analysis reveals that pupil responses are modulated by observable variables, including choice and outcome, as well as latent variables for value updating, but not action selection. Collectively, these results establish a paradigm for studying competitive decision-making in head-fixed mice and provide insights into the role of arousal-linked neuromodulation in the decision process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Intrinsic Sources and Functional Impacts of Asymmetry at Electrical Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Electrical synapses couple inhibitory neurons across the brain, underlying a variety of functions that are modifiable by activity. Despite recent advances, many functions and contributions of electrical synapses within neural circuitry remain underappreciated. Among these are the sources and impacts of electrical synapse asymmetry. Using multi-compartmental models of neurons coupled through dendritic electrical synapses, we investigated intrinsic factors that contribute to effective synaptic asymmetry and that result in modulation of spike timing and synchrony between coupled cells. We show that electrical synapse location along a dendrite, input resistance, internal dendritic resistance, or directional conduction of the electrical synapse itself each alter asymmetry as measured by coupling between cell somas. Conversely, we note that asymmetrical gap junction (GJ) conductance can be masked by each of these properties. Furthermore, we show that asymmetry modulates spike timing and latency of coupled cells by up to tens of milliseconds, depending on direction of conduction or dendritic location of the electrical synapse. Coordination of rhythmic activity between two cells also depends on asymmetry. These simulations illustrate that causes of asymmetry are diverse, may not be apparent in somatic measurements of electrical coupling, influence dendritic processing, and produce a variety of outcomes on spiking and synchrony of coupled cells. Our findings highlight aspects of electrical synapses that should always be included in experimental demonstrations of coupling, and when assembling simulated networks containing electrical synapses.</p>

                Background: High corn production and consumption in Indonesia have led to massive corn husk waste. To increase the economic value of corn husk waste, innovations have utilized its silica content as an alternative source for the synthesis of multifunctional silica compounds. Methods: In this research, silica xerogel was successfully synthesized from corn husk via the sol-gel method. Its physical properties and capabilities as an adsorbent to remove cationic dyes such as crystal violet and methylene blue in wastewater were investigated for the first time. Results: The as-synthesized silica xerogel possesses an amorphous crystal structure with an average pore diameter of 6.35 nm, a Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface area of 363.72 m2/g, and particle size ranging from 80 to 250 μm. The optimum contact times of silica xerogel are 90 minutes for crystal violet and 120 minutes for methylene blue adsorptions. While at the same time, the dye removal efficiencies are as high as 98.539% and 96.184%, respectively. The adsorption of both crystal violet and methylene blue on silica xerogel follows the Langmuir isotherm model and exhibits a high monolayer capacity of 69.44 mg/g and 59.17 mg/g, respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest the great potential of silica xerogel synthesized from corn husk as a low-cost and effective cationic dye adsorbent.

                Background: Schizophrenia has a broad range of interrelated symptoms and impairment in functioning. The objective of the study was to explore the interplay between positive symptoms, negative symptoms, neurocognition, social cognition and functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia using network analysis. Methods: Participants were 64 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia. Psychopathologic, neurocognition, social cognition, and functional outcome were measured using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III, Faces test, Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, and Personal Social Performance scale. Results: The network analysis suggested that functional outcome was the most central in the network followed by avolition and asociality. Functioning was directly connected to avolition, asociality, blunted affect, neurocognition and emotion recognition. The positive symptoms were the most remote and therefore the least important node. Conclusion: The high centrality of functioning suggests the need for improving of everyday life skills for patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, treatment of specific negative symptoms, neurocognition and emotion recognition could also enhance functional outcome.

                Background: The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in the Elderly defined sarcopenia as a geriatric syndrome with a diagnostic criteria of low skeletal muscle mass (LMM). Various sarcopenia consensuses recommend as cut-offs for LMM, the use of below 2 SDs from the mean skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) of a young reference group. Given the contrast between reported cut-offs, the objective of this study was to establish cut-offs for LMM from older adults in Manizales and compare them with those published in the literature. Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional analytical study in 237 healthy elderly patients from the city of Manizales, Colombia. Anthropometric measurements of weight, height and body mass index were estimated. The SMI was estimated with the Xitron Technologies bioimpedance meter using the Janssen formula. For the comparison of SMI cut-offs, studies that evaluated this parameter with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were taken into account, in addition to being obtained from the −2 SD from the sex-specific mean of a young reference group. Results: The cut-off points for SMI were 8.0 kg/m2 for men and 6.1 kg/m2 for women. There was a statistically significant difference when evaluating LMM from the cut-offs of the present study and those reported in Spain, Turkey, and Finland. The cut-off points of SMI derived from this sample of Colombian men and women may be adequate for the diagnosis in the Colombian geriatric population. However, we did not find significant differences when comparing the cut-offs for SMI from a population of older adults and young adults from the same city. Conclusions: The cut-off points of SMI by BIA derived from a sample of Colombian men and women may be adequate for the diagnosis of LMM in the Colombian geriatric population or populations with similar characteristics to those of the sample evaluated here.

                Background: The oral administration of L-arginine has been related to improved physical performance due to a likely reduction in muscle fatigue, resulting from the vasodilator effect of nitric oxide on skeletal muscle. However, there is no precise and quantitative analysis of the information in the literature. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training with a systematic review and meta-analysis. We hypothesized that L-arginine supplementation would improve performance capacity and the effects involved in strength training. Methods: The study period was from 2010 to 2020. The inclusion process established articles with well-designed human experiments that included only L-arginine supplementation (without any additional compounds) testing the effects of L-arginine supplementation on sports performance related to strength training; identical experimental conditions in placebo or control group; and publications in the last ten years (until December 31, 2020). Three studies were included that compared L-arginine supplementation with placebo in anaerobic performance tests. Test analysis supplementation with other supplements was removed and there was no gender, age, and ethnicity level. Results: There was no significant heterogeneity (p>0.05) in the analysis of the three selected articles and the effects of L-arginine supplementation in muscular endurance; performance had a mean of 0.26 (95% CI = -0.129; 0.649; p = 0.190), peak torque with a mean of -0.002 (95% CI = -0.531; 0.527; p = 0. 99) of the third series of exercises and, furthermore, when comparing the integrated effect (resistance rate with the peak torque) there was no difference with a mean of 0.168 (95% CI = -0.145; 0.481; p = 0.292). Conclusions: Acute L-arginine supplementation provides no ergogenic effect on strength training performance.

                Background: A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was associated with a newly identified respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across the globe, imposing increased working hours and workloads for healthcare workers. We have evaluated the prevalence of mental health outcomes and associated factors in house staff physicians in Panama. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken from July 23, 2020, to August 13, 2020. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants. Then, an electronic questionnaire with scales to evaluate anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and post-traumatic stress (IES-R) was administered. In addition, socio-demographic variables, clinical history of mental disorders and COVID-19 exposure were evaluated. Independent analyses for each mental health outcome were undertaken using a logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 517/1,205 (42.9%) interns and residents were recruited nationwide. The overall prevalence of depression symptoms was 25.3%, 13.7% for anxiety and 12.2% for post-traumatic stress. At least 9.3% participants reported having suicidal ideation. The most parsimonious model showed females had a higher prevalence of mental health disorders across results, and married participants were more likely to present depression (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.03-2.91; P = 0.039) or at least one mental health disorder (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.03-2.68; P = 0.039). Conclusions: A high prevalence of mental health disorders was found, showing the need to mitigate this emotional burden among healthcare workers in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background Depression is a global public health problem. Studies show comorbid depression increases morbidity, mortality, and associated risk of poor adherence compared to those without depression. Materials and Method An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 326 patients who met the inclusion criteria. They were selected following simple random sampling from medical OPD and ward of Shree Birendra Hospital Kathmandu, Nepal.  Semi-structured interview schedule (SSIS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Kuppuswamy’s Scale (KS) were used for data collection. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 26 and STATA version 15. Simple frequency distribution of attributes presented in tables and association assessed using Chi-square/ Fisher’s exact test. Further, the relation between depression and other independent factors is quantified using multivariate/ multivariable logistics regression analyses. Result Using Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) as a tool to determine depression 52.1% (n=170) had minimal or no depression, 16.9% (n=55) had mild depression, 18.7 %( n=61) had moderate depression and 12.3% (n=40) had severe depression i.e. 47.9% of population had some form of depression. Prevalence of depression among patient with single comorbidity found to be 30.9% (n=25, N=81) for hypertension, 43.3% (n=13, N=30) for diabetes mellitus, 45.6% (n=31, N=68) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 77.5% (n=31, N=40) for chronic kidney disease, and 60 %( n=9, N=15) for chronic heart disease. Depression among patient with multiple comorbidities (more than one disease above mention) was found to be 51.1% (n=47, N=92). Prevalence of depression was more among patients with history of longer duration of illness; 11 years and above 52.9 % (n=36, N=68); 6-10 years 48.3 % (n=43, N=89); 1-5 years 45.6 %( n=77, N=169). Conclusion This study showed that the prevalence of depression has a significant relationship with the duration of illness. Therefore, early recognition and treatment play a crucial role in reducing the effects of depression.

                The term “noetic” comes from the Greek word noēsis/noētikos that means inner wisdom, direct knowing, intuition, or implicit understanding. Strong cultural taboos exist about sharing these experiences. Thus, many may not feel comfortable transparently discussing or researching these topics, despite growing evidence that these experiences may be real. The study’s objective was to qualitatively evaluate first-hand accounts of noetic experiences. 521 English-speaking adults from around the world completed an online survey that collected demographic data and four open-ended questions about noetic experiences. Thematic analysis was used to characterize the data. The ten most used codes were expressing to or sharing with others, impacting decision-making, intuition/”just knowing,” meditation/hypnosis, inner visions, setting intentions/getting into the “state,” healing others, writing for self, and inner voice. There were five main themes identified: 1. Ways of Engagement; 2. Ways of Knowing; 3. Types of Information; 4. Ways of Affecting; and 5. Ways of Expressing. Subthemes. Future research will include investigating the nuances of these themes and also establishing standardized methods for evaluating them. This would also then inform curricula and therapies to support people in these experiences.

                Background: Protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency (VAD) are the most important public health issues, and a food-based strategy is crucial to combat those health problems among the vulnerable group of people. Methods: Composite biscuits were made with 100:0:0, 90:5:5, 80:10:10, 70:15:15, 60:20:20, and 50:25:25 percent wheat, haricot bean, and orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) flours.Standard methods were used to evaluate the proximate compositions, β-carotene, physical properties, functional properties, and sensory acceptability. A one-way analysis of variance model was used to statistically evaluate the data using the statistical analysis system software package, version 9.0 standard methods. Results: The results showed that partially replacing wheat with haricot beans and OFSP increased the β-carotene and proximate compositions significantly. When wheat was replaced with haricot beans and OFSP, the physical characteristics of the biscuits did not vary significantly from those of biscuits made entirely of wheat flour. Sensory acceptability (appearance, color, flavor, taste and overall acceptability) was higher in the composite biscuits with up to 40% wheat substitution than in the 100% wheat flour biscuits. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this report, replacing wheat with OFSP and haricot beans in biscuit formulation appears to be promising in improving nutritional quality, sensory acceptability, and beta carotene. It is proposed that these products can mitigate food insecurity and deficiency of vitamin A.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The ability to classify patients based on gene-expression data varies by algorithm and performance metric</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephen R. Piccolo, Avery Mecham, Nathan P. Golightly, Jérémie L. Johnson, Dustin B. Miller</p>

By classifying patients into subgroups, clinicians can provide more effective care than using a uniform approach for all patients. Such subgroups might include patients with a particular disease subtype, patients with a good (or poor) prognosis, or patients most (or least) likely to respond to a particular therapy. Transcriptomic measurements reflect the downstream effects of genomic and epigenomic variations. However, high-throughput technologies generate thousands of measurements per patient, and complex dependencies exist among genes, so it may be infeasible to classify patients using traditional statistical models. Machine-learning classification algorithms can help with this problem. However, hundreds of classification algorithms exist—and most support diverse hyperparameters—so it is difficult for researchers to know which are optimal for gene-expression biomarkers. We performed a benchmark comparison, applying 52 classification algorithms to 50 gene-expression datasets (143 class variables). We evaluated algorithms that represent diverse machine-learning methodologies and have been implemented in general-purpose, open-source, machine-learning libraries. When available, we combined clinical predictors with gene-expression data. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of performing hyperparameter optimization and feature selection using nested cross validation. Kernel- and ensemble-based algorithms consistently outperformed other types of classification algorithms; however, even the top-performing algorithms performed poorly in some cases. Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection typically improved predictive performance, and univariate feature-selection algorithms typically outperformed more sophisticated methods. Together, our findings illustrate that algorithm performance varies considerably when other factors are held constant and thus that algorithm selection is a critical step in biomarker studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating genetic variance contributed by a quantitative trait locus: A random model approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shibo Wang, Fangjie Xie, Shizhong Xu</p>

Detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) and estimating QTL variances (represented by the squared QTL effects) are two main goals of QTL mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, there are issues associated with estimated QTL variances and such issues have not attracted much attention from the QTL mapping community. Estimated QTL variances are usually biased upwards due to estimation being associated with significance tests. The phenomenon is called the Beavis effect. However, estimated variances of QTL without significance tests can also be biased upwards, which cannot be explained by the Beavis effect; rather, this bias is due to the fact that QTL variances are often estimated as the squares of the estimated QTL effects. The parameters are the QTL effects and the estimated QTL variances are obtained by squaring the estimated QTL effects. This square transformation failed to incorporate the errors of estimated QTL effects into the transformation. The consequence is biases in estimated QTL variances. To correct the biases, we can either reformulate the QTL model by treating the QTL effect as random and directly estimate the QTL variance (as a variance component) or adjust the bias by taking into account the error of the estimated QTL effect. A moment method of estimation has been proposed to correct the bias. The method has been validated via Monte Carlo simulation studies. The method has been applied to QTL mapping for the 10-week-body-weight trait from an F<sub>2</sub> mouse population.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterization of intrinsically disordered regions in proteins informed by human genetic diversity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shehab S. Ahmed, Zaara T. Rifat, Ruchi Lohia, Arthur J. Campbell, A. Keith Dunker, M. Sohel Rahman, Sumaiya Iqbal</p>

All proteomes contain both proteins and polypeptide segments that don’t form a defined three-dimensional structure yet are biologically active—called intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDPs and IDRs). Most of these IDPs/IDRs lack useful functional annotation limiting our understanding of their importance for organism fitness. Here we characterized IDRs using protein sequence annotations of functional sites and regions available in the UniProt knowledgebase (“UniProt features”: active site, ligand-binding pocket, regions mediating protein-protein interactions, etc.). By measuring the statistical enrichment of twenty-five UniProt features in 981 IDRs of 561 human proteins, we identified eight features that are commonly located in IDRs. We then collected the genetic variant data from the general population and patient-based databases and evaluated the prevalence of population and pathogenic variations in IDPs/IDRs. We observed that some IDRs tolerate 2 to 12-times more single amino acid-substituting missense mutations than synonymous changes in the general population. However, we also found that 37% of all germline pathogenic mutations are located in disordered regions of 96 proteins. Based on the observed-to-expected frequency of mutations, we categorized 34 IDRs in 20 proteins (DDX3X, KIT, RB1, etc.) as intolerant to mutation. Finally, using statistical analysis and a machine learning approach, we demonstrate that mutation-intolerant IDRs carry a distinct signature of functional features. Our study presents a novel approach to assign functional importance to IDRs by leveraging the wealth of available genetic data, which will aid in a deeper understating of the role of IDRs in biological processes and disease mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep inference of seabird dives from GPS-only records: Performance and generalization properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amédée Roy, Sophie Lanco Bertrand, Ronan Fablet</p>

At-sea behaviour of seabirds have received significant attention in ecology over the last decades as it is a key process in the ecology and fate of these populations. It is also, through the position of top predator that these species often occupy, a relevant and integrative indicator of the dynamics of the marine ecosystems they rely on. Seabird trajectories are recorded through the deployment of GPS, and a variety of statistical approaches have been tested to infer probable behaviours from these location data. Recently, deep learning tools have shown promising results for the segmentation and classification of animal behaviour from trajectory data. Yet, these approaches have not been widely used and investigation is still needed to identify optimal network architecture and to demonstrate their generalization properties. From a database of about 300 foraging trajectories derived from GPS data deployed simultaneously with pressure sensors for the identification of dives, this work has benchmarked deep neural network architectures trained in a supervised manner for the prediction of dives from trajectory data. It first confirms that deep learning allows better dive prediction than usual methods such as Hidden Markov Models. It also demonstrates the generalization properties of the trained networks for inferring dives distribution for seabirds from other colonies and ecosystems. In particular, convolutional networks trained on Peruvian boobies from a specific colony show great ability to predict dives of boobies from other colonies and from distinct ecosystems. We further investigate accross-species generalization using a transfer learning strategy known as ‘fine-tuning’. Starting from a convolutional network pre-trained on Guanay cormorant data reduced by two the size of the dataset needed to accurately predict dives in a tropical booby from Brazil. We believe that the networks trained in this study will provide relevant starting point for future fine-tuning works for seabird trajectory segmentation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Automatic wound detection and size estimation using deep learning algorithms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Héctor Carrión, Mohammad Jafari, Michelle Dawn Bagood, Hsin-ya Yang, Roslyn Rivkah Isseroff, Marcella Gomez</p>

Evaluating and tracking wound size is a fundamental metric for the wound assessment process. Good location and size estimates can enable proper diagnosis and effective treatment. Traditionally, laboratory wound healing studies include a collection of images at uniform time intervals exhibiting the wounded area and the healing process in the test animal, often a mouse. These images are then manually observed to determine key metrics —such as wound size progress— relevant to the study. However, this task is a time-consuming and laborious process. In addition, defining the wound edge could be subjective and can vary from one individual to another even among experts. Furthermore, as our understanding of the healing process grows, so does our need to efficiently and accurately track these key factors for high throughput (e.g., over large-scale and long-term experiments). Thus, in this study, we develop a deep learning-based image analysis pipeline that aims to intake non-uniform wound images and extract relevant information such as the location of interest, wound only image crops, and wound periphery size over-time metrics. In particular, our work focuses on images of wounded laboratory mice that are used widely for translationally relevant wound studies and leverages a commonly used ring-shaped splint present in most images to predict wound size. We apply the method to a dataset that was never meant to be quantified and, thus, presents many visual challenges. Additionally, the data set was not meant for training deep learning models and so is relatively small in size with only 256 images. We compare results to that of expert measurements and demonstrate preservation of information relevant to predicting wound closure despite variability from machine-to-expert and even expert-to-expert. The proposed system resulted in high fidelity results on unseen data with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, the pipeline estimates acceptable wound sizes when less than 50% of the images are missing reference objects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automated human chromosome segmentation and feature extraction: Current trends and prospects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Automated human chromosome segmentation and feature extraction aim to improve the overall quality of genetic disorder diagnosis by addressing the limitations of tedious manual processes such as expertise dependence, time-inefficiency, observer variability and fatigue errors. Nevertheless, significant differences caused by staining methods, chromosome damage which may occur during imaging, cell and staining debris, inhomogeneity, weak boundaries, morphological variations, premature sister chromatid separation, as well as the presence of overlapping, touching, di-centric and bent chromosomes pose challenges in automated human chromosome segmentation and feature extraction. This review paper extensively discusses how the approaches presented in literature have addressed these challenges, and their strengths and limitations. Human chromosome segmentation algorithms are presented under four broad categories; thresholding, clustering, active contours and convex-concave points-based methods. Chromosome feature extraction methods are discussed under two main categories based on banding-pattern and geometry. In addition, new insights for the improvement of fully automated karyotyping are provided.

                Perception and cognition require the integration of feedforward sensory information with feedback signals. Using different sized stimuli, we isolate spectral signatures of feedforward and feedback signals, and their effect on communication between layers in primary visual cortex of male macaque monkeys. Small stimuli elicited gamma frequency oscillations predominantly in the superficial layers. These Granger-causally originated in upper layer 4 and lower supragranular layers. Unexpectedly, large stimuli generated strong narrow band gamma oscillatory activity across cortical layers. They Granger-causally arose in layer 5, were conveyed through layer six to superficial layers, and violated existing models of feedback spectral signatures. Equally surprising, with large stimuli, alpha band oscillatory activity arose predominantly in granular and supragranular layers and communicated in a feedforward direction. Thus, oscillations in specific frequency bands are dynamically modulated to serve feedback and feedforward communication and are not restricted to specific cortical layers in V1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A saturation-mutagenesis analysis of the interplay between stability and activation in Ras</a></h4>

              
                Cancer mutations in Ras occur predominantly at three hotspots: Gly 12, Gly 13, and Gln 61. Previously, we reported that deep mutagenesis of H-Ras using a bacterial assay identified many other activating mutations (Bandaru et al., 2017). We now show that the results of saturation mutagenesis of H-Ras in mammalian Ba/F3 cells correlate well with the results of bacterial experiments in which H-Ras or K-Ras are co-expressed with a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The prominent cancer hotspots are not dominant in the Ba/F3 data. We used the bacterial system to mutagenize Ras constructs of different stabilities and discovered a feature that distinguishes the cancer hotspots. While mutations at the cancer hotspots activate Ras regardless of construct stability, mutations at lower-frequency sites (e.g. at Val 14 or Asp 119) can be activating or deleterious, depending on the stability of the Ras construct. We characterized the dynamics of three non-hotspot activating Ras mutants by using NMR to monitor hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). These mutations result in global increases in HDX rates, consistent with destabilization of Ras. An explanation for these observations is that mutations that destabilize Ras increase nucleotide dissociation rates, enabling activation by spontaneous nucleotide exchange. A further stability decrease can lead to insufficient levels of folded Ras – and subsequent loss of function. In contrast, the cancer hotspot mutations are mechanism-based activators of Ras that interfere directly with the action of GAPs. Our results demonstrate the importance of GAP surveillance and protein stability in determining the sensitivity of Ras to mutational activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Progressive axonopathy when oligodendrocytes lack the myelin protein CMTM5</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes facilitate rapid impulse propagation along the axons they myelinate and support their long-term integrity. However, the functional relevance of many myelin proteins has remained unknown. Here, we find that expression of the tetraspan-transmembrane protein CMTM5 (chemokine-like factor-like MARVEL-transmembrane domain containing protein 5) is highly enriched in oligodendrocytes and central nervous system (CNS) myelin. Genetic disruption of the <i>Cmtm5</i> gene in oligodendrocytes of mice does not impair the development or ultrastructure of CNS myelin. However, oligodendroglial <i>Cmtm5</i> deficiency causes an early-onset progressive axonopathy, which we also observe in global and tamoxifen-induced oligodendroglial <i>Cmtm5</i> mutants. Presence of the <i>Wld<sup>S</sup></i> mutation ameliorates the axonopathy, implying a Wallerian degeneration-like pathomechanism. These results indicate that CMTM5 is involved in the function of oligodendrocytes to maintain axonal integrity rather than myelin biogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Leading edge maintenance in migrating cells is an emergent property of branched actin network growth</a></h4>

              
                Animal cell migration is predominantly driven by the coordinated, yet stochastic, polymerization of thousands of nanometer-scale actin filaments across micron-scale cell leading edges. It remains unclear how such inherently noisy processes generate robust cellular behavior. We employed high-speed imaging of migrating neutrophil-like HL-60 cells to explore the fine-scale shape fluctuations that emerge and relax throughout the process of leading edge maintenance. We then developed a minimal stochastic model of the leading edge that reproduces this stable relaxation behavior. Remarkably, we find lamellipodial stability <i>naturally</i> <i>emerges</i> from the interplay between branched actin network growth and leading edge shape - with no additional feedback required - based on a synergy between membrane-proximal branching and lateral spreading of filaments. These results thus demonstrate a novel biological noise-suppression mechanism based entirely on system geometry. Furthermore, our model suggests that the Arp2/3-mediated ~70‑80º branching angle optimally smooths lamellipodial shape, addressing its long-mysterious conservation from protists to mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contextual control of conditioned pain tolerance and endogenous analgesic systems</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain are unclear but may involve the persistence or strengthening of pain memories acquired in part through associative learning. Contextual cues, which comprise the environment in which events occur, were recently described as a critical regulator of pain memory; both male rodents and humans exhibit increased pain sensitivity in environments recently associated with a single painful experience. It is unknown, however, how repeated exposure to an acute painful unconditioned stimulus in a distinct context modifies pain sensitivity or the expectation of pain in that environment. To answer this question, we conditioned mice to associate distinct contexts with either repeated administration of a mild visceral pain stimulus (intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid) or vehicle injection over the course of three days. On the final day of experiments animals received either an acid injection or vehicle injection prior to being placed into both contexts. In this way, contextual control of pain sensitivity and pain expectation could be tested respectively. When re-exposed to the noxious stimulus in a familiar environment, both male and female mice exhibited context-dependent conditioned analgesia, a phenomenon mediated by endogenous opioid signaling. However, when expecting the presentation of a painful stimulus in a given context, males exhibited conditioned hypersensitivity whereas females exhibited endogenous opioid-mediated conditioned analgesia. These results are evidence that pain perception and engagement of endogenous opioid systems can be modified through their psychological association with environmental cues. Successful determination of the brain circuits involved in this sexually dimorphic anticipatory response may allow for the manipulation of pain memories, which may contribute to the development of chronic pain states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NLGC: Network Localized Granger Causality with Application to MEG Directional Functional Connectivity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the causal relationships that underlie networked activity between different cortical areas is critical for understanding the neural mechanisms behind sensory processing. Granger causality (GC) is widely used for this purpose in functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis, but there the temporal resolution is low, making it difficult to capture the millisecond-scale interactions underlying sensory processing. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has millisecond resolution, but only provides low-dimensional sensor-level linear mixtures of neural sources, which makes GC inference challenging. Conventional methods proceed in two stages: First, cortical sources are estimated from MEG using a source localization technique, followed by GC inference among the estimated sources. However, the spatiotemporal biases in estimating sources propagate into the subsequent GC analysis stage, resulting in both false alarms and missing true GC links. Here, we introduce the Network Localized Granger Causality (NLGC) inference paradigm, which models the source dynamics as latent sparse multivariate autoregressive processes and estimates their parameters directly from the MEG measurements, without intermediate source localization, and employs the resulting parameter estimates to produce a precise statistical characterization of the detected GC links. We offer several theoretical and algorithmic innovations within NLGC and further examine its utility via comprehensive simulations and application to MEG data from an auditory task involving tone processing from both younger and older participants. Our simulation studies reveal that NLGC is markedly robust with respect to model mismatch, network size, and low signal-to-noise ratio, whereas the conventional two-stage methods result in high false alarms and mis-detections. We also demonstrate the advantages of NLGC in revealing the cortical network-level characterization of neural activity during tone processing and resting state by delineating task- and age-related connectivity changes.
