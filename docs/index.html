              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A cellular and molecular atlas reveals the basis of chytrid development</a></h4>

              
                The chytrids (phylum Chytridiomycota) are a major fungal lineage of ecological and evolutionary importance. Despite their importance, many fundamental aspects of chytrid developmental and cell biology remain poorly understood. To address these knowledge gaps, we combined quantitative volume electron microscopy and comparative transcriptome profiling to create an ‘atlas’ of the cellular and molecular basis of the chytrid life cycle, using the model chytrid <i>Rhizoclosmatium globosum</i>. From our developmental atlas, we describe the transition from the transcriptionally inactive free-swimming zoospore to the more biologically complex germling, and show that lipid processing is multifaceted and dynamic throughout the life cycle. We demonstrate that the chytrid apophysis is a compartmentalised site of high intracellular trafficking, linking the feeding/attaching rhizoids to the reproductive zoosporangium, and constituting division of labour in the chytrid cell plan. We provide evidence that during zoosporogenesis, zoospores display amoeboid morphologies and exhibit endocytotic cargo transport from the interstitial maternal cytoplasm. Taken together, our results reveal insights into chytrid developmental biology and provide a basis for future investigations into non-dikaryan fungal cell biology.

	<p>To test the ability of different entropy measures to classify patients with different conditions of chronic disorder of consciousness, we applied the Lempel&amp;amp;ndash;Ziv complexity, the amplitude coalition entropy (ACE), and the synchrony coalition entropy (SCE) to the EEG signals recorded in 32 patients, clinically evaluated using the coma recovery scale revised (CRS-R). All the entropy measures indicated that differences found in the theta and alpha bands can distinguish patients in a minimal consciousness state (MCS) with respect to those in a vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness state (VS/UWS). These differences were significant comparing the entropy measure performed on the anterior region of the left hemisphere and midline region. The values of theta-alpha entropy positively correlated with those of the CRS-R scores. Among the entropy measures, ACE most often highlighted significant differences. The higher values found in MCS were for the less impaired patients, according to their CRS-R, suggest that the preservation of signal entropy on the anterior region of the dominant hemisphere correlates with better preservation of consciousness, even in chronic conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of newspapers published in North Sumatra during Indonesia's independence struggle between 1916-1925: A discourse analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the history of Indonesian independence, newspapers not only functioned as a medium of information but also as a tool for the struggle for independence. This is because of the role of newspapers in bringing out the spirit of nationalism and the concept of “nation” to the Indonesian people through various writings and reports in each edition. This study aims to describe the form of Indonesia's struggle for independence in newspapers published in North Sumatra in 1916-1925. Methods: This research uses the critical discourse analysis method. The research data are in the form of texts published in thirteen indigenous newspapers published in North Sumatra in 1916-1925. Data analysis used three structures of Teun A. van Dijk's discourse analysis model, namely: macrostructure, superstructure, and microstructure. Results: From 1910-1925 there were 24 indigenous newspapers published in North Sumatra. Of these, there were 13 newspapers demanding Indonesian independence: Soeara Djawa, Pewarta Deli, Benih Merdeka, Perempoean Bergerak, Soeara Bondjol, Sinar Zaman, Orgaan Bataksche Studiefonds, Andalas, Mandailing, Warta Timur, Al Moektabas, Tjermin Karo, Soeara Batak. These newspapers published articles that fought for Indonesian independence by demanding Indonesian independence openly, criticizing various policies of the Dutch Colonial Government, and building awareness of Indonesian nationalism. Conclusion: The role of newspapers in the struggle for Indonesian independence in North Sumatra in 1916-1925 can be seen from the findings of 51 articles demanding Indonesia's independence from Dutch colonialism, criticizing the policies of the Dutch colonial government, and building the spirit of nationalism to encourage the Indonesian people to fight for their independence.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nothing to Cheer About: Endorsing  Imaginary Economic Evaluations and Value Claims with CHEERS 22 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                One of the more unfortunate features of health technology assessment is the tenacity with which leaders in the field and organizations such as the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) cling to an evaluation framework that fails to meet the standards of normal science. Believers subscribe to a meme that is clearly non-science (metaphysics and pseudoscience) and one that should have been discarded over 30 years ago. Certainly, subscribing to an impossible belief is not unusual; indeed it may make the belief that much stronger. Yet the meme is non-sustainable; it is also pointless as the economic evaluation claims are non-evaluable. There is no acknowledgement of the standards of normal science or the limitations imposed by the axioms of fundamental measurement. The purpose of this commentary is to make the case that the recent release of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 2022 (CHEERS 22) checklist is misleading; CHEERS 22 fails to address the manifest deficiencies in the approach to economic evaluations endorsed by ISPOR and ICER. Instead, it continues to promote economic evaluations in healthcare that invent evidence and non-empirically evaluable value claims. Given the widespread publicity that has accompanied the release of CHEERS 22, the purpose of this commentary is to detail the deficiencies in CHEERS 22 and propose an alternative framework for economic evaluation in health care to meet the information needs of formulary committees. This means abandoning the standards for economic evaluations that have dominated health technology assessment for 30 years, notably the key role assigned to the mathematically impossible quality adjusted life year (QALY). The proposed new start recommends single attribute evaluable value claims that meet ratio or interval measurement standards and are supported by evaluation protocols.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: High-grade anterior prostate cancer previously undetected by transrectal biopsy, diagnosed with MRI-US fusion transperineal robotic prostate biopsy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Seventy percent of anterior prostate cancer cases are diagnosed during rebiopsy. MRI-US fusion transperineal robotic prostate biopsy is an emerging diagnostic method and might be an effective one in diagnosing prostate cancers in difficult sites such as the anterior zone. We report a case of a high grade anterior prostate cancer previously undetected by transrectal biopsy, diagnosed with MRI-US fusion transperineal robotic prostate biopsy. This case report suggests that MRI-US fusion transperineal robotic prostate biopsy might be valuable in diagnosing prostate cancer especially in difficult sites – the anterior region in this case – and might be an imperative diagnostic method in suspicious cases with prior negative biopsy.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Distinct roles of rodent thalamus and corpus callosum in seizure generalization</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bilateral synchronous cortical activity occurs during sleep, attention, and seizures. Canonical models place the thalamus at the center of bilateral cortical synchronization because it generates bilateral sleep spindle oscillations and primarily generalized absence seizures. However, classical studies suggest that the corpus callosum mediates bilateral cortical synchronization.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We mapped the spread of right frontal lobe-onset, focal to bilateral seizures in mice and modified it using chemo and optogenetic suppression of motor thalamic nucleus and corpus callosotomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seizures from the right cortex spread faster to the left cortex than to the left thalamus. The two thalami have minimal monosynaptic commissural connections compared to the massive commissure corpus callosum. Chemogenetic and closed-loop optogenetic inhibition of the right ventrolateral thalamic nucleus did not alter inter-hemispheric seizure spread. However, anterior callosotomy delayed bilateral seizure oscillations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thalamocortical oscillations amplify focal onset motor seizures, and corpus callosum spreads them bilaterally.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MS‐driven metabolic alterations are recapitulated in iPSC‐derived astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes play a significant role in the pathology of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, for ethical reasons, most studies in these cells were performed using the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis model. As there are significant differences between human and mouse cells, we aimed here to better characterize astrocytes from patients with MS (PwMS), focusing mainly on mitochondrial function and cell metabolism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We obtained and characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes from three PwMS and three unaffected controls, and performed electron microscopy, flow cytometry, cytokine and glutamate measurements, gene expression, <i>in situ</i> respiration, and metabolomics. We validated our findings using a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We detected several differences in MS astrocytes including: (i) enrichment of genes associated with neurodegeneration, (ii) increased mitochondrial fission, (iii) increased production of superoxide and MS-related proinflammatory chemokines, (iv) impaired uptake and enhanced release of glutamate, (v) increased electron transport capacity and proton leak, in line with the increased oxidative stress, and (vi) a distinct metabolic profile, with a deficiency in amino acid catabolism and increased sphingolipid metabolism, which have already been linked to MS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here we describe the metabolic profile of iPSC-derived astrocytes from PwMS and validate this model as a very powerful tool to study disease mechanisms and to perform non-invasive drug targeting assays <i>in vitro</i>. Our findings recapitulate several disease features described in patients and provide new mechanistic insights into the metabolic rewiring of astrocytes in MS, which could be targeted in future therapeutic studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A secretory vesicle failure in Parkinson's disease occurs in human platelets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The presence of elevated dopamine (DA) and its major metabolites in the cytosol of neurons has been associated with their vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Over 99% of the cell's amines are confined to secretory vesicles (SVs), making these structures fundamental in the regulation of cytosolic DA levels. SVs of platelets use similar, if not the same mechanisms to accumulate serotonin in SVs as dopaminergic neurons do to store DA. Hence, any functional defects in platelets probably mirrors events in DA neurons.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We have isolated fresh platelets from the blood of 75 PD patients, 116 matched controls and 24 patients with Parkinsonism, assaying serotonin handling (basal content, accumulation, secretion and spontaneous leakage).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a dramatic decrease in the serotonin content and uptake by SVs, as well as decreased thrombin-induced release by platelets from PD patients but not in those from most Parkinsonism cases. Platelets from PD patients also failed to retain serotonin in SVs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings indicate a functional impairment in the handling of amines by SVs in PD patients. This defect may serve as a biomarker of PD, and the approach described here may be potentially used for the subclinical detection of PD and to establish a platform to assay disease modifying drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modified recurrent equation-based cubic spline interpolation for missing data recovery in phasor measurement unit (PMU) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Smart grid systems require high-quality phasor measurement unit (PMU) data for proper operation, control, and decision-making. Missing PMU data may lead to improper actions or even blackouts. While the conventional cubic interpolation methods based on the solution of a set of linear equations to solve for the cubic spline coefficients have been applied by many researchers for interpolation of missing data, the computational complexity increases non-linearly with increasing data size. Methods: In this work, a modified recurrent equation-based cubic spline interpolation procedure for recovering missing PMU data is proposed. The recurrent equation-based method  makes the computations of spline constants simpler. Using PMU data from the State Load Despatch Center (SLDC) in Madhya Pradesh, India, a comparison of the root mean square error (RMSE) values and time of calculation (ToC) is calculated for both methods. Results: The modified recurrent relation method could retrieve missing values 10 times faster when compared to the conventional cubic interpolation method based on the solution of a set of linear equations.  The RMSE values have shown the proposed method is effective even for special cases of missing values (edges, continuous missing values). Conclusions: The proposed method can retrieve any number of missing values at any location using observed data with a minimal number of calculations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In heart failure reactivation of RNA-binding proteins is associated with the expression of 1,523 fetal-specific isoforms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matteo D’Antonio, Jennifer P. Nguyen, Timothy D. Arthur, Hiroko Matsui, Margaret K. R. Donovan, Agnieszka D’Antonio-Chronowska, Kelly A. Frazer</p>

Reactivation of fetal-specific genes and isoforms occurs during heart failure. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the extent to which the fetal program switch occurs remains unclear. Limitations hindering transcriptome-wide analyses of alternative splicing differences (i.e. isoform switching) in cardiovascular system (CVS) tissues between fetal, healthy adult and heart failure have included both cellular heterogeneity across bulk RNA-seq samples and limited availability of fetal tissue for research. To overcome these limitations, we have deconvoluted the cellular compositions of 996 RNA-seq samples representing heart failure, healthy adult (heart and arteria), and fetal-like (iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells) CVS tissues. Comparison of the expression profiles revealed that reactivation of fetal-specific RBPs, and the accompanied re-expression of 1,523 fetal-specific isoforms, contribute to the transcriptome differences between heart failure and healthy adult heart. Of note, isoforms for 20 different RBPs were among those that reverted in heart failure to the fetal-like expression pattern. We determined that, compared with adult-specific isoforms, fetal-specific isoforms encode proteins that tend to have more functions, are more likely to harbor RBP binding sites, have canonical sequences at their splice sites, and contain typical upstream polypyrimidine tracts. Our study suggests that compared with healthy adult, fetal cardiac tissue requires stricter transcriptional regulation, and that during heart failure reversion to this stricter transcriptional regulation occurs. Furthermore, we provide a resource of cardiac developmental stage-specific and heart failure-associated genes and isoforms, which are largely unexplored and can be exploited to investigate novel therapeutics for heart failure.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Objective quantification of nerves in immunohistochemistry specimens of thyroid cancer utilising deep learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Indriani P. Astono, James S. Welsh, Christopher W. Rowe, Phillip Jobling</p>

Accurate quantification of nerves in cancer specimens is important to understand cancer behaviour. Typically, nerves are manually detected and counted in digitised images of thin tissue sections from excised tumours using immunohistochemistry. However the images are of a large size with nerves having substantial variation in morphology that renders accurate and objective quantification difficult using existing manual and automated counting techniques. Manual counting is precise, but time-consuming, susceptible to inconsistency and has a high rate of false negatives. Existing automated techniques using digitised tissue sections and colour filters are sensitive, however, have a high rate of false positives. In this paper we develop a new automated nerve detection approach, based on a deep learning model with an augmented classification structure. This approach involves pre-processing to extract the image patches for the deep learning model, followed by pixel-level nerve detection utilising the proposed deep learning model. Outcomes assessed were a) sensitivity of the model in detecting manually identified nerves (expert annotations), and b) the precision of additional model-detected nerves. The proposed deep learning model based approach results in a sensitivity of 89% and a precision of 75%. The code and pre-trained model are publicly available at https://github.com/IA92/Automated_Nerves_Quantification.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Meta-control of social learning strategies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anil Yaman, Nicolas Bredeche, Onur Çaylak, Joel Z. Leibo, Sang Wan Lee</p>

Social learning, copying other’s behavior without actual experience, offers a cost-effective means of knowledge acquisition. However, it raises the fundamental question of which individuals have reliable information: successful individuals versus the majority. The former and the latter are known respectively as success-based and conformist social learning strategies. We show here that while the success-based strategy fully exploits the benign environment of low uncertainly, it fails in uncertain environments. On the other hand, the conformist strategy can effectively mitigate this adverse effect. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that meta-control of individual and social learning strategies provides effective and sample-efficient learning in volatile and uncertain environments. Simulations on a set of environments with various levels of volatility and uncertainty confirmed our hypothesis. The results imply that meta-control of social learning affords agents the leverage to resolve environmental uncertainty with minimal exploration cost, by exploiting others’ learning as an external knowledge base.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RNA-Seq is not required to determine stable reference genes for qPCR normalization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nirmal Kumar Sampathkumar, Venkat Krishnan Sundaram, Prakroothi S. Danthi, Rasha Barakat, Shiden Solomon, Mrityunjoy Mondal, Ivo Carre, Tatiana El Jalkh, Aïda Padilla-Ferrer, Julien Grenier, Charbel Massaad, Jacqueline C. Mitchell</p>

Assessment of differential gene expression by qPCR is heavily influenced by the choice of reference genes. Although numerous statistical approaches have been proposed to determine the best reference genes, they can give rise to conflicting results depending on experimental conditions. Hence, recent studies propose the use of RNA-Seq to identify stable genes followed by the application of different statistical approaches to determine the best set of reference genes for qPCR data normalization. In this study, however, we demonstrate that the statistical approach to determine the best reference genes from commonly used conventional candidates is more important than the preselection of ‘stable’ candidates from RNA-Seq data. Using a qPCR data normalization workflow that we have previously established; we show that qPCR data normalization using conventional reference genes render the same results as stable reference genes selected from RNA-Seq data. We validated these observations in two distinct cross-sectional experimental conditions involving human iPSC derived microglial cells and mouse sciatic nerves. These results taken together show that given a robust statistical approach for reference gene selection, stable genes selected from RNA-Seq data do not offer any significant advantage over commonly used reference genes for normalizing qPCR assays.

                Background: The loss of E-cadherin expression and the induction of N-cadherin are known as hallmarks of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, an essential initial step in the process of metastasis in solid tumors. Although several studies have reported expressions of these cadherins in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), their clinical significance is unknown as MM cells are non-epithelial. Methods: In this study, we examined the expression of E- and N-cadherins by immunohistochemistry using bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens from 31 newly diagnosed MM patients and in subsequent biopsy specimens from six of these. Results: Negative E-cadherin expression on BM myeloma cell membranes was significantly associated with the presence of soft-tissue masses arising from bone lesions and breaking through the cortical bone, referred to as extramedullary disease (EMD). Conclusions: Given the aggressive nature of EMD, our study suggests that screening for E-cadherin using BM immunohistochemistry is one measure that could predict the development of EMD in patients with MM.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A pilot study assessing the similarity between core outcome sets and outcomes included in health technology assessments [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Core outcome sets (COS) are an agreed standardised collection of outcomes created with representation from all key stakeholders (such as patients, clinicians, researchers), which should be reported as a minimum for all trials in that corresponding clinical area. There has been little research investigating the use of core outcomes in Health technology assessments (HTAs) and none in non-oncology HTAs. This study aimed to assess the similarity between COS and HTA outcomes. Methods: Ten COS published between 2015 and 2019 were selected, with patient participation taken as a proxy measure for a high quality COS. The INAHTA database was used as a source to identify relevant HTAs, which were accessed through the hyperlinks provided. Outcomes selected for these assessments were categorised as either a specific, partial or no match compared to the COS. An additional cohort of non-oncology HTAs published between 2019 and 2021 were identified from the NICE website and compared against a relevant COS. Results: Six hundred and fifty-one HTAs were matched to the ten COS areas, of which 119 were reviewed. Of a possible 1318 core outcome matches, there were 562 (43%) matches, 413 (31%) specific and 149 (11%) partial. NICE HTA matches against corresponding COS ranged from 44% to 100%, with a total of 78% (73/94) matches, 57 (61%) specific and 16 (17%) partial. Conclusion: Further work is required to promote the awareness and implementation of COS within HTAs. The degree of matching between COS and NICE HTA outcomes is encouraging, demonstrating acceptance of COS by HTA producers.

                Background: This article investigates an innovative use of because, called the because X construction (e.g., because homework). Quantitative and qualitative research as well as research about the historical development of the construction have been conducted. The present article aims to determine what motivates the use of the construction.  Methods: Based on the data collected from the literature and online sources, the grammar of the because X construction is described in detail. The construction is then analyzed  within Hirose’s (2015) three-tier model of language use.  Results: A two-layered expressive structure is proposed: The X-element serves as a private expression, which is a speaker’s expression of thought with no intention of communication, whereas the whole construction functions publicly. The private nature of the X-element consistently accounts for the syntactic categories of the X-element and the restrictions on them observed in the literature.  Conclusion: The proposed two-layered expressive structure reflects a metapragmatic function of the construction. A private, subjective expression embedded in a public expression has the function of connecting the hearer to the speaker, and it accordingly brings about a joint attention effect. With such a function, the proposed structure is effective especially (but not exclusively) in online communication because one can strategically indicate closeness or intimacy to others, particularly in an environment where nonverbal means are difficult to apply.

                Background: Salinity is a significant abiotic stress which affects eggplant (Solanum melongena) growth and development, decreasing photosynthesis and reducing yield. To address this problem, we performed a salt induction response (SIR) study in eggplant. Methods: In this experiment, we optimized the salt induction cycle of 60, 80, 100 and 125 mM NaCl concentrations at 120-min time intervals. Eggplant seeds were exposed to three treatments. In particular, induced, non-induced, and control. The induction responses were tested with a supply of sub-lethal dose (100 mM NaCl) of saline water irrigation. Results: Salt induction improved the eggplant seedling vigour, germination, adjusts the physiology, antioxidant machinery and increase the fruit yield under salinity. Conclusion: Salt induction acclimatizes the eggplant seedlings to salinity stress and enhances the salinity tolerance at the whole-plant level.

                Background: iron and calcium dysmetabolism, with hyperferritinemia, hypoferremia, hypocalcemia and anemia have been documented in the majority of COVID-19 patients at later/worse stages. Furthermore, complementary to ACE2, both sialic acid (SA) molecules and CD147 proved relevant host receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry, which explains the viral attack to multiple types of cells, including erythrocytes, endothelium and neural tissue. Several authors advocated that cell ferroptosis may be the core and final cell degenerative mechanism. Methods: a literature research was performed in several scientific search engines, such as PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, Chemical Abstract Service. More than 500 articles were retrieved until mid-December 2021, to highlight the available evidence about the investigated issues. Results: based on COVID-19 literature data, we have highlighted a few pathophysiological mechanisms, associated with virus-based cation dysmetabolism, multi-organ attack, mitochondria degeneration and ferroptosis. Our suggested elucidated pathological sequence is: a) spike protein subunit S1 docking with sialylated membrane glycoproteins/receptors (ACE2, CD147), and S2 subunit fusion with the lipid layer; b) cell membrane morpho-functional changes due to the consequent electro-chemical variations and viroporin action, which induce an altered ion channel function and intracellular cation accumulation; c) additional intracellular iron concentration due to a deregulated hepcidin-ferroportin axis, with higher hepcidin levels. Viral invasion may also affect erythrocytes/erythroid precursors, endothelial cells and macrophages, through SA and CD147 receptors, with relative hemoglobin and iron/calcium dysmetabolism. AB0 blood group, hemochromatosis, or environmental elements may represent possible factors which affect individual susceptibility to COVID-19.     Conclusions: our literature analysis confirms the combined role of SA molecules, ACE2, CD147, viroporins and hepcidin in determining the cation dysmetabolism and final ferroptosis in the cells infected by SARS-CoV-2. The altered ion channels and electrochemical gradients of the cell membrane have a pivotal role in the virus entry and cell dysmetabolism, with subsequent multi-organ immune-inflammatory degeneration and erythrocyte/hemoglobin alterations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">How to build phylogenetic species trees with OMA [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge of species phylogeny is critical to many fields of biology. In an era of genome data availability, the most common way to make a phylogenetic species tree is by using multiple protein-coding genes, conserved in multiple species. This methodology is composed of several steps: orthology inference, multiple sequence alignment and inference of the phylogeny with dedicated tools. This can be a difficult task, and orthology inference, in particular, is usually computationally intensive and error prone if done ad hoc. This tutorial provides protocols to make use of OMA Orthologous Groups, a set of genes all orthologous to each other, to infer a phylogenetic species tree. It is designed to be user-friendly and computationally inexpensive, by providing two options: (1) Using only precomputed groups with species available on the OMA Browser, or (2) Computing orthologs using OMA Standalone for additional species, with the option of using precomputed orthology relations for those present in OMA. A protocol for downstream analyses is provided as well, including creating a supermatrix, tree inference, and visualization. All protocols use publicly available software, and we provide scripts and code snippets to facilitate data handling. The protocols are accompanied with practical examples.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A review of the therapeutic properties of dithiocarbamates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The persistence of infectious diseases that continue to plague the world, as well as the formation of harmful substances within the human body, such as free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have sparked new research. Thus, the need for innovative approaches for developing new or modification of existing therapeutic agents. The design of biologically important metal complexes of dithiocarbamates (DTCs) has been made possible by recent advancements in innovative research. Dithiocarbamates are reduced thiuram disulfides with excellent complexing capabilities and have various applications. They are potent and work in tandem with the core metal ions of coordinating compounds to produce synergistic effects. Dithiocarbamates have many uses, including as antidotes for metal poisoning, cisplatin or carboplatin toxicity, and clinical trials for cancer, Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus and antibiotics. They exert anti-oxidant effect in cells. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of this therapeutic agent is important in drug repurposing. This review highlights the protective and therapeutic properties of dithiocarbamate compounds in biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Duration of dry and humidified incubation of single-step embryo culture medium and oxygen tension during sham culture do not alter metabolomics signature [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extended embryo culture using single-step medium gained popularity in clinical in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, there are concerns about the degradation of unstable medium components and their negative effects on the developing embryos. Further, dry-incubation can increase osmolality, which can in-turn enhance the concentration of constituents of the media and their stability. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the immediate changes in the culture media metabolites in relation to clinically comparable situations such as single-step extended embryo culture and use of dry and humidified-incubation in two-different gaseous conditions. Methods: Commercially available single-step medium was sham-cultured in droplets under oil in two different conditions viz. dry (37°C; 6%CO2; 5%O2) and humidified (37°C; 6% CO2; atmospheric O2) for 0h, 72h, and 120h intervals. Droplets were subjected to the sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based profiling using 800 MHz NMR equipped with a cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7mm) probe. Metabolomic signatures between the two groups were comprehensively assessed. Results: A total of ten amino acids and four energy substrates were identified from the culture medium. Metabolite levels showed a non-significant increase in the dry-incubation group at 72h and then declined at 120h. Humidified incubation had no effects on the level of the metabolite until 120h. No significant differences in the levels of metabolites were observed between the dry and humidified-groups at various time-points tested. Conclusions: A non-significant variation in the levels of metabolites observed in the dry-incubation of single-step medium most unlikely to influence a clinical outcome. However, the impact of these subtle changes on the (epi)genetic integrity of the embryos in a clinical set-up to be addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Implementation of a Teleneurology Clinic in Zambia during the COVID‐19 Pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and benefits of a teleneurology clinic serving adults usually attending a neurology outpatient clinic in Lusaka, Zambia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Televisits were offered to patients scheduled for neurology appointments between March and July 2020 using the telephone, WhatsApp video, or Zoom calls based on patient accessibility. Visit outcomes were documented, and patient and neurologist satisfaction surveys were completed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 323 patients, 195 (60%) were reachable by telephone, 179 of these were alive, and 74% (133/179) of those alive agreed to a televisit. Stroke (30%), seizures (20%), and headache (16%) were the most common diagnoses seen via televisit. Most televisits (80%) were by telephone call, 14% by WhatsApp video call, and 6% by Zoom. Nearly one-third (30%) of the patients were stable and discharged from the clinic, 32% only required medication refills, and 19% required an in-person visit. Sixty patients (out of 85 reachable and 71% response rate) and 7 of 9 neurologists (78% response rate) completed satisfaction surveys. Neurologists reported greater assessment confidence with Zoom, but confidence was high for all modalities. Patients preferring televisits (75%, 45/60) noted reduced expense and time requirements, whereas those preferring in-person visits (22%, 13/60) cited the desire for physical examinations. Overall, 98% of patients and 100% of neurologists were satisfied with televisits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Teleneurology visits were acceptable and feasible for adults attending an outpatient neurology clinic in Zambia and their neurologists. They offer a promising supplement to in-person visits in resource-limited settings, even when video-conference capabilities and electronic medical records are absent.

                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and critical illness myopathy (CIM). We examined 3 ICU patients with COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation for pneumonia and developed CIM. Pathological examination of the skeletal muscle biopsies revealed myopathic changes consistent with CIM, variable inflammation with autophagic vacuoles, SARS-CoV immunostaining + fibers/granules, and electron microscopy findings of mitochondrial abnormalities and coronavirus-like particles. Although mitochondrial dysfunction with compromised energy production is a critical pathogenic mechanism of non-COVID-19-associated CIM, in our series of COVID-19-associated CIM, myopathic changes including prominent mitochondrial damage suggest a similar mechanism and association with direct SARS-CoV-2 muscle infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, emotions, college adjustment, and digital skills [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 ± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32; RMSE: 2.42; R2: 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59; RMSE: 2.49; R 2: 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety; while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion: Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons in the hippocampus fire in consistent sequence over the timescale of seconds during the delay period of some memory experiments. For longer timescales, the firing of hippocampal neurons also changes slowly over minutes within experimental sessions. It was thought that these slow dynamics are caused by stochastic drift or a continuous change in the representation of the episode, rather than consistent sequences unfolding over minutes. This paper studies the consistency of contextual drift in three chronic calcium imaging recordings from the hippocampus CA1 region in mice. Computational measures of consistency show reliable sequences within experimental trials at the scale of seconds as one would expect from time cells or place cells during the trial, as well as across experimental trials on the scale of minutes within a recording session. Consistent sequences in the hippocampus are observed over a wide range of time scales, from seconds to minutes. The hippocampal activity could reflect a scale-invariant spatiotemporal context as suggested by theories of memory from cognitive psychology.</p>

                Background: Automation has increasingly become more commonplace in the research laboratory workspace. The introduction of articulated robotic arms allows the researcher more flexibility in the tasks a single piece of automated machinery can perform. We set out to incorporate automation in processing of genomic DNA organic extractions to increase throughput and limit researchers to the exposure of organic solvents. Methods: In order to automate the genome sequencing pipeline in our laboratory, we programmed a dual-arm anthropomorphic robot, the Robotic Biology Institute's Maholo LabDroid, to perform organic solvent-based genomic DNA extraction from cell lysates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that automation of phenol-chloroform extraction has been reported. Results: We achieved routine extraction of high molecular weight genomic DNA (>100 kb) from diverse biological samples including algae cultured in sea water, bacteria, whole insects, and human cell lines. The results of pulse-field electrophoresis size analysis and the N50 sequencing metrics of reads obtained from Nanopore MinION runs verified the presence of intact DNA suitable for direct sequencing. Conclusions: We present the workflow that can be used to program similar robots and discuss the problems and solutions we encountered in developing the workflow. The protocol can be adapted to analogous methods such as RNA extraction, and there is ongoing work to incorporate further post-extraction steps such as library construction. This work shows the potential for automated robotic workflows to free molecular biological researchers from manual interventions in routine experimental work. A time-lapse movie of the entire automated run is included in this report.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Interbrain synchrony: on wavy ground</a></h4>

              
                In recent years the study of dynamic, between-brain coupling mechanisms has taken social neuroscience by storm. In particular, interbrain synchrony (IBS) is a putative neural mechanism said to promote social interactions by enabling the functional integration of multiple brains. In this article, I argue that this research is beset with three pervasive and interrelated problems. First, the field lacks a widely accepted definition of IBS. Second, IBS wants for theories that can guide the design and interpretation of experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perception is associated with the brain's metabolic response to sensory stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Processing of incoming sensory stimulation triggers an increase of cerebral perfusion and blood oxygenation (neurovascular response) as well as an alteration of the metabolic neurochemical profile (neurometabolic response). Here we show in human primary visual cortex (V1) that perceived and unperceived isoluminant chromatic flickering stimuli designed to have similar neurovascular responses as measured by blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) have markedly different neurometabolic responses as measured by functional MRS. In particular, a significant regional buildup of lactate, an index of aerobic glycolysis, and glutamate, an index of malate-aspartate shuttle, occurred in V1 only when the flickering was perceived, without any relation with behavioral or physiological variables. Whereas the BOLD-fMRI signal in V1, a proxy for input to V1, was insensitive to flickering perception by design, the BOLD-fMRI signal in secondary visual areas was larger during perceived than unperceived flickering, indicating increased output from V1. These results demonstrate that the upregulation of energy metabolism induced by visual stimulation depends on the type of information processing taking place in V1, and that 1H-fMRS provides unique information about local input/output balance that is not measured by BOLD fMRI.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Target-specific control of olfactory bulb periglomerular cells by GABAergic and cholinergic basal forebrain inputs</a></h4>

              
                The olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay for odor processing in the brain, receives dense GABAergic and cholinergic long-range projections from basal forebrain (BF) nuclei that provide information about the internal state and behavioral context of the animal. However, the targets, impact and dynamic of these afferents are still unclear. I studied how BF synaptic inputs modulate activity in diverse subtypes of periglomerular (PG) interneurons using optogenetic stimulation and loose cell-attached or whole-cell patch-clamp recording in OB slices from adult mice. GABAergic BF inputs potently blocked PG cells firing except in a minority of calretinin-expressing cells in which GABA release elicited spiking. Parallel cholinergic projections excited a previously overlooked PG cell subtype via synaptic activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. Low frequency stimulation of the cholinergic axons drove persistent firing in these PG cells thereby increasing tonic inhibition in principal neurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that modality-specific BF inputs can orchestrate synaptic inhibition in OB glomeruli using multiple, potentially independent, inhibitory or excitatory target-specific pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Augmentation of progestin signaling rescues testis organization and spermatogenesis in zebrafish with the depletion of androgen signaling</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of androgen signaling is known to cause testicular malformation and defective spermatogenesis in zebrafish. However, knockout of <i>cyp17a1</i>, a key enzyme responsible for the androgen synthesis, in <i>ar</i>-/- male zebrafish paradoxically causes testicular hypertrophy and enhanced spermatogenesis. Because Cyp17a1 plays key roles in hydroxylation of pregnenolone and progesterone (P4), and convert of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione, we hypothesize that the unexpected phenotype in <i>cyp17a1</i>-/-;<i>androgen receptor</i> (<i>ar</i>)-/- zebrafish may be mediated through an augmentation of progestin/nuclear progestin receptor (nPgr) signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we show that knockout of <i>cyp17a1</i> leads to accumulation of 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) and P4. Further, administration of progestin, a synthetic DHP mimetic, is sufficient to rescue testicular development and spermatogenesis in <i>ar</i>-/- zebrafish, whereas knockout of <i>npgr</i> abolishes the rescue effect of <i>cyp17a1</i>-/- in the <i>cyp17a1</i>-/-;<i>ar</i>-/- double mutant. Analyses of the transcriptomes among the mutants with defective testicular organization and spermatogenesis (<i>ar</i>-/-, <i>ar</i>-/-;<i>npgr</i>-/- and <i>cyp17a</i>-/-;<i>ar</i>-/-;<i>npgr</i>-/-), those with normal phenotype (Control and <i>cyp17a1</i>-/-), and rescued phenotype (<i>cyp17a1</i>-/-;<i>ar</i>-/-) reveal a common link between a down-regulated expression of <i>insl3</i> and its related downstream genes in <i>cyp17a</i>-/-;<i>ar</i>-/-;<i>npgr</i>-/- zebrafish. Taken together, our data suggest that genetic or pharmacological augmentation of the progestin/nPgr pathway is sufficient to restore testis organization and spermatogenesis in zebrafish with the depletion of androgen signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ribosome profiling of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus reveals novel features of viral gene expression</a></h4>

              
                Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an arterivirus which causes significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Here, we use ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and parallel RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to characterise the transcriptome and translatome of both species of PRRSV and to analyse the host response to infection. We quantified viral gene expression over a timecourse of infection, and calculated the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at both sites on the viral genome. At the nsp2 frameshift site (a rare example of protein-stimulated frameshifting), −2 PRF efficiency increases over time, likely facilitated by accumulation of the PRF-stimulatory viral protein (nsp1β) during infection. This marks arteriviruses as the second example of temporally regulated PRF. Surprisingly, we find that PRF efficiency at the canonical ORF1ab frameshift site also increases over time, in apparent contradiction of the common assumption that RNA structure-directed frameshift sites operate at a fixed efficiency. This has potential implications for the numerous other viruses with canonical PRF sites. Furthermore, we discovered several highly translated additional viral ORFs, the translation of which may be facilitated by multiple novel viral transcripts. For example, we found a 125-codon ORF overlapping nsp12, which is expressed as highly as nsp12 itself at late stages of replication, and is likely translated from novel subgenomic (sg) RNA transcripts that overlap the 3′ end of ORF1b. Similar transcripts were discovered for both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, suggesting a potential conserved mechanism for temporal regulation of expression of the 3′-proximal region of ORF1b. In addition, we identified a highly translated, short upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5′ UTR, the presence of which is highly conserved amongst PRRSV-2 isolates. This is the first application of RiboSeq to arterivirus-infected cells, and reveals new features which add to the complexity of gene expression programmes in this important family of nidoviruses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of bipotent progenitors that give rise to myogenic and connective tissues in mouse</a></h4>

              
                How distinct cell fates are manifested by direct lineage ancestry from bipotent progenitors, or by specification of individual cell types is a key question for understanding the emergence of tissues. The interplay between skeletal muscle progenitors and associated connective tissue cells provides a model for examining how muscle functional units are established. Most craniofacial structures originate from the vertebrate-specific neural crest cells except in the dorsal portion of the head, where they arise from cranial mesoderm. Here, using multiple lineage-tracing strategies combined with single cell RNAseq and in situ analyses, we identify bipotent progenitors expressing <i>Myf5 </i>(an upstream regulator of myogenic fate) that give rise to both muscle and juxtaposed connective tissue. Following this bifurcation, muscle and connective tissue cells retain complementary signalling features and maintain spatial proximity. Disrupting myogenic identity shifts muscle progenitors to a connective tissue fate. The emergence of <i>Myf5</i>-derived connective tissue is associated with the activity of several transcription factors, including <i>Foxp2</i>. Interestingly, this unexpected bifurcation in cell fate was not observed in craniofacial regions that are colonised by neural crest cells. Therefore, we propose that an ancestral bi-fated program gives rise to muscle and connective tissue cells in skeletal muscles that are deprived of neural crest cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Competition between parallel sensorimotor learning systems</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor learning is supported by at least two parallel systems: a strategic process that benefits from explicit knowledge, and an implicit process that adapts subconsciously. How do these systems interact? Does one system's contributions suppress the other, or do they operate independently? Here we illustrate that during reaching, implicit and explicit systems both learn from visual target errors. This shared error leads to competition such that an increase in the explicit system's response siphons away resources that are needed for implicit adaptation, thus reducing its learning. As a result, steady-state implicit learning can vary across experimental conditions, due to changes in strategy. Furthermore, strategies can mask changes in implicit learning properties, such as its error sensitivity. These ideas, however, become more complex in conditions where subjects adapt using multiple visual landmarks, a situation which introduces learning from sensory prediction errors in addition to target errors. These two types of implicit errors can oppose each other, leading to another type of competition. Thus, during sensorimotor adaptation, implicit and explicit learning systems compete for a common resource: error.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Apelin signaling dependent endocardial protrusions promote cardiac trabeculation in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                During cardiac development, endocardial cells (EdCs) produce growth factors to promote myocardial morphogenesis and growth. In particular, EdCs produce Neuregulin which is required for ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs) to seed the multicellular ridges known as trabeculae. Defects in Neuregulin signaling, or in endocardial sprouting towards CMs, cause hypotrabeculation. However, the mechanisms underlying endocardial sprouting remain largely unknown. Here, we first show by live imaging in zebrafish embryos that EdCs interact with CMs via dynamic membrane protrusions. After touching CMs, these protrusions remain in close contact with their target despite the vigorous cardiac contractions. Loss of the CM-derived peptide Apelin, or of the Apelin receptor, which is expressed in EdCs, leads to reduced endocardial sprouting and hypotrabeculation. Mechanistically, Neuregulin signaling requires endocardial protrusions to induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activity in CMs and trigger their delamination. Altogether, these data show that Apelin signaling dependent endocardial protrusions modulate CM behavior during trabeculation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global and context-specific transcriptional consequences of oncogenic Fbw7 mutations</a></h4>

              
                The Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase targets many proteins for proteasomal degradation, which include oncogenic transcription factors (TFs) (e.g., c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch). Fbw7 is a tumor suppressor and tumors often contain mutations in <i>FBXW7</i>, the gene that encodes Fbw7. The complexity of its substrate network has obscured the mechanisms of Fbw7-associated tumorigenesis, yet this understanding is needed for developing therapies. We used an integrated approach employing RNA-Seq and high-resolution mapping (CUT&amp;RUN) of histone modifications and TF occupancy (c-Jun and c-Myc) to examine the combinatorial effects of mis-regulated Fbw7 substrates in colorectal cancer cells with engineered tumor-associated <i>FBXW7</i> null or missense mutations. Both Fbw7 mutations caused widespread transcriptional changes associated with active chromatin and altered TF occupancy: some were common to both Fbw7 mutant cell lines, whereas others were mutation specific. We identified loci where both Jun and Myc were co-regulated by Fbw7, suggesting that substrates may have synergistic effects. One co-regulated gene was <i>CIITA</i>, the master regulator of MHC Class II gene expression. Fbw7 loss increased MHC Class II expression and Fbw7 mutations were correlated with increased CIITA expression in TCGA colorectal tumors and cell lines, which may have immunotherapeutic implications for Fbw7-associated cancers. Analogous studies in neural stem cells in which <i>FBXW7</i> had been acutely deleted closely mirrored the results in colorectal cancer cells. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed Fbw7-asssociated pathways that were conserved across both cell types that may reflect fundamental Fbw7 functions. These analyses provide a framework for understanding normal and neoplastic context specific Fbw7 functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocyte responses to amyloid and tau pathologies</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: In Alzheimer's disease clinical research, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) released in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood is widely measured and perceived as a biomarker of reactive astrogliosis. However, it was recently demonstrated that plasma GFAP levels are associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) but not tau pathology. The molecular underpinnings behind this specificity are unexplored. Here we investigated biomarker and transcriptomic associations of GFAP-positive astrocytes with Abeta and tau pathologies in humans and mouse models. Methods: We studied 90 individuals with plasma GFAP, Abeta- and Tau-PET to investigate the association between biomarkers. Then, transcriptomic analysis in hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes isolated from mouse models presenting Abeta (PS2APP) or tau (P301S) pathologies was applied to explore differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology processes, and protein-protein interaction networks associated with each phenotype. Findings: In humans, we found that plasma GFAP associates with Abeta but not tau pathology. Supporting these results, mouse transcriptomics showed scarce overlap of DEGs between the Abeta and tau mouse models, revealing the unique nature of GFAP-positive astrocytic responses to Abeta or tau pathology. While Abeta GFAP-positive astrocytes were overrepresented with genes associated with proteostasis and exocytosis-related processes, tau hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes presented greater abnormalities in functions related to DNA/RNA processing and cytoskeleton dynamics. Interpretation: Our results offer insights into Abeta and tau-driven specific signatures in GFAP-positive astrocytes. Characterizing how different underlying pathologies distinctly influence astrocyte responses is critical for the biological interpretation of astrocyte-related biomarker and suggests the need to develop context-specific astrocyte targets to study AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast and functionally specific cortical thickness changes induced by visual stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Structural characteristics of the human brain serve as important markers of brain development, aging, disease progression and neural plasticity. They are considered stable properties, changing slowly over time. Multiple recent studies reported that structural brain changes measured with MRI may occur much faster than previously thought, happening on a time scale as fast as several minutes. The mechanisms behind such fast changes remain unclear, with hemodynamics as one possible explanation. Here we investigated the functional specificity of cortical thickness changes induced by a flickering checkerboard stimulus. We also compared the thickness effects to those measured with BOLD fMRI. We found that checkerboard stimulation led to a significant thickness increase, which was functionally specific to V1 and spatially confined to the retinotopic representation of the checkerboard stimulus. Although functional specificity and the effect size of these changes were comparable to those of the BOLD signal in V1, thickness effects were substantially weaker in V3. Furthermore, a comparison of predicted and measured thickness changes for different stimulus timings suggested a slow increase of thickness over time, speaking against a hemodynamic explanation. Altogether, our findings suggest that visual stimulation can induce structural gray matter enlargement measurable with MRI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Memory Consolidation with Orthogonal Gradients for avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                The memory consolidation process enables the accumulation of recent and remote memories in the long-term memory store. In general, the deep network models of memory suffer from forgetting old information while learning new information, called catastrophic forgetting/interference. The human brain overcomes this problem quite effectively, a problem that continues to challenge current deep neural network models. We propose a regularization-based model to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting. According to the proposed training mechanism, the network parameters are constrained to vary in a direction orthogonal to the average of the error gradients corresponding to the previous tasks. We also ensure that the constraint used in parameter updating satisfies the locality principle. The proposed model's performance is compared with Elastic Weight Consolidation on standard datasets such as permuted MNIST and split MNIST on classification tasks using fully connected networks, and Convolution-based networks. The model performance is also compared to an autoencoder on split MNIST dataset, and to complex core50 dataset on two types of classification tasks with EWC. The proposed model gives a new view on plasticity at the neuronal level. In the proposed model, the parameter updating is controlled by the neuronal level plasticity rather than synapse level plasticity as in other standard models. The biological plausibility of the proposed model is discussed by linking the extra parameters to synaptic tagging, which represents the state of the synapse involved in Long Term Potentiation (LTP).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deciphering the developmental patterns of white matter tracts in a diffusion MRI based fetal brain atlas</a></h4>

              
                White matter of the fetal brain undergoes rapid development to form the early structural connections. Diffusion MRI has shown to be a useful tool to depict the fetal brain white matter in utero, and many studies have observed increasing fractional anisotropy and decreasing mean diffusivity in the fetal brain during the second-to-third trimester, whereas others reported non-monotonic changes. Unbiased diffusion MRI atlases of the fetal brain are important for characterizing developmental trajectories of white matter and providing normative references for in-utero diagnosis of prenatal abnormalities. To date, the sole fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas was collected from a Caucasian/mixed population, and was constructed based on the diffusion tensor model with limited spatial resolution. In this work, we proposed a fiber orientation distribution (FOD) based pipeline for the generation of fetal brain diffusion MRI atlases, which showed better registration accuracy than diffusion tensor-based pipeline. Based on the FOD pipeline, we constructed the first Chinese fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas using 89 normal fetal diffusion MRI scans at GA between 24 and 38 weeks. Complex non-monotonic trends of tensor- and FOD-derived microstructural parameters in eight white matter tracts were observed, which jointly pointed to different phases of microstructural development. Specifically, we speculated that the turning point of the diffusivity trajectory may correspond to the starting point of pre-myelination, based on which, the developmental order of white matter tracts can be mapped and the order was in agreement with order of myelination from histological studies. The normative atlas also provided a reference for detection of abnormal white matter development, such as that in congenital heart disease. Therefore, the high-order fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas established in this study depicted the spatiotemporal pattern of early white matter development, and findings may help decipher the distinct microstructural events in utero.

                Age-related decline in intestinal barrier function impacts survival across species, but the underlying cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate a role for neuropeptides in regulating aging-associated increases in intestinal leakiness. Adult-specific knockdown of insulin-like peptides daf-28 or ins-7 in C. elegans neurons or dilp3 in D. melanogaster neurons improves intestinal integrity and lifespan of these animals, respectively. Neuropeptide knockdowns activate intestinal DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor that likely increases expression of epithelial barrier components. Furthermore, age-associated changes in neuronal DAF-28 peptide secretion mirrors C. elegans reproductive span and overexpression of this peptide suppresses the improved intestinal health in long-lived germline-less animals. Collectively, we show that intestinal integrity is subject to neuronal regulation, and this neuropeptidergic axis may be modulated by the germline of the animal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A molecular mechanism for high salt taste in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Dietary salt detection and consumption are crucial to maintaining fluid and ionic homeostasis. To optimize salt intake, animals employ salt-dependent activation of multiple taste pathways. Generally, sodium activates attractive taste cells, but attraction is overridden at high salt concentrations by cation non-selective activation of aversive taste cells. In flies, high salt avoidance is driven by both 'bitter' taste neurons and a class of glutamatergic 'high salt' neurons expressing pickpocket23 (ppk23). Although the cellular basis of salt taste has been described, many of the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that ionotropic receptor 7c (IR7c) is expressed in glutamatergic high salt neurons, where it functions with co-receptors IR76b and IR25a to detect high salt. Misexpression of IR7c in sweet neurons, which endogenously express IR76b and IR25a, confers responsiveness to non-sodium salts, indicating that IR7c is sufficient to convert a sodium-selective receptor to a cation non-selective receptor. Furthermore, the resultant transformation of taste neuron tuning switches potassium chloride from an aversive to an attractive tastant. This research provides insight into the molecular basis of monovalent and divalent salt taste coding and the full repertoire of IRs needed to form a functional salt receptor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TMS over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex affects the timing of motor imagery but not overt action: further support for the Motor-Cognitive model</a></h4>

              
                The Motor-Cognitive model suggests a functional dissociation between motor imagery and overt action, in contrast to the traditional notion of shared processes central to the Functional Equivalence view. According to the Motor-Cognitive model, motor imagery differs from overt action primarily through the use of executive resources to monitor and elaborate a motor image during execution. This can result in a lack of correspondence between motor imagery and its overt action counterpart. The present study examined the importance of executive resources in motor imagery using TMS to impair the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while measuring the time to complete imagined versus overt actions. In two experiments, TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slowed motor imagery but did not affect overt actions. TMS over the same region also interfered with performance of a mental calculation task, though it did not reliably affect less demanding cognitive tasks also thought to rely on executive functions. Taken together, these results were consistent with the Motor-Cognitive model but not with the idea of functional equivalence. The implications of these results for the theoretical understanding of motor imagery, and potential applications of the Motor-Cognitive model to the use of motor imagery in training and rehabilitation, are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Opioid Antagonism in Humans: A Primer on Optimal Dose and Timing for Central Mu-Opioid Receptor Blockade</a></h4>

              
                Non-human animal studies outline precise mechanisms of central mu-opioid regulation of pain, stress, affiliation and reward processing. In humans, pharmacological blockade with non-selective opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone is typically used to assess involvement of the mu-opioid system in such processing. However, robust estimates of the opioid receptor blockade achieved by opioid antagonists are missing. Dose and timing schedules are highly variable and often based on single studies. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of central opioid receptor blockade after opioid antagonism based on existing positron emission tomography data. We also create models for estimating opioid receptor blockade with intravenous naloxone and oral naltrexone. We find that common doses of intravenous naloxone (0.10-0.15 mg/kg) and oral naltrexone (50 mg) are more than sufficient to produce full blockade of central MOR (>90% receptor occupancy) for the duration of a typical experimental session (~60 minutes), presumably due to initial super saturation of receptors. Simulations indicate that these doses also produce high KOR blockade (78-100%) and some DOR blockade (10% with naltrexone and 48-74% with naloxone). Lower doses (e.g., 0.01 mg/kg intravenous naloxone) are estimated to produce less DOR and KOR blockade while still achieving a high level of MOR blockade over ~30 minutes. The models and simulations form the basis of two novel web applications for detailed planning and evaluation of experiments with opioid antagonists. These tools and recommendations enable selection of appropriate antagonists, doses and assessment time points, and determination of the achieved receptor blockade in previous studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Basolateral amygdala to insular cortex activity makes sign-tracking behavior insensitive to outcome value</a></h4>

              
                Goal-tracking rats are sensitive to Pavlovian outcome devaluation while sign-tracking rats are devaluation insensitive. During outcome devaluation, goal-tracking (GT) rats flexibly modify responding to cues based on the current value of the associated outcome. However, sign-tracking (ST) rats rigidly respond to cues regardless of the current outcome value. Our prior study demonstrated disconnection of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and anterior insular cortex (aIC) decreased both goal- and sign-tracking behaviors. Given the role of these regions in appetitive motivation and behavioral flexibility we predicted that disrupting BLA to aIC pathway during outcome devaluation would reduce flexibility in GT rats and reduce rigid appetitive motivation in ST rats. We inhibited the BLA to aIC pathway by infusing inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di-mcherry) or control (mCherry) virus into the BLA and implanted cannulae into the aIC to inhibit BLA terminals using intracranial injections of clozapine N-oxide (CNO). After training, we used a within subject satiety-induced outcome devaluation procedure in which we sated rats on training pellets (devalued condition) or homecage chow (valued condition). All rats received bilateral CNO infusions into the aIC prior to brief non-reinforced test sessions. Contrary to our hypothesis, BLA-IC inhibition did not interfere with devaluation sensitivity in GT rats but did make ST behaviors sensitive to devaluation. Intermediate rats showed the opposite effect, showing rigid in responding to cues with BLA-aIC pathway inactivation. Together, these results demonstrate BLA-IC projections mediate tracking-specific Pavlovian devaluation sensitivity and highlights the importance of considering individual differences in Pavlovian approach when evaluating circuitry contributions to behavioral flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporally extended and reversible neuronal silencing with Aion</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic silencing allows to reveal the necessity of selected neuronal populations for various neurophysiological functions ranging from specific behaviors to neuronal network activity. An ideal optogenetic silencing tool should be switchable between active and inactive states with precise timing while preserving its activity in the absence of light until switched to an inactive state. Although bistable anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (ACRs) were previously engineered to reach this goal, their conducting state life time was limited to only a few minutes and some ACRs were not fully switchable. Here we report Aion, a bistable ACR displaying a long-lasting open state with a spontaneous closing time constant close to 15 min. Moreover, Aion can be switched between the open and closed state with millisecond precision using blue and orange light, respectively. The long conducting state enables overnight silencing of neurons with minimal light exposure. We further generated trafficking-optimized versions of Aion, which show enhanced membrane localization and allow precisely timed, long-lasting all-optical control of nociceptive responses in larvae of Drosophila melanogaster.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meta-Analysis of the Functional Neuroimaging Literature with Probabilistic Logic Programming</a></h4>

              
                Inferring reliable brain-behavior associations requires synthesizing evidence from thousands of functional neuroimaging studies through meta-analysis. However, existing meta-analysis tools are limited to investigating simple neuroscience concepts and expressing a restricted range of questions. Here, we expand the scope of neuroimaging meta-analysis by designing NeuroLang: a domain-specific language to express and test hypotheses using probabilistic first-order logic programming. By leveraging formalisms found at the crossroads of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation, NeuroLang provides the expressivity to address a larger repertoire of hypotheses in a meta-analysis, while seamlessly modelling the uncertainty inherent to neuroimaging data. We demonstrate the language's capabilities in conducting comprehensive neuroimaging meta-analysis through use-case examples that address questions of structure-function associations. Specifically, we infer the specific functional roles of three canonical brain networks, support the role of the visual word-form area in visuospatial attention, and investigate the heterogeneous organization of the fronto-parietal control network.

	<p>High-grade pediatric glioma (p-HGG&amp;amp;mdash;WHO 2021, formerly GBM&amp;amp;mdash;WHO 2016), as a common, aggressive, and highly lethal primary brain malignancy in adults, accounts for only 3&amp;amp;ndash;15% of primary brain tumors in pediatric patients. After leukemia, brain malignancies are the second most common in the pediatric population and first in incidences concerning solid tumors. This study was designed on the basis of 14 pediatric patients hospitalized at Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Poland, due to p-HGG treatment. All the patients had a histopathological diagnosis performed by an experienced neuropathologist according to WHO guidelines (WHO 2016 Grade IV Glioblastoma). A significant correlation was found between the miR-155 concentration and the level of PD-L1 expression in p-HGG tumor tissue. Very few reports have indicated PD-L1 expression in pediatric patients.</p>

	<p>Monitoring the level of responsiveness of patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DoCs) represents an issue in all the settings where there is not the daily presence of clinicians, such as long-term and domestic settings. The involvement of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; informal caregivers (i.e., patients&amp;amp;rsquo; family) in such a monitoring process is thus fundamental. However, to date, no standardized tailored-made instruments exist that informal caregivers can use without the presence of clinicians, despite evidence illustrating the good accuracy of caregivers when expressing their opinions about the level of responsiveness of DoC patients. The present work aims to set the foundational knowledge, to create a standardized instrument that is able to assess the level of responsiveness of patients with DoCs by their informal caregivers. After selecting and modifying the items to be included in the new scale from the gold standard to diagnose DoCs (i.e., the Coma Recovery Scale-revised), and following a consensus process, we created the Social and Family Evaluation (SAFE) scale for caregivers of patients with DoCs. Although the SAFE needs a validation process, with the present work we provided its preliminary description along with insights into its clinical utility.</p>

	<p>Our study aimed to assess functional, structural changes of the right ventricular using strain parameters and sleep structure using polysomnography in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Our study group consisted of 43 patients, 29 men, 14 women. The mean age was 56.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.77. All patients underwent full night polysomnography and transthoracic echocardiography. The right ventricular global longitudinal strain was measured by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography. The prevalence of OSA (AHI &amp;amp;ge; 5) was 76.7% in the studied group. We observed a significant positive correlation between OAH and average free wall strain (r = 0.37), snore and mid-free wall strain (r = 0.34), average HR, and basal free wall strain (r = 0.34). Moreover, CSB was positively correlated with basal septal strain and mid septal strain (r = 0.36 and 0.42). In summary, among patients with sleep disorders, functional disorders of the right ventricle, assessed using the strain method, are partly observed.</p>

	<p>Objective: While cavernous carotid aneurysms can cause neurological symptoms, their often-uneventful natural course and the increasing options of intravascular aneurysm closure call for educated decision-making. However, evidence-based guidelines are missing. Here, we report 64 patients with cavernous carotid aneurysms, their respective therapeutic strategies, and follow-up. Methods: We included all patients with cavernous carotid aneurysms who presented to our clinic between 2014 and 2020 and recorded comorbidities (elevated blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and nicotine consumption), PHASES score, aneurysm site, size and shape, therapeutic strategy, neurological deficits, and clinical follow-up. Results: The mean age of the 64 patients (86% female) was 53 years, the mean follow-up time was 3.8 years. A total of 22 patients suffered from cranial nerve deficit. Of these patients, 50% showed a relief of symptoms regardless of the therapy regime. We found no significant correlations between aneurysm size or PHASES score and the occurrence of neurological symptoms. Conclusion: If aneurysm specific symptoms persist over a longer period of time, relief is difficult to achieve despite aneurysm treatment. Patients should be advised by experts in neurovascular centers, weighing the possibility of an uneventful course against the risks of treatment. In this regard, more detailed prospective data is needed to improve individual patient counseling.</p>

	<p>Despite an abundance of research related to the functional and structural changes of the brain in patients with geriatric depression, knowledge related to early alterations such as decreased white matter connectivity and their association with cognitive decline remains lacking. We aimed to investigate early alterations in hippocampal microstructure and identify their associations with memory function in geriatric patients with subclinical depression. Nineteen participants with subclinical geriatric depression and 19 healthy controls aged &amp;amp;ge;65 years exhibiting general cognitive function within the normal range were included in the study and underwent assessments of verbal memory. Hippocampal subfield volumes were determined based on T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (T1-MPRAGE) images, while group tractography and connectometry analyses were conducted using diffusion tensor images. Our findings indicated that the volumes of whole bilateral hippocampus, cornus ammonis (CA) 1, molecular layer, left subiculum, CA3, hippocampal tail, right CA4, and granule cell/molecular layers of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG) were significantly smaller in the subclinical depression group than in the control group. In the subclinical depression group, verbal learning was positively correlated with the volumes of the CA1, GC-ML-DG, molecular layer, and whole hippocampus in the right hemisphere. The fractional anisotropy of the bilateral fornix was also significantly lower in the subclinical depression group and exhibited a positive correlation with verbal learning and recall in both groups. Our results suggest that hippocampal microstructure is disrupted and associated with memory in patients with subclinical depression.</p>

	<p>Cerebellar dysfunction can be associated with ataxia, dysarthria, dysmetria, nystagmus and cognitive deficits. While cerebellar dysfunction can be caused by vascular, traumatic, metabolic, genetic, inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic events, the cerebellum is also a frequent target of autoimmune attacks. The underlying cause for this vulnerability is unclear, but it may be a result of region-specific differences in blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier permeability, the high concentration of neurons in the cerebellum and the presence of autoantigens on Purkinje cells. An autoimmune response targeting the cerebellum&amp;amp;mdash;or any structure in the CNS&amp;amp;mdash;is typically accompanied by an influx of peripheral immune cells to the brain. Under healthy conditions, the brain is protected from the periphery by the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier, blood&amp;amp;ndash;CSF barrier, and blood&amp;amp;ndash;leptomeningeal barrier. Entry of immune cells to the brain for immune surveillance occurs only at the blood-CSF barrier and is strictly controlled. A breakdown in the barrier permeability allows peripheral immune cells uncontrolled access to the CNS. Often&amp;amp;mdash;particularly in infectious diseases&amp;amp;mdash;the autoimmune response develops because of molecular mimicry between the trigger and a host protein. In this review, we discuss the immune surveillance of the CNS in health and disease and also discuss specific examples of autoimmunity affecting the cerebellum.</p>

	<p>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggle to access high-quality health care due to the shortage of trained providers. ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Autism is a unique educational program that allows ASD experts to provide knowledge and skills to professionals in local communities to deliver evidence-based care to children with ASD and their families. The model teaches clinicians how to screen and diagnose ASD, as well as manage common co-occurring medical and mental health issues. ECHO Autism is particularly useful for addressing the complex needs of children with ASD and reducing disparities often present in rural and underserved communities. The model can be disseminated globally due to its flexibility in accommodating local and regional differences in social norms and constructs. This article provides an overview of the format of the ECHO Autism model, data supporting the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficacy, and discusses future research directions.</p>

	<p>The synapsin family offers a strong linkage between synaptic mechanisms and the epileptic phenotype. Synapsins are phosphoproteins reversibly associated with synaptic vesicles. Synapsin deficiency can cause epilepsy in humans, and synapsin II (SynII) in knockout (KO) mice causes generalized epileptic seizures. To differentiate between the direct effect of SynII versus its secondary adaptations, we used neonatal intracerebroventricular injections of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing SynII. We found that SynII reintroduction diminished the enhanced synaptic activity in Syn2 KO hippocampal slices. Next, we employed the epileptogenic agent 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and found that SynII reintroduction completely rescued the epileptiform activity observed in Syn2 KO slices upon 4-AP application. Finally, we developed a protocol to provoke behavioral seizures in young Syn2 KO animals and found that SynII reintroduction balances the behavioral seizures. To elucidate the mechanisms through which SynII suppresses hyperexcitability, we injected the phospho-incompetent version of Syn2 that had the mutated protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site. The introduction of the phospho-incompetent SynII mutant suppressed the epileptiform and seizure activity in Syn2 KO mice, but not to the extent observed upon the reintroduction of native SynII. These findings show that SynII can directly suppress seizure activity and that PKA phosphorylation contributes to this function.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major health problem in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients. We described the clinical and sociodemographic factors of MDD among patients with PD at a national neurological referral center in Mexico. One hundred patients with PD + MDD were included in the study. All the patients were evaluated during the &amp;amp;ldquo;ON&amp;amp;rdquo; treatment phase of PD. Clinical scales for cognition (MMSE and MoCA) and MDD (MADRS) were applied. The mean age was 58.49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.02 years, and 57% of the sample was male. The most frequent symptom of PD was tremor (67%), and onset was more frequent on the right side (57%). Additionally, 49% of the patients with PD had moderate to severe (M/S) MDD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most frequent antidepressant treatment (69%). The scores of the scales were MADRS 21.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.49, MoCA 21.06 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.65, and MMSE 26.67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.20. The females had lower MMSE scores compared to the males (p = 0.043). The patients with M/S MDD had more rigidity at the beginning of PD (p = 0.005), fewer march alterations (p = 0.023), and a greater prevalence of left-side initial disease (p = 0.037). Rigidity was associated with M/S MDD (OR 3.75 p = 0.013). MDD was slightly more frequent in the males than in the females. The MDD symptoms and cognitive impairment were worse in the female population.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using predictive validity to compare associations between brain damage and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Lesion-behavior mapping (LBM) provides a statistical map of the association between voxel-wise brain damage and individual differences in behavior. To understand whether two behaviors are mediated by damage to distinct brain regions, researchers often compare LBM beta weight outputs by either the overlap method (emphasizing differences) or by the correlation method (emphasizing similarity). However, both methods lack a principled way to determine LBM distinctness and are disconnected from a major goal of LBMs, that of predicting behavior from brain damage. Without such criteria, researchers may draw conclusions from numeric differences between LBMs that are irrelevant to predicting behavior from brain damage. Here, we developed and validated a Predictive Validity Comparison method (PVC) that establishes such a criterion by directly comparing two LBMs based on the difference in predictive accuracy: two LBMs are significantly different if they provide unique predictive power for the two behaviors assessed. Applying the PVC to two lesion-behavior stroke data sets (Ding et al., 2020; Pustina et al., 2018) demonstrated the utility of a statistical criterion for determining when individual differences across behaviors result from the same vs. different lesion patterns. Using region-of-interest based simulations derived from proportion damage in Brodmann regions from a large group of participants (n=131), PVC detected when two behaviors were mediated by different regions (high sensitivity) and determined when two behaviors were mediated by the same region (high specificity). By objectively determining whether two behavioral deficits can be explained by a single vs. distinct patterns of brain damage, the PVC provides a critical advance in establishing the brain bases of behavior. We have released a GUI-driven, open-access web app of this method to encourage widespread adoption.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human mesenchymal stem cells and derived extracellular vesicles reduce sensory neuron hyperexcitability and pain-related behaviors in a mouse model of osteoarthritis</a></h4>

              
                Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease characterized by joint pain and stiffness. In humans, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have been reported to alleviate pain in knee OA. Here, we used the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model of OA to investigate mechanisms by which MSCs and MSC-EVs influence pain-related behavior. We found that MSC and MSC-EV treated DMM mice displayed improved OA pain-related behavior (i.e. locomotion, digging and sleep) compared to untreated DMM mice. Improved behavior was not the result of reduced joint damage, but rather knee-innervating sensory neurons from MSC and MSC-EV treated mice did not display the hyperexcitability observed in untreated DMM mice. Furthermore, we found that MSC-EVs normalize sensory neuron hyperexcitability induced by nerve growth factor in vitro. Our study suggests that MSCs and MSC-EVs may reduce pain in OA by direct action on peripheral sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transient regulation of focal adhesion via Tensin3 is required for nascent oligodendrocyte differentiation</a></h4>

              
                The differentiation of oligodendroglia from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to complex and extensive myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a multistep process that involves largescale morphological changes with significant strain on the cytoskeleton. While key chromatin and transcriptional regulators of differentiation have been identified, their target genes responsible for the morphological changes occurring during OL myelination are still largely unknown. Here, we show that the regulator of focal adhesion, Tensin3 (Tns3), is a direct target gene of Olig2, Chd7, and Chd8, transcriptional regulators of OL differentiation. Tns3 is transiently upregulated and localized to cell processes of immature OLs, together with integrin-{beta}1, a key mediator of survival at this transient stage. Constitutive Tns3 loss-of-function leads to reduced viability in mouse and humans, with surviving knockout mice still expressing Tns3 in oligodendroglia. Acute deletion of Tns3 in vivo, either in postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) or in OPCs, leads to a two-fold reduction in OL numbers. We find that the transient upregulation of Tns3 is required to protect differentiating OPCs and immature OLs from cell death by preventing the upregulation of p53, a key regulator of apoptosis. Altogether, our findings reveal a specific time window during which transcriptional upregulation of Tns3 in immature OLs is required for OL differentiation likely by mediating integrin-{beta}1 survival signaling to the actin cytoskeleton as OL undergo the large morphological changes required for their terminal differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Constructive Connectomics: how neuronal axons get from here to there using gene-expression maps derived from their family trees</a></h4>

              
                During brain development, billions of axons must navigate over multiple spatial scales to reach specific neuronal targets, and so build the processing circuits that generate the intelligent behavior of animals. However, the limited information capacity of the zygotic genome puts a strong constraint on how, and which, axonal routes can be encoded. We propose and validate a mechanism of development that can provide an efficient encoding of this global wiring task. The key principle, confirmed through simulation, is that basic constraints on mitoses of neural stem cells--that mitotic daughters have similar gene expression to their parent and do not stray far from one another--induce a global hierarchical map of nested regions, each marked by the expression profile of its common progenitor population. Thus, a traversal of the lineal hierarchy generates a systematic sequence of expression profiles that traces a staged route, which growth cones can follow to their remote targets. We have analyzed gene expression data of developing and adult mouse brains published by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and found them consistent with our simulations: gene expression indeed partitions the brain into a global spatial hierarchy of nested contiguous regions that is stable at least from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. We use this experimental data to demonstrate that our axonal guidance algorithm is able to robustly extend arbors over long distances to specific targets, and that these connections result in a qualitatively plausible connectome. We conclude that, paradoxically, cell division may be the key to uniting the neurons of the brain.

Author SummaryThe embryological development of each brain installs an essentially identical communication network between its cells that is roughly as complex as that between the billions of people living on Earth. Although vast scientific resources are currently applied to identifying the final pattern of connections, the connectome, there has until now been relatively little effort to answer the fundamental question of how this complex network across billions of neurons realized through the mitotic elaboration of the initial embryonic cell. The problem is sharpened by the constraints that construction of the network is limited by the information budget of the initial genome, and that it has no pre-existing address space for placing neurons and guiding axons. We explain how Biology can solve this problem by using the family tree of neurons to install a global space of molecular addresses, which axons can use to navigate from their source neuron to its relatives. We provide experimental evidence for this familial address space in gene expression patterns of the developing mouse brain, and demonstrate through simulation that the experimentally observed address space indeed supports global navigation to produce a qualitatively plausible default connectome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sound-evoked responses of distinct neuron classes from the tail of the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Given its inputs from auditory structures and neuromodulatory systems, the posterior tail of the striatum is ideally positioned to influence behavioral responses to acoustic stimuli according to context and previous rewards. Results from previous studies indicate that neurons in this striatal region display selective responses to sounds. However, it is not clear whether different striatal cell classes code for distinct features of sounds, nor how different striatal output pathways may use acoustic information to guide behavior. Here we compared the sound-evoked responses of posterior striatal neurons that form the striatal direct pathway (and express the dopamine receptor D1) to the responses of neighboring neurons in naive mice. We achieved this via optogenetic photo-identification of D1-expressing neurons during extracellular electrophysiological recordings in awake head-fixed mice of both sexes. We found that the frequency tuning of sound-responsive direct-pathway striatal neurons is comparable to that of their sound-responsive neighbors. Moreover, we found that both populations encode amplitude modulated sounds in a similar fashion. These results suggest that different classes of neurons in the posterior striatum of naive animals have similar access to acoustic features conveyed by the auditory system even outside the context of an auditory task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tango for Two: Modeling Synchronization and Social Interaction in Turn-Taking</a></h4>

              
                Individuals can synchronize their body movements with regular auditory signals such as a metronome with a wide range of success. We investigate whether synchronizing with a regular auditory metronome is affected by each persons spontaneous production rate (SPR) and by hearing a partners synchronization in a social context. Musically trained and untrained participants synchronized their tapping with an auditory cue presented at different rates (their own SPR or their partners SPR) and in a Solo or Joint (turn-taking) condition. Linear and nonlinear oscillator models were fit to participants mean asynchronies (signed timing differences between the cued onsets and taps). Participants synchrony improved in Joint turn-taking trials when the auditory metronome was cued at the participants own SPR than at their partners SPR; in contrast, synchronization did not differ across rates in the Solo condition. Asynchronies in the Joint task became larger as the difference between partners spontaneous rates increased; the increased asynchronies were driven by the faster partner who did not slow down to match the rate of their slower partner. Nonlinear delay-coupled models (with time delay, coupling strength, and intrinsic frequency) outperformed linear models (intrinsic frequency only) in accounting for tappers synchronization adjustments. The nonlinear models coupling value was increased for musically trained participants, relative to untrained participants. Overall, these findings suggest that both intrinsic differences in partners spontaneous rates and the social turn-taking context contribute to the range of synchrony in the general population. Delay-coupled models are capable of capturing the wide range of individual differences in auditory-motor synchronization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypoconnectivity between anterior insula and amygdala in neonates with familial history of autism</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundAltered resting state functional connectivity (FC) involving the anterior insula (aINS), a key node in the salience network, has been reported consistently in autism.

MethodHere we examined, for the first time, FC between the aINS and the whole brain in a sample of full-term, postmenstrual age (PMA) matched neonates (mean 44.0 weeks, SD=1.5) who due to family history have high likelihood (HL) for developing autism (n=12) and in controls (n=41) without family history of autism (low likelihood, LL). Behaviors associated with autism were evaluated between 12 and 18 months (M=17.3 months, SD=2.5) in a subsample (25/53) of participants using the First Year Inventory (FYI).

ResultsCompared to LL controls, HL neonates showed hypoconnectivity between left aINS and left amygdala. Lower connectivity between the two nodes was associated with higher FYI risk scores in the social domain (r(25) = -.561, p=.003) and this association remained robust when maternal mental health factors were considered. Considering that a subsample of LL participants (n=14/41) underwent brain imaging during the fetal period at PMA 31 and 34 weeks, in an exploratory analysis, we evaluated prospectively development of the LaINS-Lamy connectivity and found that the two areas strongly coactivate throughout the third trimester of pregnancy.

ConclusionsThe study identifies left lateralized anterior insula - amygdala connectivity as a potential target of further investigation into neural circuitry that enhances likelihood of future onset of social behaviors associated with autism during neonatal and potentially prenatal periods.

	<p>Background: Children are especially sensitive to a broad range of influences and show a remarkable capacity for learning. One prominent example is declarative memory, which may be influenced by a variety of factors and is impaired in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Exercise and sleep, or both combined, might foster declarative memory. Methods: Here, 12 typically developing children (TDC) and 12 age-matched children with ADHD participated in an exercise and rest condition before a night in the sleep laboratory. Declarative memory was encoded before exercise or rest and retrieved before and after a night of sleep. Results: Exercise in TDC but rest in ADHD lead to a transient destabilization of declarative memory, while there were no more differences after a night of sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency was prolonged after exercise in both groups. Conclusions: Exercise leads to opposing effects on immediate declarative memory formation. The factors or contexts that promote or hinder declarative memory formation in children ADHD and TDC differ, and further work is needed to determine the recommendations for declarative learning in children with ADHD.</p>

	<p>This study examined the prospective relationships between preschoolers&amp;amp;rsquo; body mass index (BMI) and cognitive development. BMI, cognitive (i.e., Brigance), sex, and age data were collected from seven cohorts of children attending Head Start from 2012 to 2018. Children (N = 324) with two years of complete data were included. After controlling for the first year cognitive development scores, age, gender, and the cohort, the BMI was predictive of lower cognitive development scores in year two (B = &amp;amp;minus;0.06, &amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.14, t = &amp;amp;minus;3.19, p = 0.002). Female sex (B = 2.69, &amp;amp;beta; = 0.10, t = 2.30, p = 0.022) and older age (B = 0.02, &amp;amp;beta; = 0.15, t = 3.20, p &amp;amp;le; 0.001) were also shown to be statistically significant predictors of improved year two cognitive scores. The initial BMI scores were associated with poorer one year cognitive development scores in this sample of preschool children. Excessive body mass may contribute to numerous biological, psychological, and social factors that inhibit children with obesity from reaching their full cognitive potential, during a time in which brain development and cognitive skills development are at critical points of growth. Early childhood obesity interventions may have positive consequences for cognitive development, but additional prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.</p>

	<p>Veterans with difficult-to-diagnose conditions who receive care in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system can be referred for evaluation at one of three specialty VA War-Related Illness and Injury Study Centers (WRIISC). Veterans of the 1990&amp;amp;ndash;1991 Gulf War have long experienced excess rates of chronic symptoms associated with the condition known as Gulf War Illness (GWI), with hundreds evaluated at the WRIISC. Here we provide the first report from a cohort of 608 Gulf War Veterans seen at the WRIISC who completed questionnaires on chronic symptoms (&amp;amp;gt;6 months) consistent with GWI as well as prominent exposures during Gulf War deployment. These included veterans&amp;amp;rsquo; reports of hearing chemical alarms/donning Military-Ordered Protective Posture Level 4 (MOPP4) gear, pesticide use, and use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills as prophylaxis against the effects of nerve agents. Overall, veterans in the cohort were highly symptomatic and reported a high degree of exposures. In multivariable models, these exposures were significantly associated with moderate-to-severe chronic symptoms in neurocognitive/mood, fatigue/sleep, and pain domains. Specifically, exposure to pesticides was associated with problems with concentration and memory, problems sleeping, unrefreshing sleep, and joint pain. Use of MOPP4 was associated with light sensitivity and unrefreshing sleep and use of PB was associated with depression. We also evaluated the association of exposures with symptom summary scores based on veterans&amp;amp;rsquo; severity of symptoms in four domains and overall. In multivariable modeling, the pain symptom severity score was significantly associated with pesticide use (Odds ratio (OR): 4.13, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.78&amp;amp;ndash;9.57) and taking PB pills (OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.02&amp;amp;ndash;5.09), and overall symptom severity was significantly associated with use of PB pills (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;5.75). Conclusion: Decades after deployment, Gulf War veterans referred to a VA tertiary evaluation center report a high burden of chronic symptoms, many of which were associated with reported neurotoxicant exposures during the war.</p>

     alt="BET protein inhibition in macrophages enhances dorsal root ganglion neurite outgrowth in female mice"/>
<p>Treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 does not enhance sensory and motor regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in female mice (Top). Direct neuronal BET inhibition reduces neurite outgrowth in DRG explants (Middle). However, BET-inhibited macrophages secrete pro-regenerative factors, probably anti-inflammatory cytokines that enhance STAT 6 phosphorylation and neuritogenesis ex vivo (Bottom).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve regeneration is limited after injury, especially in humans, due to the large distance the axons have to grow in the limbs. This process is highly dependent on the expression of neuroinflammatory factors produced by macrophages and glial cells. Given the importance of the epigenetic BET proteins on inflammation, we aimed to ascertain if BET inhibition may have an effect on axonal outgrowth. For this purpose, we treated female mice with JQ1 or vehicle after sciatic nerve crush injury and analyzed target reinnervation. We also used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) culture explants to analyze the effects of direct BET inhibition or treatment with conditioned medium from BET-inhibited macrophages. We observed that although JQ1 produced an enhancement of IL-4, IL-13, and GAP43 expression, it did not have an effect on sensory or motor reinnervation after crush injury in vivo. In contrast, JQ1 reduced neurite growth when interacting directly with DRG neurons ex vivo, whereas conditioned medium from JQ1-treated macrophages promoted neurite outgrowth. Therefore, BET-inhibited macrophages secrete pro-regenerative factors that induce neurite outgrowth, and that may counteract the direct inhibition of BET proteins in neurons in vivo. Finally, we observed an activation of the STAT6 pathway in DRG explants treated with conditioned medium from JQ1-treated macrophages. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that BET protein inhibition in macrophages provides a mechanism to enhance axonal outgrowth. However, specific targeting of BET proteins to macrophages will be needed to efficiently enhance functional recovery after nerve injury.</p>

                BackgroundCognitive flexibility encompasses the ability to efficiently shift focus and forms a critical component of goal-directed attention. The neural substrates of this process are incompletely understood in part due to difficulties in sampling the involved circuitry.

MethodsStereotactic intracranial recordings that permit direct resolution of local-field potentials from otherwise inaccessible structures were employed to study moment-to-moment attentional activity in children with epilepsy during the performance of an attentional set-shifting task. A combined deep learning and model-agnostic feature explanation approach was used to analyze these data and decode attentionally-relevant neural features. Connectomic profiling of highly predictive attentional nodes was further employed to examine task-related engagement of large-scale functional networks.

ResultsThrough this approach, we show that beta/gamma power within executive control, salience, and default mode networks accurately predicts single-trial attentional performance. Connectomic profiling reveals that key attentional nodes exclusively recruit dorsal default mode subsystems during attentional shifts.

ConclusionsThe identification of distinct substreams within the default mode system supports a key role for this network in cognitive flexibility and attention in children. Furthermore, convergence of our results onto consistent functional networks despite significant inter-subject variability in electrode implantations supports a broader role for deep learning applied to intracranial electrodes in the study of human attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interaction of human keratinocytes and nerve fiber terminals at the neuro-cutaneous unit</a></h4>

              
                Traditionally, peripheral sensory neurons hold the monopole of transducing external stimuli. Current research moves epidermal keratinocytes into focus as sensors and transmitters of nociceptive and non-nociceptive sensations, tightly interacting with intraepidermal nerve fibers at the neuro-cutaneous unit. In animal models, epidermal cells establish close contacts and ensheath sensory neurites. However, ultrastructural morphological and mechanistic data examining the human keratinocyte-nociceptor interface are sparse. We investigated this exact interface in human skin applying super-resolution array tomography, expansion microscopy, and structured illumination microscopy. We show keratinocyte ensheathment of nociceptors and connexin 43 plaques at keratinocyte-nociceptor contact sites in healthy native skin. We further derived a fully human co-culture system, modeling ensheathment and connexin 43 plaques in vitro. Unraveling human intraepidermal nerve fiber ensheathment and interaction sites marks a milestone in research at the neuro-cutaneous unit. These findings are mind-changers on the way to decipher the mechanisms of cutaneous nociception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcranial photobiomodulation enhances visual working memory capacity in humans</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) is a novel and noninvasive intervention, which has shown promise for improving cognitive performances. Whether tPBM can modulate brain activity and thereby enhance working memory (WM) capacity in humans remains unclear. In this study, we delivered double-blind and sham-control tPBM with different wavelengths to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 90 healthy participants and conducted four electroencephalography (EEG) experiments to investigate whether individual visual working memory capacity and related neural response could be modulated. We found that 1064 nm tPBM applied to the right PFC has both a substantial impact on visual working memory capacity and occipitoparietal contralateral delay activity (CDA), no matter orientation or color feature of the memorized objects. Importantly, the CDA set-size effect during the retention mediated the effect between 1064 nm tPBM and subsequent WM performance. However, these behavioral benefits and the corresponding changes of CDA set-size effect were absent with tPBM at 852 nm wavelength or with the stimulation on the left PFC. Our findings provide converging evidence that 1064 nm tPBM applied on the right PFC can improve visual working memory capacity, as well as explain the individuals electrophysiologyical changes about behavioral benefits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">iPSC-based modeling of THD recapitulates disease phenotypes and reveals neuronal malformation</a></h4>

              
                Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to dopaminergic depletion and early-onset parkinsonism. Affected children present with either a severe form that does not respond to L-Dopa treatment (THD-B), or a milder L-Dopa responsive form (THD-A). We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from THD patients that were differentiated into dopaminergic neurons (DAn) and compared with control-DAn from healthy individuals and gene-corrected isogenic controls. Consistent with patients, THD iPSC-DAn displayed lower levels of DA metabolites and reduced TH expression, when compared to controls. Moreover, THD iPSC-DAn showed abnormal morphology, including reduced total neurite length and either an abnormal TH proximodistal gradient (THDA), or neurite arborization defects (THDB). Treatment of THD-iPSC-DAn with L-Dopa rescued the neuronal defects and disease phenotype only in THDA-DAn. Interestingly, L-Dopa treatment at the stage of neuronal precursors could prevent the alterations in THDB-iPSC-DAn, thus suggesting the existence of a critical developmental window in THD. Our iPSC-based model recapitulates THD disease phenotypes and response to treatment, representing a promising tool for investigating pathogenic mechanisms, drug screening, and personalized management.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Monkeys exhibit human-like gaze biases in economic decisions</a></h4>

              
                In economic decision-making individuals choose between items on the basis of their perceived value. For both humans and nonhuman primates, these decisions are often carried out while shifting gaze between the available options. Recent studies in humans suggest that these shifts in gaze actively influence choice, manifesting as a bias in favor of the items that are viewed first, viewed last, or viewed for the overall longest duration in a given trial. This suggests the existence of a mechanism that links gaze behavior to the neural computations underlying value-based choices. In order to identify this mechanism, it is first necessary to develop and validate a suitable animal model of this behavior. To this end, we have created a novel value-based choice task for macaque monkeys that captures the essential features of the human paradigms in which gaze biases have been observed. Using this task, we identified gaze biases in the monkeys that were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in humans. In addition, the monkeys gaze biases were well-explained using a sequential sampling model framework previously used to describe gaze biases in humans--the first time this framework has been used to explore value-based choice mechanisms in nonhuman primates. Together, these findings suggest a common mechanism that can explain gaze-related choice biases across species, and open the way for mechanistic studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brevican, Neurocan, Tenascin-C and Tenascin-R Act as Important Regulators of the Interplay between Perineuronal Nets, Synaptic Integrity, Inhibitory Interneurons and Otx2</a></h4>

              
                Fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons are critical for the function of mature cortical inhibitory circuits. Most of these neurons are enwrapped by a specialized extracellular matrix structure (ECM) called perineuronal net (PNN), which can regulate their synaptic input. In this study, we investigated the relationship between PNNs, parvalbumin interneurons and synaptic distribution on these cells in the adult primary visual cortex (V1) of quadruple knockout mice deficient for the ECM molecules brevican, neurocan, tenascin-C and tenascin-R. We used super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to analyze PNN structure and associated synapses. Additionally, we examined parvalbumin and calretinin interneuron populations. We observed a reduction in the number of PNN-enwrapped cells and a clear disorganization of the PNN structure in the quadruple knockout V1. This was accompanied by an imbalance of inhibitory and excitatory synapses with a reduction of inhibitory and an increase of excitatory synaptic elements along the PNNs. Also, the number of parvalbumin interneurons was reduced in the quadruple knockout, while calretinin interneurons, which do not wear PNNs did not display differences in number. Interestingly, we found the transcription factor Otx2 homeoprotein positive cell population also reduced. Otx2 is crucial for parvalbumin and PNN maturation and a positive feedback loop between these parameters has been described. Collectively, these data indicate an important role of brevican, neurocan, tenascin-C and tenascin-R in regulating the interplay between PNNs, inhibitory interneurons, synaptic distribution as well as Otx2 in the V1.

	<p>Automatic and accurate classification of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is a challenging and promising task. Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) can classify images at the pixel level. Adding an attention mechanism to the Fully Convolutional Network can effectively improve the classification performance of the model. However, the self-attention mechanism ignores the potential correlation between different samples. Aiming at this problem, we propose a new method for image classification of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease based on the external-attention mechanism. The external-attention module is added after the fourth convolutional block of the fully convolutional network model. At the same time, the double normalization method of Softmax and L1 norm is introduced to obtain a better classification performance and richer feature information of the disease probability map. The activation function Softmax can increase the degree of fitting of the neural network to the training set, which transforms linearity into nonlinearity, thereby increasing the flexibility of the neural network. The L1 norm can avoid the attention map being affected by especially large (especially small) eigenvalues. The experiments in this paper use 550 three-dimensional MRI images and use five-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that the proposed image classification method for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, combining the external-attention mechanism with double normalization, can effectively improve the classification performance of the model. With this method, the accuracy of the MLP-A model is 92.36%, the accuracy of the MLP-B model is 98.55%, and the accuracy of the fusion model MLP-C is 98.73%. The classification performance of the model is higher than similar models without adding any attention mechanism, and it is better than other comparison methods.</p>

	<p>The Aberdeen birth cohorts of 1921 and 1936 (ABC21 and ABC36) were subjected to IQ tests in 1932 or 1947 when they were aged about 11y. They were recruited between 1997&amp;amp;ndash;2001 among cognitively healthy community residents and comprehensively phenotyped in a long-term study of brain aging and health up to 2017. Here, we report associations between baseline cognitive test scores and long-term cognitive outcomes. On recruitment, significant sex differences within and between the ABC21 and ABC36 cohorts supported advantages in verbal ability and learning among the ABC36 women that were not significant in ABC21. Comorbid physical disorders were self-reported in both ABC21 and ABC36 but did not contribute to differences in terms of performance in cognitive tests. When used alone without other criteria, cognitive tests scores which fell below the &amp;amp;minus;1.5 SD criterion for tests of progressive matrices, namely verbal learning, digit symbol and block design, did not support the concept that Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a stable class of acquired loss of function with significant links to the later emergence of a clinical dementia syndrome. This is consistent with many previous reports. Furthermore, because childhood IQ-type data were available, we showed that a lower cognitive performance at about 64 or 78 y than that predicted by IQ at 11 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.5 y did not improve the prediction of progress to MCI or greater cognitive loss. We used binary logistic regression to explore how MCI might contribute to the prediction of later progress to a clinical dementia syndrome. In a fully adjusted model using ABC21 data, we found that non-amnestic MCI, along with factors such as female sex and depressive symptoms, contributed to the prediction of later dementia. A comparable model using ABC36 data did not do so. We propose that (1) MCI criteria restricted to cognitive test scores do not improve the temporal stability of MCI classifications; (2) pathways towards dementia may differ according to age at dementia onset and (3) the concept of MCI may require measures (not captured here) that underly self-reported subjective age-related cognitive decline.</p>

	<p>Tinnitus is often triggered by cochlear damage and has been linked with aberrant patterns of neuronal activity. Acoustic Coordinated Reset (CR&amp;amp;reg;) Neuromodulation is a sound therapy hypothesised to reduce tinnitus symptoms by desynchronising pathological brain activity using a portable acoustic device (the T30 neurostimulator). We report results of a pivotal trial to test the efficacy of this intervention. This two-centre, double-blind randomised controlled trial with long-term open-label extension, was undertaken between February 2012 and February 2014 in the UK. Participants were 100 adults with tinnitus as a primary complaint, recruited through hearing clinics and media advertisements. Intervention was the device programmed either with the proprietary sound sequence or placebo algorithm, fit by one of five trained audiologists. Minimisation software provided group allocation (1:1 randomisation), with groups matched for age, gender, hearing loss and tinnitus severity. Allocation was masked from participants and assessors during the trial. The primary measure of efficacy was change in tinnitus symptom severity between groups, measured using the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were other measures of tinnitus symptom severity, health-related quality of life, and perceptual characteristics (pitch, loudness, bandwidth) at 12 weeks, and Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire at 36 weeks (open-label extension). A statistician blinded to the allocation conducted an intention-to-treat analysis that employed linear regressions on minimisation variables, trial centre and intervention group, with multiple imputations for missing data. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01541969). We screened 391 individuals and assigned interventions to 100 eligible participants. The primary outcome was not statistically significant between groups (mean group = &amp;amp;minus;0.45, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus;5.25 to 4.35; p = 0.85), nor were any of the secondary outcomes. Four adverse events occurred during the trial. Analysis of tinnitus symptom severity data collected across the 24-week open-label extension showed no statistically significant within-group changes after 12, 24, or 36 weeks treatment with the proprietary sound sequence. While individual participants may benefit from sound therapy, Acoustic CR&amp;amp;reg; Neuromodulation did not lead to group-mean reductions on tinnitus symptom severity or other measures compared to placebo, or over time.</p>

	<p>Positive and negative moods tend to have differential effects on lexico-semantic processing in the native language (L1). Though accumulating evidence points to dampened sensitivity to affective stimuli in the non-native language (L2), little is known about the effects of positive and negative moods on L2 processing. Here, we show that lexico-semantic processing is differently affected by positive and negative moods only in L1. Unbalanced Polish&amp;amp;ndash;English bilinguals made meaningfulness judgments on L1 and L2 sentences during two EEG recording sessions featuring either positive- or negative-mood-inducing films. We observed a reduced N1 (lexical processing) for negative compared to positive mood in L2 only, a reduced N2 (lexico-semantic processing) in negative compared to positive mood in L1 only, a reduced N400 (lexico-semantic processing) for meaningless compared to meaningful L1 sentences in positive mood only, and an enhanced late positive complex (semantic integration and re-analysis) for L2 compared to L1 meaningful sentence in negative mood only. Altogether, these results suggest that positive and negative moods affect lexical, lexico-semantic, and semantic processing differently in L1 and L2. Our observations are consistent with previous accounts of mood-dependent processing and emotion down-regulation observed in bilinguals.</p>

In this study, participants engaged in a soccer task and estimated the likelihood of successful passes in personal and social scenarios. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that personal optimism bias varied as a positive function of gray matter volume (GMV) in the putamen, frontal pole, hippocampus, temporal pole, inferior temporal gyrus, visual association areas, and mid-superior temporal gyrus. Social optimism bias correlated positively with GMV in the temporoparietal junction and negatively with GMV in the inferior temporal gyrus and pre-supplementary motor areas. Together, these findings suggest that parts of our optimistic outlook are biologically rooted. Moreover, while the two biases looked similar at the behavioral level, they were related to distinct gray matter structures, proposing that their underlying mechanisms are not identical.</p>

	<p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that a deficiency of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) mediates dysfunction of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most commonly known single-gene cause of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Nevertheless, animal and human studies regarding the link between FMRP and mGluR5 expression provide inconsistent or conflicting findings about the nature of those relationships. Since multiple clinical trials of glutamatergic agents in humans with FXS did not demonstrate the amelioration of the behavioral phenotype observed in animal models of FXS, we sought measure if mGluR5 expression is increased in men with FXS to form the basis for improved clinical trials. Unexpectedly marked reductions in mGluR5 expression were observed in cortical and subcortical regions in men with FXS. Reduced mGluR5 expression throughout the living brains of men with FXS provides a clue to examine FMRP and mGluR5 expression in FXS. In order to develop the findings of our previous study and to strengthen the objective tools for future clinical trials of glutamatergic agents in FXS, we sought to assess the possible value of measuring both FMRP levels and mGluR5 expression in men with FXS. We aimed to show the value of measurement of FMRP levels and mGluR5 expression for the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with FXS and related conditions. We administered 3-[18F]fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile ([18F]FPEB), a specific mGluR5 radioligand for quantitative measurements of the density and the distribution of mGluR5s, to six men with the full mutation (FM) of FXS and to one man with allele size mosaicism for FXS (FXS-M). Utilizing the seven cortical and subcortical regions affected in neurodegenerative disorders as indicator variables, adjusted linear regression of mGluR5 expression and FMRP showed that mGluR5 expression was significantly reduced in the occipital cortex and the thalamus relative to baseline (anterior cingulate cortex) if FMRP levels are held constant (F(7,47) = 6.84, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001).These findings indicate the usefulness of cerebral mGluR5 expression measured by PET with [18F]FPEB and FMRP values in men with FXS and related conditions for assessments in community facilities within a hundred-mile radius of a production center with a cyclotron. These initial results of this pilot study advance our previous study regarding the measurement of mGluR5 expression by combining both FMRP levels and mGluR5 expression as tools for meaningful clinical trials of glutamatergic agents for men with FXS. We confirm the feasibility of this protocol as a valuable tool to measure FMRP levels and mGluR5 expression in clinical trials of individuals with FXS and related conditions and to provide the foundations to apply precision medicine to tailor treatment plans to the specific needs of individuals with FXS and related conditions.</p>

Retromer proteins positively associated with soluble tau, whereas pathogenic tau negatively correlated with retromer proteins and cathepsin-D activity. Retromer deficiency and consequent reduction of cathepsin-D activity may contribute to pathogenic tau accumulation, thus, retromer represents a viable therapeutic target against tau pathology in Down syndrome.

                Background: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and its associated factors among people living with HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh.   Methods: This cross-sectional study, which took place in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from July to December 2020, included 338 HIV-positive people. The method used was a simple random sampling technique. The Beck Depression Inventory assessed depression in HIV-positive people (BDI).    Results: More than 62 percent of the 338 people surveyed had severe depression, 30.5 percent had moderate depression, 5.6 percent had mild depression, and 1.8 percent had no depression at all. Age, being a man, being married, and having a low monthly income were all significant predictors of depression.  Conclusions: This study found that depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among HIV-positive patients in Bangladesh. The authors recommend that health care providers address depressive disorders for people with HIV/ AIDS comprehensively.

<p>Satellite microglia associate with different neuron types in the adult murine CNS. Their frequency correlates with the neuron density in a given brain region whereas a preference for neurons of a specific transmitter subtype is not apparent.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). In the adult uncompromised CNS, they have a highly ramified morphology and continuously extend and retract their processes. A subpopulation of microglial cells forms close soma-to-soma contacts with neurons and have been termed satellite microglia, yet the role of such interaction is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the distribution of satellite microglia in different areas of the CNS of adult male mice applying transgenic- and immunolabeling of neuronal subtypes and microglia followed by three-dimensional imaging analysis. We quantified satellite microglia associated with GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the somatosensory cortex, striatum, and thalamus; with dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the basal forebrain and raphe nucleus, respectively; and with cerebellar Purkinje cell neurons. Satellite microglia in the retina were assessed qualitatively. Microglia form satellites with all neuronal subtypes studied, whereas a preference for a specific neuron subtype was not found. The occurrence and frequency of satellite microglia is determined by the histo-architectural organization of the brain area and the densities of neuronal somata therein.</p>

Network-based approaches are becoming increasingly popular for drug discovery as they provide a systems-level overview of the mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology. They have demonstrated significant early promise over other methods of biological data representation, such as in target discovery, side effect prediction and drug repurposing. In parallel, an explosion of -omics data for the deep characterization of biological systems routinely uncovers molecular signatures of disease for similar applications. Here, we present RPath, a novel algorithm that prioritizes drugs for a given disease by reasoning over causal paths in a knowledge graph (KG), guided by both drug-perturbed as well as disease-specific transcriptomic signatures. First, our approach identifies the causal paths that connect a drug to a particular disease. Next, it reasons over these paths to identify those that correlate with the transcriptional signatures observed in a drug-perturbation experiment, and anti-correlate to signatures observed in the disease of interest. The paths which match this signature profile are then proposed to represent the mechanism of action of the drug. We demonstrate how RPath consistently prioritizes clinically investigated drug-disease pairs on multiple datasets and KGs, achieving better performance over other similar methodologies. Furthermore, we present two case studies showing how one can deconvolute the predictions made by RPath as well as predict novel targets.

The increasing availability of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from various developmental systems provides the opportunity to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) directly from data. Herein we describe IQCELL, a platform to infer, simulate, and study executable logical GRNs directly from scRNA-seq data. Such executable GRNs allow simulation of fundamental hypotheses governing developmental programs and help accelerate the design of strategies to control stem cell fate. We first describe the architecture of IQCELL. Next, we apply IQCELL to scRNA-seq datasets from early mouse T-cell and red blood cell development, and show that the platform can infer overall over 74% of causal gene interactions previously reported from decades of research. We will also show that dynamic simulations of the generated GRN qualitatively recapitulate the effects of known gene perturbations. Finally, we implement an IQCELL gene selection pipeline that allows us to identify candidate genes, without prior knowledge. We demonstrate that GRN simulations based on the inferred set yield results similar to the original curated lists. In summary, the IQCELL platform offers a versatile tool to infer, simulate, and study executable GRNs in dynamic biological systems.

Integration of multi-omics data with molecular interaction networks enables elucidation of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using the latest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including proxy cases and the STRING interactome, we identified an AD network of 142 risk genes and 646 network-proximal genes, many of which were linked to synaptic functions annotated by mouse knockout data. The proximal genes were confirmed to be enriched in a replication GWAS of autopsy-documented cases. By integrating the AD gene network with transcriptomic data of AD and healthy temporal cortices, we identified 17 gene clusters of pathways, such as up-regulated complement activation and lipid metabolism, down-regulated cholinergic activity, and dysregulated RNA metabolism and proteostasis. The relationships among these pathways were further organized by a hierarchy of the AD network pinpointing major parent nodes in graph structure including endocytosis and immune reaction. Control analyses were performed using transcriptomics from cerebellum and a brain-specific interactome. Further integration with cell-specific RNA sequencing data demonstrated genes in our clusters of immunoregulation and complement activation were highly expressed in microglia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Predicting drug polypharmacology from cell morphology readouts using variational autoencoder latent space arithmetic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuen Ler Chow, Shantanu Singh, Anne E. Carpenter, Gregory P. Way</p>

A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a machine learning algorithm, useful for generating a compressed and interpretable latent space. These representations have been generated from various biomedical data types and can be used to produce realistic-looking simulated data. However, standard vanilla VAEs suffer from entangled and uninformative latent spaces, which can be mitigated using other types of VAEs such as β-VAE and MMD-VAE. In this project, we evaluated the ability of VAEs to learn cell morphology characteristics derived from cell images. We trained and evaluated these three VAE variants—Vanilla VAE, β-VAE, and MMD-VAE—on cell morphology readouts and explored the generative capacity of each model to predict compound polypharmacology (the interactions of a drug with more than one target) using an approach called latent space arithmetic (LSA). To test the generalizability of the strategy, we also trained these VAEs using gene expression data of the same compound perturbations and found that gene expression provides complementary information. We found that the β-VAE and MMD-VAE disentangle morphology signals and reveal a more interpretable latent space. We reliably simulated morphology and gene expression readouts from certain compounds thereby predicting cell states perturbed with compounds of known polypharmacology. Inferring cell state for specific drug mechanisms could aid researchers in developing and identifying targeted therapeutics and categorizing off-target effects in the future.

                <p>by Nir Gavish, Guy Katriel</p>

COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for children of age five and older in many countries. However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether children should be vaccinated and at what priority. In this work, we use mathematical modeling and optimization to study how vaccine allocations to different age groups effect epidemic outcomes. In particular, we consider the effect of extending vaccination campaigns to include the vaccination of children. When vaccine availability is limited, we consider Pareto-optimal allocations with respect to competing measures of the number of infections and mortality and systematically study the trade-offs among them. In the scenarios considered, when some weight is given to the number of infections, we find that it is optimal to allocate vaccines to adolescents in the age group 10-19, even when they are assumed to be less susceptible than adults. We further find that age group 0-9 is included in the optimal allocation for sufficiently high values of the basic reproduction number.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bacterial age distribution in soil—Generational gaps in adjacent hot and cold spots</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benedict Borer, Dani Or</p>

Resource patchiness and aqueous phase fragmentation in soil may induce large differences local growth conditions at submillimeter scales. These are translated to vast differences in bacterial age from cells dividing every thirty minutes in close proximity to plant roots to very old cells experiencing negligible growth in adjacent nutrient poor patches. In this study, we link bacterial population demographics with localized soil and hydration conditions to predict emerging generation time distributions and estimate mean bacterial cell ages using mechanistic and heuristic models of bacterial life in soil. Results show heavy-tailed distributions of generation times that resemble a power law for certain conditions, suggesting that we may find bacterial cells of vastly different ages living side by side within small soil volumes. Our results imply that individual bacteria may exist concurrently with all of their ancestors, resulting in an archive of bacterial cells with traits that have been gained (and lost) throughout time–a feature unique to microbial life. This reservoir of bacterial strains and the potential for the reemergence of rare strains with specific functions may be critical for ecosystem stability and function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Gene-rich germline-restricted chromosomes in black-winged fungus gnats evolved through hybridization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christina N. Hodson, Kamil S. Jaron, Susan Gerbi, Laura Ross</p>

Germline-restricted DNA has evolved in diverse animal taxa and is found in several vertebrate clades, nematodes, and flies. In these lineages, either portions of chromosomes or entire chromosomes are eliminated from somatic cells early in development, restricting portions of the genome to the germline. Little is known about why germline-restricted DNA has evolved, especially in flies, in which 3 diverse families, Chironomidae, Cecidomyiidae, and Sciaridae, carry germline-restricted chromosomes (GRCs). We conducted a genomic analysis of GRCs in the fungus gnat <i>Bradysia</i> (<i>Sciara</i>) <i>coprophila</i> (Diptera: Sciaridae), which has 2 large germline-restricted “L” chromosomes. We sequenced and assembled the genome of <i>B</i>. <i>coprophila</i> and used differences in sequence coverage and k-mer frequency between somatic and germline tissues to identify GRC sequence and compare it to the other chromosomes in the genome. We found that the GRCs in <i>B</i>. <i>coprophila</i> are large, gene rich, and have many genes with divergent homologs on other chromosomes in the genome. We also found that 2 divergent GRCs exist in the population we sequenced. GRC genes are more similar in sequence to genes from another Dipteran family (Cecidomyiidae) than to homologous genes from Sciaridae. This unexpected finding suggests that these chromosomes likely arose in Sciaridae through hybridization with a related lineage. These results provide a foundation from which to answer many questions about the evolution of GRCs in Sciaridae, such as how this hybridization event resulted in GRCs and what features on these chromosomes cause them to be restricted to the germline.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Characterising metabolomic signatures of lipid-modifying therapies through drug target mendelian randomisation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tom G. Richardson, Genevieve M. Leyden, Qin Wang, Joshua A. Bell, Benjamin Elsworth, George Davey Smith, Michael V. Holmes</p>

Large-scale molecular profiling and genotyping provide a unique opportunity to systematically compare the genetically predicted effects of therapeutic targets on the human metabolome. We firstly constructed genetic risk scores for 8 drug targets on the basis that they primarily modify low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (HMGCR, PCKS9, and NPC1L1<i>)</i>, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (CETP), or triglycerides (APOC3, ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and LPL). Conducting mendelian randomisation (MR) provided strong evidence of an effect of drug-based genetic scores on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk with the exception of ANGPTL3. We then systematically estimated the effects of each score on 249 metabolic traits derived using blood samples from an unprecedented sample size of up to 115,082 UK Biobank participants. Genetically predicted effects were generally consistent among drug targets, which were intended to modify the same lipoprotein lipid trait. For example, the linear fit for the MR estimates on all 249 metabolic traits for genetically predicted inhibition of LDL cholesterol lowering targets HMGCR and PCSK9 was r<sup>2</sup> = 0.91. In contrast, comparisons between drug classes that were designed to modify discrete lipoprotein traits typically had very different effects on metabolic signatures (for instance, HMGCR versus each of the 4 triglyceride targets all had r<sup>2</sup> < 0.02). Furthermore, we highlight this discrepancy for specific metabolic traits, for example, finding that LDL cholesterol lowering therapies typically had a weak effect on glycoprotein acetyls, a marker of inflammation, whereas triglyceride modifying therapies assessed provided evidence of a strong effect on lowering levels of this inflammatory biomarker. Our findings indicate that genetically predicted perturbations of these drug targets on the blood metabolome can drastically differ, despite largely consistent effects on risk of CAD, with potential implications for biomarkers in clinical development and measuring treatment response.

                Background: Clomiphene citrate (CC) is known to improve semen quality for men with infertility, but there are no published algorithms to predict the changes in an individual’s semen parameters following CC therapy. Since there are multiple options to treat men with infertility, a model to predict the outcomes of CC therapy would allow men to make a more informed decision on their treatment choices.  Methods: This is a prospective study on a cohort of 121 infertile men being treated empirically with CC 25 mg every other day for a minimum of three months.  Men were included if they did not have other active fertility therapies other than the use of supplements.  Semen samples and a hormone profile (including total testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and leutinizing hormone (LH)) were provided prior to and at least three months after initiation of therapy.  The patient age, pre-CC hormone values and semen parameters were used to develop a nomogram to predict the post-CC hormone values and semen parameters. The model was developed with predictors selected using backward selection methods by minimizing root mean square error evaluated on 500 bootstrap runs. A zero-inflated negative binomial modeling (ZINB) approach was used to model sperm concentration and sperm motility.  A generalized linear model for the Gamma distribution was used to model testosterone. A linear model was used to model log transformed LH, FSH and semen volume.  Results:  Post-CC sperm parameters and hormone values were predicted by the pre-CC sperm concentration, hormone values and patient.  Nomograms were developed to predict the outcomes of CC therapy based on pre-CC parameters.     Conclusion:   These new models will help physicians personalize care by predicting the outcomes of therapy and allow clinicians to tailor the treatment to the individual couple.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">On the development of B-Raf inhibitors acting through innovative mechanisms [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                B-Raf is a protein kinase participating to the regulation of many biological processes in cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that this protein is frequently overactivated in human cancers, especially when it bears activating mutations. In recent years, few ATP-competitive inhibitors of B-Raf have been marketed for the treatment of melanoma and are currently under clinical evaluation on a variety of other types of cancer. Although the introduction of drugs targeting B-Raf has provided significant advances in cancer treatment, responses to such ATP-competitive inhibitors remain limited, mainly due to selectivity issues, side effects, narrow therapeutic windows, and the insurgence of drug resistance. Impressive research efforts have been made so far towards the identification of novel ATP-competitive modulators with improved efficacy against cancers driven by mutant Raf monomers and dimers, some of them showing good premises. However, several limitations could still be envisioned for these compounds, according to recent literature data. Besides, increased attentions have recently arisen around approaches based on the design of allosteric modulators, polypharmacology, PROTACs and drug repurposing for the targeting of B-Raf proteins. The design of compounds acting through such innovative mechanisms is rather challenging. However, novel valuable therapeutic opportunities can be envisioned on these drugs, as they act through innovative mechanisms in which limitations typically observed for approved ATP-competitive B-Raf inhibitors are less prone to emerge. In this article, the most recent approaches adopted for the design of non-ATP competitive inhibitors targeting B-Raf are described, discussing also on the possibilities, ligands acting through such innovative mechanisms could provide for the obtainment of more effective therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">External stressors prior to traumatic knee injury: A cohort study on youth athletes. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Data on external stressors, such as social and environment variables and other "life events", and its relation to injury in youth athletic population are scarce. Investigating if external stressors is associated with injury risk may help coaches and other team staff to provide a more safe sport environment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate different aspects of external stressors and its potential association to traumatic knee injury in youth athletes. Methods: This study comprised of youth female and male athletes from Swedish national sports high schools, aged 15–19 years, participating and competing in soccer, handball, or floorball. The athletes recorded any traumatic knee injury that had occurred during high-school in a web-based injury form. Data on external stressors and subjective perceived stress was also collected. Results: The majority (60%) of stress factors noted was related to sport context. More athletes in the injured group of athletes reported life event stressor (p=0.001) and experienced stress more often (p=0.02) compared to the group of non-injured athletes. No differences between injured and non-injured athletes in terms of change of club, team coach, training protocol or game formation were noted (p>0.05). A weak correlation (r=0.20, p=0.02) was found between the number of stressors and injuries. Conclusions: A high prevalence of external stressors are present in youth elite athletes with a majority of stress factors related to sport context. Life event stressors are present prior to injury and seem to be associated with traumatic knee injury to some degree.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Using social annotation to construct knowledge with others: A case study across undergraduate courses [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social annotation (SA) is a genre of learning technology that enables the addition of digital notes to shared texts and affords contextualized peer-to-peer online discussion. A small body of literature examines how SA, as asynchronous online discussion, can contribute to students’ knowledge construction (KC)—or a process whereby learners collaborate through shared socio-cognitive practices. This case study analyzed how SA enabled student participation in seven KC activities, such as interpretation and elaboration. Methods: We analyzed 2,121 annotations written by 59 students in three undergraduate courses at a Canadian University in the Winter 2019 semester. Using a method of open coding and constant comparison, we coded each annotation for evidence of KC activities. Results: Results showed a range of KC activities in students’ SA. Across courses, interpretation was the most common KC activity (40%), followed by elaboration (20%). Annotations that were part of peer-to-peer discussion included all seven types of KC activities, but some activities, such as consensus building, support, and conflict, were almost exclusively found in replies to others. Conclusions: This study suggests that SA is a productive form of online learning through which undergraduate students in multiple disciplinary contexts can interact with peers, make sense of academic content, and construct knowledge by reading and writing together.

                Aversion toward unfamiliarity is a hallmark of autism. Kruettner et al. show that in Shank3ΔC/ΔC autism model mice, exposure to novel environments lacking familiar features produces failure to engage and repetitive behaviors upon context re-exposure. Therefore, behavioral therapies involving familiarity might prevent the emergence of autism phenotypes in predisposed individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Corticohippocampal circuit dysfunction in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic variants in <i>SCN1A</i> encoding the Nav1.1 sodium channel subunit, characterized by treatment-resistant epilepsy, temperature-sensitive seizures, developmental delay/intellectual disability with features of autism spectrum disorder, and increased risk of sudden death. Convergent data suggest hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) pathology in DS (<i>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></i>) mice. We performed two-photon calcium imaging in brain slice to uncover a profound dysfunction of filtering of perforant path input by DG in young adult <i>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice. This was not due to dysfunction of DG parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs), which were only mildly impaired at this timepoint; however, we identified enhanced excitatory input to granule cells, suggesting that circuit dysfunction is due to excessive excitation rather than impaired inhibition. We confirmed that both optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal cortex and selective chemogenetic inhibition of DG PV-INs lowered seizure threshold <i>in vivo </i>in young adult <i>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice. Optogenetic activation of PV-INs, on the other hand, normalized evoked responses in granule cells <i>in vitro.</i> These results establish the corticohippocampal circuit as a key locus of pathology in <i>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup> </i>mice and suggest that PV-INs retain powerful inhibitory function and may be harnessed as a potential therapeutic approach towards seizure modulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Signature-scoring methods developed for bulk samples are not adequate for cancer single-cell RNA sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying the activity of gene expression signatures is common in analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Methods originally developed for bulk samples are often used for this purpose without accounting for contextual differences between bulk and single-cell data. More broadly, these methods have not been benchmarked. Here we benchmark five such methods, including single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), AUCell, Single Cell Signature Explorer (SCSE), and a new method we developed, Jointly Assessing Signature Mean and Inferring Enrichment (JASMINE). Using cancer as an example, we show cancer cells consistently express more genes than normal cells. This imbalance leads to bias in performance by bulk-sample-based ssGSEA in gold standard tests and down sampling experiments. In contrast, single-cell-based methods are less susceptible. Our results suggest caution should be exercised when using bulk-sample-based methods in single-cell data analyses, and cellular contexts should be taken into consideration when designing benchmarking strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Blocking Kir6.2 channels with SpTx1 potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from murine pancreatic β cells and lowers blood glucose in diabetic mice</a></h4>

              
                ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels in pancreatic β cells are comprised of pore-forming subunits (Kir6.2) and modulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR1). The ATP sensitivity of these channels enables them to couple metabolic state to insulin secretion in β cells. Antidiabetic sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide target SUR1 and indirectly suppress Kir6.2 activity. Glibenclamide acts as both a primary and a secondary secretagogue to trigger insulin secretion and potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, respectively. We tested whether blocking Kir6.2 itself causes the same effects as glibenclamide, and found that the Kir6.2 pore-blocking venom toxin SpTx1 acts as a strong secondary, but not a strong primary, secretagogue. SpTx1 triggered a transient rise of plasma insulin and lowered the elevated blood glucose of diabetic mice overexpressing Kir6.2 but did not affect those of nondiabetic mice. This proof-of-concept study suggests that blocking Kir6.2 may serve as an effective treatment for diabetes and other diseases stemming from K<sub>ATP</sub> hyperactivity that cannot be adequately suppressed with sulfonylureas.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KDM6B interacts with TFDP1 to activate P53 signalling in regulating mouse palatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic regulation plays extensive roles in diseases and development. Disruption of epigenetic regulation not only increases the risk of cancer, but can also cause various developmental defects. However, the question of how epigenetic changes lead to tissue-specific responses during neural crest fate determination and differentiation remains understudied. Using palatogenesis as a model, we reveal the functional significance of <i>Kdm6b</i>, a H3K27me3 demethylase, in regulating mouse embryonic development. Our study shows that <i>Kdm6b</i> plays an essential role in cranial neural crest development, and loss of <i>Kdm6b</i> disturbs P53 pathway-mediated activity, leading to complete cleft palate along with cell proliferation and differentiation defects in mice. Furthermore, activity of H3K27me3 on the promoter of <i>Trp53 </i>is antagonistically controlled by <i>Kdm6b</i>, and <i>Ezh2 </i>in cranial neural crest cells. More importantly, without <i>Kdm6b</i>, the transcription factor TFDP1, which normally binds to the promoter of <i>Trp53</i>, cannot activate <i>Trp53</i> expression in palatal mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the function of <i>Kdm6b</i> in activating <i>Trp53</i> in these cells cannot be compensated for by the closely related histone demethylase <i>Kdm6a</i>. Collectively, our results highlight the important role of the epigenetic regulator KDM6B and how it specifically interacts with TFDP1 to achieve its functional specificity in regulating <i>Trp53</i> expression, and further provide mechanistic insights into the epigenetic regulatory network during organogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Architecture and evolution of the cis-regulatory system of the echinoderm kirrelL gene</a></h4>

              
                The gene regulatory network (GRN) that underlies echinoderm skeletogenesis is a prominent model of GRN architecture and evolution. <i>KirrelL</i> is an essential downstream effector gene in this network and encodes an Ig-superfamily protein required for the fusion of skeletogenic cells and the formation of the skeleton. In this study, we dissected the transcriptional control region of the <i>kirrelL </i>gene of the purple sea urchin, <i>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</i>. Using plasmid- and BAC-based transgenic reporter assays, we identified key <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factor inputs that regulate <i>Sp-kirrelL</i>, including direct, positive inputs from two key transcription factors in the skeletogenic GRN, Alx1 and Ets1. We next identified <i>kirrelL</i> <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions from seven other echinoderm species that together represent all classes within the phylum. By introducing these heterologous regulatory regions into developing sea urchin embryos we provide evidence of their remarkable conservation across ~500 million years of evolution. We dissected in detail the <i>kirrelL</i> regulatory region of the sea star, <i>Patiria miniata</i>, and demonstrated that it also receives direct inputs from Alx1 and Ets1. Our findings identify <i>kirrelL</i> as a component of the ancestral echinoderm skeletogenic GRN. They support the view that GRN sub-circuits, including specific transcription factor-CRE interactions, can remain stable over vast periods of evolutionary history. Lastly, our analysis of <i>kirrelL</i> establishes direct linkages between a developmental GRN and an effector gene that controls a key morphogenetic cell behavior, cell-cell fusion, providing a paradigm for extending the explanatory power of GRNs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis for an unprecedented enzymatic alkylation in cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                The cyanobacterial enzyme CylK assembles the cylindrocyclophane natural products by performing two unusual alkylation reactions, forming new carbon-carbon bonds between aromatic rings and secondary alkyl halide substrates. This transformation is unprecedented in biology and the structure and mechanism of CylK are unknown. Here, we report x-ray crystal structures of CylK, revealing a distinctive fusion of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding domain and a β-propeller fold. We use a mutagenic screening approach to locate CylK's active site at its domain interface, identifying two residues, Arg105 and Tyr473, that are required for catalysis. Anomalous diffraction datasets collected with bound bromide ions, a product analog, suggest these residues interact with the alkyl halide electrophile. Additional mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations implicates Asp440 in activating the nucleophilic aromatic ring. Bioinformatic analysis of CylK homologs from other cyanobacteria establishes that they conserve these key catalytic amino acids but they are likely associated with divergent reactivity and altered secondary metabolism. By gaining a molecular understanding of this unusual biosynthetic transformation, this work fills a gap in our understanding of how alkyl halides are activated and used by enzymes as biosynthetic intermediates, informing enzyme engineering, catalyst design, and natural product discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Event-related causality in Stereo-EEG discriminates syntactic processing of noun phrases and verb phrases</a></h4>

              
                Syntax involves complex neurobiological mechanisms, which are difficult to disentangle for multiple reasons. Using a protocol able to separate syntactic information from sound information we investigated the neural causal connections evoked by the processing of homophonous phrases, either verb phrases (VP) or noun phrases (NP). We used event-related causality (ERC) from stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in 10 epileptic patients in multiple cortical areas, including language areas and their homologous in the non-dominant hemisphere. We identified the different networks involved in the processing of these syntactic operations (faster in the dominant hemisphere) showing that VPs engage a wider cortical network. We also present a proof-of-concept for the decoding of the syntactic category of a perceived phrase based on causality measures. Our findings help unravel the neural correlates of syntactic elaboration and show how a decoding based on multiple cortical areas could contribute to the development of speech prostheses for speech impairment mitigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical compensation for afferent loss in older adults: Associations with GABA and speech recognition in noise</a></h4>

              
                Age-related deficits in auditory nerve (AN) function reduce afferent input to the auditory cortex. The extent to which the auditory cortex in older adults compensates for this loss of afferent input, also known as central gain, and the mechanisms underlying this compensation are not well understood. We took a neural systems approach to estimate central gain, measuring AN and cortical evoked responses within 50 older and 27 younger adults. Amplitudes were significantly smaller for older than for younger adults for AN responses but not for cortical responses. We used the relationship between AN and cortical response amplitudes in younger adults to predict cortical response amplitudes for older adults from their AN responses. Central gain in older adults was thus defined as the difference between their observed cortical responses and those predicted from the parameter estimates of younger adults. More central gain was associated with decreased cortical levels of GABA measured with 1H-MRS and poorer speech recognition in noise (SIN). Effects of central gain and GABA on SIN occur in addition to, and independent from, effects attributed to elevated hearing thresholds. Our results are consistent with animal models of central gain and suggest that reduced AN afferent input in some older adults may result in changes in cortical encoding and inhibitory neurotransmission, which contribute to reduced SIN. An advancement in our understanding of the changes that occur throughout the auditory system in response to the gradual loss of input with increasing age may provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

SignificanceAge-related hearing loss is one of the most common chronic conditions of aging, yet little is known about how the cortex compensates for this loss of sensory input. We measured AN and cortical responses to the same stimulus in younger and older adults. In older adults we found an increase in cortical activity following concomitant declines in afferent input that are consistent with central gain. Increased central gain was associated with lower levels of cortical GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which predicted poorer speech recognition in noise. The results suggest that the cortex in older adults can compensate for attenuated sensory input by reducing inhibition to amplify the cortical response, but this amplification may lead to poorer speech recognition in noise.

                Autosomal recessive mutations in either PRKN or PINK1 are associated with early-onset Parkinsons disease. The corresponding proteins, PRKN, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the mitochondrial serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1 play a role in mitochondrial quality control. Using CRISPR/CAS9 technology we generated three human iPSC lines from the well characterized AIW002-02 control line. These isogenic iPSCs contain homozygous knockouts of PRKN (PRKN-KO, CBIGi001-A-1), PINK1 (PINK1-KO, CBIGi001-A-2) or both PINK1 and PRKN (PINK1-KO/PRKN-KO, CBIGi001-A-3). The knockout lines display normal karyotypes, express pluripotency markers and upon differentiation into relevant brain cells or midbrain organoids may be valuable tools to model Parkinsons disease.

                The tremendous increase of video-based eye tracking has made it possible to collect data from thousands of participants. Traditional manual detection and classification procedures for saccades and trial categorization is not viable for the large data sets being collected. Additionally, high-speed video-based eye trackers now allow for the novel analysis of pupil responses and blink behavior. Here we present a detailed description of our pipeline for collecting data, storing data, organizing participant codes, and cleaning data, which are fairly lab-specific but nonetheless important precursory steps in establishing standardized pipelines. More importantly, we also include descriptions of the automated detection and classification of saccades, blinks,  blincades (blinks occurring during saccades), and boomerang saccades (two saccades in opposite directions that occur almost simultaneously so that speed-based algorithms fail to split them), which are almost entirely task-agnostic and can be used on a wide variety of data. We additionally describe novel findings about post-saccadic oscillations, and provide a method to get more accurate estimates for end-points of saccades. Lastly, we describe the automated behavior classification for the Interleaved Pro- and Anti-Saccade Task (IPAST), a well-known task that probes voluntary and inhibitory control. This pipeline was evaluated using data collected from 592 human participants between 5 and 93 years of age, making it robust enough to handle large clinical patient data sets as well. In sum, this pipeline has been optimized to consistently handle large data sets obtained from diverse study cohorts (i.e., development, aging, clinical), and collected across multiple laboratory sites.

                Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common complication of diabetes, but the underlying molecular pathogenesis remains unclear. Accumulating evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in DPN, while their expressions and functions in Schwann cell (SC) are rarely reported. Here, we performed protein profiling and circRNA sequencing on the peripheral nerves of patients with or without DPN. A total of 265 differentially expressed proteins were identified in DPN by protein profiling, which mainly enrich in myelination according to Gene Ontology analysis. Further, 15637 circRNAs were identified by circRNA sequencing, of which 11 were verified to be dysregulated. Among them, circ_0002538 was found to be downregulated in DPN and chosen for further investigation. Functional experiments revealed that circ_0002538 overexpression promoted SC migration and relieved demyelination in DPN. Mechanistic studies revealed that circ_0002538 could promote PLLP expression by sponging miR-138-5p, while lack of circ_0002538 led to PLLP deficiency, which further suppressed SC migration and caused demyelination. The present research provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of DPN, in which the circ_0002538/miR-138-5p/PLLP axis was suppressed in SCs and hence caused demyelination. These findings expanded the role of circRNAs in DPN and provided potential therapeutic targets for DPN.

                Rabies viral vectors have become important components of the systems neuroscience toolkit, allowing both direct retrograde targeting of projection neurons and monosynaptic tracing of inputs to defined postsynaptic populations, but the rapid cytotoxicity of first-generation ({Delta}G) vectors limits their use to short-term experiments. We recently introduced second-generation, double-deletion-mutant ({Delta}GL) rabies viral vectors, showing that they efficiently retrogradely infect projection neurons and express recombinases effectively but with little to no detectable toxicity; more recently, we have shown that {Delta}GL viruses can be used for monosynaptic tracing with far lower cytotoxicity than the first-generation system. Here we introduce third-generation ({Delta}L) rabies viral vectors, which, like first-generation vectors, have only a single gene deleted from their genomes (in this case the viral polymerase gene L) but which we find are as nontoxic as second-generation ones: using longitudinal structural and functional two-photon imaging in mouse visual cortex in vivo, we found that they did not kill labeled neurons or perturb their response properties over the entire months-long courses of imaging. Although third-generation vectors are therefore phenotypically very similar to second-generation ones, we show that they have the major advantage of growing to much higher titers, and this key difference results in 25% - 525% increased numbers of retrogradely labeled neurons in vivo. These {Delta}L rabies viral vectors therefore constitute a new state of the art for nontoxic, pathway-specific expression of recombinases and transactivators in mammalian neurons selected on the basis of their axonal projections. Because replication of deletion-mutant rabies viruses within complementing cells is precisely the process that underlies monosynaptic tracing, the higher replication efficiency of this new class of rabies viral vectors furthermore suggests the potential to provide the foundation of an improved nontoxic monosynaptic tracing system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The estrous cycle modulates early-life adversity effects on mouse avoidance behavior through progesterone signaling</a></h4>

              
                Early-life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to develop neuropsychiatric conditions, which are more prevalent in women than men. Efforts to model this sex difference in rodents have produced mixed results, with some studies paradoxically showing stronger phenotypes in males than females. Since changes in reproductive hormone levels can increase the likelihood of anxiety disorders in women, we examined the effects of ELA on adult female mice across the estrous cycle. We found that during diestrus, when the ratio of progesterone to estrogen is relatively high, ELA mice exhibit increased avoidance behavior, altered activity levels in specific contexts, and increased theta oscillation power in the ventral hippocampus. Ovariectomy, which eliminates circulating estrogen but not progesterone, unexpectedly preserved some of the effects present in diestrus ELA mice. Progesterone receptor antagonism in diestrus normalized avoidance behavior in ELA mice, while treatment with a negative allosteric modulator of the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone promoted avoidance behavior in control mice. These results suggest that altered progesterone and allopregnanolone signaling during diestrus increases avoidance behavior in ELA mice
