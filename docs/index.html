              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assessing pupil size as an index of activation of subcortical ascending arousal system nuclei during rest</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory nuclei that are part of the ascending arousal system (AAS) play a crucial role in regulating cortical state and optimizing task performance. Pupil diameter, under constant luminance conditions, is increasingly used as an index of activity of these AAS nuclei. Indeed, task-based functional imaging studies in humans have begun to provide evidence of stimulus-driven pupil-AAS coupling. However, whether there is such a tight pupil-AAS coupling during rest is not clear. To address this question, we examined simultaneously acquired resting-state fMRI and pupil-size data from 74 participants, focusing on six AAS nuclei: the locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and cholinergic basal forebrain. Activation in all six AAS nuclei was optimally correlated with pupil size at 0- to 2-second lags, suggesting that spontaneous pupil changes were almost immediately followed by corresponding BOLD-signal changes in the AAS. These results suggest that spontaneous changes in pupil size that occur during states of rest can be used as a noninvasive general index of activity in AAS nuclei. Importantly, the nature of pupil-AAS coupling during rest appears to be vastly different from the relatively slow canonical hemodynamic response function that has been used to characterize task-related pupil-AAS coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Methadone alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation in human cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women has become an epidemic in the United States. Pharmacological interventions for OUD involve methadone, a synthetic opioid analgesic that attenuates withdrawal symptoms and behaviors linked with maternal drug addiction. However, methadone's ability to readily accumulate in neural tissue, and cause long-term neurocognitive sequelae, has led to concerns regarding its effect on prenatal brain development. We took advantage of human cortical organoid (hCO) technology to probe how this drug impacts the earliest mechanisms giving rise to the cerebral cortex. To this end, we conducted bulk mRNA sequencing of 2-month-old hCOs derived from two cell lines that were chronically treated with a clinically relevant dose of 1M methadone for 50 days. Differential expression and gene ontology analyses revealed a robust transcriptional response to methadone associated with functional components of the synapse, the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and cilia. Further unsupervised co-expression network and predictive protein-protein interaction analyses demonstrated that these changes occurred in concert, centered around a regulatory axis consisting of growth factors, developmental signaling pathways, and matricellular proteins. Our results demonstrate that exposure to methadone during early cortico-genesis fundamentally alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation, and that these changes arise by modulating extra-synaptic molecular mechanisms in the ECM and cilia. These findings provide novel insight into methadone's putative effect on cognitive and behavioral development and a basis for improving interventions for maternal opioid addiction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cookies rich in iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and antioxidants: a novel functional food potential for adolescent with anemia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anemia is a global public health problem, including Indonesia with 32% of adolescents are anemic. This study aims to process porang flour, moringa leaves, and tempe into cookies that are high in iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and antioxidants as potential functional food snacks for adolescents with anemia. Methods: This study is experimental with a completely randomized trial design (CRD) with three treatments and replications. There are three comparison formulations of a combination of porang, moringa leaves, and black soybean-based tempe; respectively F1 (91:3:3:3)%, F2 (85:3:6:6)%, and F3 (77:3:10:10)%. The cookie sample was then analyzed for water content, ash, iron, folic acid, cobalt, and antioxidant activity. The differences between the samples were analyzed based on the activity of antioxidants, iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in data obtained from triplicates using multivariate ANOVA analysis. Results: The results of the ash and water content tests of all three cookie formulations showed values in accordance with the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) for cookie products. F3 has significantly higher iron, folic acid, and cobalt levels than F1 and F2 (p<0.05). Antioxidant activity is highest in F3, but there is no statistical difference between F2 and F3 (p>0.05). Conclusions: The combination of porang's tubers, moringa leaves, and tempe made from black soybeans, especially F3, has the potential to be used as a functional cookie processed product source of iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin, and antioxidants for adolescent anemia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What is the association between common medications (indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen) and spontaneous intestinal perforations in premature infants? A systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) affects very low birth weight preterm neonates and accounts for 44% of gastrointestinal perforations. Commonly used medications such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen for PDA closure, increases the risk of intestinal perforation. Unfortunately, the majority of the data combine SIP with those affected by necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) despite them being separate entities. This systematic review aims to explore the association between the use of common medications and SIP in the premature infant cohort independently from NEC. Methods: Our study will focus on preterm infants with exposure to either indomethacin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen where SIP is a reported outcome. A health science librarian will search Medline and Medline in Process via OVID, Embase Classic + Embase via OVID, the LILACS database, the ScIELO database and the Cochrane Library including EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Search dates for each database will be from their respective dates of inception to March 2022. All articles will undergo screening by two independent reviewers, and if selected, data extraction with risk of bias assessment by two independent reviewers. A third reviewer will settle any disagreements that may occur. Incidence of SIP will be measured as a proportion. Individual proportions will be pooled using a random effects logistic regression model. The comparative incidence of SIP by treatment group will be measured using the odds ratio. Odds ratios will be pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model for meta-analysis. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42017058603

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Burden of disease in Colombian Orinoquia, 2017 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Population health diagnoses are a fundamental tool to guide health policies and programs, and consequently, public health requirements. In this perspective, the burden of disease in inhabitants of Colombian Orinoquia is quantified for the first time. Methods: A descriptive population-based study that was based on secondary sources was carried out, which aimed at measuring the burden of the disease in the Colombian region of Orinoquia, using the simplified synthetic indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the global health estimation methodology. We used mortality records from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and service provision records from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, both records from the year 2017, available on the Integrated Social Protection Information System. Results: 288,740.2 DALYs occurred (95% UI 210,714.6-382,948.8), with higher reports for men (59%); group of non-communicable diseases accounted for 62.3% of DALY (179,993.6, 95% UI, 115,030.2-268,405.0), followed by external cause injuries group which contributed 24.6% (71,000.0, 95% UI, 25,638.1-134,013.1), and group of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders which contributed 13.1% (37,746.0, 95% UI, 28,048.0-50,239.7). Interpersonal violence was the primary cause specific of DALYs with 9.8% of the burden, (28,290.0, 95% UI, 7,365.1-64,208.1). Conclusions: Most DALYs in Orinoquia are produced by non-communicable diseases (NCD), largely caused by neoplasms and cardiovascular disease, which increased with age. However, when considered by specific cause of illness or injury, interpersonal violence is indicated as the main cause of DALYs, affecting mainly young men, possibly as an expression of social inequality, substance use, criminality, and insecurity. It is important to highlight that this region has been recognized as an area of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and poverty.

                Agronomic traits of plants especially those of economic or aesthetic importance are threatened by climatic and environmental factors such as climate change, biotic, and abiotic stresses. These threats are now being mitigated through the analyses of omics data like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics. The emergence of high-throughput omics technology has led to an avalanche of plant omics data. Plant research demands novel analytical paradigms to extract and harness large plant omics data for plant improvement effectively and efficiently. Machine learning algorithms are well-suited analytical and computational approaches for the integrative analysis of large unstructured, heterogeneous datasets. This study presents an overview of omics approaches to improve plant agronomic traits and crucial curated plant genomic data sources. Furthermore, we summarize machine learning algorithms and software tools/programming packages used in plant omics research. Lastly, we discuss advancements in machine learning algorithms' applications in improving agronomic traits of economically important plants. Extensive application of machine learning would advance plant omics studies. These advancements would consequently help agricultural scientists improve economically important plants’ quality, yield, and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stresses and other plant health-threatening issues.

                Introduction Hand injuries are a recognized occupational hazard from the use of chaff cutters. With increasing mechanization of farming in our region, the burden of hand injuries is poised to increase. Methods We conducted a descriptive study of 47 patients presenting with chaff cutter hand injuries at our center in one year. Results They were predominantly male (98%) and the majority (70%) were aged between 21 and 40 years. The majority of patients who had not resumed work were those with severe injuries and those who had had an amputation. There was a positive correlation between age category and severity of injury. Discussion Chaff cutter injuries contribute considerably to hand amputations at our center. The majority of patients with severe injuries and those undergoing amputations do not return to gainful activities one year after sustaining the injury, suggesting increased dependency. Further research is paramount to identify safety features of chaff cutters in this region.

                Background: A growing population of cells accumulates mutations. A single mutation early in the growth process carries forward to all descendant cells, causing the final population to have a lot of mutant cells. When the first mutation happens later in growth, the final population typically has fewer mutants. The number of mutant cells in the final population follows the Luria-Delbrück distribution. The mathematical form of the distribution is known only from its probability generating function. For larger populations of cells, one typically uses computer simulations to estimate the distribution. Methods: This article searches for a simple approximation of the Luria-Delbrück distribution, with an explicit mathematical form that can be used easily in calculations. Results: The Fréchet distribution provides a good approximation for the Luria-Delbrück distribution for neutral mutations, which do not cause a growth rate change relative to the original cells. Conclusions: The Fréchet distribution apparently provides a good match through its description of extreme value problems for multiplicative processes such as exponential growth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Role of RAS signaling in ovarian cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The RAS family of proteins is among the most frequently mutated genes in human malignancies. In ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecological malignancy, RAS, especially KRAS mutational status at codons 12, 13, and 61, ranges from 6–65% spanning different histo-types. Normally RAS regulates several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular signaling cascades mediating numerous cellular processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion, and death. Aberrant activation of RAS leads to uncontrolled induction of several downstream signaling pathways such as RAF-1/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PI3K phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, RalGEFs, Rac/Rho, BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B), MEK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), PKB (protein kinase B) and PKC (protein kinase C) involved in cell proliferation as well as maintenance pathways thereby driving tumorigenesis and cancer cell propagation. KRAS mutation is also known to be a biomarker for poor outcome and chemoresistance in OC. As a malignancy with several histotypes showing varying histopathological characteristics, we focus on reviewing recent literature showcasing the involvement of oncogenic RAS in mediating carcinogenesis and chemoresistance in OC and its subtypes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integration of single-cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF data characterises heterogeneity of rare cell subpopulations [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The simultaneous measurement of cellular proteins and transcriptomes of single cell data has become an exciting new possibility with the advent of highly multiplexed multi-omics methodologies. However, mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a well-established, affordable technique for the analysis of proteomic data, which is well suited for the discovery and characterisation of very rare subpopulations of cells with a wealth of publicly available datasets. Methods: We present and evaluate the multimodal integration of single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF datasets coming from both matched and unmatched samples, using two publicly available datasets. Results: We demonstrate that the integration of well annotated CyTOF data with single cell RNA sequencing can aid in the identification and annotation of cell populations with high accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the integration can provide imputed measurements of protein markers which are comparable to the current gold standard of antibody derived tags (ADT) from CITE-Seq for both matched and unmatched datasets. Using this methodology, we identify and transcriptionally characterise a rare subpopulation of CD11c positive B cells in high resolution using publicly available data and we unravel its heterogeneity in a single cell setting without the need to sort the cells in advance, in a manner which had not been previously possible. Conclusions: This approach provides the framework for using available proteomic and transcriptomic datasets in a unified and unbiased fashion to assist ongoing and future studies of cellular characterisation and biomarker identification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Job Search during COVID-19: How Online Mindfulness Intervention helped to Reduce Stress and Enhance the Self-esteem of the Job Seeker [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Immediately after graduation from university, college students need to make significant decisions about starting their careers or pursuing higher studies. They are also pressured to meet the expectations and demands of self, others, and the environment. Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aforementioned challenging decisions may become hazardous stressors for college students. Hence, the researchers intended to assist and assess the college students involved in student placements. The research goal was to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on the stress and self-esteem of college students involved in student placements.  Methods: One hundred college students participating in the campus placements were selected using purposive sampling from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University in Coimbatore, India. For evaluation purposes, college students were administered the perceived stress, Rosenberg self-esteem, and Kuppuswamy socio-economic scales. Seventy-five college students were selected for the MBI process and were administered with a pre-intervention and post-intervention without a control group research design. Results: Statistical analysis including analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni post hoc test showed a significant increase in self-esteem and a decrease in the stress of the college students involved in placements. Conclusions: Thus, the researchers recommend that policymakers create awareness, include MBI in the curriculum, and allocate funds for training ventures in educational institutions to assist college students in their challenging life journeys

                Intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring abnormalities had been reported to correlate with decreased umbilical artery base excess associated with neonatal seizures. However, we present an infant born at 35 weeks of gestation diagnosed with cerebral palsy associated with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) without fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring abnormalities, According to the summary reports of PVL cases published on the home page of the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy (JOCSC)), the percentage of placenta previa without FHR monitoring abnormalities in the cases of PVL was 5.7% (12/209), which seemed to be higher than the total percentage of placenta previa reported in Japan (0.3-0.5%).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring parameters of cancer evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathan D. Lee, Ivana Bozic</p>

As a cancer develops, its cells accrue new mutations, resulting in a heterogeneous, complex genomic profile. We make use of this heterogeneity to derive simple, analytic estimates of parameters driving carcinogenesis and reconstruct the timeline of selective events following initiation of an individual cancer, where two longitudinal samples are available for sequencing. Using stochastic computer simulations of cancer growth, we show that we can accurately estimate mutation rate, time before and after a driver event occurred, and growth rates of both initiated cancer cells and subsequently appearing subclones. We demonstrate that in order to obtain accurate estimates of mutation rate and timing of events, observed mutation counts should be corrected to account for clonal mutations that occurred after the founding of the tumor, as well as sequencing coverage. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which often does not require treatment for years after diagnosis, presents an optimal system to study the untreated, natural evolution of cancer cell populations. When we apply our methodology to reconstruct the individual evolutionary histories of CLL patients, we find that the parental leukemic clone typically appears within the first fifteen years of life.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">CROCCP2 acts as a human-specific modifier of cilia dynamics and mTOR signaling to promote expansion of cortical progenitors</a></h4>

              
                van Heurck et al. identify CROCCP2, a hominid-specific gene duplicate, as a human-specific modifier of neurogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex. They find that CROCCP2 is necessary and sufficient to enhance human cortical progenitor amplification and acts by decreasing primary cilia dynamics and enhancing the mTOR pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Condensin DC loads and spreads from recruitment sites to create loop-anchored TADs in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Condensins are molecular motors that compact DNA via linear translocation. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the X-chromosome harbors a specialized condensin that participates in dosage compensation (DC). Condensin DC is recruited to and spreads from a small number of <i>r</i>ecruitment <i>e</i>lements on the <i>X</i>-chromosome (<i>rex</i>) and is required for the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs). We take advantage of autosomes that are largely devoid of condensin DC and TADs to address how <i>rex</i> sites and condensin DC give rise to the formation of TADs. When an autosome and X-chromosome are physically fused, despite the spreading of condensin DC into the autosome, no TAD was created. Insertion of a strong <i>rex</i> on the X-chromosome results in the TAD boundary formation regardless of sequence orientation. When the same <i>rex</i> is inserted on an autosome, despite condensin DC recruitment, there was no spreading or features of a TAD. On the other hand, when a ‘<i>super rex</i>’ composed of six <i>rex</i> sites or three separate <i>rex</i> sites are inserted on an autosome, recruitment and spreading of condensin DC led to the formation of TADs. Therefore, recruitment to and spreading from <i>rex</i> sites are necessary and sufficient for recapitulating loop-anchored TADs observed on the X-chromosome. Together our data suggest a model in which <i>rex</i> sites are both loading sites and bidirectional barriers for condensin DC, a one-sided loop-extruder with movable inactive anchor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The interpretation of computational model parameters depends on the context</a></h4>

              
                Reinforcement Learning (RL) models have revolutionized the cognitive and brain sciences, promising to explain behavior from simple conditioning to complex problem solving, to shed light on developmental and individual differences, and to anchor cognitive processes in specific brain mechanisms. However, the RL literature increasingly reveals contradictory results, which might cast doubt on these claims. We hypothesized that many contradictions arise from two commonly-held assumptions about computational model parameters that are actually often invalid: That parameters <i>generalize</i> between contexts (e.g. tasks, models) and that they capture <i>interpretable</i> (i.e. unique, distinctive) neurocognitive processes. To test this, we asked 291 participants aged 8–30 years to complete three learning tasks in one experimental session, and fitted RL models to each. We found that some parameters (exploration / decision noise) showed significant generalization: they followed similar developmental trajectories, and were reciprocally predictive between tasks. Still, generalization was significantly below the methodological ceiling. Furthermore, other parameters (learning rates, forgetting) did not show evidence of generalization, and sometimes even opposite developmental trajectories. Interpretability was low for all parameters. We conclude that the systematic study of context factors (e.g. reward stochasticity; task volatility) will be necessary to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of computational cognitive models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Optimized tight binding between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is required for the constitutively open nature of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel complex</a></h4>

              
                Tetrameric voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels have four identical voltage sensor domains, and they regulate channel gating. KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) is a voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel, and its auxiliary subunit KCNE proteins dramatically regulate its gating. For example, KCNE3 makes KCNQ1 a constitutively open channel at physiological voltages by affecting the voltage sensor movement. However, how KCNE proteins regulate the voltage sensor domain is largely unknown. In this study, by utilizing the KCNQ1-KCNE3-calmodulin complex structure, we thoroughly surveyed amino acid residues on KCNE3 and the S1 segment of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor facing each other. By changing the side-chain bulkiness of these interacting amino acid residues (volume scanning), we found that the distance between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is elaborately optimized to achieve the constitutive activity. In addition, we identified two pairs of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 mutants that partially restored constitutive activity by co-expression. Our work suggests that tight binding of the S1 segment and KCNE3 is crucial for controlling the voltage sensor domains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-resolution secretory timeline from vesicle formation at the Golgi to fusion at the plasma membrane in S. cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Most of the components in the yeast secretory pathway have been studied, yet a high-resolution temporal timeline of their participation is lacking. Here we define the order of acquisition, lifetime, and release of critical components involved in late secretion from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Of particular interest is the timing of the many reported effectors of the secretory vesicle Rab protein Sec4, including the myosin-V Myo2, the exocyst complex, the lgl homolog Sro7, and the small yeast-specific protein Mso1. At the trans-Golgi network (TGN) Sec4's GEF, Sec2, is recruited to Ypt31-positive compartments, quickly followed by Sec4 and Myo2 and vesicle formation. While transported to the bud tip, the entire exocyst complex, including Sec3, is assembled on to the vesicle. Before fusion, vesicles tether for 5s, during which the vesicle retains the exocyst complex and stimulates lateral recruitment of Rho3 on the plasma membrane. Sec2 and Myo2 are rapidly lost, followed by recruitment of cytosolic Sro7, and finally the SM protein Sec1, which appears for just 2 seconds prior to fusion. Perturbation experiments reveal an ordered and robust series of events during tethering that provide insights into the function of Sec4 and effector exchange.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography for whole-organ multicolor imaging with real-time molecular staining</a></h4>

              
                Rapid multicolor three-dimensional (3D) imaging for centimeter-scale specimens with subcellular resolution remains a challenging but captivating scientific pursuit. Here, we present a fast, cost-effective, and robust multicolor whole-organ 3D imaging method assisted with ultraviolet (UV) surface excitation and vibratomy-assisted sectioning, termed translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography (TRUST). With an inexpensive UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED) and a color camera, TRUST achieves widefield exogenous molecular-specific fluorescence and endogenous content-rich autofluorescence imaging simultaneously while preserving low system complexity and system cost. Formalin-fixed specimens are stained layer by layer along with serial mechanical sectioning to achieve automated 3D imaging with high staining uniformity and time efficiency. 3D models of all vital organs in wild-type C57BL/6 mice with the 3D structure of their internal components (e.g., vessel network, glomeruli, and nerve tracts) can be reconstructed after imaging with TRUST to demonstrate its fast, robust, and high-content multicolor 3D imaging capability. Moreover, its potential for developmental biology has also been validated by imaging entire mouse embryos (~2 days for the embryo at the embryonic day of 15). TRUST offers a fast and cost-effective approach for high-resolution whole-organ multicolor 3D imaging while relieving researchers from the heavy sample preparation workload.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a looming public health disaster with limited interventions. Progress in therapeutic development requires a more detailed understanding of molecular pathogenesis. Most data for AD pathogenesis in humans is from standard neuropathologic assessments, e.g., neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles or biochemical measurement of a limited number of analytes related to neuropathologic features, e.g., amyloid-{beta} peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau. Standard neuropathologic evaluation is highly valuable as it provides assessment of diseases that afflict an individual brain, but it also is limited in its ability to investigate molecular pathogenesis. Modern mass spectrometry-based proteomics enable quantitative insight into the protein phenotype in brains with AD neuropathology. Careful selection of specimens enabled us to investigate protein signatures specific to autosomal dominant AD dementia (ADD), sporadic ADD with minimal comorbidities, individuals without dementia who had high histopathologic burden of AD, and cognitively normal individuals with no or minimal AD histopathologic burden. All data are deposited in the ProteomeXchange proteomic data repositories (ID: PXD034525).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Target-distractor competition modulates saccade trajectories in space and object-space</a></h4>

              
                Saccade planning and execution can be affected by a multitude of factors present in a target selection task. Recent studies have shown that the similarity between a target and nearby distractors affects the curvature of saccade trajectories, due to target-distractor competition. To further understand the nature of this competition, we varied the distance between and the similarity of complex target and distractor objects in a delayed match-to-sample task to examine their effects on saccade trajectories and better understand the underlying neural circuitry. For trials with short saccadic reaction times (SRTs) when target-distractor competition is still active, we found a robust effect of distance consistent with saccade vector averaging, whereas the effect of similarity suggested the existence of an object-based suppressive surround. At longer SRTs there was sufficient time for competition between the objects to complete and the distractor to be inhibited, which resulted in saccade trajectory deviations exhibiting the effects of a spatial suppressive surround. In terms of similarity, as the target-distractor similarity decreased, the initial saccade angle shifted towards the target, reflecting stronger distractor inhibition. There were no interactions between distance and similarity at any point in the time-course of target-distractor competition. Taken together, saccade trajectories reflect target-distractor competition that is affected independently by both spatial and object-space suppressive surrounds. The differences in saccade trajectories at short and long SRTs distinguish between active and completed decision-making processes. Thus, saccade responses are more beneficial than manual responses in studies of decision-making models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissecting the chain of information processing and its interplay with neurochemicals and fluid intelligence across development</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has highlighted the role of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in perceptual, cognitive, and motor tasks. However, the exact involvement of these neurochemical mechanisms in the chain of information processing, and across human development, are unclear. In a cross-sectional longitudinal design, we used a computational approach to dissociate cognitive, decision, and visuomotor processing in 293 individuals spanning early childhood to adulthood. We found that glutamate and GABA within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) explained unique variance in visuomotor processing, with higher glutamate predicting poorer visuomotor processing in younger participants but better visuomotor processing in mature participants, while GABA showed the opposite pattern. These findings were functionally, neuroanatomically, and neurochemically specific, and were replicated ~1.5 years later and were generalized in two further different behavioral tasks. Using resting fMRI, we revealed that the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and visuomotor processing is mediated by functional connectivity in the visuomotor network. We then extended our findings to high-level cognitive behavior by predicting fluid intelligence performance. We showed that fluid intelligence performance is explained by IPS GABA and glutamate and is mediated by visuomotor processing, and moderated by the developmental stage. These results provide an integrative biological and psychological mechanistic explanation that links cognitive processes and neurotransmitters across human development and establishes their involvement in intelligent behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing our hand or a tool during visually-guided actions: different effects on the somatosensory and visual cortices</a></h4>

              
                The processing of proprioceptive information in the context of a conflict between visual and somatosensory feedbacks deteriorates motor performance. Previous studies have shown that seeing one's hand increases the weighting assigned to arm somatosensory inputs. In this light, we hypothesized that the sensory conflict, when tracing the contour of a shape with mirror-reversed vision, will be greater for participants who trace with a stylus seen in their hand (Hand group, n=17) than for participants who trace with the tip of rod without seen their hand (Tool group, n=15). Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that the tracing performance with mirror vision will be more deteriorated for the Hand group than for the Tool group, and we predicted a greater gating of somatosensory information for the Hand group to reduce the sensory conflict. The participants of both groups followed the outline of a shape in two visual conditions. Direct vision: the participants saw the hand or portion of a light 40 cm rod directly. Mirror Vision: the hand or the rod was seen through a mirror. We measured tracing performance using a digitizing tablet and the cortical activity with electroencephalography. Behavioral analyses revealed that the tracing performance of both groups was similarly impaired by mirror vision. However, contrasting the spectral content of the cortical oscillatory activity between the Mirror and Direct conditions, we observed that tracing with mirror vision resulted in significantly larger alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) powers in the somatosensory cortex for participants of the Hand group. The somatosensory alpha and beta powers did not significantly differ between Mirror and Direct vision conditions for the Tool group. For both groups, tracing with mirror vision altered the activity of the visual cortex: decreased alpha power for the Hand group, decreased alpha and beta power for the Tool group. Overall, these results suggest that seeing the hand enhanced the sensory conflict when tracing with mirror vision and that the increase of alpha and beta powers in the somatosensory cortex served to reduce the weight assigned to somatosensory information. The increased activity of the visual cortex observed for both groups in the mirror vision condition suggests greater visual processing with increased task difficulty. Finally, the fact that the participants of the Tool group did not show better tracing performance than those of the Hand group suggests that tracing deterioration resulted from a sensorimotor conflict (as opposed to a visuo-proprioceptive conflict).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust and consistent measures of pattern separation based on information theory and demonstrated in the dentate gyrus</a></h4>

              
                Pattern separation is a valuable computational function performed by neuronal circuits, such as the dentate gyrus, where dissimilarity between inputs is increased, reducing noise and increasing the storage capacity of downstream networks. A number of different measures (such as orthogonalisation, decorrelation, or spike train distance) have been applied to quantify the process of pattern separation. However, these are known to give conclusions that can differ qualitatively depending on the choice of measure and the parameters used to calculate it. We here demonstrate that arbitrarily increasing sparsity, a noticeable feature of dentate granule cell firing and one that is believed to be key to pattern separation, typically leads to improved classical measures for pattern separation even, inappropriately, up to the point where almost all information about the inputs is lost. Standard measures therefore both cannot differentiate between pattern separation and pattern destruction, and give results that may depend on arbitrary parameter choices. We propose that techniques from information theory, in particular mutual information, transfer entropy, and redundancy, should be applied to penalise the potential for lost information (often due to increased sparsity) that is neglected by existing measures. We compare five commonly-used measures of pattern separation with three novel techniques based on information theory, showing that the latter can be applied in a principled way and provide a robust and reliable measure for comparing the pattern separation performance of different neurons and networks. We demonstrate our new measures on detailed compartmental models of individual dentate granule cells and a dentate microcircuit, and show how structural changes associated with epilepsy affect pattern separation performance. Overall, our measures solve a widely acknowledged problem in assessing the pattern separation of neural circuits such as the dentate gyrus, as well as the cerebellum and mushroom body. Finally we provide a publicly available toolbox allowing for easy analysis of pattern separation in spike train ensembles.

                Recent studies have suggested the glymphatic system as a solute transport pathway and waste removal mechanism in the brain. Imaging intracisternally administered tracers provides the opportunity of assessing various aspects of the glymphatic function in vivo. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI allows the evaluation of both the kinetics and spatial distribution of tracer transport throughout the brain. In this study, we investigated the impact of the molecular size of intracisternal tracers on the transport kinetics and distribution in the healthy mouse brain. Three MRI contrast agents with drastically different molecular weights (MWs): 1) Gd-DTPA (MW=661.8 Da), 2) GadoSpin (MW=200 kDa), and 3) oxygen-17 enriched water (H217O, MW=19 Da), were administered via cisterna magna infusion and their transport was dynamically assessed. Our results show that the transport of H217O was significantly faster and more extensive than the two gadolinium-based contrast agents. Time-lagged correlation analysis and clustering analysis comparing the kinetics of Gd-DTPA and H217O transport also showed different cluster patterns and lag time between different regions of the brain. Further, there were also significant differences in the transport kinetics of the three tracers to the lateral ventricles. These observations suggest the size-dependent differences in forces that drive tracer transport in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward prediction error neurons implement an efficient code for reward</a></h4>

              
                We apply efficient coding principles to derive the optimal population of neurons to encode rewards from a distribution. Similar to this optimal population, dopaminergic reward prediction error neurons have a broad distribution of optimistically placed thresholds, neurons with higher thresholds have higher gain and the curvature of their responses depends on the threshold. Thus, these neurons may broadcast an efficient reward signal, not necessarily a reward prediction error.

                Neuronal response to nutrient availability plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and behavioral response to the environment in higher eukaryotes. However, we know little about how neuronal function is influenced by acute changes in nutrients at high resolution. Taking advantage of powerful fly genetics and the amenability of the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we have investigated the synaptic response to acute amino acid restriction. Our findings indicate that the presence of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) and phosphorylation of its target eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) are essential for the ability of the NMJ to maintain normal neurotransmitter output when the larvae are deprived of amino acids. Surprisingly, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which normally acts downstream of GCN2/eIF2alpha, appears dispensable in this regulation. Furthermore, we show that GCN2/eIF2alpha dependent cascade acts retrogradely from muscle back to motoneuron to adjust synaptic release. These results provide a mechanistic insight into the intricate regulation of synaptic strength through the action of GCN2 when organisms are faced with amino acid scarcity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct feedforward and feedback pathways for cell-type specific attention effects in macaque V4.</a></h4>

              
                Attention gates the flow of sensory information across brain areas. Mechanistically, attention should depend on a modulation of both feedback (FB) and feedforward (FF) projections, which terminate in distinct laminar compartments and target specific neural populations. We performed simultaneous laminar recordings from macaque V1 and V4 and identified putative fast-spiking (FS) interneurons and excitatory cells. V4 firing rates increased for both excitatory neurons and FS interneurons with attention. This increase was most prominent in superficial layers and preceded the modulations in V1 and Layer-4 of V4 in time, consistent with a FB modulation. We furthermore identified an attentional modulation of FF signaling corresponding to an increase in V1-V4 gamma-synchronization. Surprisingly, in V4, only Layer-4 FS interneurons were phase-locked to the V1 gamma rhythm, suggesting that V1-V4 gamma-synchronization may increase the signal-to-noise ratio rather than the gain of FF information transmission. Consistently, optogenetic tagging experiments in mice showed relatively strong phase-locking of PV+ and narrow-waveform SSt+ interneurons to gamma-rhythmic inputs. These findings reveal two distinct FF and FB pathways for attentional modulation with cell-type and layer-specific physiological effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different ways of evolving tool-using brains in teleosts and amniotes</a></h4>

              
                In mammals and birds, tool-using species are characterized by a high degree of encephalization with a relatively large telencephalon containing a higher proportion of total brain neurons compared to other species. Some teleost species in the wrasse family have convergently evolved tool-using abilities. In this study, we compared the brains of tool-using wrasses with various teleost species from a broad phylogenetic range. We show that in the tool-using wrasses, the telencephalon and the ventral part of the forebrain and midbrain are significantly enlarged compared to other teleost species, but do not contain a larger proportion of cells. Instead, this size difference is due to large fiber tracts connecting the dorsal part of the telencephalon (pallium) to the inferior lobe (IL), a ventral mesencephalic structure absent in amniotes. Such tracts were not present in other teleost species such as trout, zebrafish, or the Astyanax surface fish. The high degree of connectivity between the IL and the pallium in tool-using wrasses suggests that this unique teleostean structure contributes to higher-order cognitive functions. Considering how remarkably different their overall brain organization is, we conclude that, unlike in amniotes, the evolution of non telencephalic structures might have been key in the emergence of higher-order cognitive functions in teleosts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lipidomic alterations in the cerebral cortex and white matter in sporadic Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Aims: Non-targeted lipidomics analysis was conducted in post-mortem human frontal cortex area 8 (GM) and white matter of the frontal lobe centrum semi-ovale (WM) to identify lipidomes in middle-aged individuals with no neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, and cases at progressive stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Methods: Lipidomic analysis using an LC-MS/MS platform was carried out in selected cases with suitable post-mortem lacking co-morbidities and concomitant brain pathologies. Complementary data were obtained using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Results: The WM shows an adaptive lipid phenotype resistant to lipid peroxidation, characterized by a lower fatty acid unsaturation, peroxidizability index, and higher ether lipid content than the GM. Changes in the lipidomic profile more marked in the WM than in GM occur in AD with disease progression. WM alterations are characterized by a decline in the content of branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA), diacylglycerols (DG), triacylglycerols (TG), glycerophospholipids (GP) (especially ether lipids), and sphingolipids (especially sulfatides, ceramides, and glycosphingolipids). The GM acquires a fatty acid profile prone to peroxidation in sAD, while WM reinforces its peroxidation-resistant trait. Transcriptomic data point to additional defects of peroxisomal function. Conclusions: Four functional categories are associated with the different lipid classes affected in sAD: membrane structural composition, bioenergetics, antioxidant protection, and bioactive lipids, with deleterious consequences affecting both neurons and glial cells favoring disease progression.

                The gut microbiome is emerging as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimers disease (AD) possibly due to the increased prevalence of pro-inflammatory genera in gut microbiota of AD participants. Microbiota-mediated changes in cognition and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), an important process for memory which is altered in AD, position the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a key regulator of AD. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are the cause or consequence of AD symptoms. We transplanted faecal microbiota from AD participants and age-matched controls into microbiota-depleted naive adult rats and found impairments in AHN and associated memory tasks, which correlated with clinical cognitive scores. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were evident. Serum from AD participants also decreased neurogenesis in vitro and correlated with cognitive scores and pro-inflammatory genera. Our results reveal that the cognitive symptoms in AD may be due to alterations in gut microbiota, and that impaired neurogenesis may be a mechanistic link between altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment in AD.

                Tactile sensation and vision are often both utilized for the exploration of objects that are within reach though it is not known whether or how these two distinct sensory systems might combine such information. Here in mice we find that stimulation of the contralateral whisker array suppresses visually evoked activity in a subarea of primary visual cortex (VISp) whose visual space covers the whisker search space. This is mediated by local fast spiking interneurons that receive a direct cortico-cortical input predominantly from layer 6 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (SSp-bfd). These data demonstrate functional convergence within and between two primary sensory cortical areas for multisensory object detection and recognition.

                Amongst the characteristics about information processing in the brain, observations of dynamic near-critical states have generated significant interest. However, theoretical and experimental limitations have precluded a definite answer about when and why neural criticality arises. To explore this topic, we used an in vitro neural network of cortical neurons that was trained to play a simplified game of `Pong'. We demonstrate that critical dynamics emerge when neural networks receive task-related structured sensory input, reorganizing the system to a near-critical state. Additionally, better task performance correlated with proximity to critical dynamics. However, criticality alone is insufficient for a neuronal network to demonstrate learning in the absence of additional information regarding the consequences of previous actions. These findings have compelling implications for the role of neural criticality.

                Recent studies in mice have shown that orofacial behaviors drive a large fraction of neural activity across the brain. To understand the nature and function of these signals, we need better computational models to characterize the behaviors and relate them to neural activity. Here we developed Facemap, a framework consisting of a keypoint tracking algorithm and a deep neural network encoder for predicting neural activity. We used the Facemap keypoints as input for the deep neural network to predict the activity of ~50,000 simultaneously-recorded neurons and in visual cortex we doubled the amount of explained variance compared to previous methods. Our keypoint tracking algorithm was more accurate than existing pose estimation tools, while the inference speed was several times faster, making it a powerful tool for closed-loop behavioral experiments. The Facemap tracker was easy to adapt to data from new labs, requiring as few as 10 annotated frames for near-optimal performance. We used Facemap to find that the neuronal activity clusters which were highly driven by behaviors were more spatially spread-out across cortex. We also found that the deep keypoint features inferred by the model had time-asymmetrical state dynamics that were not apparent in the raw keypoint data. In summary, Facemap provides a stepping stone towards understanding the function of the brainwide neural signals and their relation to behavior.

                A standard assumption in neuroscience is that low-effort model-free learning is automatic and continuously employed, while more complex model-based strategies are only used when the rewards they generate are worth the additional effort. We present evidence refuting this assumption. First, we demonstrate flaws in previous reports of combined model-free and model-based reward prediction errors in the ventral striatum that likely led to spurious results. More appropriate analyses yield no evidence of a model-free prediction errors in this region. Second, we find that task instructions generating more correct model-based behaviour reduce rather than increase mental effort. This is inconsistent with cost-benefit arbitration between model-based and model-free strategies. Together, our data suggest that model-free learning may not be automatic. Instead, humans can reduce mental effort by using a model-based strategy alone rather than arbitrating between multiple strategies. Our results call for re-evaluation of the assumptions in influential theories of learning and decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-model order spatially constrained ICA reveals highly replicable group differences and consistent predictive results from fMRI data</a></h4>

              
                Brain functional networks identified from resting fMRI data have the potential to reveal biomarkers for brain disorders, but studies of complex mental illnesses such as schizophrenia (SZ) often yield mixed results across replication studies. This is likely due in part to the complexity of the disorder, the short data acquisition time, and the limited ability of the approaches for brain imaging data mining. Therefore, the use of analytic approaches which can both capture individual variability while offering comparability across analyses is highly preferred. Fully blind data-driven approaches such as independent component analysis (ICA) are hard to compare across studies, and approaches that use fixed atlas-based regions can have limited sensitivity to individual sensitivity. By contrast, spatially constrained ICA (scICA) provides a hybrid, fully automated solution that can incorporate spatial network priors while also adapting to new subjects. However, scICA has thus far only been used with a single spatial scale. In this work, we present an approach using scICA to extract subject-specific intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from fMRI data at multiple spatial scales (ICA model orders), which also enables us to study interactions across spatial scales. We evaluate this approach using a large N (N>1,600) study of schizophrenia divided into separate validation and replication sets. A multi-scale ICN template was estimated and labeled, then used as input into spatially constrained ICA which was computed on an individual subject level. We then performed a subsequent analysis of multiscale functional network connectivity (msFNC) to evaluate the patient data, including group differences and classification. Results showed highly consistent group differences in msFNC in regions including cerebellum, thalamus, and motor/auditory networks. Importantly, multiple msFNC pairs linking different spatial scales were implicated. We also used the msFNC features as input to a classification model in cross-validated hold-out data and also in an independent test data. Visualization of predictive features was performed by evaluating their feature weights. Finally, we evaluated the relationship of the identified patterns to positive symptoms and found consistent results across datasets. The results verified the robustness of our framework in evaluating brain functional connectivity of schizophrenia at multiple spatial scales, implicated consistent and replicable brain networks, and highlighted a promising approach for leveraging resting fMRI data for brain biomarker development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dodecyl Creatine Ester Improves Cognitive Function and Identifies Drivers of Creatine Deficiency.</a></h4>

              
                Creatine transporter deficiency prevents creatine uptake into the brain, leading to mental retardation. To better understand the pathophysiology, this study focuses on the identification of biomarkers related to cognitive improvement in a Slc6a8 knockout mouse model (Slc6a8-/y) engineered to mimic the clinical features of CTD patients which have low brain creatine content. Shotgun proteomics analysis of 4,035 proteins in four different brain regions; the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus (associated with cognitive functions) and brain stem, and muscle as a control, was performed in 24 mice. Comparisons of the protein abundance in the four brain regions between DCE-treated intranasally Slc6a8-/y mice and wild type and DCE-treated Slc6a8-/y and vehicle group identified 14 biomarkers, shedding light on the mechanism of action of DCE. Integrative bioinformatics and statistical modeling identified key proteins associated with CTD, including KIF1A and PLCB1. The abundance of these proteins in the four brain regions was significantly correlated with both the object recognition and the Y-maze tests. Functional analysis confirmed their key roles and associated molecules in CTD pathogenesis.

	<p>A unique structure of care for neurological inpatients with significant palliative care (PC) needs was established in the Department of Neurology at the Charit&amp;amp;eacute;&amp;amp;mdash;Universit&amp;amp;auml;tsmedizin Berlin in 2021: a specialized neuropalliative care (NPC) unit. After one year, we provide an overview of the concept and the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; characteristics. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of patients treated in our NPC unit between February 2021&amp;amp;ndash;February 2022. Data were extracted from medical records and PC assessment including diagnosis, mode of admission and discharge, length of stay, and palliative symptoms. Data are presented as averages with a 95% confidence interval [lower limit; upper limit] or percentage (absolute number). Results: We included 143 patients (52% (75) female, 67.9 years [65.6; 70.2]). Patients were admitted from general wards (48%; 68), their homes (22%; 32), intensive care units (16%; 23) or emergency departments (14%; 20). The main diagnoses were tumors of the nervous system (39%; 56), neurodegenerative diseases (30%; 43), neurologic complications (13%; 19) and cerebrovascular diseases (12%; 17). Complaints most frequently rated as severely to overwhelmingly burdensome were motor- or fatigue-associated problems, problems communicating, dysphagia and pain. The average length of stay was 13.7 days [12.2; 15.2]. Forty-five percent (64) of patients were discharged without further PC, 17% (24) were referred to a hospice and 13% (18) were discharged with outpatient PC. Five percent (7) were referred to neurorehabilitation and 21% (30) of patients died. Conclusions: Our NPC unit is a new model of care for neurological patients with substantial PC needs especially within the structures of a highly specialized and individualized medicine.</p>

	<p>Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) microstates reflect sub-second, quasi-stable states of brain activity. Several studies have reported alterations of microstate features in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Based on these findings, it has been suggested that microstates may represent neurophysiological biomarkers for the classification of SZ. To explore this possibility, machine learning approaches can be employed. Bayesian optimization is a machine learning approach that selects the best-fitted machine learning model with tuned hyperparameters from existing models to improve the classification. In this proof-of-concept preliminary study based on secondary analysis, 20 microstate features were extracted from 14 SZ patients and 14 healthy controls&amp;amp;rsquo; EEG signals. These parameters were then ranked as predictors based on their importance, and an optimized machine learning approach was applied to evaluate the performance of the classification. SZ patients had altered microstate features compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization outperformed conventional multivariate analyses and showed the highest accuracy (90.93%), AUC (0.90), sensitivity (91.37%), and specificity (90.48%), with reliable results using just six microstate predictors. Altogether, in this proof-of-concept study, we showed that machine learning with Bayesian optimization can be utilized to characterize EEG microstate alterations and contribute to the classification of SZ patients.</p>

	<p>Verbal fluency impairment is common in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but the effect of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients has not been comprehensively evaluated. We conducted a network meta-analysis based on four online databases to compare the effect of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients. This study was performed and reported according to PRISMA-NMA guidelines. In total, 6 out of 3707 articles (three RCTS and three cross-sectional studies) covering eight drug regimens were included (five for letter fluency, five for semantic fluency). In terms of letter fluency, the ranking of the overall efficacy of included drug regimens was: levodopa, levodopa combined with pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, pramipexole, pergolide, but no drug regimen presented a significant advantage over the others. In terms of semantic fluency, the ranking of the overall efficacy of included drug regimens was: rotigotine, levodopa, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, among which, levodopa alone (SMD = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.28&amp;amp;ndash;1.59) and rotigotine alone (SMD = 1.18, 95%CI: 0.28&amp;amp;ndash;2.09) were statistically superior to pramipexole, while no significant difference was identified between all the other drug regimens. Levodopa and rotigotine seem to be more appropriate choices for PD patients with verbal fluency impairment. Further study is needed to illustrate the efficacy of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients.</p>

	<p>The paper overviews components of neurologic processing efficiencies to develop innovative methodologies and thinking to school-based applications and changes in educational leadership based on sound findings in the cognitive neurosciences applied to schools and learners. Systems science can allow us to better manage classroom-based learning and instruction on the basis of relatively easily evaluated efficiencies or inefficiencies and optimization instead of simply examining achievement. &amp;amp;ldquo;Medicalizing&amp;amp;rdquo; the learning process with concepts such as &amp;amp;ldquo;learning disability&amp;amp;rdquo; or employing grading methods such as pass-fail does little to aid in understanding the processes that learners employ to acquire, integrate, remember, and apply information learned. The paper endeavors to overview and provided reference to tools that can be employed that allow a better focus on nervous system-based strategic approaches to classroom learning.</p>

	<p>The effectiveness of early intensive interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is now well-established, but there continues to be great interindividual variability in treatment response. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify putative predictors of response to two different approaches in behavioral treatment: Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions (EIBI) and the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM). Both are based upon the foundations of Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), but the former is more structured and therapist-driven, while the latter is more naturalistic and child-driven. Four databases (EmBase, PubMed, Scopus and WebOfScience) were systematically screened, and an additional search was conducted in the reference lists of relevant articles. Studies were selected if participants were children with ASD aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;48 months at intake, receiving either EIBI or ESDM treatment. For each putative predictor, p-values from different studies were combined using Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s method. Thirteen studies reporting on EIBI and eleven on ESDM met the inclusion criteria. A higher IQ at intake represents the strongest predictor of positive response to EIBI, while a set of social cognitive skills, including intention to communicate, receptive and expressive language, and attention to faces, most consistently predict response to ESDM. Although more research will be necessary to reach definitive conclusions, these findings begin to shed some light on patient characteristics that are predictive of preferential response to EIBI and ESDM, and may provide clinically useful information to begin personalizing treatment.</p>

	<p>Action imagery involves the mental representation of an action without overt execution, and can contribute to perspective taking, such as that required for left-right judgments in mental body rotation tasks. It has been shown that perspective (back view, front view), rotational angle (head-up, head-down), and abstractness (abstract, realistic) of the stimulus material influences speed and correctness of the judgement. The present studies investigated whether left-right judgements are more difficult on legs than on arms and whether the type of limb interacts with the other factors. Furthermore, a combined score for speed and accuracy was explored to eliminate possible tradeoffs and to obtain the best possible measure of subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; individual ability. Study 1 revealed that the front view is more difficult than the back view because it involves a vertical rotation in perspective taking. Head-down rotations are more difficult than head-up rotations because they involve a horizontal rotation in perspective taking. Furthermore, leg stimuli are more difficult than hand stimuli, particularly in head-down rotations. In Study 2, these findings were replicated in abstract stimuli as well as in realistic stimuli. In addition, perspective taking for realistic stimuli in the back view is easier than realistic stimuli in the front view or abstract stimuli (in both perspectives). We conclude that realistic stimulus material facilitates task comprehension and amplifies the effects of perspective. By replicating previous findings, the linear speed-accuracy score was shown to be a valid measure to capture performance in mental body rotations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcription Factor Hb9 Is Expressed in Glial Cell Lineages in the Developing Mouse Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hb9 (<I>Mnx1</I>) is a transcription factor described as a spinal cord motor neuron (MN)-specific marker and critical factor for the postmitotic specification of these cells. To date, expression of Hb9 in other cell types has not been reported. We performed a fate-mapping approach to examine distributions of Hb9-expressing cells and their progeny ("Hb9-lineage cells") within the embryonic and adult spinal cord of Hb9<sup>cre</sup>;Ai14 mice. We found that Hb9-lineage cells are distributed in a gradient of increasing abundance throughout the rostrocaudal spinal cord axis during embryonic and postnatal stages. Furthermore, although the majority of Hb9-lineage cells at cervical spinal cord levels are MNs, at more caudal levels, Hb9-lineage cells include small-diameter dorsal horn neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system, we observed a similar phenomenon with more abundant Hb9-lineage Schwann cells in muscles of the lower body versus upper body muscles. We cultured spinal cord progenitors <I>in vitro</I> and found that gliogenesis was increased by treatment with the caudalizing factor FGF-8B, while glial tdTomato expression was increased by treatment with both FGF-8B and GDF-11. Together, these observations suggest that early and transient expression of Hb9 in spinal cord neural progenitors may be induced by caudalizing factors such as FGF and GDF signaling. Furthermore, our work raises the possibility that early Hb9 expression may influence the development of spinal cord macroglia and Schwann cells, especially at caudal regions. Together, these findings highlight the importance of using caution when designing experiments using Hb9<sup>cre</sup> mice to perform spinal cord MN-specific manipulations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prefrontal Cortical to Mediodorsal Thalamus Projection Neurons Regulate Posterror Adaptive Control of Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adaptive control is the online adjustment of behavior to guide and optimize responses after errors or conflict. The neural circuits involved in monitoring and adapting behavioral performance following error are poorly understood. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in this form of control. However, these brain areas are densely connected with many other regions, and it is unknown which projections are critical for adaptive behavior. Here, we tested the involvement of four distinct dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortical projections to striatal and thalamic target areas in adaptive control. We re-analyzed data from published experiments, using trial-by-trial analyses of behavior in an operant task for attention and impulsivity. We find that male rats slow their responses and perform worse following errors. Moreover, by combining retrograde labeling and chemogenetic silencing, we find that dorsomedial prefrontal pyramidal neurons that project to the lateral nucleus of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDL) are involved in posterror performance and timing of responses, specifically with unpredictable delays until stimulus presentation. Together, these data show that dorsal medial PFC (mPFC) projection neurons targeting the lateral MDT regulate adaptive control to flexibly optimize behavioral responses in goal-directed behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Regular antenatal care visits were associated with low risk of low birth weight among newborns in Rwanda: Evidence from the 2014/2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey (RDHS) Data [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low birth weight (LBW) remains the global unfinished agenda in most countries of the world especially in low- and middle-income countries. LBW subsequently has harmful effects on the lifestyle, psychosocial and physiological development of the child. Although it is known that antenatal care (ANC) visits are important interventions contributing to prediction of newborn birth weight, little has been conducted on effect of ANC visits on birth weight in Rwanda. This study aimed at determining the association between regular ANC visits and risk of LBW among newborns in Rwanda. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted to analyse the effects of ANC on LBW using the 2014/2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Associations of socio-demographic, socio-economic, and individual factors of the mother with LBW newborns were performed using bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Prevalences of LBW and macrosomia were 5.8% and 17.6%, respectively. Newborns delivered from mothers attending fewer than four ANC visits were at almost three-times greater risk of having LBW [aOR=2.8; 95%CI (1.5–5.4), p=0.002] compared to those whose mothers attending four or more ANC visits. Residing in a rural area for pregnant women was significantly associated with LBW [aOR=1.1; 95%CI (0.7–1.6), p=0.008]. Maternal characteristics, such as anemia, predicted an increase in LBW [aOR=3.5; 95%CI (1.5–5.4),p<0.001]. Those who received no nutritional counseling [aOR=2.5; 95%CI (2–8.5), p<0.001] and who were not told about maternal complications [aOR=3.3; 95%CI (1.5–6.6), p=0.003] were more prone to deliver newborns with LBW than those who received them. Pregnant women who received iron and folic acid were less likely to have LBW newborns [aOR=0.5; 95%CI (0.3–0.9), p=0.015]. Conclusion: ANC visits significantly contributed to reducing the incidence of LBW. This study underscores the need for early, comprehensive, and high-quality ANC services to prevent LBW in Rwanda.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multidisciplinary digital methodologies for documentation and preservation of immovable Archaeological heritage in the Khovd River Valley, Western Mongolia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The archaeological and ethnographic heritages of Mongolia reflect a multi-millennial continuity of typically mobile-pastoral occupations across sparsely populated, environmentally diverse landscapes, but the threats of modernisation and industrialisation to those heritages are nevertheless present and substantial. The construction of the Erdeneburen Hydroelectric Dam on the Khovd River in western Mongolia is planned to submerge hundreds of archaeological features and jeopardise at least another thousand. Methods: The Mongolian Archaeology Project: Surveying the Steppes, in collaboration with the Mongolian Institute of Archaeology, integrates a variety of digital techniques including GIS (geographic information systems), Machine Learning automated site detection, drone mapping, and Structure-from-Motion LiDAR scanning to document the endangered archaeology. This paper presents the resulting dataset of archaeological features across three different impact zones associated with the dam construction and evaluates the degree of efficacy of the initial data integration strategy through informal partner feedback and self-assessment. Results: While only approximately 20% of the documented sites fall within the planned flood zone, the remaining sites will be subjected to collateral threats such as industrial and infrastructural development that will necessitate extended monitoring, both temporally and spatially. In consideration of these results, this paper argues that a ‘responsive’ mode of heritage disaster intervention can bridge the gap between ‘reactive’ and ‘proactive’ modes, but requires development of an integrated (digital) methodology. Conclusions: The paper concludes by offering a new, more interconnected ‘transmethodology’ that addresses spatiality, sub-sampling, data reuse, and community input across multiple disciplines such as cultural heritage preservation, salvage archaeology, computer vision, and community archaeology. The authors developed this ‘transmethodology’ and the resulting workflows out of a theoretical framework that considers principles of Symmetrical Archaeology, Resilience Humanitarianism, and the CARE standard for inclusive data management (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence, causes and impacts of human trafficking in Asian countries: A scoping review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Asian countries, human trafficking is often encountered as forced labor, forced marriage, sex trafficking, men, women, and children exploitation. This review points out how human trafficking activities are prevalent in Asian countries and also reveals different causes that are the basis of increasingly human trafficking in Asian countries such as poverty, unemployment, political uncertainty, war, natural disaster, corruption and weak policies. Human trafficking also creates huge health, physical, psychological and social implications on individuals and the overall society. Methods: The purpose of this study is to collect evidence on human trafficking in Asian countries. A scoping review methodology was used to systematically search online databases including Sage Journals Online, Wiley Online, Hein Online, Taylor & Francis Online, Web of Science, and Scopus literature to amalgamate information on this issue. For the purposes of this article, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria after searching and screening a total number of 1,278 studies. Results: The findings of this study were classified under three categories: prevalence of human trafficking in Asia, causes of human trafficking in Asia (poverty and unemployment, environmental and manmade disaster, weak policies and corruption), and impacts of human trafficking including social, health, physical, psychological impacts. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the prevalence and impacts of human trafficking, the author also recommends some meaningful and practical steps for policymakers and researchers to effectively tackle human trafficking in Asian countries.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Machine learning model to predict endophytic colonisation of rice cultivar plant tissues by Beauveria bassiana isolates and their potential as bio-control agents against rice stem borer using existing knowledge [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer revie</a></h4>

              
                Background: Finding well-known Beauveria bassiana isolates that could preserve rice crops from Sesamia calamistis (stem borer) is problematic. Another difficult task is the development of precise inoculation methods, which have been employed for their establishment as endophytes in cereal crops. This study proposed machine learning models to predict the best entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana that could directly protect rice crops against Sesamia calamistis. Methods: Data driven machine learning decisions were implemented and assessed from 60 experimental runs with nine different feature/input variables and three target/output variables following foliar spray and seed treatment inoculation method. The feature variables consisted of rice plant tissue, such as Nerica-L19, Nerica1, Nerica8, the time, and the five promising isolates Beauveria bassiana (Bb3, Bb4, Bb10, Bb21, Bb35). The target variable consisted of the number of colonised roots, stems and leaves, expressed as a percentage depending on the degree of protection after each inoculation. A data driven decision by the extreme gradient boosting regression algorithm was used to proficiently abstract the situation where there is no direct relationship between features and target variables. Results: The foliar spray inoculation method exhibited high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99, 0.98 and 0.94 depending on the number of colonised stems, roots and leaves, respectively, while the seed treatment approach exhibited the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.91, 0.87 and 0.75, respectively. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm effectively abstracted the nonlinear relationship between the attribute variables that were taken into consideration and predicted Beauveria bassiana as a bio-pesticide for rice and perhaps other cereal stem borers. Thus, this XGBoost regression model could be used to navigate the optimization domain and reduce the development time of the biocontrol process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Synaptic reshaping of plastic neuronal networks by periodic multichannel stimulation with single-pulse and burst stimuli</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justus A. Kromer, Peter A. Tass</p>

Synaptic dysfunction is associated with several brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Utilizing synaptic plasticity, brain stimulation is capable of reshaping synaptic connectivity. This may pave the way for novel therapies that specifically counteract pathological synaptic connectivity. For instance, in PD, novel multichannel coordinated reset stimulation (CRS) was designed to counteract neuronal synchrony and down-regulate pathological synaptic connectivity. CRS was shown to entail long-lasting therapeutic aftereffects in PD patients and related animal models. This is in marked contrast to conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy, where PD symptoms return shortly after stimulation ceases.
In the present paper, we study synaptic reshaping by periodic multichannel stimulation (PMCS) in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). During PMCS, phase-shifted periodic stimulus trains are delivered to segregated neuronal subpopulations. Harnessing STDP, PMCS leads to changes of the synaptic network structure. We found that the PMCS-induced changes of the network structure depend on both the phase lags between stimuli and the shape of individual stimuli. Single-pulse stimuli and burst stimuli with low intraburst frequency down-regulate synapses between neurons receiving stimuli simultaneously. In contrast, burst stimuli with high intraburst frequency up-regulate these synapses. We derive theoretical approximations of the stimulation-induced network structure. This enables us to formulate stimulation strategies for inducing a variety of network structures. Our results provide testable hypotheses for future pre-clinical and clinical studies and suggest that periodic multichannel stimulation may be suitable for reshaping plastic neuronal networks to counteract pathological synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, we provide novel insight on how the stimulus type may affect the long-lasting outcome of conventional DBS. This may strongly impact parameter adjustment procedures for clinical DBS, which, so far, primarily focused on acute effects of stimulation.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was rapidly declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Early clinical symptomatology focused mainly on respiratory illnesses. However, a variety of neurological manifestations in both adults and newborns are now well-documented. To experimentally determine whether SARS-CoV-2 could replicate in and affect human brain cells, we infected iPSC-derived human brain organoids. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can productively replicate and promote death of neural cells, including cortical neurons. This phenotype was accompanied by loss of excitatory synapses in neurons. Notably, we found that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiviral Sofosbuvir was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and rescued these neuronal alterations in infected brain organoids. Given the urgent need for readily available antivirals, these results provide a cellular basis supporting repurposed antivirals as a strategic treatment to alleviate neurocytological defects that may underlie COVID-19- related neurological symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Prophage-like gene transfer agents promote Caulobacter crescentus survival and DNA repair during stationary phase</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin Gozzi, Ngat T. Tran, Joshua W. Modell, Tung B. K. Le, Michael T. Laub</p>

Gene transfer agents (GTAs) are prophage-like entities found in many bacterial genomes that cannot propagate themselves and instead package approximately 5 to 15 kbp fragments of the host genome that can then be transferred to related recipient cells. Although suggested to facilitate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the wild, no clear physiological role for GTAs has been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the α-proteobacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> produces bona fide GTAs. The production of <i>Caulobacter</i> GTAs is tightly regulated by a newly identified transcription factor, RogA, that represses <i>gafYZ</i>, the direct activators of GTA synthesis. Cells lacking <i>rogA</i> or expressing <i>gafYZ</i> produce GTAs harboring approximately 8.3 kbp fragment of the genome that can, after cell lysis, be transferred into recipient cells. Notably, we find that GTAs promote the survival of <i>Caulobacter</i> in stationary phase and following DNA damage by providing recipient cells a template for homologous recombination-based repair. This function may be broadly conserved in other GTA-producing organisms and explain the prevalence of this unusual HGT mechanism.

                Background After the first cases of coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in January 2020, the epidemic spread around the world. Few data are available from Central Africa. We conducted a study to monitor this emerging disease in Gabon, a Central Africa country. Methods In order to set up an epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 in Gabon, we led molecular investigations on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from the 1161 first suspected cases of COVID-19. A Reverse Ttranscriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using primers and probes targeted the E gene and polymerase gene according to the kit Tib-Molbiol. Results We diagnosed the first case of COVID-19 on March, 12 2020. Among those suspected cases, 83 were confirmed cases. There was no significant difference in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 between age groups (p = 0.14). Seventy-three percent were asymptomatic. The viral loads were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal samples than in the oropharyngeal samples (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in viral loads between age groups (p=0.9895) and no correlation between clinical symptoms and viral loads (p=0.06042). Conclusion In conclusion, this study provides the first molecular data from Gabon concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The data showed that most of the infected people were asymptomatic. The viral load was higher in the nasopharyngeal samples.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of the safety and immunogenicity profile of an azoximer bromide polymer-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                A systematic review of clinical trials conducted with a low-dose inactivated influenza vaccine adjuvanted by azoximer bromide (AZB, Polyoxidonium), was performed to compare vaccine reactogenicity against non-adjuvant vaccines. We also assessed whether lower amounts of antigen per viral strain in AZB-adjuvanted vaccines affected antibody responses. A robust search strategy identified scientific publications reporting 30 clinical trials, comprising data on 11,736 participants and 86 trial arms, for inclusion in the analysis. Local reaction rates (R lr) appeared to be lower in AZB-adjuvanted vaccine treatment arms versus comparator vaccine treatment arms. Post-vaccination geometric mean titres in those exposed to AZB-adjuvanted vaccine and comparator vaccine treatment arms were similar in both children and adults aged 18–60 years, implying an antigen-sparing effect by AZB. Meta‑regression analysis based on a literature search of records or reports of clinical trials featuring AZB and the inactivated subunit of influenza published between 1998–2018 was conducted online in January 2019 and updated in August 2019. This search covered trials performed between 1993 and 2016 and suggested that AZB did not contribute to vaccine reactogenicity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Functional Neuroimaging as an Assessment Tool in Critically Ill Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Little is known about residual cognitive function in the earliest stages of serious brain injury. Functional neuroimaging has yielded valuable diagnostic and prognostic information in chronic disorders of consciousness, such as the vegetative state (also termed unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). The objective of the current study was to determine if functional neuroimaging could be efficacious in the assessment of cognitive function in acute disorders of consciousness, such as coma, where decisions about the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies are often made.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A hierarchical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach assessed sound perception, speech perception, language comprehension, and covert command following in 17 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Preserved auditory function was observed in 15 patients (88%), whereas 5 (29%) also had preserved higher-order language comprehension. Notably, one patient could willfully modulate his brain activity when instructed to do so, suggesting a level of covert conscious awareness that was entirely inconsistent with his clinical diagnosis at the time of the scan. Across patients, a positive relationship was also observed between fMRI responsivity and the level of functional recovery, such that patients with the greatest functional recovery had neural responses most similar to those observed in healthy control participants.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that fMRI may provide important diagnostic and prognostic information beyond standard clinical assessment in acutely unresponsive patients, which may aid discussions surrounding the continuation or removal of life-sustaining therapies during the early post-injury period.

                The spatiotemporal blood vessel formation and specification at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface of murine cranial bone defect repair were examined utilizing a high-resolution multiphoton-based imaging platform in conjunction with advanced optical techniques that allow interrogation of the oxygen microenvironment and cellular energy metabolism in living animals. Our study demonstrates the dynamic changes of vessel types, i.e. arterial, venous and capillary vessel networks at the superior and dura periosteum of cranial bone defect, suggesting a differential coupling of the vessel type with osteoblast expansion and bone tissue deposition/remodeling during repair. Employing transgenic reporter mouse models that label distinct types of vessels at the site of repair, we further show that oxygen distributions in capillary vessels at the healing site are heterogeneous as well as time and location-dependent. The endothelial cells coupling to osteoblasts prefer glycolysis and are less sensitive to microenvironmental oxygen changes than osteoblasts. In comparison, osteoblasts utilize relatively more OxPhos and potentially consume more oxygen at the site of repair. Taken together, our study highlights the dynamics and functional significance of blood vessel types at the site of defect repair, opening up opportunities for further delineating the oxygen and metabolic microenvironment at the interface of bone tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mesoscale cortex-wide neural dynamics predict goal-directed, but not random actions in mice several seconds prior to movement</a></h4>

              
                Volition - the sense of control or agency over one's voluntary actions - is widely recognized as the basis of both human subjective experience and natural behavior in non-human animals. Several human studies have found peaks in neural activity preceding voluntary actions, e.g. the readiness potential (RP), and some have shown upcoming actions could be decoded even before awareness. Others propose that random processes underlie and explain pre-movement neural activity. Here we seek to address these issues by evaluating whether pre-movement neural activity in mice contains structure beyond that present in random neural activity. Implementing a self-initiated water-rewarded lever pull paradigm in mice while recording widefield [Ca++] neural activity we find that cortical activity changes in variance seconds prior to movement and that upcoming lever pulls could be predicted between 3 to 5 seconds (or more in some cases) prior to movement. We found inhibition of motor cortex starting at approximately 5sec prior to lever pulls and activation of motor cortex starting at approximately 2sec prior to a random unrewarded left limb movement. We show that mice, like humans, are biased towards commencing self-initiated actions during specific phases of neural activity but that the pre-movement neural code changes over time in some mice and is widely distributed as behavior prediction improved when using all vs single cortical areas. These findings support the presence of structured multi-second neural dynamics preceding self-initiated action beyond that expected from random processes. Our results also suggest that neural mechanisms underlying self-initiated action could be preserved between mice and humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intracranial human recordings reveal association between neural activity and perceived intensity for the pain of others in the insula</a></h4>

              
                Based on neuroimaging data, the insula is considered important for people to empathize with the pain of others. Here we present intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings and single-cell recordings from the human insulae while 7 epilepsy patients rated the intensity of a woman's painful experiences seen in short movie clips. Pain had to be deduced from seeing facial expressions or a hand being slapped by a belt. We found activity in the broadband 20-190 Hz range correlated with the trial-by-trial perceived intensity in the insula for both types of stimuli. Within the insula, some locations had activity correlating with perceived intensity for our facial expressions but not for our hand stimuli, others only for our hand but not our face stimuli, and others for both. The timing of responses to the sight of the hand being hit is best explained by kinematic information; that for our facial expressions, by shape information. Comparing the broadband activity in the iEEG signal with spiking activity from a small number of neurons and an fMRI experiment with similar stimuli, revealed a consistent spatial organization, with stronger associations with intensity more anteriorly, while viewing the hand being slapped.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genome-wide base editor screen identifies regulators of protein abundance in yeast</a></h4>

              
                Proteins are key molecular players in a cell, and their abundance is extensively regulated not just at the level of gene expression but also post-transcriptionally. Here, we describe a genetic screen in yeast that enables systematic characterization of how protein abundance regulation is encoded in the genome. The screen combines a CRISPR/Cas9 base editor to introduce point mutations with fluorescent tagging of endogenous proteins to facilitate a flow-cytometric readout. We first benchmarked base editor performance in yeast with individual gRNAs as well as in positive and negative selection screens. We then examined the effects of 16,452 genetic perturbations on the abundance of eleven proteins representing a variety of cellular functions. We uncovered hundreds of regulatory relationships, including a novel link between the GAPDH isoenzymes Tdh1/2/3 and the Ras/PKA pathway. Many of the identified regulators are specific to one of the eleven proteins, but we also found genes that, upon perturbation, affected the abundance of most of the tested proteins. While the more specific regulators usually act transcriptionally, broad regulators often have roles in protein translation. Overall, our novel screening approach provides unprecedented insights into the components, scale and connectedness of the protein regulatory network.

                Previous studies have highlighted an important role for hippocampal sharp-wave ripples in spatial alternation learning, as well as modulating activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, no study so far has investigated the direct influence of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples on mPFC activity during spatial alternation learning. Long Evans rats were trained on a three-arm radial maze to perform a sequence of alternations. Three different alternation sequences needed to be learnt, and while learning a new sequence, the activity in the mPFC was inhibited either directly following sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus (on-time condition) or with a randomized delay (delayed condition). In the on-time condition the behavioral performance was significantly worse compared to the same animals in the delayed inhibition condition, as measured by a lower correct alternation performance and more perseverative behavior. This indicates that the activity in the mPFC directly following hippocampal sharp-wave ripples is necessary for spatial rule switching.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Artificial Gravity During a Spaceflight Analog Alters Brain Sensory Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Spaceflight has numerous untoward effects on human physiology. Various countermeasures are under investigation including artificial gravity (AG). Here, we investigated whether AG alters resting-state brain functional connectivity changes during head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR), a spaceflight analog. Participants underwent 60 days of HDBR. Two groups received daily AG administered either continuously (cAG) or intermittently (iAG). A control group received no AG. We assessed resting-state functional connectivity before, during, and after HDBR. We also measured balance and mobility changes from pre- to post-HDBR. We examined how functional connectivity changes throughout HDBR and whether AG is associated with differential effects. We found differential connectivity changes by group between posterior parietal cortex and multiple somatosensory regions. The control group exhibited increased functional connectivity between these regions throughout HDBR whereas the cAG group showed decreased functional connectivity. This finding suggests that AG alters somatosensory reweighting during HDBR. We also observed brain-behavioral correlations that differed significantly by group. Control group participants who showed increased connectivity between the putamen and somatosensory cortex exhibited greater mobility declines post-HDBR. For the cAG group, increased connectivity between these regions was associated with little to no mobility declines post-HDBR. This suggests that when somatosensory stimulation is provided via AG, functional connectivity increases between the putamen and somatosensory cortex are compensatory in nature, resulting in reduced mobility declines. Given these findings, AG may be an effective countermeasure for the reduced somatosensory stimulation that occurs in both microgravity and HDBR.

                Riluzole is the only treatment known to improve survival in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, oral riluzole efficacy is modest at best, further it is known to have large inter-individual variability of serum concentration and clearance, is formulated as an oral drug in a patient population plagued with dysphagia, and has known systemic side-effects like asthenia (limiting patient compliance) and elevated liver enzymes. In this context, we postulated that continuous intrathecal (IT) infusion of low doses of riluzole could provide consistent elevations of the drug spinal cord (SC) concentrations at or above those achieved with oral dosing, without increasing the risk for adverse events associated with systemic drug exposure or off-target side effects in the brain. We developed a formulation of riluzole for IT delivery and conducted our studies in purpose-bred hound dogs. Our non-GLP studies revealed that IT infusion alone was able to increase SC concentrations above those provided by oral administration, without increasing plasma concentrations. We then conducted two GLP studies that combined IT infusion with oral administration at human equivalent dose, to evaluate SC and brain concentrations of riluzole along with assessments of safety and tolerability. In the 6-week study, the highest IT dose (0.2 mg/hr) was well tolerated by the animals and increased SC concentrations above those achieved with oral riluzole alone, without increasing brain concentrations. In the 6-month study, the highest dose tested (0.4 mg/hr) was not tolerated and yielded SC significantly above those achieved in all previous studies. Our data show the feasibility and safety profile of continuous IT riluzole delivery to the spinal cord, without concurrent elevated liver enzymes, and minimal brain concentrations creating another potential therapeutic route of delivery to be used in isolation or in combination with other therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Effect of Node Features on GCN-based Brain Network Classification: An Empirical Study</a></h4>

              
                Brain functional network (BFN) analysis has become a popular technique for identifying neurological/mental diseases. Due to the fact that BFN is a graph, graph convolutional network (GCN) can be naturally used in the classification of BFN. Different from traditional methods that directly use the adjacency matrices of BFNs to train a classifier, GCN requires an additional input i.e.,node features. To our best knowledge, however, there is no systematic study to analyze their influence on the performance of GCN-based brain disorder classification. Therefore, in this per, we conduct an empirical study on various node feature measures, including 1) original fMRI signals, 2) one-hot encoding, 3) node statistics, 4) node correlation, and 5) their combination. Experimental results on two benchmark databases show that different node feature inputs to GCN significantly affect the brain disease classification performance, and node correlation usually contributes higher accuracy compared to original signals and manually extracted statistical features.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the progressive loss of both upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Currently, there are only two drugs, Riluzole (Rilutek) and Edaravone (Radicava), approved by FDA for ALS treatment. These two drugs are very expensive with only a few months of life extension. So far, there is no cure for ALS. Aberrant protein aggregation in motor neurons is an intracellular hallmark of ALS. The disturbance in protein homeostasis may contribute to the onset and progression of ALS. Autophagy plays an important role in degrading misfolded proteins and thereby preventing their aggregation. Pharmacological manipulation of autophagy has been proposed as a new therapeutic approach for treating ALS. IADB, a novel indole alkaloid derivative, has been reported to exert mitochondrial protection and cardioprotection through its autophagy-modulating potential. In our present study, we attempted to examine whether IADB has therapeutic potential in SOD1G93A-associated experimental models of ALS. We found that IADB could promote the clearance of SOD1G93A aggregates and reduce the overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells transfected with SOD1G93A. We further examined the IADB in a mouse model of ALS. Administration of IADB started at the age of 55 days until the end stage of the disease. IADB treatment significantly increased LC3-II levels and decreased human SOD1 levels and p62 expression in the spinal cords of SOD1G93A mice, suggesting that IADB treatment could induce autophagy activation and promote clearance of mutant SOD1 aggregates in SOD1G93A mice. Moreover, IADB treatment could alleviate the activation of microglia and astrocytes and mitochondrial oxidative damage in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice. Finally, we demonstratedthat IADB treatment could improve motor performance and delay the onset and progression of the disease in a mouse model of ALS. The neuroprotective effects of IADB may mainly originate from its autophagy-promoting property.

                Reward processing is essential for our mental-health and well-being. Here, we present the development and validation of a scalable fMRI-informed EEG model related to reward processing in the ventral-striatum (VS); a central reward circuit node. Simultaneous EEG/fMRI data were acquired from 17 healthy individuals listening to pleasurable music, and used to construct a one-class regression model for predicting the reward-related VS-BOLD signal using spectro-temporal features from the EEG. Validation analyses, applied on EEG/fMRI data from a different group (N=14), revealed that the EEG model predicted VS-BOLD activation from the simultaneous EEG to a greater extent than a model derived from another anatomical region. The VS-EEG-model was also modulated by musical pleasure and predictive of the VS-BOLD during a monetary reward task, further indicating it functional relevance. These findings provide compelling evidence for the use of a scalable yet precise EEG-only probe of VS-originated reward processing, which could serve for process specific neruo-monitoring and -modulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis Identifies Regional Contributions to Brain Age Prediction</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning frameworks utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have frequently been used for brain age prediction and have achieved outstanding performance. Nevertheless, deep learning remains a black box as it is hard to interpret which brain parts contribute significantly to the predictions. To tackle this challenge, we first trained a lightweight, fully CNN model for brain age estimation on a large sample data set (N = 3054, age range = [8,80 years]) and tested it on an independent data set (N = 555, mean absolute error (MAE) = 4.45 years, r = 0.96). We then developed an interpretable scheme combining network occlusion sensitivity analysis (NOSA) with a fine-grained human brain atlas to uncover the learned invariance of the model. Our findings show that the dorsolateral, dorsomedial frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus had the highest contributions to age prediction across the lifespan. More interestingly, we observed that different regions showed divergent patterns in their predictions for specific age groups and that the bilateral hemispheres contributed differently to the predictions. Regions in the frontal lobe were essential predictors in both the developmental and aging stages with the thalamus remaining relatively stable and saliently correlated with other regional changes throughout the lifespan. The lateral and medial temporal brain regions gradually became involved during the aging phase. At the network level, the frontoparietal and the default mode networks show an inverted U-shape contribution from the developmental to the aging stages. The framework could identify regional contributions to the brain age prediction model, which could help increase the model interpretability when serving as an aging biomarker.

                When making decisions, humans can evaluate how likely they are to be correct. If this subjective confidence could be reliably decoded from brain activity, it would be possible to build a brain-computer interface (BCI) that improves decision performance by automatically providing more information to the user if needed based on their confidence. But this possibility depends on whether confidence can be decoded right after stimulus presentation and before the response so that a corrective action can be taken in time. Although prior work has shown that decision confidence is represented in brain signals, it is unclear if the representation is stimulus-locked or response-locked, and whether stimulus-locked pre-response decoding is sufficiently accurate for enabling such a BCI. We investigate the neural correlates of confidence by collecting high-density EEG during a perceptual decision task with realistic stimuli. Importantly, we design our task to include a post-stimulus gap that prevents the confounding of stimulus-locked activity by response-locked activity and vice versa, and then compare with a task without this gap. We perform event-related potential (ERP) and source-localization analyses. Our analyses suggest that the neural correlates of confidence are stimulus-locked, and that an absence of a post-stimulus gap could cause these correlates to incorrectly appear as response-locked. By preventing response-related activity to confound stimulus-locked activity, we then show that confidence can be reliably decoded from single-trial stimulus-locked pre-response EEG alone. We also identify a high-performance classification algorithm by comparing a battery of algorithms. Lastly, we design a simulated BCI framework to show that the EEG classification is accurate enough to build a BCI and that the decoded confidence could be used to improve decision making performance particularly when the task difficulty and cost of errors are high. Our results show feasibility of non-invasive EEG-based BCIs to improve human decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The molecular genetic landscape of human brain size variation</a></h4>

              
                Human brain size increases dynamically through early development, peaks in adolescence, and varies up to two-fold among adults. Although previous studies have elucidated changes in brain size across evolution, development, traits, and diseases, the molecular underpinnings of interindividual variation in brain size remain unknown. Here, we leverage postmortem brain RNA sequencing and estimates of brain weight (BW) in 2,531 individuals across three independent datasets, to identify 928 genes that show genome-wide significant associations with either higher or lower BW (BW+, BW-, respectively). These BW gene sets showed distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories and spatial patterns that mapped onto developmental, functional and cellular axes of brain organization. Expression differences among evolutionarily conserved BW genes were predictive of interspecies differences in brain size, and functional annotation of BW genes revealed enrichment for neurogenesis and cell-cell communication. Genome-wide, transcriptome-wide, and phenome-wide association analyses of in vivo neuroimaging phenotypes confirmed that the genetic regulation of BW- transcripts influences cortical surface area and volume, as well as behavioral traits related to brain function and disease. Cumulatively, our study represents a major step towards the goal of delineating the causal mechanisms of human brain size variation in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytes regulate spatial memory in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive processes and neurocognitive disorders are regulated by astrocytes and have prominent sex differences. However, the contribution of astrocytes to sex differences is not known. We leveraged astrocyte-targeted gene editing and chemogenetics in adult mice to reveal that astrocytic glutamate receptors and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in a sexually dimorphic manner. In females, spatial memory was improved by increasing metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3) in astrocytes or stimulating astrocytic Gi/o-coupled signaling, whereas stimulating Gs-coupled signaling impaired memory. However, in males, memory was improved by reducing mGluR3 or stimulating Gs-coupled signaling, whereas stimulating Gi/o-coupled signaling impaired memory. Thus, memory requires a sex-specific balance of astrocytic Gs-coupled and Gi/o-coupled receptor activities, and disease-associated alterations or therapeutic targeting of these pathways may cause opposing sex-dependent effects on cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta band rhythms influence reaction times</a></h4>

              
                Despite their involvement in many cognitive functions, beta oscillations are among the least understood brain rhythms. Reports on whether the functional role of beta is primarily inhibitory or excitatory have been contradictory. Our framework attempts to reconcile these findings and proposes that several beta rhythms co-exist at different frequencies. Beta frequency shifts and their potential influence on behavior have thus far received little attention. In this magnetoencephalography experiment, we asked whether changes in beta power or frequency in auditory cortex and motor cortex influence behavior (reaction times) during an auditory sweep discrimination task. We found that in motor cortex, increased beta power slowed down responses, while in auditory cortex, increased beta frequency slowed down responses. We further characterized beta as transient burst events with distinct spectro-temporal profiles influencing reaction times. Finally, we found that increased motor-to-auditory beta connectivity also slowed down responses. In sum, beta power, frequency, bursting properties, cortical focus, and connectivity profile all influenced behavioral outcomes. Our results imply that the study of beta oscillations requires caution as beta dynamics are multifaceted phenomena, and that several dynamics must be taken into account to reconcile mixed findings in the literature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Infant low-frequency EEG cortical power, cortical tracking and phase-amplitude coupling predicts language a year later.</a></h4>

              
                Cortical signals have been shown to track acoustic and linguistic properties of continual speech. This phenomenon has been measured across the lifespan, reflecting speech understanding as well as cognitive functions such as attention and prediction. Furthermore, atypical low-frequency cortical tracking of speech is found in children with phonological difficulties (developmental dyslexia). Accordingly, low-frequency cortical signals, especially in the delta and theta ranges, may play a critical role in language acquisition. A recent investigation Attaheri et al., 2022 (1) probed cortical tracking mechanisms in infants aged 4, 7 and 11 months as they listened to sung speech. Results from temporal response functions (TRF), phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and dynamic theta-delta power (PSD) analyses indicated speech envelope tracking and stimulus related power (PSD) via the delta & theta neural signals. Furthermore, delta and theta driven PAC was found at all ages with gamma amplitudes displaying a stronger PAC to low frequency phases than beta. The present study tests whether those previous findings replicate in the second half of the same cohort (first half: N=61, (1); second half: N=61). In addition to demonstrating good replication, we investigate whether cortical tracking in the first year of life predicts later language acquisition for the full infant cohort (122 infants recruited, 113, retained). Increased delta cortical tracking and theta-gamma PAC were related to better language outcomes using both infant-led and parent-estimated measures. By contrast, increased ~4Hz PSD power and a greater theta/delta power ratio related to decreased parent-estimated language outcomes. The data are interpreted within a "Temporal Sampling" framework for developmental language trajectories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Awake hippocampal replay is not required for short-term memory</a></h4>

              
                Short-term memory (STM) on a time scale of seconds to minutes is required to successfully perform day-to-day tasks, for example when engaging in a meaningful conversation. Previous studies in both rodents and primates have correlated hippocampal cellular activity and behavioural expression of STM. This research has led to models describing the putative neural mechanism in the hippocampus that mediate STM. In these models, a key role has been given to hippocampal replay - reactivation of neurons representing a trajectory through space-but definitive causal evidence that can challenge or confirm the model is missing. In this study, we aimed to address the uncertainty around the role of awake replay in STM by collecting direct causal evidence from behaving rats. Signatures of replay events were detected in the hippocampus and disrupted using electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampal commissure in rats that were trained on three different spatial memory tasks in a multi-arm radial maze. All tasks required memory of the recent past, but varied in the time scale over which information needed to be retained: (1) a multiple trial match-to sample task, (2) a single trial non-match to sample task and (3) a spatial sequence memory paradigm. Rats readily learned the task rules, but disruption of awake replay did not affect task performance or other behavioral measures in any of the task. Altogether, our results show for the first time with definitive causal evidence that awake replay is not required for STM of events or of their temporal order.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variability by region and method in human brain sodium concentrations estimated by 23Na magnetic resonance imaging: a meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Sodium imaging (23Na-MRI) is of interest in neurological conditions given potential sensitivity to the physiological and metabolic status of tissues. Benchmarks have so far been restricted to parenchyma or grey/white matter (GM/WM). We investigate (1) the availability of evidence, (2) regional pooled estimates and (3) variability attributable to regional/methodology. MEDLINE literature search for Tissue sodium concentration (TSC) measured in specified healthy brain regions returned 127 reports plus 278 retrieved from bibliographies. 28 studies met inclusion criteria, including 400 individuals. Reporting variability led to nested data structure, so we used multilevel meta-analysis and a random effects model to pool effect sizes. The pooled mean from 141 TSC estimates was 40.51 mM (95% CI: 37.59 - 43.44; p< 0.001, I2Total=99.4%). Tissue as a moderator was significant (F214=65.34, p-val < .01). Six sub-regional pooled means with requisite statistical power were derived. We were unable to consider most methodological and demographic factors sought because of non-reporting, but each factor included beyond tissue improved model fit. Significant residual heterogeneity remained. The current estimates provide an empirical point of departure for better understanding in 23Na-MRI. Improving on current estimates supports: (1) larger, more representative data collection/sharing, including (2) regional data, and (3) agreement on full reporting standards.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overflow of Working Memory from an Easily Accessible Active State</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is a system that realizes short-term memory retention and is essential to everyday activities. Recently, it has been suggested that working memory items can be maintained in both an active state with sustained neural activity and a latent state without any explicit neural activity. However, how easily we can retrieve memories in each state and how much information can be retained in the active state remains unknown. Here, we addressed these questions by adopting a novel experimental paradigm for measuring the reaction time required to recall a letter of the alphabet when presented with a corresponding color, based on memorized color/letter pairs. The results demonstrated that when participants retained only two pairs of items, they could recall both pairs similarly quickly. However, when there were two or more memorized pairs, the most recent or internally attended pairs were recalled more quickly than the other pairs. These results suggest that memories in the "active" state are accessed first and memories that have overflowed into the "latent" state are accessed afterward. Additionally, the capacity of the easily accessible active state is extremely limited (to approximately two chunks of information) compared with the traditionally considered working memory capacity (four to seven chunks). These results provide robust behavioral support for the co-existence of multiple states in working memory and underscore the need for a more detailed classification of the working memory capacity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The motor pattern of rolling escape locomotion in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                When undisturbed, Drosophila larvae move forward through their environment with sweeping waves of caudal to rostral muscle contraction [1, 2]. In stark contrast, nociceptive sensory stimuli (such as attacks by parasitoid wasps) trigger the larvae to roll across the substrate by corkscrewing around the long body axis [3, 4]. While studies have described the motor pattern of larval crawling [1, 2], the motor pattern of larval rolling escape locomotion remains unknown. Here, we have determined this pattern. To do so, we developed a high speed confocal time-lapse imaging preparation that allowed us to trigger rolling with optogenetics while simultaneously imaging a genetically encoded calcium sensor that was expressed in the muscles. Of the 30 muscles present in each larval abdominal hemisegment we find that only 11 muscles are consistently and specifically activated across segments during rolling. 8 additional muscles are more sparsely activated. Importantly, the sequential pattern of muscle recruitment during rolling is completely distinct from that of forward or reverse crawling. We discover that a roll involves a wave of muscle activation that propagates around the larval circumference (in the transverse plane of each segment) and involves four coactive muscle groups. A pattern of activation progresses from coactive ventral muscle groups to dorsal groups and then spreads across the midline to the contralateral dorsal muscle groups which then progresses back to the ventral groups. Finally, the direction of a roll (either clockwise or counterclockwise around the body) is determined by the clockwise or counterclockwise order of muscle group activation around the transverse plane.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Catecholaminergic neuromodulation and selective attention jointly shape perceptual decision making</a></h4>

              
                Perception of sensory input is influenced by fluctuations in ongoing neural activity, most prominently driven by attention and neuromodulator systems. It is currently unknown if neuromodulator activity and attention differentially modulate neural activity and perception or whether neuromodulatory systems in fact control attentional processes. We pharmacologically enhanced cholinergic (through donepezil) and catecholaminergic (through atomoxetine) levels in humans performing a visual attention task to investigate the effects of neuromodulatory drive and spatial attention on neural activity and behavior. Attention and catecholaminergic enhancement both improved perceptual sensitivity by increasing the rate of evidence accumulation towards a decision threshold (cholinergic effects were negligible). Electroencephalographic recordings revealed that attention and catecholaminergic enhancement both modulated pre-stimulus cortical excitability, evoked sensory processes and parietal evidence accumulation. Crucially however, the spatial profile and timing of these effects were remarkably different. This suggests that selective attention and neuromodulatory systems shape perception largely independently and in qualitatively different ways.

                It has been repeatedly claimed that emotional faces capture attention readily, and that they are processed without awareness. Yet some observations cast doubt on these assertions. Part of the problem may lie in the experimental paradigms employed. Here, we used a free viewing visual search task and simultaneously recorded electroencephalography and eye-movements. Fixation-related potentials were computed for fearful and neutral facial expressions, and the electrical response compared when participants were aware or unaware of the fixated stimulus. We showed that the P300 increased across repeated fixations on the unseen targets, culminating in a conscious report, likely reflecting evidence accumulation. Awareness of the stimulus was associated with electrical changes emerging at around 130 ms, with emotions of the stimulus being dissociated only after awareness had arisen. These results suggest that the earliest electrical correlate of awareness emerges at around 130 ms in visual search and that emotion processing requires visual awareness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contrast detection is enhanced by non-stochastic, high-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation with triangle and sine waveform.</a></h4>

              
                Stochastic Resonance (SR) describes a phenomenon where an additive noise (stochastic carrier-wave) enhances the signal transmission in a nonlinear system. In the nervous system, nonlinear properties are present from the level of single ion channels all the way to perception and appear to support the emergence of SR. For example, SR has been repeatedly demonstrated for visual detection tasks, also by adding noise directly to cortical areas via transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). We mathematically show that high-frequency, non-stochastic, periodic signals can yield resonance-like effects with linear transfer and infinite signal-to-noise ratio at the output. Here we tested this prediction empirically and investigated whether non-random, high-frequency, transcranial alternating current stimulation (hf-tACS) applied to visual cortex could induce resonance-like effects and enhance performance on a visual detection task. We demonstrated in 28 participants that applying 80 Hz triangular-waves or sine-waves with hf-tACS reduced visual contrast detection threshold for optimal brain stimulation intensities. The influence of hf-tACS on contrast sensitivity was equally effective to tRNS-induced modulation, demonstrating that both hf-tACS and tRNS can reduce contrast detection thresholds. Our findings suggest that a resonance-like mechanism can also emerge when non-stochastic electrical waveforms are applied via hf-tACS.

                Progress in neuroscience research hinges on technical advances in visualizing living brain tissue with high fidelity and facility. Current neuroanatomical imaging approaches either require tissue fixation, do not have cellular resolution or only give a fragmented view. Here, we show how regular light microscopy together with fluorescence labeling of the interstitial fluid in the extracellular space provide comprehensive optical access in real-time to the anatomical complexity and dynamics of living brain tissue.

                Visual perception is limited by spatial resolution, which declines with eccentricity and differs around polar angle locations. To compensate for poor peripheral resolution, we make rapid eye movements, saccades, to bring peripheral objects into high-acuity foveal vision. Already before saccade onset, visual attention shifts to the saccade target location and prioritizes visual processing. This presaccadic shift of attention improves performance in many visual tasks, but whether it changes resolution is unknown. Here, we investigated whether presaccadic attention sharpens peripheral spatial resolution; and if so, whether such effect interacts with polar angle locations. We measured acuity thresholds in an orientation discrimination task during fixation and saccade preparation around the visual field. The results revealed that presaccadic attention sharpens acuity, which can facilitate a smooth transition from peripheral to foveal representation. This acuity enhancement is similar across the four cardinal locations; thus, presaccadic attention does not change polar angle differences in resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A permissive role for dopamine in the production of vigorous movements</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is essential for the production of vigorous movements, but how dopamine modifies the gain of motor commands remains unclear. Here, we developed a dexterous motor task in which head-restrained mice self-initiate fast and large-amplitude lever pushes with their left forelimb to earn rewards. We show that this task is goal-directed and depends on cortico-striatal circuits in the hemisphere contralateral to the limb used to push the lever. We find that unilateral loss of midbrain dopamine neurons reduces the speed and amplitude of lever pushes, and that levodopa treatment rapidly restores motor vigor, consistent with parkinsonian bradykinesia. Photometry recordings of striatal dopamine levels indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of levodopa does not require phasic dopamine release. In dopamine-intact mice, optogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons calibrated to mimic transients evoked by rewards is also insufficient to increase the speed and amplitude of forelimb movements. Together, our data show that phasic dopamine transients are unlikely to specify the vigor of forelimb movements online as they are being executed, and suggest instead that dopamine plays a permissive role in the selection and production of vigorous movements. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of how the basal ganglia contribute to motor control under physiological conditions and in Parkinson's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging the Neural Substrate of Trigeminal Neuralgia Pain Using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe and disabling facial pain condition and is characterized by intermittent, severe, electric shock-like pain in one (or more) trigeminal subdivisions. This pain can be triggered by an innocuous stimulus or can be spontaneous. Presently available therapies for TN include both surgical and pharmacological management; however, the lack of a known etiology for TN contributes to the unpredictable response to treatment and the variability in long-term clinical outcomes. Given this, a range of peripheral and central mechanisms underlying TN pain remain to be understood. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from TN patients who (1) rested comfortably in the scanner during a resting state session and (2) rated their pain levels in real time using a calibrated tracking ball-controlled scale in a pain tracking session. Following data acquisition, the data was analyzed using the conventional correlation analysis and two artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired deep learning methods: convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Each of the three methods yielded a set of brain regions related to the generation and perception of pain in TN. There were six regions that were identified by all three methods, including the superior temporal cortex, the insula, the fusiform, the precentral gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the supramarginal gyrus. Additionally, 17 regions, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex(dACC) and the thalamus, were identified by at least two of the three methods. Collectively, these 23 regions represent signature centers of TN pain and provide target areas for future studies relating to central mechanisms of TN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related changes in brain metabolites underlie slowing of speed-accuracy trade-off</a></h4>

              
                Aging leads to response slowing but the underpinning cognitive and neural mechanisms remain elusive. We studied cognitive components of response speed with a diffusion drift model to estimate non-decision, boundary-separation, and drift-rate contributions to choice reaction times of older (62-80 years) and younger (18-29 years) adults (n=25 each). We characterised age-related differences in the metabolic and microstructural profile of cortical regions and white matter (WM) pathways of visuo-perceptual and attention networks with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging. Aging was associated with increased non-decision time and boundary-separation, reduced N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentrations in anterior cingulate (ACC) and posterior parietal cortices, and reduced WM microstructure in the optic radiation (OR), inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF, SLF) and fornix. NAA in ACC and diffusivities in OR and SLF predicted non-decision time, while restricted diffusivity signal fraction in the ILF and fornix, and diffusivity in OR predicted boundary-separation. These results suggest that age-related deterioration of neuronal health and WM microstructure in visuo-perceptual and attention networks contribute to response slowing in aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do intrinsic functional networks reflect interacting brain rhythms? Assessing the power bias in MEG amplitude connectivity at rest</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological measures of functional connectivity can be affected by the power bias, i.e., variations in their estimation due to variations in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) rather than in genuine neural interactions. Intrinsic functional networks emerge at rest from magnetoencephalography (MEG) amplitude connectivity mostly within the  and {beta} frequency bands, where the SNR of MEG recordings is coincidentally maximal. This raises the question, is the spectral specificity of these networks really driven by neural oscillatory dynamics or is it an artifact due to the power bias? Here, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the power bias in amplitude connectivity allowing to disentangle the neural part of connectivity from the nonlinear SNR dependence of estimated amplitude connectivity (as well as from the contribution of noise correlations). On this basis, we developed a new correction technique involving a SNR-dependent renormalization of amplitude connectivity, which we validated using synthetic data. We then applied the technique to resting-state MEG data and quantified to what extent the power bias affects the spectral content of intrinsic functional brain couplings. We demonstrated the absence of such effect, which was explained by the observation in synthetic data that the power bias is very reduced at the sufficiently high SNRs found in resting-state MEG recordings. Comparison with a classical linear regression technique highlights the importance of our nonlinear correction to reach this conclusion. Our analysis thus confirms the crucial role of neural oscillations for the spontaneous emergence of intrinsic brain functional networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct spectral profiles of awake resting EEG in disorders of consciousness - the role of frequency and topography of oscillations</a></h4>

              
                The prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC) pose a challenge for an accurate clinical diagnosis, mainly due to patients scarce or ambiguous behavioral responsiveness. Measurement of brain activity can support better diagnosis, independent of motor restrictions. Methods based on spectral analysis of resting-state EEG appear as a promising path, revealing specific changes within the internal brain dynamics in PDOC patients. In this study we used a robust method of resting-state EEG power spectrum parameter extraction to identify distinct spectral properties for different types of PDOC. Sixty patients and 37 healthy volunteers participated in this study. Patient group consisted of 22 unresponsive wakefulness patients, 25 minimally conscious patients and 13 patients emerging from the minimally conscious state. Ten minutes of resting EEG was acquired during wakefulness and transformed into individual power spectra. For each patient, using the spectral decomposition algorithm, we extracted maximum peak frequency within 1-14 Hz range in the centro-parietal region, and the antero-posterior (AP) gradient of the maximal frequency peak. All patients were behaviorally diagnosed using Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R). The maximal peak frequency in the 1-14 Hz range successfully predicted both neurobehavioral capacity of patients as indicated by CRS-R total score and PDOC diagnosis. Additionally in patients in whom only one peak within the 1-14 Hz range was observed, the AP gradient significantly contributed to the accuracy of prediction. We have identified three distinct spectral profiles of patients, likely representing separate neurophysiological modes of thalamocortical functioning. Etiology did not have significant influence on the obtained results.

                Neurons in cortex synchronize their spiking in response to local and distant inputs. These synchronized assemblies are fundamental to cortex function, yet basic dynamical aspects about their size and duration are largely unknown. Using 2-photon imaging of neurons in superficial cortex of awake mice, we show that synchronized assemblies organize as scale-invariant avalanches that quadratically grow with duration. This quadratic expansion was found only for correlated neurons and required temporal coarse graining to compensate for spatial subsampling when network dynamics are critical, as demonstrated in simulations. The corresponding time course of an inverted parabola with an exponent of 2 described avalanches of up to 5 s duration and maximized temporal complexity in the ongoing activity of prefrontal and somatosensory cortex and in visual responses of primary visual cortex. Our results identify a scale-invariant order in the synchronization of highly diverse cortical cell assemblies in the form of parabolic avalanches.

                Hippocampal seizures mimicking mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) cause a profound disruption of the adult neurogenic niche in mice. Seizures provoke neural stem cells to switch to a reactive phenotype (reactive-neural stem cells, React-NSCs)) characterized by multibranched hypertrophic morphology, massive activation to enter mitosis, symmetric division and final differentiation into reactive astrocytes. As a result, neurogenesis is chronically impaired. Here we, using a mouse model of MTLE, show that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalization pathway is key for the induction of React-NSCs and that its inhibition exerts a beneficial effect on the neurogenic niche. We show that during the initial days after the induction of seizures by a single intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid, a strong release of zinc and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, both activators of the EGFR signalization pathway in neural stem cells, is produced. Administration of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, a chemotherapeutic in clinical phase IV, prevents the induction of React-NSCs and preserves neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The inhibitory control of traveling waves in cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                Propagating waves of activity can be evoked and can occur spontaneously in vivo and in vitro. We examine the properties of these waves as inhibition varies in a cortical slice and then develop several computational models. We first show that in the slice, inhibition controls the velocity of propagation as well as the magnitude of the local field potential. We introduce a spiking model of sparsely connected excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons which are distributed on a one-dimensional domain and illustrate both evoked and spontaneous waves. The excitatory neurons have an additional spike-frequency adaptation current which limits their maximal activity. We show that increased inhibition slows the waves down and limits the participation of excitatory cells in this spiking network. Decreased inhibition leads to large amplitude faster moving waves similar to those seen in seizures. To gain further insight into the mechanism that control the waves, we then systematically reduce the model to a Wilson-Cowan type network using a mean-field approach. We simulate this network directly and by using numerical continuation to follow traveling waves in a moving coordinate system as we vary the strength and spread of inhibition and the strength of adaptation. We find several types of instability (bifurcations) that lead to the loss of waves and subsequent pattern formation. We approximate the smooth nonlinearity by a step function and obtain expressions for the velocity, wave-width, and stability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of walking with reduced trunk motion on dynamic stability in healthy adults</a></h4>

              
                Most people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) walk with a smaller mediolateral base of support (BoS) compared to healthy people, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. According to the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) concept, a decrease in mediolateral XCoM excursion would require a smaller mediolateral BoS to maintain a constant margin of stability (MoS) and remain stable. As people with PD typically walk with reduced trunk motion, we hypothesized that the mediolateral MoS might stay the same despite a smaller BoS. As proof of principle, we assess whether walking with reduced trunk motion results in a smaller step width in healthy adults, without altering the mediolateral MoS. Fifteen healthy adults walked on a treadmill at preferred comfortable walking speed in two conditions. First, the 'regular walking' condition without any instructions, and second, the 'reduced trunk motion' condition with the instruction: 'Keep your trunk as still as possible'. Treadmill speed was kept the same in the two conditions. Trunk kinematics, step width, mediolateral XCoM excursion and mediolateral MoS were calculated and compared between the two conditions. Walking with the instruction to keep the trunk still significantly reduced trunk kinematics. Walking with reduced trunk motion resulted in significant decreases in step width and mediolateral XCoM excursion, but not in the mediolateral MoS. Furthermore, step width and mediolateral XCoM excursion were strongly correlated during both conditions (r=0.887 and r=0.934). This study shows that walking with reduced trunk motion leads to a gait pattern with a smaller BoS in healthy adults, without altering the mediolateral MoS. Our findings indicate a strong coupling between CoM motion state and the mediolateral BoS. We expect that people with PD who walk narrow-based, have a similar mediolateral MoS as healthy people, which will be further investigated.

	<p>Motor imagery (MI) describes a dynamic cognitive process where a movement is mentally simulated without taking place and holds potential as a means of stimulating motor learning and regaining motor skills. There is growing evidence that imagined and executed actions have common neural circuitry. Since MI counteracts cognitive and motor decline, a growing interest in MI-based mental exercise for older individuals has emerged. Here we review the last decade&amp;amp;rsquo;s scientific literature on age-related changes in MI skills. Heterogeneity in the experimental protocols, as well as the use of populations with unrepresentative age, is making it challenging to draw unambiguous conclusions about MI skills preservation. Self-report and behavioural tasks have shown that some MI components are preserved, while others are impaired. Evidence from neuroimaging studies revealed that, during MI tasks, older individuals hyperactivate their sensorimotor and attentional networks. Some studies have argued that this represents a compensatory mechanism, others claim that this is a sign of cognitive decline. However, further studies are needed to establish whether MI could be used as a promotion factor to improve cognitive functioning and well-being in older people.</p>

	<p>Fatigue, depression, and sleep inertia are frequently underdiagnosed manifestations in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Our cross-sectional study design included diagnostic interview accompanied by assessment instruments and aimed to explore how these factors influence disease severity as well as to elucidate any sex predisposition. One hundred and forty-eight subjects (female 63%) were divided into narcolepsy type 1 (NT1; n = 87, female = 61%), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2; n = 22, female = 59%), and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH; n = 39, female = 69%). All subjects completed a set of questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Sleep Inertia Questionnaire (SIQ). In narcoleptic subjects, questionnaire data were correlated with the Narcolepsy Severity Scale (NSS), and in subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia, with the Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS). The highest correlation in narcoleptic subjects was found between NSS and ESS (r = 0.658; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), as well as FSS (r = 0.506; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), while in subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia, the most prominent positive correlations were found between IHSS and SIQ (r = 0.894; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), FSS (r = 0.812; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), HADS depression scale (r = 0.649; p = 0.0005), and HADS anxiety scale (r = 0.528; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). ESS showed an analogic correlation with disease severity (r = 0.606; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). HADS anxiety and depression scores were higher in females (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), with similar results for FSS and SIQ scales (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 for both), and a trend toward higher ESS values in females (p = 0.057). Our study illustrates that more attention should be focused on pathophysiological mechanisms and associations of fatigue, depression, as well as sleep inertia in these diseases; they influence the course of both illnesses, particularly in women.</p>

	<p>Early literacy skills such as alphabet knowledge and phonemic awareness are made up the foundation for learning to read. These skills are more effectively taught with explicit instruction starting inpreschool and then continuing during early elementary school years. The COVID19 pandemic school closures severely impacted early literacy development worldwide. Brazil had one of the longest school closure periods, which resulted in several children having no access to any educational activities. Education Technology (EdTech) tools can leverage access to pedagogical materials and remediate the consequences of school closure. We investigated the impact of using an early literacy EdTech, GraphoGame Brazil, to foster learning of early literacy skills during the height of COVID19 school closures, in Brazil. We carried out a quasi-experimental, pretest and posttest study with elementary school students who were taking online classes. Participants were pseudo randomly assigned to (1) an experimental group, who played GraphoGame Brazil, and to (2) an active control group, who played an EdTech that focuses on early numeracy skills. The results show a significant positive training effect on word reading accuracy associated with the use of GraphoGame for the children in the experimental group, relative to the control group. We also found statistically significant negative effect in lowercase naming for the control group. We address the consequences of COVID19 school closures, the promise of EdTech and its limitations, and discuss the issue of fostering successful early literacy instruction in countries that have struggled with teaching children to read even before the pandemic.</p>

	<p>This article will explore the expressivity and tractability of vividness, as viewed from the interdisciplinary perspective of the cognitive sciences, including the sub-disciplines of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and phenomenology. Following the precursor work by Benussi in experimental phenomenology, seminal papers by David Marks in psychology and, later, Hector Levesque in computer science, a substantial part of the discussion has been around a symbolic approach to the concept of vividness. At the same time, a similar concept linked to semantic memory, imagery, and mental models has had a long history in cognitive psychology, with new emerging links to cognitive neuroscience. More recently, there is a push towards neural-symbolic representations which allows room for the integration of brain models of vividness to a symbolic concept of vividness. Such works lead to question the phenomenology of vividness in the context of consciousness, and the related ethical concerns. The purpose of this paper is to review the state of the art, advances, and further potential developments of artificial-human vividness while laying the ground for a shared conceptual platform for dialogue, communication, and debate across all the relevant sub-disciplines. Within such context, an important goal of the paper is to define the crucial role of vividness in grounding simulation and modeling within the psychology (and neuroscience) of human reasoning.</p>

	<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the &amp;amp;alpha;7 nAChR, play a critical role in neuroinflammation and microglial activation associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Microglial quinolinic acid (QUIN), which is synthesized by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase (HAAO), is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist and has been implicated in the development of MDD-related symptoms. In the present study, we assessed the effects of PNU120596, an &amp;amp;alpha;7 nAChR positive allosteric modulator (PAM), on HAAO expression and QUIN formation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We also investigated the effects of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, alone and in combination with PNU120596 on cognitive deficit and depressive-like behaviors induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice using the Y-maze and forced swim test, respectively. LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) elevated HAAO expression and QUIN formation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which were reduced with pretreatment with PNU120596 (4 mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, memantine (1 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the cognitive deficit and depressive-like behaviors induced by LPS in mice. Together, these results suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of PNU120596 are mediated by attenuation of LPS-induced QUIN formation. Therefore, &amp;amp;alpha;7 nAChR PAM could be a potential therapeutic candidate for MDD associated with neurotoxic glutamatergic transmission.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Psychosocial- and disclosure-related challenges among HIV-serodiscordant couples: an interpretative phenomenological analysis study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Serodiscordant refers to a couple where one has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the other partner is HIV negative. HIV-serodiscordancy often results in diverse psychological and emotional challenges. Evidence demonstrates that the dynamics of living in an HIV-serodiscordant relationship are often stressful. This study explored the psychosocial- and disclosure-related challenges faced by couples in HIV-serodiscordant relationships in South Africa. Methods: An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) design was followed. A total of 13 HIV-serodiscordant partners were purposively sampled. Data were collected through individual face-to-face interviews and analysed using the IPA framework. Results: The findings indicated that HIV-serodiscordant couples experienced diverse psychosocial challenges such as shock, sadness, hurt, denial and disbelief. Participants also experienced challenges such as selective disclosure and fear of further disclosure. Conclusions: The findings have implications for public health and are critical in programming and designing couple-based HIV care interventions. Couples in HIV-serodiscordant relationships would benefit more from differentiated, client-centred psychosocial support. To contribute to the HIV epidemic control and reduction of new HIV infections, specific interventions such as couples counselling, disclosure counselling, support groups, health education and safer conception risk reduction strategies need to be implemented.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of sleep and health behaviours among people with diabetes and a nondiabetic group in Phitsanulok, Thailand: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global public health problem. To avoid disease complications, people with diabetes have to control their blood glucose and maintain a healthy lifestyle including a healthy diet, weight control, moderate exercise, and smoking cessation. Methods: This study aimed to survey sleep, eating, and exercise behaviours of people with diabetes in the Bang Rakam district, a rural community in Phitsanulok province, Thailand. The data on sleep and other health behaviours were taken from 1,385 T2DM patients and 1,394 non-T2DM controls, who were aged 30 - 85 years and were free from other chronic diseases. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Compared to the control group, the people with diabetes had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI).  However, only a few of them smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Most of the participants were ‘morning people’ who slept 7-9 hours per day. It was found that sleep ≥8 hours increased the risk of diabetes among women (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.56). The people with diabetes also reported eating chicken and vegetables more than the control group. They also avoided eating beef and eating more than a cup of rice per meal. However, the T2DM group did fewer physical activities, such as walking, biking, or playing sports, during their leisure time. Conclusions: Most people with diabetes (T2DM) in a rural community of Thailand had healthy behaviours regarding sleep duration, sleep pattern, lifestyle, eating, smoking and alcohol consumption, except exercise and physical activity. The findings here contrast with the common perception that people with diabetes have bad lifestyle patterns, instead it showed that a healthy lifestyle pattern based on dietary patterns alone may not be sufficient and that lifestyle prevention of diabetes should always include physical activity as an integral part.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tsh Induces Agrp1 Neuron Proliferation in Oatp1c1-Deficient Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Thyroid hormones (THs), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3), regulate growth, metabolism, and neurodevelopment. THs secretion is controlled by the pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;thyroid (HPT) axis. The organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1/SLCO1C1) and the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8/SLC16A2) actively transport THs, which bind to their nuclear receptors and induce gene expression. A mutation in <I>OATP1C1</I> is associated with brain hypometabolism, gradual neurodegeneration, and impaired cognitive and motor functioning in adolescent patients. To understand the role of Oatp1c1 and the mechanisms of the disease, we profiled the transcriptome of <I>oatp1c1</I> mutant (<I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) and <I>mct8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup><I>xoatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> adult male and female zebrafish brains. Among dozens of differentially expressed genes, agouti-related neuropeptide 1 (<I>agrp1</I>) expression increased in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> adult brains. Imaging in the hypothalamus revealed enhanced proliferation of Agrp1 neurons in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae and adults, and increased food consumption in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae. Similarly, feeding and the number of Agrp1 neurons increased in thyroid gland-ablated zebrafish. Pharmacological treatments showed that the T3 analog TRIAC (3,3',5-tri-iodothyroacetic acid), but not T4, normalized the number of Agrp1 neurons in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> zebrafish. Since the HPT axis is hyperactive in the <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brain, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knockdown <I>tsh</I> in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae, and inducibly enhanced the HPT axis in wild-type larvae. These manipulations showed that Tsh promotes proliferation of Agrp1 neurons and increases food consumption in zebrafish. The results revealed upregulation of both the HPT axis&ndash;Agrp1 circuitry and feeding in a zebrafish model for OATP1C1 deficiency.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mutation in the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter <I>OATP1C1</I> is associated with cognitive and motor functioning disturbances in humans. Here, we used an <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> zebrafish to understand the role of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (Oatp1c1), and the characteristics of OATP1C1 deficiency. Transcriptome profiling identified upregulation of <I>agrp1</I> expression in the <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brain. The <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae showed increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (<I>tsh</I>) levels, proliferation of Agrp1 neurons and food consumption. Genetic manipulations of the hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;thyroid (HPT) axis showed that Tsh increases the number of Agrp1 neurons and food consumption. The T3 analog TRIAC (3,3',5-tri-iodothyroacetic acid) normalizes the number of Agrp1 neurons and may have potential for the treatment of Oatp1c1 deficiency. The findings demonstrate a functional interaction between the thyroid and feeding systems in the brain of zebrafish and suggest a neuroendocrinological mechanism for OATP1C1 deficiency.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">PDE2A Inhibition Enhances Axonal Sprouting, Functional Connectivity, and Recovery after Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors have been safely and effectively used in the clinic and increase the concentration of intracellular cyclic nucleotides (cAMP/cGMP). These molecules activate downstream mediators, including the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which controls neuronal excitability and growth responses. CREB gain of function enhances learning and allocates neurons into memory engrams. CREB also controls recovery after stroke. PDE inhibitors are linked to recovery from neural damage and to stroke recovery in specific sites within the brain. PDE2A is enriched in cortex. In the present study, we use a mouse cortical stroke model in young adult and aged male mice to test the effect of PDE2A inhibition on functional recovery, and on downstream mechanisms of axonal sprouting, tissue repair, and the functional connectivity of neurons in recovering cortex. Stroke causes deficits in use of the contralateral forelimb, loss of axonal projections in cortex adjacent to the infarct, and functional disconnection of neuronal networks. PDE2A inhibition enhances functional recovery, increases axonal projections in peri-infarct cortex, and, through two-photon <I>in vivo</I> imaging, enhances the functional connectivity of motor system excitatory neurons. PDE2A inhibition after stroke does not have an effect on other aspects of tissue repair, such as angiogenesis, gliogenesis, neurogenesis, and inflammatory responses. These data suggest that PDE2A inhibition is an effective therapeutic approach for stroke recovery in the rodent and that it simultaneously enhances connectivity in peri-infarct neuronal populations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inhibition of PDE2A enhances motor recovery, axonal projections, and functional connectivity of neurons in peri-infarct tissue. This represents an avenue for a pharmacological therapy for stroke recovery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Age of Reason: Functional Brain Network Development during Childhood</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human childhood is characterized by dramatic changes in the mind and brain. However, little is known about the large-scale intrinsic cortical network changes that occur during childhood because of methodological challenges in scanning young children. Here, we overcome this barrier by using sophisticated acquisition and analysis tools to investigate functional network development in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years (<f></f>; 50 female, 42 male). At multiple spatial scales, age is positively associated with brain network segregation. At the system level, age was associated with segregation of systems involved in attention from those involved in abstract cognition, and with integration among attentional and perceptual systems. Associations between age and functional connectivity are most pronounced in visual and medial prefrontal cortex, the two ends of a gradient from perceptual, externally oriented cortex to abstract, internally oriented cortex. These findings suggest that both ends of the sensory-association gradient may develop early, in contrast to the classical theories that cortical maturation proceeds from back to front, with sensory areas developing first and association areas developing last. More mature patterns of brain network architecture, controlling for age, were associated with better visuospatial reasoning abilities. Our results suggest that as cortical architecture becomes more specialized, children become more able to reason about the world and their place in it.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anthropologists have called the transition from early to middle childhood the "age of reason", when children across cultures become more independent. We employ cutting-edge neuroimaging acquisition and analysis approaches to investigate associations between age and functional brain architecture in childhood. Age was positively associated with segregation between cortical systems that process the external world and those that process abstract phenomena like the past, future, and minds of others. Surprisingly, we observed pronounced development at both ends of the sensory-association gradient, challenging the theory that sensory areas develop first and association areas develop last. Our results open new directions for research into how brains reorganize to support rapid gains in cognitive and socioemotional skills as children reach the age of reason.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Large-Scale Mapping of Vocalization-Related Activity in the Functionally Diverse Nuclei in Rat Posterior Brainstem</a></h4>

              
                <p>The identity and location of vocalization pattern generating (VPG) circuits in mammals is debated. Based on physiological experiments, investigators suggested anterior brainstem circuits in the reticular formation, and anatomic evidence suggested the nucleus retroambiguus (NRA) in the posterior brainstem, or combinations of these sites as the putative mammalian VPG. Additionally, vocalization loudness is a critical factor in acoustic communication. However, many of the underlying neuronal mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we evoked calls by stimulation of the periaqueductal gray in anesthetized male rats, performed a large-scale mapping of vocalization-related activity using the activity marker c-<I>fos</I>, and high-density recordings of brainstem circuits using Neuropixels probes. Both c-<I>fos</I> expression and recording of vocalization-related activity point to a participation of the NRA in vocalization. More important, among our recorded structures, we found that the NRA is the only brainstem area showing a strong correlation between unit activity and call intensity. In addition, we observed functionally diverse patterns of vocalization-related activity in a set of regions around NRA. Dorsal to NRA, we observed activity specific to the beginning and end of vocalizations in the posterior level of the medullary reticular nucleus, dorsal part, whereas medial and lateral to the NRA, we observed activity related to call initiation. No clear vocalization-related activity was observed at anterior brainstem sites. Our findings suggest a set of functionally heterogeneous regions around the NRA contribute to vocal pattern generation in rats.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Vocalization patterns are shaped in the mammalian brainstem, but the identity and location of the circuits involved is debated. Additionally, the neuronal mechanisms of vocal intensity control are still unknown. This study consisted of a large-scale mapping of brainstem vocalization circuits based on the activity marker c-<I>fos</I> and high-density recordings with Neuropixels probes. The results confirm the role of nucleus retroambiguus in call production and point to a key role of neurons in this nucleus in loudness control. Dorsal to the nucleus retroambiguus and in the posterior medulla, the authors identify neurons with activity specific to the beginning and end of vocalizations. The results point to specific neural dials for various aspects of rat vocalization control in the posterior brainstem.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Midbrain Inspired Recurrent Neural Network Model for Robust Change Detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>We present a biologically inspired recurrent neural network (RNN) that efficiently detects changes in natural images. The model features sparse, topographic connectivity (st-RNN), closely modeled on the circuit architecture of a "midbrain attention network." We deployed the st-RNN in a challenging change blindness task, in which changes must be detected in a discontinuous sequence of images. Compared with a conventional RNN, the st-RNN learned 9x faster and achieved state-of-the-art performance with 15x fewer connections. An analysis of low-dimensional dynamics revealed putative circuit mechanisms, including a critical role for a global inhibitory (GI) motif, for successful change detection. The model reproduced key experimental phenomena, including midbrain neurons' sensitivity to dynamic stimuli, neural signatures of stimulus competition, as well as hallmark behavioral effects of midbrain microstimulation. Finally, the model accurately predicted human gaze fixations in a change blindness experiment, surpassing state-of-the-art saliency-based methods. The st-RNN provides a novel deep learning model for linking neural computations underlying change detection with psychophysical mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> For adaptive survival, our brains must be able to accurately and rapidly detect changing aspects of our visual world. We present a novel deep learning model, a sparse, topographic recurrent neural network (st-RNN), that mimics the neuroanatomy of an evolutionarily conserved "midbrain attention network." The st-RNN achieved robust change detection in challenging change blindness tasks, outperforming conventional RNN architectures. The model also reproduced hallmark experimental phenomena, both neural and behavioral, reported in seminal midbrain studies. Lastly, the st-RNN outperformed state-of-the-art models at predicting human gaze fixations in a laboratory change blindness experiment. Our deep learning model may provide important clues about key mechanisms by which the brain efficiently detects changes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Early Life Pain Experience Changes Adult Functional Pain Connectivity in the Rat Somatosensory and the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Early life pain (ELP) experience alters adult pain behavior and increases injury-induced pain hypersensitivity, but the effect of ELP on adult functional brain connectivity is not known. We have performed continuous local field potential (LFP) recording in the awake adult male rats to test the effect of ELP on functional cortical connectivity related to pain behavior. Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) LFPs evoked by mechanical hindpaw stimulation were recorded simultaneously with pain reflex behavior for 10 d after adult incision injury. We show that, after adult injury, sensory evoked S1 LFP  and  energy and S1 LFP / frequency coupling are significantly increased in ELP rats compared with controls. Adult injury also induces increases in S1-mPFC functional connectivity, but this is significantly prolonged in ELP rats, lasting 4 d compared with 1 d in controls. Importantly, the increases in LFP energy and connectivity in ELP rats were directly correlated with increased behavioral pain hypersensitivity. Thus, ELP alters adult brain functional connectivity, both within and between cortical areas involved in sensory and affective dimensions of pain. The results reveal altered brain connectivity as a mechanism underlying the effects of ELP on adult pain perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pain and stress in early life has a lasting impact on pain behavior and may increase vulnerability to chronic pain in adults. Here, we record pain-related cortical activity and simultaneous pain behavior in awake adult male rats previously exposed to pain in early life. We show that functional connectivity within and between the somatosensory cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is increased in these rats and that these increases are correlated with their behavioral pain hypersensitivity. The results reveal that early life pain (ELP) alters adult brain connectivity, which may explain the impact of childhood pain on adult chronic pain vulnerability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Autonomic Nerve Fibers Aberrantly Reinnervate Denervated Facial Muscles and Alter Muscle Fiber Population</a></h4>

              
                <p>The surgical redirection of efferent neural input to a denervated muscle via a nerve transfer can reestablish neuromuscular control after nerve injuries. The role of autonomic nerve fibers during the process of muscular reinnervation remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neurobiological mechanisms behind the spontaneous functional recovery of denervated facial muscles in male rodents. Recovered facial muscles demonstrated an abundance of cholinergic axonal endings establishing functional neuromuscular junctions. The parasympathetic source of the neuronal input was confirmed to be in the pterygopalatine ganglion. Furthermore, the autonomically reinnervated facial muscles underwent a muscle fiber change to a purely intermediate muscle fiber population myosin heavy chain type IIa. Finally, electrophysiological tests revealed that the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel to the facial muscles via the sensory infraorbital nerve. Our findings demonstrated expanded neuromuscular plasticity of denervated striated muscles enabling functional recovery via alien autonomic fibers. These findings may further explain the underlying mechanisms of sensory protection implemented to prevent atrophy of a denervated muscle.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nerve injuries represent significant morbidity and disability for patients. Rewiring motor nerve fibers to other target muscles has shown to be a successful approach in the restoration of motor function. This demonstrates the remarkable capacity of the CNS to adapt to the needs of the neuromuscular system. Yet, the capability of skeletal muscles being reinnervated by nonmotor axons remains largely unknown. Here, we show that under deprivation of original efferent input, the neuromuscular system can undergo functional and morphologic remodeling via autonomic nerve fibers. This may explain neurobiological mechanisms of the sensory protection phenomenon, which is because of parasympathetic reinnervation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prolactin Action Is Necessary for Parental Behavior in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parental care is critical for successful reproduction in mammals. Recent work has implicated the hormone prolactin in regulating male parental behavior, similar to its established role in females. Male laboratory mice show a mating-induced suppression of infanticide (normally observed in virgins) and onset of paternal behavior 2 weeks after mating. Using this model, we sought to investigate how prolactin acts in the forebrain to regulate paternal behavior. First, using c-fos immunoreactivity in prolactin receptor (Prlr) <I>Prlr</I>-IRES-Cre-tdtomato reporter mouse sires, we show that the circuitry activated during paternal interactions contains prolactin-responsive neurons in multiple sites, including the medial preoptic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and medial amygdala. Next, we deleted <I>Prlr</I> from three prominent cell types found in these regions: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and CaMKII&alpha;. Prlr deletion from CaMKII&alpha;, but not glutamatergic or GABAergic cells, had a profound effect on paternal behavior as none of these KO males completed the pup-retrieval task. Prolactin was increased during mating, but not in response to pups, suggesting that the mating-induced secretion of prolactin is important for establishing the switch from infanticidal to paternal behavior. Pharmacological blockade of prolactin secretion at mating, however, had no effect on paternal behavior. In contrast, suppressing prolactin secretion at the time of pup exposure resulted in failure to retrieve pups, with exogenous prolactin administration rescuing this behavior. Together, our data show that paternal behavior in sires is dependent on basal levels of circulating prolactin acting at the time of interaction with pups, mediated through Prlr on CaMKII&alpha;-expressing neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parental care is critical for offspring survival. Compared with maternal care, however, the neurobiology of paternal care is less well understood. Here we show that the hormone prolactin, which is most well known for its female-specific role in lactation, has a role in the male brain to promote paternal behavior. In the absence of prolactin signaling specifically during interactions with pups, father mice fail to show normal retrieval behavior of pups. These data demonstrate that prolactin has a similar action in both males and females to promote parental care.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stable Working Memory and Perceptual Representations in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex during Naturalistic Vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primates use perceptual and mnemonic visuospatial representations to perform everyday functions. Neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) have been shown to encode both of these representations during tasks where eye movements are strictly controlled and visual stimuli are reduced in complexity. This raises the question of whether perceptual and mnemonic representations encoded by LPFC neurons remain robust during naturalistic vision&mdash;in the presence of a rich visual scenery and during eye movements. Here we investigate this issue by training macaque monkeys to perform working memory and perception tasks in a visually complex virtual environment that requires navigation using a joystick and allows for free visual exploration of the scene. We recorded the activity of 3950 neurons in the LPFC (areas 8a and 9/46) of two male rhesus macaques using multielectrode arrays, and measured eye movements using video tracking. We found that navigation trajectories to target locations and eye movement behavior differed between the perception and working memory tasks, suggesting that animals used different behavioral strategies. Single neurons were tuned to target location during cue encoding and working memory delay, and neural ensemble activity was predictive of the behavior of the animals. Neural decoding of the target location was stable throughout the working memory delay epoch. However, neural representations of similar target locations differed between the working memory and perception tasks. These findings indicate that during naturalistic vision, LPFC neurons maintain robust and distinct neural codes for mnemonic and perceptual visuospatial representations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that lateral prefrontal cortex neurons encode working memory and perceptual representations during a naturalistic task set in a virtual environment. We show that despite eye movement and complex visual input, neurons maintain robust working memory representations of space, which are distinct from neuronal representations for perception. We further provide novel insight into the use of virtual environments to construct behavioral tasks for electrophysiological experiments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sustained Activity of Hippocampal Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneurons Supports Trace Eyeblink Conditioning in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although recent studies have revealed an involvement of hippocampal interneurons in learning the association among time-separated events, its underlying cellular mechanisms remained not fully clarified. Here, we combined multichannel recording and optogenetics to elucidate how the hippocampal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) support associative learning. To address this issue, we trained the mice (both sexes) to learn hippocampus-dependent trace eyeblink conditioning (tEBC) in which they associated a light flash conditioned stimulus (CS) with a corneal air puff unconditioned stimuli (US) separated by a 250 ms time interval. We found that the hippocampal PV-INs exhibited learning-associated sustained activity at the early stage of tEBC acquisition. Moreover, the PV-IN sustained activity was positively correlated with the occurrence of conditioned eyeblink responses at the early learning stage. Suppression of the PV-IN sustained activity impaired the acquisition of tEBC, whereas the PV-IN activity suppression had no effect on the acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampus-independent learning task. Learning-associated augmentation in the excitatory pyramidal cell-to-PVIN drive may contribute to the formation of PV-IN sustained activity. Suppression of the PV-IN sustained activity disrupted hippocampal gamma but not theta band oscillation during the CS-US interval period. Gamma frequency (40 Hz) activation of the PV-INs during the CS-US interval period facilitated the acquisition of tEBC. Our current findings highlight the involvement of hippocampal PV-INs in tEBC acquisition and reveal insights into the PV-IN activity kinetics which are of key importance for the hippocampal involvement in associative learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cellular mechanisms underlying associative learning have not been fully clarified. Previous studies focused on the involvement of hippocampal pyramidal cells in associative learning, whereas the activity and function of hippocampal interneurons were largely neglected. We herein demonstrated the hippocampal PV-INs exhibited learning-associated sustained activity, which was required for the acquisition of tEBC. Furthermore, we showed evidence that the PV-IN sustained activity might have arisen from the learning-associated augmentation in excitatory pyramidal cell-to-PVIN drive and contributed to learning-associated augmentation in gamma band oscillation during tEBC acquisition. Our findings provide more mechanistic understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the hippocampal involvement in associative learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deiters Cells Act as Mechanical Equalizers for Outer Hair Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>The outer hair cells in the mammalian cochlea are cellular actuators essential for sensitive hearing. The geometry and stiffness of the structural scaffold surrounding the outer hair cells will determine how the active cells shape mammalian hearing by modulating the organ of Corti (OoC) vibrations. Specifically, the tectorial membrane and the Deiters cell are mechanically in series with the hair bundle and soma, respectively, of the outer hair cell. Their mechanical properties and anatomic arrangement must determine the relative motion among different OoC structures. We measured the OoC mechanics in the cochleas acutely excised from young gerbils of both sexes at a resolution fine enough to distinguish the displacement of individual cells. A three-dimensional finite element model of fully deformable OoC was exploited to analyze the measured data in detail. As a means to verify the computer model, the basilar membrane deformations because of static and dynamic stimulations were measured and simulated. Two stiffness ratios have been identified that are critical to understand cochlear physics, which are the stiffness of the tectorial membrane with respect to the hair bundle and the stiffness of the Deiters cell with respect to the outer hair cell body. Our measurements suggest that the Deiters cells act like a mechanical equalizer so that the outer hair cells are constrained neither too rigidly nor too weakly.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mammals can detect faint sounds thanks to the action of mammalian-specific receptor cells called the outer hair cells. It is getting clearer that understanding the interactions between the outer hair cells and their surrounding structures such as the tectorial membrane and the Deiters cell is critical to resolve standing debates. Depending on theories, the stiffness of those two structures ranges from negligible to rigid. Because of their perceived importance, their properties have been measured in previous studies. However, nearly all existing data were obtained <I>ex situ</I> (after they were detached from the outer hair cells), which obscures their interaction with the outer hair cells. We quantified the mechanical properties of the tectorial membrane and the Deiters cell <I>in situ</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Conserved and Distinct Functions of the Autism-Related Chromatin Remodeler CHD8 in Embryonic and Adult Forebrain Neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>The chromatin remodeler CHD8 represents a high-confidence risk factor in autism, a multistage progressive neurologic disorder, however the underlying stage-specific functions remain elusive. In this study, by analyzing <I>Chd8</I> conditional knock-out mice (male and female), we find that CHD8 controls cortical neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) proliferation and survival in a stage-dependent manner. Strikingly, inducible genetic deletion reveals that CHD8 is required for the production and fitness of transit-amplifying intermediate progenitors (IPCs) essential for upper-layer neuron expansion in the embryonic cortex. p53 loss of function partially rescues apoptosis and neurogenesis defects in the <I>Chd8</I>-deficient brain. Further, transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling indicates that CHD8 regulates the chromatin accessibility landscape to activate neurogenesis-promoting factors including TBR2, a key regulator of IPC neurogenesis, while repressing DNA damage- and p53-induced apoptotic programs. In the adult brain, CHD8 depletion impairs forebrain neurogenesis by impeding IPC differentiation from NSCs in both subventricular and subgranular zones; however, unlike in embryos, it does not affect NSC proliferation and survival. Treatment with an antidepressant approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), fluoxetine, partially restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis in <I>Chd8</I>-ablated mice. Together, our multistage functional studies identify temporally specific roles for CHD8 in developmental and adult neurogenesis, pointing to a potential strategy to enhance neurogenesis in the CHD8-deficient brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The role of the high-confidence autism gene <I>CHD8</I> in neurogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify a stage-specific function of CHD8 in development of NSCs in developing and adult brains by conserved, yet spatiotemporally distinct, mechanisms. In embryonic cortex, CHD8 is critical for the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of both NSC and IPCs during cortical neurogenesis. In adult brain, CHD8 is required for IPC generation but not the proliferation and survival of adult NSCs. Treatment with FDA-approved antidepressant fluoxetine partially rescues the adult neurogenesis defects in CHD8 mutants. Thus, our findings help resolve CHD8 functions throughout life during embryonic and adult neurogenesis and point to a potential avenue to promote neurogenesis in CHD8 deficiency.</p>

                Background: E-government is an initiative taken by governments worldwide to align the administration of their countries. Governments have utilized the internet as part of a transition into a globalized economy. This helps reduce red tape and procedures in dealing with people in government agencies. This study aims to develop an e-government model as an anti-corruption strategy by applying the Penta-helix model and religiosity as the moderating variable. Methods: The data was gathered from government officials, representatives in business, media, academia, and NGOs, in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2021. Online questionnaires were distributed to 240 respondents from Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition, SPSS v.25 and SEM AMOS v.25 were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings indicate that the Penta-helix elements and religiosity could help to reduce corruption in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Malaysia must increase its human resource competency and embed the religiosity element as a tool to reduce corruption. Conclusion: Penta-helix and religious factors should be incorporated by organizations in Malaysia and Indonesia as part of their strategy in combating corruption.

                Abstract Background Childbirth is a life-transforming intense event to a woman and her family. Even though a variety of non-pharmacological techniques are readily available to alleviate the distress of women in labour, the majority of women are unaware of its benefits. The objective of the study was to explore the impact of a simple non-pharmacological technique i.e., antepartum breathing exercises on maternal outcomes of labour among primigravid women. Methods A single centre prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at the antenatal outpatient clinic of a secondary healthcare institution. Eligible primigravid women were randomized into intervention and standard care groups. Both groups received standard obstetrical care. In addition, the intervention group were taught antepartum breathing exercises and were advised to practise daily and also during the active stage of labour. The primary outcome of the trial was the maternal outcome of labour measured in terms of onset of labour, nature of delivery, duration of labour, and need for augmentation of labour. Data was collected using World Health Organization (WHO) partograph, structured observational record on the outcome of labour. Results A total of 98 (70%) primigravid women who practised antepartum breathing exercises had spontaneous onset of labour. The odds of spontaneous onset of labour after randomization in the intervention group was 2.192 times more when compared to standard care at a (95% confidence interval 1.31–3.36, p<.001). Also, the requirement for augmentation of labour was minimal and there was a reduction in the rate of caesarean deliveries (p <.05) based on the χ2 test. The overall mean duration of labour was less compared to standard care group F(1)= 133.800, p <.001. Conclusion Antepartum breathing exercises during labour can facilitate spontaneous vaginal birth, shorten the duration of labour, and reduce the need for operative interference.

                Background: The lung microbiome is composed of bacteria, viruses and fungi that interplay with each other and participate in mucosal defense protecting the lungs from colonization and infection by pathogenic microorganisms. In intensive care, a change in the composition of the lung microbiome, called dysbiosis, could be associated to the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The objective of the study was to test a method to assess the lung virome. Methods: We applied a protocol including the same nucleic acid extraction methods as used for bacterial lung microbiome and a metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to detect eukaryotic RNA, DNA viruses and bacteriophages. Results: Our method was able to detect all viruses identified with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), other eukaryotic viruses not included in the multiplex PCR panel, and bacteriophages. Notably persistent viruses, mainly Herpesviridae, associated with opportunistic infections and those showing immunodepression such as Anellovirus have been identified. Conclusions: A better description of the global composition and evolution of the lung microbiome, including viruses, could help to better understand ventilator-associated pneumonia occurrence and outcomes.

                Caecal volvulus (CV) is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, defined by an axial torsion of the caecum, ascending colon, and terminal ileum around the mesenteric vascular pedicles, leading to ischemia and bowel necrosis. A 20-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, was admitted for generalized abdominal pain evolving for three days, along with constipation and abdominal distension, but with no vomiting. Physical examination showed a generalized abdominal tenderness with no rigidity or rebound tenderness, associated with abdominal distension and tympanic upon percussion. Laboratory findings were within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed distension of a loop of the large bowel with its long axis extending from the right lower quadrant to the epigastrium or left upper quadrant. Colonic haustral pattern was absent. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a rounded focal collection of air-distended bowel with haustral creases in the upper left quadrant. In addition, spiraled loops of the collapsed cecum (giving a whirl sign) were noted, along with low-attenuating fatty mesentery from the twisted bowel. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy and caecectomy using GEA 80 charges. The patient had no complaints post-operation. CV is a rare cause of bowel obstruction, mainly caused by an exceedingly mobile caecum. Despite its rareness, CV represents the second most common cause of large bowel volvulus, behind sigmoid volvulus. For acute obstruction by CV, it is hard to differentiate it clinically from obstruction of the small bowel; therefore, radiological exams are needed. Surgery is the gold standard treatment for CV. We report a rare case of CV to highlight the rarity of this pathology, specify its diagnostic and therapeutic means, and its clinical and biological evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Early detection of biliary atresia in primary health care: still a problem [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biliary atresia is the leading cause of liver transplantation in children. Early detection of biliary atresia is crucial for diagnosis and disease progression. The purpose of this study was to analyze knowledge about biliary atresia and the effectiveness of health education in increasing the knowledge of primary health care providers. Methods:  A quasi-experimental study with pretest and posttest designs was carried out in Sidoarjo, East Java using a self-administered questionnaire. The intervention using health education was delivered by pediatrician and consultant of pediatric gastro hepatology. There were 13 questions on the questionnaire, question numbers 1 to 6 were about normal and abnormal neonatal jaundice, question numbers 7 to 13 were about biliary atresia. Results: A total of 252 participants were involved, the mean age of the participants was 40.7 ± 9.4 years old. Most of the participants were midwives (61.9%) and 77.8% of participants have years of service in primary health care > 5 years.  A total of 40.5% participants stated that newborns may have physiological jaundice, which was characterized by icteric sclera, pale stools, and dark urine. A total of 27,4% and 24,2% participants said that all jaundice in newborn will always improve on their own and newborn with prolonged jaundice does not need further examination, respectively. There was an increase in the median value in the pretest and posttest knowledge scores  after interventional health education (p < 0,05). Conclusions: The primary health care provider understands about biliary atresia, however, the initial knowledge about early detection of biliary atresia is not evenly distributed in all primary health care providers. These findings suggest that improving knowledge to early detection of biliary atresia is needed. Health education can be used effectively in increasing knowledge about biliary atresia.

                Background: Nurses have a pivotal role in initiating and managing enteral nutrition (EN) and monitoring any potential complications. Yet, it is unclear whether Yemeni nurses have adequate knowledge to deliver and manage enteral nutrition safely. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the level of ICU nurses’ knowledge regarding the care of EN. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2019 to March 2019. A probability sampling method was used to recruit 174 nurses from four public hospitals in the capital city of Yemen. A self-administered 17-item questionnaire related to ICU nurses' knowledge regarding EN intervention was used to collect the data. Results: Based on our findings, only 10.9% of the respondents had an adequate level of knowledge about EN care, while 43.1% of them had a moderate level of knowledge, and 46.0% of them had an inadequate level of knowledge. Only 16.1% of the participants were knowledgeable of EN pre-administration care, whereas 5.80% of them were knowledgeable of EN administration care, and 9.20% were knowledgeable of EN post-administration care. There were significant associations between ICU nurses’ level of knowledge of EN care and their level of education and knowledge sources. Conclusions: The significant gap in ICU nurses’ knowledge regarding EN care identified implies the need to upgrade and refresh of the ICU nurses' knowledge by implementing a regular training program concerning EN care.

                <p>by Levi Solomyak, Paul B. Sharp, Eran Eldar</p>

Many decision-making studies have demonstrated that humans learn either expected values or relative preferences among choice options, yet little is known about what environmental conditions promote one strategy over the other. Here, we test the novel hypothesis that humans adapt the degree to which they form absolute values to the diversity of the learning environment. Since absolute values generalize better to new sets of options, we predicted that the more options a person learns about the more likely they would be to form absolute values. To test this, we designed a multi-day learning experiment comprising twenty learning sessions in which subjects chose among pairs of images each associated with a different probability of reward. We assessed the degree to which subjects formed absolute values and relative preferences by asking them to choose between images they learned about in separate sessions. We found that <i>concurrently</i> learning about more images within a session enhanced absolute-value, and suppressed relative-preference, learning. Conversely, <i>cumulatively</i> pitting each image against a larger number of other images across multiple sessions did not impact the form of learning. These results show that the way humans encode preferences is adapted to the diversity of experiences offered by the immediate learning context.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Strength-dependent perturbation of whole-brain model working in different regimes reveals the role of fluctuations in brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yonatan Sanz Perl, Anira Escrichs, Enzo Tagliazucchi, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco</p>

Despite decades of research, there is still a lack of understanding of the role and generating mechanisms of the ubiquitous fluctuations and oscillations found in recordings of brain dynamics. Here, we used whole-brain computational models capable of presenting different dynamical regimes to reproduce empirical data’s turbulence level. We showed that the model’s fluctuations regime fitted to turbulence more faithfully reproduces the empirical functional connectivity compared to oscillatory and noise regimes. By applying global and local strength-dependent perturbations and subsequently measuring the responsiveness of the model, we revealed each regime’s computational capacity demonstrating that brain dynamics is shifted towards fluctuations to provide much-needed flexibility. Importantly, fluctuation regime stimulation in a brain region within a given resting state network modulates that network, aligned with previous empirical and computational studies. Furthermore, this framework generates specific, testable empirical predictions for human stimulation studies using strength-dependent rather than constant perturbation. Overall, the whole-brain models fitted to the level of empirical turbulence together with functional connectivity unveil that the fluctuation regime best captures empirical data, and the strength-dependent perturbative framework demonstrates how this regime provides maximal flexibility to the human brain.

                <p>Risk of sudden death in multiple system atrophy (MSA) is greatest during sleep with unknown mechanisms. We compared nocturnal pulse event frequency in 46 MSA patients and age-/sex-matched controls undergoing overnight pulse oximetry. Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation indices and pulse event indices (PEIs) were recorded, and relationships between pulse oximetry variables and survival were analyzed. MSA patients had lower PEI (3.1 ± 5.3 vs. 12.8 ± 10.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) despite greater hypoxic burden and similar frequency of respiratory events. Nocturnal pulse events were not associated with severity of daytime autonomic failure. Two MSA patients had suspected sudden death, both with severely reduced PEI. MSA patients have fewer nocturnal pulse events compared with controls, despite similar respiratory event frequency, suggesting abnormal cardiac responses to sleep-disordered breathing. Whether this contributes to sudden death in MSA requires further study. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Ocrelizumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, counteracts induction of humoral immune responses after severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccinations in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess if serum ocrelizumab concentration measured at the time of vaccination could predict the humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In 52 patients with MS, we found ocrelizumab concentration at the time of vaccination to be a good predictor for SARS-CoV-2 IgG anti-RBD titers after vaccination (comparable to B-cell count). As the course of ocrelizumab concentration may be predicted using pharmacokinetic models, this may be a superior biomarker to guide optimal timing for vaccinations in B-cell depleted patients with MS.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Synaptic loss is an early feature of neurodegenerative disease models, and is severe in <i>post mortem</i> clinical studies, including frontotemporal dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiotracers that bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A enables quantification of synaptic density <i>in vivo.</i> This study used [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET in participants with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), testing the hypothesis that synaptic loss is severe and related to clinical severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eleven participants with clinically probable bvFTD and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Participants underwent dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET, structural MRI and a neuropsychological battery, including the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), and INECO frontal screening (IFS). General linear models compared [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential maps and grey-matter volume between groups, and assessed associations between synaptic density and clinical severity in patients. Analyses were also performed using partial-volume corrected [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential from regions of interest (ROIs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with bvFTD showed severe synaptic loss compared to controls. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding was reduced bilaterally in medial and dorsolateral frontal regions, inferior frontal gyri, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and medial temporal lobe. Synaptic loss in the frontal and cingulate regions correlated significantly with cognitive impairments. Synaptic loss was more severe than atrophy. Results from ROI-based analyses mirrored the voxel-wise results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In accordance with preclinical models, and human <i>post mortem</i> evidence, there is widespread frontotemporal loss of synapses in symptomatic bvFTD, in proportion to severity. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET could support translational studies and experimental medicine strategies for new disease-modifying treatments for neurodegeneration.</p>
