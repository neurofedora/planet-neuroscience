                arXiv:2412.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological and artificial neural systems form high-dimensional neural representations that underpin their computational capabilities. Methods for quantifying geometric similarity in neural representations have become a popular tool for identifying computational principles that are potentially shared across neural systems. These methods generally assume that neural responses are deterministic and static. However, responses of biological systems, and some artificial systems, are noisy and dynamically unfold over time. Furthermore, these characteristics can have substantial influence on a system's computational capabilities. Here, we demonstrate that existing metrics can fail to capture key differences between neural systems with noisy dynamic responses. We then propose a metric for comparing the geometry of noisy neural trajectories, which can be derived as an optimal transport distance between Gaussian processes. We use the metric to compare models of neural responses in different regions of the motor system and to compare the dynamics of latent diffusion models for text-to-image synthesis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14498">Diverging network architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome and signaling network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connectome describes the complete set of synaptic contacts through which neurons communicate. While the architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome has been extensively characterized, much less is known about the organization of causal signaling networks arising from functional interactions between neurons. Understanding how effective communication pathways relate to or diverge from the underlying structure is a central question in neuroscience. Here, we analyze the modular architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ signal propagation network, measured via calcium imaging and optogenetics, and compare it to the underlying anatomical wiring measured by electron microscopy. Compared to the connectome, we find that signaling modules are not aligned with the modular boundaries of the anatomical network, highlighting an instance where function deviates from structure. An exception to this is the pharynx which is delineated into a separate community in both anatomy and signaling. We analyze the cellular compositions of the signaling architecture and find that its modules are enriched for specific cell types and functions, suggesting that the network modules are neurobiologically relevant. Lastly, we identify a "rich club" of hub neurons in the signaling network. The membership of the signaling rich club differs from the rich club detected in the anatomical network, challenging the view that structural hubs occupy positions of influence in functional (signaling) networks. Our results provide new insight into the interplay between brain structure, in the form of a complete synaptic-level connectome, and brain function, in the form of a system-wide causal signal propagation atlas.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14536">Multi-Modal Latent Variables for Cross-Individual Primary Visual Cortex Modeling and Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the functional mechanisms of the primary visual cortex (V1) remains a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. Current computational models face two critical limitations, namely the challenge of cross-modal integration between partial neural recordings and complex visual stimuli, and the inherent variability in neural characteristics across individuals, including differences in neuron populations and firing patterns. To address these challenges, we present a multi-modal identifiable variational autoencoder (miVAE) that employs a two-level disentanglement strategy to map neural activity and visual stimuli into a unified latent space. This framework enables robust identification of cross-modal correlations through refined latent space modeling. We complement this with a novel score-based attribution analysis that traces latent variables back to their origins in the source data space. Evaluation on a large-scale mouse V1 dataset demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-individual latent representation and alignment, without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning, and exhibits improved performance with increasing data size. Significantly, our attribution algorithm successfully identifies distinct neuronal subpopulations characterized by unique temporal patterns and stimulus discrimination properties, while simultaneously revealing stimulus regions that show specific sensitivity to edge features and luminance variations. This scalable framework offers promising applications not only for advancing V1 research but also for broader investigations in neuroscience.

                arXiv:2412.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tinnitus and hyperacusis can occur together or in isolation, with hyperacusis being associated with tinnitus much more frequently than vice versa. This striking correlation between tinnitus and hyperacusis prevalence implicates that there might be a common origin such as a (hidden) hearing loss and possibly interrelated neural mechanisms of pathological development of those two conditions. In this theoretical paper, we propose such interrelated pathological mechanisms, localized in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of the brainstem, that are based on classical mechanisms of Hebbian and associative plasticity known from classical conditioning. Specifically, our model proposes that hyperacusis results from synaptic enhancement of cochlear input to the DCN, whereas chronic tinnitus results from synaptic enhancement of somatosensory input to the DCN. Specific conditions leading to one or the other condition are discussed. Our model predicts, that hearing loss leads to chronic tinnitus, while noise exposure (which may also cause hearing loss) leads to hyperacusis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14999">Accessing the topological properties of human brain functional sub-circuits in Echo State Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an emerging trend in neuromorphic computing that centers around the use of brain connectomics as a blueprint for artificial neural networks. Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on embedding human brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as estimated from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to echo-state networks (ESNs). A critical step in ESN embedding requires pre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed by the induced subgraphs of the embedded reservoir. As \textit{a priori} set of functional sub-circuits are derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till this point, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs is well justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance across a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and evaluate ESNs with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization tasks. To this end, we showed that different performance optimums highly depend on the neuro-physiological characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits. In general, fMRI-induced sub-circuit-embedded ESN outperforms simple bipartite and various null models with feed-forward properties commonly seen in MLP for different tasks and reservoir criticality conditions. We provided a thorough analysis of the topological properties of pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits and highlighted their graph-theoretical properties that play significant roles in determining ESN performance.

This research introduces the CogSimulator, a novel algorithm for simulating user cognition in small-group settings with minimal data, as the educational game Wordle exemplifies. The CogSimulator employs Wasserstein-1 distance and coordinates search optimization for hyperparameter tuning, enabling precise few-shot predictions in new game scenarios. Comparative experiments with the Wordle dataset illustrate that our model surpasses most conventional machine learning models in mean Wasserstein-1 distance, mean squared error, and mean accuracy, showcasing its efficacy in cognitive enhancement through tailored game design.

                arXiv:2305.13420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributions of neuronal activity within cortical circuits are often found to display highly skewed shapes with many neurons emitting action potentials at low or vanishing rates, while some are active at high rates. Theoretical studies were able to reproduce such distributions, but come with a lack of mathematical tractability, preventing a deeper understanding of the impact of model parameters. In this study, using the Gauss-Rice neuron model, we present a balanced-state cortical circuit model for which the firing rate distribution can be exactly calculated. It offers selfconsistent solutions to recurrent neuronal networks and allows for the combination of multiple neuronal populations, with single or multiple synaptic receptors (e.g. AMPA and NMDA in excitatory populations), paving the way for a deeper understanding of how firing rate distributions are impacted by single neuron or synaptic properties.

                arXiv:2412.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) is an active research area due to its utility in solving complex search and NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems in the real world. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce new possibilities by coupling LLMs with evolutionary computation to automatically generate heuristics, known as LLM-based Evolutionary Program Search (LLM-EPS). While previous LLM-EPS studies obtained great performance on various tasks, there is still a gap in understanding the properties of heuristic search spaces and achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation, which is a critical factor in large heuristic search spaces. In this study, we address this gap by proposing two diversity measurement metrics and perform an analysis on previous LLM-EPS approaches, including FunSearch, EoH, and ReEvo. Results on black-box AHD problems reveal that while EoH demonstrates higher diversity than FunSearch and ReEvo, its objective score is unstable. Conversely, ReEvo's reflection mechanism yields good objective scores but fails to optimize diversity effectively. With this finding in mind, we introduce HSEvo, an adaptive LLM-EPS framework that maintains a balance between diversity and convergence with a harmony search algorithm. Through experimentation, we find that HSEvo achieved high diversity indices and good objective scores while remaining cost-effective. These results underscore the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation and understanding heuristic search spaces in designing frameworks in LLM-EPS.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to replicate the brain's capabilities for energy efficient and parallel information processing, promising a solution to the increasing demand for faster and more efficient computational systems. Efficient training of neural networks on neuromorphic hardware requires the development of training algorithms that retain the sparsity of spike-based communication during training. Here, we report on the first implementation of event-based backpropagation on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic hardware platform. We use EventProp, an algorithm for event-based backpropagation in spiking neural networks (SNNs), to compute exact gradients using sparse communication of error signals between neurons. Our implementation computes multi-layer networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons using discretized versions of the differential equations and their adjoints, and uses event packets to transmit spikes and error signals between network layers. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of batch-parallelized, on-chip training of SNNs using the Yin Yang dataset, and provide an off-chip implementation for efficient prototyping, hyper-parameter search, and hybrid training methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive ability to utilise information within the context of their input sequences to appropriately respond to data unseen by the LLM during its training procedure. This ability is known as in-context learning (ICL). Humans and non-human animals demonstrate similar abilities, however their neural architectures differ substantially from LLMs. Despite this, a critical component within LLMs, the attention mechanism, resembles modern associative memory models, widely used in and influenced by the computational neuroscience community to model biological memory systems. Using this connection, we introduce an associative memory model capable of performing ICL. We use this as inspiration for a novel residual stream architecture which allows information to directly flow between attention heads. We test this architecture during training within a two-layer Transformer and show its ICL abilities manifest more quickly than without this modification. We then apply our architecture in small language models with 8 million parameters, focusing on attention head values, with results also indicating improved ICL performance at this larger and more naturalistic scale.

Abstract: As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety concerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or impact on beliefs.To understand such questions, this paper proposes the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for controlled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated social networks. The framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates following a Universal Darwinism approach, interact via messages, influence each other's beliefs through dynamics based on a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with an abstract implementation of Digico show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence in the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views, depending on the size of the influence benefit; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness by up to 8%. We further discuss implications for control (e.g. legislation) and Digico as a means of studying evolutionary principles.

                arXiv:2412.14522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CAE-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CAE-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have a low-power advantage but perform poorly in image segmentation tasks. The reason is that directly converting neural networks with complex architectural designs for segmentation tasks into spiking versions leads to performance degradation and non-convergence. To address this challenge, we first identify the modules in the architecture design that lead to the severe reduction in spike firing, make targeted improvements, and propose Spike2Former architecture. Second, we propose normalized integer spiking neurons to solve the training stability problem of SNNs with complex architectures. We set a new state-of-the-art for SNNs in various semantic segmentation datasets, with a significant improvement of +12.7% mIoU and 5.0 efficiency on ADE20K, +14.3% mIoU and 5.2 efficiency on VOC2012, and +9.1% mIoU and 6.6 efficiency on CityScapes.

Abstract: We study the learning problem associated with spiking neural networks. Specifically, we focus on spiking neural networks composed of simple spiking neurons having only positive synaptic weights, equipped with an affine encoder and decoder. These neural networks are shown to depend continuously on their parameters, which facilitates classical covering number-based generalization statements and supports stable gradient-based training. We demonstrate that the positivity of the weights continues to enable a wide range of expressivity results, including rate-optimal approximation of smooth functions and dimension-independent approximation of Barron regular functions. In particular, we show in theory and simulations that affine spiking neural networks are capable of approximating shallow ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we apply these neural networks to standard machine learning benchmarks, reaching competitive results. Finally, and remarkably, we observe that from a generalization perspective, contrary to feedforward neural networks or previous results for general spiking neural networks, the depth has little to no adverse effect on the generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly being applied to solve control problems, but often rely on black-box methods without transparent output generation. To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. For better performance in partially observable and volatile environments, the symbolic policies are extended with memory represented by continuous-time latent variables, governed by differential equations. Genetic programming is used for optimisation, resulting in interpretable policies consisting of symbolic expressions. Our results show that symbolic policies with memory compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in symbolic policies is demonstrated on experiments where memory-less policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.

                arXiv:2302.03390v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Discretized Neural Networks (DNNs) composed of low-precision weights and activations, which suffer from either infinite or zero gradients due to the non-differentiable discrete function during training. Most training-based DNNs in such scenarios employ the standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to approximate the gradient w.r.t. discrete values. However, the use of STE introduces the problem of gradient mismatch, arising from perturbations in the approximated gradient. To address this problem, this paper reveals that this mismatch can be interpreted as a metric perturbation in a Riemannian manifold, viewed through the lens of duality theory. Building on information geometry, we construct the Linearly Nearly Euclidean (LNE) manifold for DNNs, providing a background for addressing perturbations. By introducing a partial differential equation on metrics, i.e., the Ricci flow, we establish the dynamical stability and convergence of the LNE metric with the $L^2$-norm perturbation. In contrast to previous perturbation theories with convergence rates in fractional powers, the metric perturbation under the Ricci flow exhibits exponential decay in the LNE manifold. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior and more stable performance for DNNs compared to other representative training-based methods.

                arXiv:2406.02507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10958">SageAttention2: Efficient Attention with Thorough Outlier Smoothing and Per-thread INT4 Quantization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.10958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive deficits and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia are poorly managed by current antipsychotics. In order to develop effective treatments, refining animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders is essential. Methods: To address their multifactorial etiology, we developed a new three-hit mouse model based on the hypoglutamatergic hypothesis of the pathology combined with early stress, offering strong construct validity. Thus, a genetic susceptibility (serine racemase deletion) was associated with an early environmental stress (24 h maternal separation at 9 days of age) and a further pharmacological treatment with phencyclidine (PCP, a glutamate receptor antagonist treatment, 10 mg/kg/day, from 8 to 10 weeks of age). The face validity of this model was assessed in female mice 1 and 6 weeks after the end of PCP treatment by a set of behavioral experiments investigating positive- and negative-like symptoms and cognitive deficits. Results: Our results showed that the three-hit mice displayed persistent hyperlocomotion (positive-like symptoms) and social behavior impairment deficits (negative-like symptoms) but non-persistent spatial working memory deficits (cognitive symptoms). Conclusions: Our work confirms the usefulness of a three-hit combination to model, particularly for negative-like symptoms associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. The model therefore gathers powerful construct and face validities and supports an involvement of glutamate dysfunction in behavioral symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1537/v1?src=rss">Protocol for conducting a scoping review on the influence of low-stakes assessment on student learning in medical education [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Rationale and Background Low-stakes assessments enhance student learning outcomes by providing a comprehensive view of performance and promoting competency-based education. Multiple low-stakes assessments encourage continuous learning and incorporate formative feedback for a realistic and long-term environment. Diverse assessment methods ensure psychometric rigor, utility and a programmatic assessment approach with multiple data points affording high-stakes decisions on progression. Objective This scoping review aims to systematically identify and map existing literature on the use of low-stakes assessments in medical education and determine their impact on student learning outcomes in terms of, motivation and engagement achievements/competencies. Methods and Analysis The review will use the Joanna Briggs Institute’s framework for scoping review studies, searching eight databases and grey literature. A presearch will be done in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using terms related to low-stakes assessment, formative assessment, continuous assessment, and programmatic assessment within the context of medical education. The Covidence Systematic Review tool will aid in screening and conflict resolution. The reference lists of included studies will be checked manually for other relevant literature. Two research team members will independently screen and extract data, resolving discrepancies with a third team member. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be refined iteratively based on key research themes. The review will follow PRISMA-P guidelines, focusing on the impact of low-stakes assessment on student learning in medical education. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required as all data will be collected from published and grey literature. Findings will be disseminated at relevant conferences and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012695">Optimisation strategies for directed evolution without sequencing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica James, Sebastian Towers, Jakob Foerster, Harrison Steel</p>

Directed evolution can enable engineering of biological systems with minimal knowledge of their underlying sequence-to-function relationships. A typical directed evolution process consists of iterative rounds of mutagenesis and selection that are designed to steer changes in a biological system (e.g. a protein) towards some functional goal. Much work has been done, particularly leveraging advancements in machine learning, to optimise the process of directed evolution. Many of these methods, however, require DNA sequencing and synthesis, making them resource-intensive and incompatible with developments in targeted <i>in vivo</i> mutagenesis. Operating within the experimental constraints of established sorting-based directed evolution techniques (e.g. Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting, FACS), we explore approaches for optimisation of directed evolution that could in future be implemented without sequencing information. We then expand our methods to the context of emerging experimental techniques in directed evolution, which allow for single-cell selection based on fitness objectives defined from any combination of measurable traits. Finally, we explore these alternative strategies on the GB1 and TrpB empirical landscapes, demonstrating that they could lead to up to 19-fold and 7-fold increases respectively in the probability of attaining the global fitness peak.

                <p>by Amit Basak, Supratim Sengupta</p>

Humans navigate diverse social relationships and concurrently interact across multiple social contexts. An individual’s behavior in one context can influence behavior in other contexts. Different payoffs associated with interactions in the different domains have motivated recent studies of the evolution of cooperation through the analysis of multichannel games where each individual is simultaneously engaged in multiple repeated games. However, previous investigations have ignored the potential role of network structure in each domain and the effect of playing against distinct interacting partners in different domains. Multiplex networks provide a useful framework to represent social interactions between the same set of agents across different social contexts. We investigate the role of multiplex network structure and strategy linking in multichannel games on the spread of cooperative behavior in all layers of the multiplex. We find that multiplex structure along with strategy linking enhances the cooperation rate in all layers of the multiplex compared to a well-mixed population in Prisoners’ Dilemma games, provided the network structure is identical across layers. The effectiveness of strategy linking in enhancing cooperation depends on the degree of similarity of the network structure across the layers and perception errors due to imperfect memory. Higher cooperation rates are achieved when the degree of structural overlap of the different layers is sufficiently large, and the probability of perception error is relatively low. Our work reveals how the social network structure in different layers of a multiplex can affect the spread of cooperation by limiting the ability of individuals to link strategies across different social domains.

                <p>by Qi Song, Alex Singh, John E. McDonough, Taylor S. Adams, Robin Vos, Ruben De Man, Greg Myers, Laurens J. Ceulemans, Bart M. Vanaudenaerde, Wim A. Wuyts, Xiting Yan, Jonas Schuppe, James S. Hagood, Naftali Kaminski, Ziv Bar-Joseph</p>

Age prediction based on single cell RNA-Sequencing data (scRNA-Seq) can provide information for patients’ susceptibility to various diseases and conditions. In addition, such analysis can be used to identify aging related genes and pathways. To enable age prediction based on scRNA-Seq data, we developed PolyEN, a new regression model which learns continuous representation for expression over time. These representations are then used by PolyEN to integrate genes to predict an age. Existing and new lung aging data we profiled demonstrated PolyEN’s improved performance over existing methods for age prediction. Our results identified lung epithelial cells as the most significant predictors for non-smokers while lung endothelial cells led to the best chronological age prediction results for smokers.

                <p>by Renata Retkute, William Thurston, Keith Cressman, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>

There is an urgent need for mathematical models that can be used to inform the deployment of surveillance, early warning and management systems for transboundary pest invasions. This is especially important for desert locust, one of the most dangerous migratory pests for smallholder farmers. During periods of desert locust upsurges and plagues, gregarious adult locusts form into swarms that are capable of long-range dispersal. Here we introduce a novel integrated modelling framework for use in predicting gregarious locust populations. The framework integrates the selection of breeding sites, maturation through egg, hopper and adult stages and swarm dispersal in search of areas suitable for feeding and breeding. Using a combination of concepts from epidemiological modelling, weather and environment data, together with an atmospheric transport model for swarm movement we provide a tool to forecast short- and long-term swarm movements. A principal aim of the framework is to provide a practical starting point for use in the next upsurge.

                <p>by Mengya Zhang, Qing Yu</p>

Successful goal-directed behavior requires the maintenance and implementation of abstract task goals on concrete stimulus information in working memory. Previous working memory research has revealed distributed neural representations of task information across cortex. However, how the distributed task representations emerge and communicate with stimulus-specific information to implement flexible goal-directed computations is still unclear. Here, leveraging electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human participants along with state space analyses, we provided converging evidence in support of a low-dimensional neural geometry of goal information congruent with a designed task space, which first emerged in frontal cortex during goal maintenance and then transferred to posterior cortex through frontomedial-to-posterior theta coherence for implementation on stimulus-specific representations. Importantly, the fidelity of the goal geometry was associated with memory performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that abstract goals in working memory are represented in an organized, task-congruent neural geometry for communications from frontal to posterior cortex to enable computations necessary for goal-directed behaviors.

                Background Leukemia, a heterogeneous group of blood cancers, poses significant challenges to global health due to its complexity, diverse risk factors, and variable outcomes. Accurate and early diagnosis is critical but remains a significant hurdle, particularly in low-resource settings. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing offer transformative solutions to improve leukemia detection and classification, addressing limitations in traditional diagnostic methods. Methods This study systematically reviewed over 25,000 scientific articles sourced from Scopus, employing a PRISMA-guided methodology to ensure a comprehensive and rigorous analysis. The analysis focused on the application of AI, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in diagnosing four primary leukemia types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It also examined global epidemiological trends, risk factors, and disparities in healthcare access. Results Key risk factors for leukemia include genetic syndromes like Down syndrome, environmental exposures to toxins such as benzene, ionizing radiation, and viral infections. Socio-economic disparities and geographical differences significantly impact leukemia incidence and outcomes. AI-based models, especially CNNs, demonstrated enhanced accuracy, speed, and reliability in diagnosing leukemia compared to traditional methods. However, challenges such as data variability, model scalability, and unequal access to AI technologies continue to hinder widespread adoption. Conclusion AI and image processing technologies hold immense potential to revolutionize leukemia diagnostics by enabling early detection, precise classification, and personalized treatment planning. Addressing critical challenges, including data standardization and equitable access to these technologies, will be vital for global application. This review highlights the transformative role of AI in improving leukemia outcomes and advancing precision medicine worldwide.

                Background The Alliance for Healthier Communities is a learning health system that supports Community Health Centres (CHCs) across Ontario, Canada to provide team-based primary health care to people who otherwise experience barriers to care. This case study describes the ongoing process and lessons learned from the first Alliance for Healthier Communities’ Practice Based Learning Network (PBLN) data-driven decision support tool co-development project. Methods We employ an iterative approach to problem identification and methods development for the decision support tool, moving between discussion sessions and case studies with CHC electronic health record (EHR) data. We summarize our work to date in terms of six stages: population-level descriptive-exploratory study, PBLN team engagement, decision support tool problem selection, sandbox case study 1: individual-level risk predictions, sandbox case study 2: population-level planning predictions, project recap and next steps decision. Results The population-level study provided an initial point of engagement to consider how clients are (not) represented in EHR data and to inform problem selection and methodological decisions thereafter. We identified three initial meaningful types of decision support, with target application areas: risk prediction/screening, triaging specialized program referrals, and identifying care access needs. Based on feasibility and expected impact, we started with the goal to support earlier identification of mental health decline after diabetes diagnosis. As discussions deepened around clinical use cases associated with example prediction task set ups, the target problem evolved towards supporting the upstream task of organizational planning and advocacy for adequate mental health care service capacity to meet incoming needs. Conclusions This case study contributes towards a tool to support diabetes and mental health care, as well as lays groundwork for future CHC EHR-based decision support tool initiatives. We share lessons learned and reflections from our process that other primary health care organizations may use to inform their own co-development initiatives while we continue to work on advancing the population-level capacity planning model.

                Background The neglect of visual identity (VI) at the organizational level within higher education institutions (HEIs) has become a critical issue, while previous studies over the past decade has focused on HEI branding and reputation. This creates a potential gap in understanding HEI branding processes. Thus, this study aims to explore the relationship between VI and HEI reputation by integrating the Expressiveness Quotient (EQ) and experiential brand meaning at the organizational level. Method Using a qualitative case study approach, the study involves semi-structured interviews with 29 employees from five top-ranked universities in Indonesia. Furthermore, it analyzes the integration of experiential brand meaning across the stages of awareness, interpretation, appropriation, and communication, alongside the EQ framework to assess how visual identity impacts visibility, distinctiveness, transparency, authenticity, and consistency. Result The findings indicate that visual identity significantly influences perceptions of institutional identity and reputation. Effective management of visual identity elements enhances competitive advantage in academia and aligns internal stakeholder perceptions with external branding, which is essential for a cohesive organizational identity. Conclusion This study emphasizes the strategic importance of visual identity in enhancing institutional reputation and provides a model for universities aiming to strengthen their reputational power through effective visual identity management. The study also reveals strong awareness and acceptance of brand identity.

                Background Mirabegron is a β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) agonist notified only for the treatment of overactive bladder. Bright preclinical results desire that β3-AR agonists manage to correct corpulence-affiliated metabolic affliction by growing brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity, white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis, and insulin sensitivity. Objective to evaluate the effect of mirabegron on lipid profile (serum cholesterol and triglyceride) and BMI in patient with OAB. Materials and Methods In medical city complex (Ghazi AL-Hariri hospital) urology outpatient clinic, a prospective study of 40 patient diagnosed with OAB. These patient a took single dose of mirabegron 50 mg for 4 months and asses it’s the effect during this period on weight and fasting serum cholesterol and triglyceride. Results investigation showed that there is astatically significant reduction from baseline after 2 and 4 months’ treatment with mirabegron (P-value=0.001) in fasting Sr. Triglyceride while fasting serum cholesterol level showed increase in level after 2 and 4 months of treatment. However; this increment not statically significant after 2 months(P-value=0.227) and after 4 months(P-value=0.261) BMI showed slightly reduction after 2 and 4 months’ treatment with mirabegron but also this reduction not statically significant after 2month(P-value=0.114) and after 4 months(P-value=0.562) Conclusion Mirabegron is dependable and direct drug for situation of overactive bladder (OAB) causes useful decline in level of triglyceride and the verdicts display that human BAT metabolic endeavor maybe increased subsequently never-ending pharmacological provocation accompanying mirabegron and support the analysis of β3-AR agonists as a treatment for metabolic ailment.

                Background Dynamic foot posture assessment is essential to determine the pathomechanics of the foot during walking. Currently, there is no affordable method for assessing dynamic foot posture that can be used in a clinical setting. Kinovea, an open-access video analysis-free application, has enabled clinicians to conduct gait analysis at a relatively low cost, but its reliability in assessing dynamic foot posture has not been studied. Methods 32 observations were recorded from various angles throughout the gait cycle, each at varying speeds, and analyzed using Kinovea. Two independent examiners conducted observations to measure the medial longitudinal arch (MLA), first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP 1), ankle inclination (AI), and calcaneal angle (CA). A third examiner was tasked with comparing the results of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two examiners. Result The inter-rater reliability showed promising results despite the observations made at 2, 3, and 4 km/h. MLA and MTP 1 observations remained “excellent” at all speeds, while AI and CA had “good” reliability among observers at 2, 3 and 4 kmph, apart from 4 kmph where AI showed “excellent” reliability. Conclusion In this study, Kinovea showed good and excellent reliability among observers in measuring the MLA, MTP 1, AI, and CA at various speeds. Therefore, a suitable alternative to a 3D motion analyzer may not be readily available in certain facilities.

                Background Stool consistency is an important outcome measure to evaluate in the investigation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) is one of the most commonly used tools for evaluation of stool consistency. BSS ranges from 1-7 and each score is assigned to a given consistency of the feces. Self-reported characterizations can differ from an expert evaluation, and the reliability of BSS is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of BSS by comparing patient scores with expert scores. Methods Patients with inflammatory bowel disease collected stool samples throughout a 3-year follow-up. The stool´s consistency was evaluated with BSS by the patients and matched with an expert score. Agreement between patient and expert scores was assessed using Cohen’s kappa. Results BSS scores from 2280 fecal samples collected from 992 patients at up to five time points were included. When all samples were compared, there was good to substantial agreement between patient and expert scores (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.66-0.72). When the BSS scores were simplified and categorized as 1 (scores 1-2), 2 (scores 3-5) or 3 (scores 6-7), the agreement improved slightly (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.73-0.77). When the scores from the first sample per patient were compared, the experts were more likely to assign higher scores compared to the patient. The proportion of the lowest assigned scores (1-2) was 12.1% for patients and 8.1% for experts. Conclusions The agreement between patient and expert BSS scores is good to substantial, especially when the BSS scores are simplified into three categories.

                Background Certain risk factors have been shown to increase the mortality of patients with neonatal sepsis. This study aimed to determine the risk factors for neonatal sepsis-related mortality. Methods Google Scholar, MEDLINE, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant literature from 2014 to 2023. Observational analytical studies in English that reported the risk factors for neonatal sepsis mortality were chosen. We assessed the risk of bias by using the checklists of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Fixed-effect models were used when the number of included studies was <5; otherwise, random-effects models were employed. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot, and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Statistical significance was set at P <0.05. Analyses were conducted using the RevMan 5.4.1. Results Twelve out of 40,587 articles included a total of 2232 patients. The majority of patients were male (50.4%–70%). The I2 statistics showed no heterogeneity across studies for sex, gestational age, birth weight, or requirement for inotropic support. History of invasive ventilation (OR = 35.06 [16.84–72.99]), requirement for inotropic support (OR = 18.04 [8.38–38.81]), low 1st minute Apgar score (OR = 4.93 [2.1–11.58]), convulsive (OR = 4.69 [2.03–10.82]), poor feeding (OR = 3.95 [2.12–7.33]) episodes, preterm birth (OR = 3.63 [2.78–4.74]), low birth weight (OR = 3.02 [1.58–5.75]), early onset sepsis (OR = 2.52 [1.74–3.64]), and lethargy (OR = 2.14 [1.5–3.04]) were associated with neonatal sepsis mortality. Conclusions A history of invasive ventilation use, requirement for inotropic support, low 1st minute Apgar score, convulsions, poor feeding episodes, preterm birth, low birth weight, early onset sepsis, and lethargy were identified as significant risk factors for neonatal sepsis mortality. Clinicians must be vigilant to improve outcomes and prevent death.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99862">Dysfunctional S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the dentate gyrus drives vulnerability of chronic pain-related memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Memory impairment in chronic pain patients is substantial and common, and few therapeutic strategies are available. Chronic pain-related memory impairment has susceptible and unsusceptible features. Therefore, exploring the underlying mechanisms of its vulnerability is essential for developing effective treatments. Here, combining two spatial memory tests (Y-maze test and Morris water maze), we segregated chronic pain mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations in a chronic neuropathic pain model induced by chronic constrictive injury of the sciatic nerve. RNA-Seq analysis and gain/loss-of-function study revealed that S1P/S1PR1 signaling is a determinant for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment. Knockdown of the S1PR1 in the dentate gyrus (DG) promoted a susceptible phenotype and led to structural plasticity changes of reduced excitatory synapse formation and abnormal spine morphology as observed in susceptible mice, while overexpression of the S1PR1 and pharmacological administration of S1PR1 agonist in the DG promoted an unsusceptible phenotype and prevented the occurrence of memory impairment, and rescued the morphological abnormality. Finally, the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and biochemical evidence indicated that downregulation of S1PR1 in susceptible mice may impair DG structural plasticity via interaction with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement-related signaling pathways including Itga2 and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 cascade. These results reveal a novel mechanism and provide a promising preventive and therapeutic molecular target for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96129">Mapping spatial patterns to energetic benefits in groups of flow-coupled swimmers</a></h4>

              
                The coordinated motion of animal groups through fluids is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion to individuals in the group. However, the connection between the spatial patterns observed in collectively moving animals and the energetic benefits at each position within the group remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we study the spontaneous emergence of cohesive formations in groups of fish, modeled as flapping foils, all heading in the same direction. We show in pairwise formations and with increasing group size that (1) in side-by-side arrangements, the reciprocal nature of flow coupling results in an equal distribution of energy requirements among all members, with reduction in cost of locomotion for swimmers flapping inphase but an increase in cost for swimmers flapping antiphase, and (2) in inline arrangements, flow coupling is non-reciprocal for all flapping phase, with energetic savings in favor of trailing swimmers, but only up to a finite number of swimmers, beyond which school cohesion and energetic benefits are lost at once. We explain these findings mechanistically and we provide efficient diagnostic tools for identifying locations in the wake of single and multiple swimmers that offer opportunities for hydrodynamic benefits to aspiring followers. Our results imply a connection between the resources generated by flow physics and social traits that influence greedy and cooperative group behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87517">Statistical analysis supports pervasive RNA subcellular localization and alternative 3' UTR regulation</a></h4>

              
                Targeted low-throughput studies have previously identified subcellular RNA localization as necessary for cellular functions including polarization, and translocation. Furthermore, these studies link localization to RNA isoform expression, especially 3’ Untranslated Region (UTR) regulation. The recent introduction of genome-wide spatial transcriptomics techniques enables the potential to test if subcellular localization is regulated in situ pervasively. In order to do this, robust statistical measures of subcellular localization and alternative poly-adenylation (APA) at single-cell resolution are needed. Developing a new statistical framework called SPRAWL, we detect extensive cell-type specific subcellular RNA localization regulation in the mouse brain and to a lesser extent mouse liver. We integrated SPRAWL with a new approach to measure cell-type specific regulation of alternative 3’ UTR processing and detected examples of significant correlations between 3’ UTR length and subcellular localization. Included examples, <i>Timp3</i>, <i>Slc32a1</i>, <i>Cxcl14</i>, and <i>Nxph1</i> have subcellular localization in the mouse brain highly correlated with regulated 3’ UTR processing that includes the use of unannotated, but highly conserved, 3’ ends. Together, SPRAWL provides a statistical framework to integrate multi-omic single-cell resolved measurements of gene-isoform pairs to prioritize an otherwise impossibly large list of candidate functional 3’ UTRs for functional prediction and study. In these studies of data from mice, SPRAWL predicts that 3’ UTR regulation of subcellular localization may be more pervasive than currently known.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88879">Bestrophin-4 relays HES4 and interacts with TWIST1 to suppress epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Bestrophin isoform 4 (<i>BEST4</i>) is a newly identified subtype of the calcium-activated chloride channel family. Analysis of colonic epithelial cell diversity by single-cell RNA-sequencing has revealed the existence of a cluster of <i>BEST4</i>+ mature colonocytes in humans. However, if the role of <i>BEST4</i> is involved in regulating tumour progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>BEST4</i> overexpression attenuates cell proliferation, colony formation, and mobility in colorectal cancer (CRC) in vitro, and impedes the tumour growth and the liver metastasis in vivo. BEST4 is co-expressed with hairy/enhancer of split 4 (<i>HES4</i>) in the nucleus of cells, and HES4 signals <i>BEST4</i> by interacting with the upstream region of the <i>BEST4</i> promoter. <i>BEST4</i> is epistatic to <i>HES4</i> and downregulates TWIST1, thereby inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC. Conversely, knockout of BEST4 using CRISPR/Cas9 in CRC cells revitalises tumour growth and induces EMT. Furthermore, the low level of the <i>BEST4</i> mRNA is correlated with advanced and the worse prognosis, suggesting its potential role involving CRC progression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95521">The geometric basis of epithelial convergent extension</a></h4>

              
                Shape changes of epithelia during animal development, such as convergent extension, are achieved through the concerted mechanical activity of individual cells. While much is known about the corresponding large-scale tissue flow and its genetic drivers, fundamental questions regarding local control of contractile activity on the cellular scale and its embryo-scale coordination remain open. To address these questions, we develop a quantitative, model-based analysis framework to relate cell geometry to local tension in recently obtained time-lapse imaging data of gastrulating <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. This analysis systematically decomposes cell shape changes and T1 rearrangements into internally driven, active, and externally driven, passive, contributions. Our analysis provides evidence that germ band extension is driven by active T1 processes that self-organize through positive feedback acting on tensions. More generally, our findings suggest that epithelial convergent extension results from the controlled transformation of internal force balance geometry which combines the effects of bottom-up local self-organization with the top-down, embryo-scale regulation by gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96810">Cytosolic S100A8/A9 promotes Ca2+ supply at LFA-1 adhesion clusters during neutrophil recruitment</a></h4>

              
                S100A8/A9 is an endogenous alarmin secreted by myeloid cells during many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Despite increasing evidence of the proinflammatory effects of extracellular S100A8/A9, little is known about its intracellular function. Here, we show that cytosolic S100A8/A9 is indispensable for neutrophil post-arrest modifications during outside-in signaling under flow conditions in vitro and neutrophil recruitment in vivo, independent of its extracellular functions. Mechanistically, genetic deletion of S100A9 in mice caused dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures in activated neutrophils resulting in reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability at the formed LFA-1/F-actin clusters with defective β<sub>2</sub> integrin outside-in signaling during post-arrest modifications. Consequently, we observed impaired cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell polarization, and spreading, as well as cell protrusion formation in <i>S100a9<sup>-/-</sup></i> compared to wildtype (WT) neutrophils, making <i>S100a9<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells more susceptible to detach under flow, thereby preventing efficient neutrophil recruitment and extravasation into inflamed tissue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95510">Discarded sequencing reads uncover natural variation in pest resistance in Thlaspi arvense</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science, but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. Here, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress (<i>Thlaspi arvense</i>) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i.e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of <i>Thlaspi arvense</i>, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97910">Endosomal sorting protein SNX4 limits synaptic vesicle docking and release</a></h4>

              
                Sorting nexin 4 (SNX4) is an evolutionary conserved organizer of membrane recycling. In neurons, SNX4 accumulates in synapses, but how SNX4 affects synapse function remains unknown. We generated a conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model and report that SNX4 cKO synapses show enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation, while the first evoked EPSC was normal. SNX4 depletion did not affect vesicle recycling, basic autophagic flux, or the levels and localization of SNARE-protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2. However, SNX4 depletion affected synapse ultrastructure: an increase in docked synaptic vesicles at the active zone, while the overall vesicle number was normal, and a decreased active zone length. These effects together lead to a substantially increased density of docked vesicles per release site. In conclusion, SNX4 is a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle docking and release. These findings suggest a role for SNX4 in synaptic vesicle recruitment at the active zone.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93241">N-terminus of Drosophila melanogaster MSL1 is critical for dosage compensation</a></h4>

              
                The male-specific lethal complex (MSL), which consists of five proteins and two non-coding roX RNAs, is involved in the transcriptional enhancement of X-linked genes to compensate for the sex chromosome monosomy in <i>Drosophila</i> XY males compared with XX females. The MSL1 and MSL2 proteins form the heterotetrameric core of the MSL complex and are critical for the specific recruitment of the complex to the high-affinity ‘entry’ sites (HAS) on the X chromosome. In this study, we demonstrated that the N-terminal region of MSL1 is critical for stability and functions of MSL1. Amino acid deletions and substitutions in the N-terminal region of MSL1 strongly affect both the interaction with roX2 RNA and the MSL complex binding to HAS on the X chromosome. In particular, substitution of the conserved N-terminal amino-acids 3–7 in MSL1 (MSL1<sup>GS</sup>) affects male viability similar to the inactivation of genes encoding roX RNAs. In addition, MSL1<sup>GS</sup> binds to promoters such as MSL1<sup>WT</sup> but does not co-bind with MSL2 and MSL3 to X chromosomal HAS. However, overexpression of MSL2 partially restores the dosage compensation. Thus, the interaction of MSL1 with roX RNA is critical for the efficient assembly of the MSL complex on HAS of the male X chromosome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91083">Intramolecular feedback regulation of the LRRK2 Roc G domain by a LRRK2 kinase-dependent mechanism</a></h4>

              
                The Parkinson’s disease (PD)-linked protein Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) consists of seven domains, including a kinase and a Roc G domain. Despite the availability of several high-resolution structures, the dynamic regulation of its unique intramolecular domain stack is nevertheless still not well understood. By in-depth biochemical analysis, assessing the Michaelis–Menten kinetics of the Roc G domain, we have confirmed that LRRK2 has, similar to other Roco protein family members, a K<sub>M</sub> value of LRRK2 that lies within the range of the physiological GTP concentrations within the cell. Furthermore, the R1441G PD variant located within a mutational hotspot in the Roc domain showed an increased catalytic efficiency. In contrast, the most common PD variant G2019S, located in the kinase domain, showed an increased K<sub>M</sub> and reduced catalytic efficiency, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism from the kinase domain to the G domain. Autophosphorylation of the G1+2 residue (T1343) in the Roc P-loop motif is critical for this phosphoregulation of both the K<sub>M</sub> and the k<sub>cat</sub> values of the Roc-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, most likely by changing the monomer–dimer equilibrium. The LRRK2 T1343A variant has a similar increased kinase activity in cells compared to G2019S and the double mutant T1343A/G2019S has no further increased activity, suggesting that T1343 is crucial for the negative feedback in the LRRK2 signaling cascade. Together, our data reveal a novel intramolecular feedback regulation of the LRRK2 Roc G domain by a LRRK2 kinase-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, PD mutants differently change the kinetics of the GTPase cycle, which might in part explain the difference in penetrance of these mutations in PD patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96284">Full-length direct RNA sequencing uncovers stress granule-dependent RNA decay upon cellular stress</a></h4>

              
                Cells react to stress by triggering response pathways, leading to extensive alterations in the transcriptome to restore cellular homeostasis. The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5ʹ end adapter ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and -nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5ʹ end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on deadenylation or decapping. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome while inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 rescues RNA length. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key component of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress that is dependent on stress granule formation.

	<p>Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on mental health in the general population. The fear, stress, and uncertainty surrounding that traumatic period could have contributed to the aggravation or possible new onset of obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive symptoms. Methods: The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) is a nationwide project organized by the University of Campania &amp;amp;ldquo;Luigi Vanvitelli&amp;amp;rdquo;, designed as an observational investigation that aimed to gather data from a representative sample of the Italian general population. The current study is a report from the main project and it focuses on obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive (OC) symptoms. Results: A total sample of N = 20,720 took part in the survey. N = 2332 individuals had a total Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Inventory&amp;amp;mdash;Revised (OCI-R) score greater than or equal to 21 (11.3% of the entire sample), indicating the presence of clinically relevant obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive symptoms. By excluding patients with a history of previous mental illnesses, we still obtained a high number of individuals with an OCI-R score greater than or equal to 21 (N = 2024), representing 10.3% of the overall sample, possibly indicating a new incidence of OC symptoms during the pandemic. Discussion: Our study highlights a substantial new incidence of obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive symptoms in the general public. Risk factors or red flags such as being male, being of working age, living in a highly stressful environment such as one of the Italian regions most affected and severely hit by the pandemic, having higher levels of loneliness, and using substances to cope with stress, should be paid particular attention in order to prevent the development of OC symptoms during a critical and traumatic event such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Hearing loss is highly prevalent in older adults and is independently associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Cochlear implants are usually the only effective treatment for people with severe&amp;amp;ndash;profound hearing loss, who have the highest risk of cognitive decline and dementia, however, very few receive them. Current evidence of the effects of cochlear implant use on cognitive decline/dementia outcomes is limited and unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of cochlear implant use on longitudinal cognitive performance, as this intervention may be an effective method of modifying cognitive outcomes for older adults with significant hearing loss. Methods: This prospective longitudinal observational study investigated cognitive performance in a convenience sample of older adults (mean age 74 years) with cochlear implants over 4.5 years post-implantation, comparing this with that of community-living adults with untreated hearing loss/normal hearing over 3 years (Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing; AIBL). All participants were assessed at 18-month intervals from baseline using the same measures. Panel regression was used to compare cognitive trajectories. Results: Cochlear implant users demonstrated significantly improved performance in executive function and working memory, as well as stability in attention, psychomotor function, and visual learning at 4.5-year follow-up. Comparatively, AIBL participants showed significantly greater worsening performance per year in attention and psychomotor function, and stability in working memory and visual learning at 3-year follow-up. Conclusions: Cochlear implant use may delay cognitive decline and/or improve cognitive performance in older adults with severe&amp;amp;ndash;profound hearing loss, providing proof-of-concept evidence of the positive effects of hearing intervention on cognitive performance in older adults with hearing loss.</p>

	<p>After more than 30 years since its inception, the utility of brain imaging for understanding and diagnosing mental illnesses is in doubt, receiving well-grounded criticisms from clinical practitioners. Symptom-based correlational approaches have struggled to provide psychiatry with reliable brain-imaging metrics. However, the emergence of computational psychiatry has paved a new path not only for understanding the psychopathology of mental illness but also to provide practical tools for clinical practice in terms of computational metrics, specifically computational phenotypes. However, these phenotypes still lack sufficient test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. In this review, we describe recent works revealing that mind and brain-related computational phenotypes show structural (not random) variation over time, longitudinal changes. Furthermore, we show that these findings suggest that understanding the causes of these changes will improve the construct validity of the phenotypes with an ensuing increase in test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. We propose that the active inference framework offers a general-purpose approach for causally understanding these longitudinal changes by incorporating brain imaging as observations within partially observable Markov decision processes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is associated with a variety of neurologic deficits and impacts socialization decisions, mood, and overall quality of life. As a common symptom comprising the long COVID condition, persistent COVID-19-associated olfactory dysfunction (C19OD) may further impact the presentations of neuropsychiatric sequelae. Our study aims to characterize the longitudinal burden of depression, anxiety, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a population with C19OD. Methods: Individuals with perceived C19OD completed a psychophysical screening evaluation of their sense of smell using the comprehensive Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks olfactory assessment. Only those with validated psychophysical OD were included in this prospective longitudinal study for baseline and one-year follow-up. Participants also completed PHQ-9, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires at each time point. Anxiety, depression, and neuropsychiatric symptom prevalence was calculated and compared between time points with Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s chi-squared, Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: Each neuropsychiatric symptom evaluated in this study was reported by 13&amp;amp;ndash;49% of longitudinal cohort participants at both baseline and follow-up, except for seizure (0% at baseline and follow-up) and word-finding difficulty (61&amp;amp;ndash;68% at baseline and follow-up). Word-finding and focus difficulties were the most commonly reported symptoms. In total, 41% of participants reported some level of depression at baseline and 38% of participants reported depression at one-year follow-up, while 29% and 27% of participants reported some level of anxiety at respective time points. Conclusions: Individuals with C19OD are at risk for developing persistent neuropsychiatric conditions. These neurologic and psychiatric sequelae are persistent with repeated longitudinal assessment, even at nearly 2.5 years following initial COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objective: Aging is associated with both cognitive and physical decline. Some factors, such as lifestyle and environment, can significantly contribute to accelerating or slowing down the decline processes. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of lifestyle (active vs. non-active) and environmental context (institutionalized vs. non-institutionalized) on the cognitive functioning, psychological well-being, sleep quality, and daily living skills of elderly people. Methods: Our sample consisted of 182 subjects divided into active and non-active groups (subjects who engage or not in physical and social activities, respectively; mean age in years: 67.19 vs. 68.75) and 245 subjects divided into institutionalized and non-institutionalized groups (i.e., living in a nursing home or not, respectively; mean age in years: 79.49 vs. 71.72). Participants were enrolled voluntarily and randomly in the city of L&amp;amp;rsquo;Aquila. A battery of psychological instruments was administered to evaluate general cognitive decline, depressive symptoms, self-assessed sleep quality, and daily living skills. Results: Regarding lifestyle, the active group exhibited significantly lower levels of depression, better sleep quality, and daily living skills with respect to the non-active group. Regarding environmental context, institutionalized subjects showed higher levels of depression and reduced cognitive functioning, which were linked to reduced sleep quality and worsened daily living skills. When comparing the non-active with the institutionalized group, the latter showed higher levels of depression and reduced cognitive functioning, more sleep complaints, and reduced daily living skills. Conclusions: Our study highlights that an active lifestyle and a non-institutionalized environment, both allowing greater mobility and autonomy, are two factors that positively contribute to the mental and physical well-being of elderly individuals. Furthermore, the healthcare institution context appears to have a greater negative impact on the psycho-physical well-being of the subjects involved compared to a non-active lifestyle.</p>

                <p>The medial frontal cortex (mFC) and locus ceruleus (LC) are two brain areas that have been implicated in a range of cognitive phenomena, such as attention, memory, and decision-making. Regulators of these brain regions at the molecular level are not well understood but might help to elucidate underlying mechanisms of disorders that present with deficits in these cognitive domains. To probe this, we used chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the LC with axonal projections to the prelimbic subregion (PrL) of the mFC and subsequent bulk RNA sequencing from the mouse PrL. We found that stimulation of this circuit caused an increase in transcription of a host of genes, including the <I>Apoe</I> gene. To investigate cell type-specific expression of <I>Apoe</I> in the PrL, we used a dual-virus approach to express either the excitatory DREADD receptor hM3Dq in LC neurons with projections to the PrL or a control virus and found that increases in <I>Apoe</I> expression in the PrL following depolarization of LC inputs is enriched in GABAergic neurons in a sex-dependent manner. The results of these experiments yield insights into how <I>Apoe</I> expression affects function in a cortical microcircuit that is important for attention, memory, and decision-making and point to interneuron-specific expression of <I>Apoe</I> as a potential biomarker for circuit function in disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                Background Postoperative immobilizatiton for patients with lower extremity fractures causes constipation, which usually affects 50–70% of patients. When it comes to nursing interventions for postoperative constipation, Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy are two possible options. Aim The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage on constipation scores on post-operative lower extremity fractures. Methods A quasi-experimental pre-posttest design without control group design was applied. 30 respondents used simple random sampling technique. The Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) questionnaire was used to assess the patient’s constipation levels before and after the intervention. The data analysis used independent t-test. Results The mean score of constipation of drinking water group after the intervention was 4.60 while abdominal Swedish massage was 3.56. Although both significantly reduced the constipation score, the p-value was 0.00. Conclusion The protocol of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage immediately after waking up effectively reduced constipation scores on postoperative lower extremity fracture patients and can be use to adjuvant therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate postoperative constipation patients with immobility and the use of strong analgetics.

                Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for human-computer interaction, particularly through eye-gesture recognition, enabling intuitive control for users and accessibility for individuals with physical impairments. Methods We developed an AI-driven eye-gesture recognition system using tools like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to translate eye movements into commands. The system was trained on a dataset of 20,000 gestures from 100 diverse volunteers, representing various demographics, and tested under different conditions, including varying lighting and eyewear. Results The system achieved 99.63% accuracy in recognizing gestures, with slight reductions to 98.9% under reflective glasses. These results demonstrate its robustness and adaptability across scenarios, confirming its generalizability. Conclusions This system advances AI-driven interaction by enhancing accessibility and unlocking applications in critical fields like military and rescue operations. Future work will validate the system using publicly available datasets to further strengthen its impact and usability.

                Background Fenugreek, or Trigonella foenum-graecum L, is an edible and medicinal plant of the Fabaceae family. Fenugreek seeds are rich in proteins, lipids, and essential nutrients, and they also contain various phytochemicals, including flavonoids, steroidal saponins, coumarin, and alkaloids such as trigonelline. Trigonelline (TG) is a bioactive plant alkaloid initially extracted from fenugreek seeds. A substantial portion of fenugreek’s health benefits may rely on the presence of TG. This study addresses the critical need for a fast, green, and economical method that overcomes inefficiencies, high solvent usage, and sensitivity limitations in the quantification of TG. Methods Fenugreek seeds from various origins were extracted using three green solvents: acetone (ACt), ethanol (EtOH), and water (H2O). The UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated using a green mobile phase of H2O: EtOH, and an r2-value of 0.999 in the linearity range of 0.1-500 ppb was adopted. The method was validated with an accuracy of 98.6% for trace analysis of TG using a small amount (10 mg) of fenugreek samples from five different origins. Results The average extract yield was 5.36 mg/100 mg with a standard deviation (SD) of 6.3, with the highest extract yield observed in H2O. The ESI (+ve) of the UPLC-MS/MS resulted in the fragmentation pattern (m/z) 138→94.10→92.05→78.20. The TG quantification revealed an average TG concentration of 181.4 ppb (SD = 176.4), with the highest amount of TG in H2O extract (mean = 392.7, SD = 132.4 ppb), followed by EtOH (mean = 91.9, SD = 83.3 ppb) and ACt (mean = 59.5, SD = 30.9 ppb). The TG amount observed in the validation step substantiated the efficiency and reproducibility of the developed method. Conclusions The method may be used as an effective tool for a green, rapid, economical, and eco-friendly extraction and quantification of TG in diverse matrices of pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, herbal, and food products.

                Background The burden of visual impairment and avoidable blindness has been attributed to the shortage and poor distribution of adequately trained eye care personnel. In the district health system, primary health care (PHC) nurses are the first point of contact for eye care patients. To provide adequate eye care, the nurses in PHC clinics apply their knowledge on basic eye health to ensure best practices and management for patients that present at their clinics. Anecdotal evidence regarding the knowledge and practices of these PHC professionals is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PHC nurses’ knowledge and practices on eye health. Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural district of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Stratified random sampling was used to select 28 from the 74 PHC clinics in the district. A researcher-administered questionnaire using a 5-point likert scale with options strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree, was developed, piloted and finalised for this study. The tool had four sections: demographic information, knowledge of eye health, practices on evaluating visual function and identification and management of presenting eye conditions. Data were collected, captured onto MSXcel, cleaned, coded and analysed descriptively, and for Chi-squared significance at 95%, using R statistical software. Results From 200 responses, 86.4% (n=172) were females of the African race. Most (93.5%, n=187) had never undergone formal training in eye care. Only 28% (n=56) correctly identified a mature cataract while 28% (n=56) correctly identified signs of glaucoma; the global leading causes of preventable blindness. A total of 94% (n=188) failed to accurately measure visual acuity on a patient. Conclusions PHC nurses showed poor knowledge and practices of common eye conditions. There is an urgent need for eye health training for PHC nurses, and the clear management protocols on eye care.

With the rapidly development of biotechnology, it is now possible to obtain single-cell multi-omics data in the same cell. However, how to integrate and analyze these single-cell multi-omics data remains a great challenge. Herein, we introduce an interpretable multitask framework (scMoMtF) for comprehensively analyzing single-cell multi-omics data. The scMoMtF can simultaneously solve multiple key tasks of single-cell multi-omics data including dimension reduction, cell classification and data simulation. The experimental results shows that scMoMtF outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms on these tasks. In addition, scMoMtF has interpretability which allowing researchers to gain a reliable understanding of potential biological features and mechanisms in single-cell multi-omics data.

                <p>by Janez Demšar, Blaž Zupan</p>

Data clustering is a core data science approach widely used and referenced in the scientific literature. Its algorithms are often intuitive and can lead to exciting, insightful results that are easy to interpret. For these reasons, data clustering techniques could be the first method encountered in data science training. This paper proposes a hands-on approach to data clustering training suitable for introductory courses. The education approach features problem-based training that starts with the data and gradually introduces various data processing and analysis methods, illustrating them through visual representations of data and models. The proposed training is suitable for a general audience, does not require a background in statistics, mathematics, or computer science, and aims to engage the audience through practical examples, an exploratory approach to data analysis with visual analysis, experimentation, and a gentle learning curve. The manuscript details the pedagogical units of the training, motivates them through the sequence of methods introduced, and proposes data sets and data analysis workflows to be explored in the class.

                <p>by Giuseppe Benagiano, Andrea R. Genazzani, Giovanni Grandi, Sun-Wei Guo, Marwan Habiba</p>

The optimal contraception dosing strategy proposed by Gavina et al. recently is a commendable attempt to model a complex physiological process with potenial to apply to real-life data. However, there is a need to take into account the real challenges that arise when moving from the theory to its practical application, and it is important that lessons learnt from clinical studies be taken into consideration in any theoretical modelling. In this manuscript, we spell out these lessons and elaborate practical challenges facing their model.

                <p>by Yoshiaki Tanaka</p>

Integrative analysis of publicly available scRNA-seq data facilitates deeper understanding of biological phenomena with strong statistical power and high resolution. A new study in this issue of <i>PLOS Biology</i> examined the fidelity of various brain organoid protocols in reference to human primary developing brain by gene co-expression relationships with million-scale collection of public scRNA-seq data sets.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Two key series of discoveries about the hippocampus are described. One is the discovery of hippocampal spatial view cells in primates. This discovery opens the way to a much better understanding of human episodic memory, for episodic memory prototypically involves a memory of where people or objects or rewards have been seen in locations “out there” which could never be implemented by the place cells that encode the location of a rat or mouse. Further, spatial view cells are valuable for navigation using vision and viewed landmarks, and provide for much richer, vision-based, navigation than the place to place self-motion update performed by rats and mice who live in dark underground tunnels. Spatial view cells thus offer a revolution in our understanding of the functions of the hippocampus in memory and navigation in humans and other primates with well-developed foveate vision. The second discovery describes a computational theory of the hippocampal-neocortical memory system that includes the only quantitative theory of how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. It is shown how foundations for this research were the discovery of reward neurons for food reward, and non-reward, in the primate orbitofrontal cortex, and representations of value including of monetary value in the human orbitofrontal cortex; and the discovery of face identity and face expression cells in the primate inferior temporal visual cortex and how they represent transform-invariant information. This research illustrates how in order to understand a brain computation, a whole series of integrated interdisciplinary discoveries is needed to build a theory of the operation of each neural system.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural Analysis Reveals Mitochondrial Placement Independent of Synapse Placement in Fine Caliber C. elegans Neurons"/>
<p>WormImage, a decades old electron microscopy database in the public domain, contains information about the ultrastructural placement of mitochondria within the nervous system of <i>C. elegans</i> over an extent not found in other databases. We mined this database and found differences in mitochondrial size and density between neurons, but limited differences between different compartments of the same neurons. While neurons are clearly able to disperse mitochondria throughout their extent, we found no evidence that they place mitochondria at synapses.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurons rely on mitochondria for an efficient supply of ATP and other metabolites. However, while neurons are highly elongated, mitochondria are discrete and limited in number. Due to the slow rates of metabolite diffusion over long distances, it follows that neurons would benefit from an ability to control the distribution of mitochondria to sites of high metabolic activity such as synapses. Ultrastructural data over substantial portions of a neuron's extent that would allow for tests of such hypotheses are scarce. Here, we mined the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>’ electron micrographs of John White and Sydney Brenner and found systematic differences in average mitochondrial length (ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 µm), diameter (0.18–0.24 µm) and volume density (3.7%–6.5%) between neurons of different function and neurotransmitter type, but found limited differences in mitochondrial length, diameter, and density between axons and dendrites of the same neurons. In analyses of mitochondrial distribution, mitochondria were found to be distributed randomly with respect to presynaptic sites. Presynaptic sites were primarily localized to varicosities, but mitochondria were no more likely to be found in synaptic varicosities than non-synaptic varicosities. Consistently, mitochondrial volume density was no greater in synaptic varicosities than non-synaptic varicosities. Therefore, beyond the capacity to disperse mitochondria throughout their length, at least in <i>C. elegans</i>, fine caliber neurons manifest limited subcellular control of mitochondrial size and distribution.</p>

                Recent studies in non-human primates do not find pronounced signals related to the animal’s own body movements in the responses of neurons in the visual cortex. This is notable because such pronounced signals have been widely observed in the visual cortex of mice. Here, we discuss factors that may contribute to the differences observed between species, such as state, slow neural drift, eccentricity, and changes in retinal input. The interpretation of movement-related signals in the visual cortex also exemplifies the challenge of identifying the sources of correlated variables. Dissecting these sources is central for understanding the functional roles of movement-related signals. We suggest a functional classification of the possible sources, aimed at facilitating cross-species comparative approaches to studying the neural mechanisms of vision during natural behavior.

                Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight. Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here, we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.

                The mis-folding and aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) such as α-synuclein (αS) underlie the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. However, targeting αS with small molecules faces challenges due to the lack of defined ligand-binding pockets in its disordered structure. Here, we implement a deep artificial neural network-based machine learning approach, which is able to statistically distinguish the fuzzy ensemble of conformational substates of αS in neat water from those in aqueous fasudil (small molecule of interest) solution. In particular, the presence of fasudil in the solvent either modulates pre-existing states of αS or gives rise to new conformational states of αS, akin to an ensemble-expansion mechanism. The ensembles display strong conformation-dependence in residue-wise interaction with the small molecule. A thermodynamic analysis indicates that small-molecule modulates the structural repertoire of αS by tuning protein backbone entropy, however entropy of the water remains unperturbed. Together, this study sheds light on the intricate interplay between small molecules and IDPs, offering insights into entropic modulation and ensemble expansion as key biophysical mechanisms driving potential therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93125">Salmonella-induced SIRT1 and SIRT3 are crucial for maintaining the metabolic switch in bacteria and host for successful pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Sirtuins are the major players in host immunometabolic regulation. However, the role of sirtuins in the modulation of the immune metabolism pertaining to salmonellosis is largely unknown. Here, our investigation focussed on the role of two important sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT3, shedding light on their impact on intracellular <i>Salmonella</i>’s metabolic switch and pathogenesis establishment. Our study indicated the ability of the live <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium to differentially regulate the levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 for maintaining the high glycolytic metabolism and low fatty acid metabolism in <i>Salmonella</i>. Perturbing SIRT1 or SIRT3 through knockdown or inhibition resulted in a remarkable shift in the host metabolism to low fatty acid oxidation and high glycolysis. This switch led to decreased proliferation of <i>Salmonella</i> in the macrophages. Further, <i>Salmonella</i>-induced higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 led to a skewed polarization state of the macrophages from a pro-inflammatory M1 state toward an immunosuppressive M2, making it more conducive for the intracellular life of <i>Salmonella</i>. Alongside, governing immunological functions by modulating p65 NF-κB acetylation, SIRT1, and SIRT3 also skew <i>Salmonella-</i>induced host metabolic switch by regulating the acetylation status of HIF-1α and PDHA1. Interestingly, though knockdown of SIRT1/3 attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> proliferation in macrophages, in in vivo mice model of infection, inhibition or knockdown of SIRT1/3 led to more dissemination and higher organ burden, which can be attributed to enhanced ROS and IL-6 production. Our study hence reports for the first time that <i>Salmonella</i> modulates SIRT1/3 levels to maintain its own metabolism for successful pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103973">Drosulfakinin signaling encodes early-life memory for adaptive social plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <i>Drosophila</i> establishes social clusters in groups, yet the underlying principles remain poorly understood. Here we performed a systemic analysis of social network behavior (SNB) that quantifies individual social distance (SD) in a group over time. The SNB assessment in 175 inbred strains from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel showed a tight association of short SD with long developmental time, low food intake, and hypoactivity. The developmental inferiority in short-SD individuals was compensated by their group culturing. By contrast, developmental isolation silenced the beneficial effects of social interactions in adults and blunted the plasticity of SNB under physiological challenges. Transcriptome analyses revealed genetic diversity for SD traits, whereas social isolation reprogrammed select genetic pathways, regardless of SD phenotypes. In particular, social deprivation suppressed the expression of the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (<i>Dsk</i>) in three pairs of adult brain neurons. Male-specific DSK signaling to Cholecystokinin-like receptor 17D1 mediated the SNB plasticity. In fact, transgenic manipulations of the DSK neuron activity were sufficient to imitate the state of social experience. Given the functional conservation of mammalian <i>Dsk</i> homologs, we propose that animals may have evolved a dedicated neural mechanism to encode early-life experience and transform group properties adaptively.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87369">A large-scale proteomics resource of circulating extracellular vesicles for biomarker discovery in pancreatic cancer</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic cancer has the worst prognosis of all common tumors. Earlier cancer diagnosis could increase survival rates and better assessment of metastatic disease could improve patient care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers to diagnose this deadly malignancy. Analyzing circulating extracellular vesicles (cEVs) using ‘liquid biopsies’ offers an attractive approach to diagnose and monitor disease status. However, it is important to differentiate EV-associated proteins enriched in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from those with benign pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). To meet this need, we combined the novel EVtrap method for highly efficient isolation of EVs from plasma and conducted proteomics analysis of samples from 124 individuals, including patients with PDAC, benign pancreatic diseases and controls. On average, 912 EV proteins were identified per 100 µL of plasma. EVs containing high levels of PDCD6IP, SERPINA12, and RUVBL2 were associated with PDAC compared to the benign diseases in both discovery and validation cohorts. EVs with PSMB4, RUVBL2, and ANKAR were associated with metastasis, and those with CRP, RALB, and CD55 correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Finally, we validated a seven EV protein PDAC signature against a background of benign pancreatic diseases that yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for the diagnosis of PDAC. To our knowledge, our study represents the largest proteomics profiling of circulating EVs ever conducted in pancreatic cancer and provides a valuable open-source atlas to the scientific community with a comprehensive catalogue of novel cEVs that may assist in the development of biomarkers and improve the outcomes of patients with PDAC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92718">The physiological landscape and specificity of antibody repertoires are consolidated by multiple immunizations</a></h4>

              
                Diverse antibody repertoires spanning multiple lymphoid organs (i.e., bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes) form the foundation of protective humoral immunity. Changes in their composition across lymphoid organs are a consequence of B-cell selection and migration events leading to a highly dynamic and unique physiological landscape of antibody repertoires upon antigenic challenge (e.g., vaccination). However, to what extent B cells encoding identical or similar antibody sequences (clones) are distributed across multiple lymphoid organs and how this is shaped by the strength of a humoral response remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed an in-depth systems analysis of antibody repertoires across multiple distinct lymphoid organs of immunized mice and discovered that organ-specific antibody repertoire features (i.e., germline V-gene usage and clonal expansion profiles) equilibrated upon a strong humoral response (multiple immunizations and high serum titers). This resulted in a surprisingly high degree of repertoire consolidation, characterized by highly connected and overlapping B-cell clones across multiple lymphoid organs. Finally, we revealed distinct physiological axes indicating clonal migrations and showed that antibody repertoire consolidation directly correlated with antigen specificity. Our study uncovered how a strong humoral response resulted in a more uniform but redundant physiological landscape of antibody repertoires, indicating that increases in antibody serum titers were a result of synergistic contributions from antigen-specific B-cell clones distributed across multiple lymphoid organs. Our findings provide valuable insights for the assessment and design of vaccine strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92493">Antimicrobial activity of iron-depriving pyoverdines against human opportunistic pathogens</a></h4>

              
                The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens. A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors. Here, we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 natural <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverdine increased survival of infected <i>Galleria mellonella</i> host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104068">Rejuvenating aged osteoprogenitors for bone repair</a></h4>

              
                Aging is marked by a decline in tissue regeneration, posing significant challenges to an increasingly older population. Here, we investigate age-related impairments in calvarial bone healing and introduce a novel two-part rejuvenation strategy to restore youthful repair. We demonstrate that aging negatively impacts the calvarial bone structure and its osteogenic tissues, diminishing osteoprogenitor number and function and severely impairing bone formation. Notably, increasing osteogenic cell numbers locally fails to rescue repair in aged mice, identifying the presence of intrinsic cellular deficits. Our strategy combines Wnt-mediated osteoprogenitor expansion with intermittent fasting, which leads to a striking restoration of youthful levels of bone healing. We find that intermittent fasting improves osteoprogenitor function, benefits that can be recapitulated by modulating NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent pathways or the gut microbiota, underscoring the multifaceted nature of this intervention. Mechanistically, we identify mitochondrial dysfunction as a key component in age-related decline in osteoprogenitor function and show that both cyclical nutrient deprivation and Nicotinamide mononucleotide rejuvenate mitochondrial health, enhancing osteogenesis. These findings offer a promising therapeutic avenue for restoring youthful bone repair in aged individuals, with potential implications for rejuvenating other tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92418">Conformational dynamics of a nicotinic receptor neurotransmitter site</a></h4>

              
                Agonists enhance receptor activity by providing net-favorable binding energy to active over resting conformations, with efficiency (η) linking binding energy to gating. Previously, we showed that in nicotinic receptors, η-values are grouped into five structural pairs, correlating efficacy and affinity within each class, uniting binding with allosteric activation (Indurthi and Auerbach, 2023). Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the low-to-high affinity transition (L→H) at the Torpedo α−δ nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmitter site. Using four agonists spanning three η-classes, the simulations reveal the structural basis of the L→H transition where: the agonist pivots around its cationic center (‘flip’), loop C undergoes staged downward displacement (‘flop’), and a compact, stable high-affinity pocket forms (‘fix’). The η derived from binding energies calculated in silico matched exact values measured experimentally in vitro. Intermediate states of the orthosteric site during receptor activation are apparent only in simulations, but could potentially be observed experimentally via time-resolved structural studies.

">Mechanisms for plastic landmark anchoring in zebrafish compass neurons</a></h4>

              
                Vision is a sensory modality particularly important for navigation, as it can inform animals of their current heading (i.e. visual landmarks) as well as its changes (i.e. optic flow). It has been shown that head direction (HD) neurons in various species incorporate the visual cues into their heading estimates. However, circuit mechanisms underlying this process remain still elusive in vertebrates. Here, we asked if and how the recently identified HD cells in the larval zebrafish - one of the smallest vertebrate models - incorporate visual information. By combining two-photon microscopy with a panoramic virtual reality setup, we demonstrate that the zebrafish HD cells can reliably track the orientation of multiple visual scenes, exploiting both landmark and optic flow cues. The mapping between landmark cues and the heading estimates is idiosyncratic across fish, and experience-dependent. Furthermore, we show that the landmark tracking requires the lateralized projection from the habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), where the HD neuron processes innervate. The physiological and morphological parallels suggest that a Hebbian mechanism similar to the fly ring neuron is at work in the habenula axons. Overall, the observations that the hindbrain HD cells of the larval zebrafish lacking an elaborate visual telencephalon shed new light on the evolution of the navigation circuitry in vertebrates.

">Comparative mapping of single-cell transcriptomic landscapes in neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease (PD) represent a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Here, we performed the first direct comparison of their transcriptomic landscapes. METHODS: We profiled the whole transcriptomes of NDD cortical tissue by snRNA-seq. We used computational analyses to identify common and distinct differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological pathways, vulnerable and disease-driver cell subtypes, and alteration in cell-to-cell interactions. RESULTS: The same vulnerable inhibitory neuron subtype was depleted in both AD and DLB. Potentially disease-driving neuronal cell subtypes were present in both PD and DLB. Cell-cell communication was predicted to be increased in AD but decreased in DLB and PD. DEGs were most commonly shared across NDDs within inhibitory neuron subtypes. Overall, we observed the greatest transcriptomic divergence between AD and PD, while DLB exhibited an intermediate transcriptomic signature. DISCUSSION: These results help explain the clinicopathological spectrum of this group of NDDs and provide unique insights into the shared and distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NDDs.

">Synaptic facilitation enhances the reliability and precision of high frequency neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                The small and tortuous volume of synaptic clefts limits the diffusion of Ca2+ ions during high frequency spiking. Extracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]o) of 0.8 mM or lower have been measured or calculated for different synapses. Here, we recorded evoked postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) and action potentials (AP) from young adult male and female mouse auditory brainstem principal neurons to investigate the relationship between neurotransmission reliability, stimulation frequency and [Ca2+]o. In 0.8 mM [Ca2+]o, we observed AP failures during afferent fiber stimulation at 100 Hz. Surprisingly, AP failures, EPSP-AP latency and jitter were all greatly reduced when stimulation frequency was increased to 500 Hz. Analysis of the EPSP/AP waveform revealed marked facilitation at 500 Hz that was not present at 100 Hz. Raising [Ca2+]o to 1.2 mM or 2.0 mM reduced or eliminated facilitation and, in these conditions, stimulation at 500 Hz increased the number of AP failures. In 0.8 mM [Ca2+]o, afferent fiber stimulation over a broad range of frequencies from 10-1000 Hz produced three different types of spiking responses: Type I cells exhibited band-pass filtering, with best response at approximately 500 Hz, Type II cells exhibited low-pass filtering above 600 Hz, and Type III cells exhibited shallow band-pass filtering centered at approximately 300 Hz. To predict AP success or failure, we built a model based on three factors: size of the EPSP, membrane potential immediately prior to the synaptic event and the number of preceding failures. We conclude that synaptic facilitation can contribute positively to the maintenance of reliable and precise high frequency neurotransmission in the auditory brainstem.

">Reanalysis of metabolomics data reveals that microbiota transfer therapy modulates important fecal and plasma metabolite profiles in children with autism spectrum disorders</a></h4>

              
                While Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is diagnosed through behavioral symptoms and psychometric evaluations, it has also been associated with distinct metabolomic patterns. A previous clinical trial of Microbiome Transfer Therapy (MTT) in children with ASD and gastrointestinal (GI) issues revealed significant differences in plasma metabolomics between children with ASD and their typically developing (TD) counterparts, which diminished after MTT. The objective of this study was to reanalyze the plasma and fecal samples using updated metabolomics libraries at Metabolon, applying a comprehensive panel of statistical methods. This approach aimed to provide deeper insights into ASD-related metabolic differences and the impact of MTT. The reanalysis identified more statistically significant metabolites and highlighted specific metabolites whose relative intensities differed between the ASD and TD groups, as well as metabolites with significant changes in intensity post-MTT. Several plasma metabolites, including sarcosine, iminodiacetate, caproate, and caprylate, initially showed significant differences between the ASD and TD groups but shifted to resemble TD levels after MTT treatment. In fecal samples, p-cresol sulfate and sphingolipids emerged as metabolites with altered intensities following MTT treatment. Multivariate Fishers Discriminant Analysis (FDA) with leave-one-out cross-validation revealed that a set of metabolites, including p-cresol sulfate, hydroxyproline, and caprylate, could robustly classify the ASD and TD cohorts pre-treatment. However, after treatment, the same FDA model could not distinguish the two groups, as the FDA scores became similar to those of the TD cohort.

">A three-dimensional histological cell atlas of the developing human brain</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is believed to contain a full complement of neurons by the time of birth together with a substantial amount of the connectivity architecture, even though a significant amount of growth occurs postnatally. The developmental process leading to this outcome is not well understood in humans in comparison with model organisms. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies give three-dimensional coverage but not cellular resolution. In contrast, sparsely sampled histological or spatial omics analyses have provided cellular resolution but not dense whole brain coverage. To address the unmet need to provide a quantitative spatiotemporal map of developing human brain at cellular resolution, we leveraged tape-transfer assisted serial section histology to obtain contiguous histological series and unbiased imaging with dense coverage. Interleaved 20 thick Nissl and H&E series and MRI volumes are co-registered into multimodal reference volumes with 60 isotropic resolution, together with atlas annotations and a stereotactic coordinate system based on skull landmarks. The histological atlas volumes have significantly more contrast and texture than the MRI volumes. We computationally detect cells brain-wide to obtain quantitative characterization of the cytoarchitecture of the developing brain at 13-14 and 20-21 gestational weeks, providing the first comprehensive regional cell counts and characterizing the differential growth of the different brain compartments. Morphological characteristics permit segmentation of cell types from histology. We detected and quantified brain-wide distribution of mitotic figures representing dividing cells, providing an unprecedented spatiotemporal atlas of proliferative dynamics in the developing human brain. Further, we characterized the abundance and distribution of Cajal-Retzius cells, a transient cell population that plays essential roles in organizing glutamatergic cortical neurons into layers. Together, our study provides an unprecedented quantitative window into the developing human brain and the reference volumes and coordinate space should be useful for integrating spatial omics data sets with dense histological context.

">Naturalistic language comprehension engages a cascade of widespread brain networks in the one second following comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension (LC) is a cornerstone of human cognition, enabling the extraction of meaning from written and spoken communication with remarkable efficiency. Decades of neuroimaging research have identified the brain networks associated with LC, but limitations in spatial and temporal resolution have hindered a comprehensive characterization of the whole-brain (millimeter scale), real-time (millisecond precision) dynamics underlying this process. To overcome these constraints, we applied a fusion of multimodal brain imaging techniques (fMRI and EEG) in healthy adults (n = 30) to map the spatiotemporal progression of neural network engagement during LC in the one second following comprehension. Our findings reveal a cascade of brain network activations, beginning with the occipitotemporal perceptual word processing network (250 ms), followed by the temporoparietal semantic retrieval network (400 ms), the posterior default mode inferential network (500 ms), the frontotemporal semantic integration network (600 ms), and finally, a distributed goal-directed comprehension network (700 ms). Crucially, inferential processing emerged as a "hinge point," linking early word processing to later higher-order networks. Efficient LC was associated with greater mediation by this inferential network and reduced reliance on top-down semantic integration. These findings provide evidence that naturalistic LC relies on rapid, dynamic interactions across widespread brain networks, with individual differences in LC reflecting specific subnetwork interactions. This work offers a framework for investigating the temporal evolution of distributed brain network dynamics in complex cognition across domains and clinical populations.

	<p>To investigate the effects of one-week maternal separation (MS) on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in adolescent and adulthood as well as adult hippocampal metabolomics simultaneously in offspring female and male rats. In the MS group, newborn SD rats were separated from their mothers for 3 h per day from postnatal days (PND) 2 to 8. The open field test (OFT), elevated plus mazes (EPM), novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT), and forced swimming test (FST) were conducted during adolescence and adulthood. Serum corticosterone, mRNA expression of hippocampal inflammatory cytokines, and hippocampal untargeted metabolomics of offspring adult rats were examined using an assay kit, qRT-PCR, and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Both MS female and male rats showed similar behaviors in OFT, EPM, NSFT, and SPT, except for the latency to feeding during adolescence and the open arm entries during adulthood, showed statistical significance only in MS female rats. Serum corticosterone and hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-&amp;amp;gamma; were significantly elevated in both female and male rats, and IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; were significantly increased only in female rats. In hippocampal metabolism, the identification of differential metabolites displayed 53 and 37 in female rats and male rats, respectively (with 35 common metabolites), which were involved in 33 and 30 metabolic pathways with 28 common pathways. One-week MS induced sex-specific anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in female and male offspring rats during adolescence and adulthood, as well as sex-differentiated characteristics in the hippocampus inflammatory cytokines and metabolomics of adult MS rats. From the experimental data, the effects of MS on the female offspring rats were more severe than those of the male offspring rats.</p>

	<p>Background: Amphetamines increase dopamine levels in mid-brain regions which, in turn, impact top-down executive function. Repeated exposure is linked to substance use disorders. Nonetheless, amphetamines are used to manage attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and eating-related disorders. In ADHD, amphetamines upregulate a system characterised by low dopaminergic tone, assisting to improve executive function. A similar process might be at play with eating disorders; however, the effect of amphetamine treatment on executive function in this case has not been thoroughly considered. Methods: Participants (N = 52, Mage = 47.06, SD = 12.29) with a body mass index of 25&amp;amp;ndash;60 were randomised to treatment (6-week dexamphetamine titration) or control (placebo) groups. They completed an executive function measure&amp;amp;mdash;Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS-SF)&amp;amp;mdash;and response inhibition task&amp;amp;mdash;Stop-Signal Task (SST)&amp;amp;mdash;at Baseline, throughout titration, at Maintenance, and at Follow-up. Mixed effects models examined whether BDEFS-SF score or the SST variable, stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), changed across sessions as a function of treatment. Results: There was no effect of group (p = 0.440), but an effect of session (p = 0.024) on BDEFS-SF, with scores at Time 2 (p = 0.011, 95% CI [0.47, 3.49]) and Maintenance (p = 0.022, 95% CI [&amp;amp;minus;4.89, &amp;amp;minus;0.39]), respectively, higher and lower than other timepoints. There was no group by session interaction (p = 0.659). R2 (conditional) = 0.74; ICC = 0.73. There was an effect of group (p = 0.039) and session (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) on SSRT, but no interaction (p = 0.707). Baseline SSRT was significantly longer than the mean of all subsequent timepoints (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, 95% CI [16.29, 33.84]). R2 (conditional) = 0.47; ICC = 0.39. Conclusions: There was no discernible impact of amphetamine treatment for obesity on executive function. Our results suggest some variation related to sample size and/or practice effects. Thus, while treatment appears unlikely to render individuals susceptible to substance use disorders, parallels with ADHD might be overstated.</p>

	<p>Antecedents: Executive functions (EFs) are the basis for establishing a goal and working towards that goal by coordinating thoughts and actions. EFs are fundamental to several aspects of daily life, specifically for academic performance. Aim: To analyse and compare the development of EFs in the transition period between the first and second cycles of early childhood education. Methodology: Non-experimental methodology, ex post facto design, descriptive, cross-sectional evolution study. Participants: Preschoolers of different educational levels (first and second cycle of infant education). In this study, the participants were evaluated by different informants: 54.42% by parents and 45.58% by teachers. In relation to gender, 52.65% were male and 47.35% were female. In relation to age, 37.54% had a range of 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 years and 62.46% had a range of 4&amp;amp;ndash;5 years. Measurement: The instrumental development of EFs was evaluated using BRIEF-P by key informants. Results: Preschoolers in the first cycle showed significantly higher scores than preschoolers in the second cycle in BRIEP-P. Conclusions: The development of EFs is key in these first key moments, having a special impact on later development and academic performance. It is necessary to work on EFs from the first cycle of early childhood education, considering the evolutionary development of EFs.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Accurately classifying Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is essential for the effective operation of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), which is needed for reliable neurorehabilitation applications. However, many factors in the processing pipeline can influence classification performance. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of different processing steps on classification accuracy in EEG-based BCI systems. Methods: This study explores the impact of various processing techniques and stages, including the FASTER algorithm for artifact rejection (AR), frequency filtering, transfer learning, and cropped training. The Physionet dataset, consisting of four motor imagery classes, was used as input due to its relatively large number of subjects. The raw EEG was tested with EEGNet and Shallow ConvNet. To examine the impact of adding a spatial dimension to the input data, we also used the Multi-branch Conv3D Net and developed two new models, Conv2D Net and Conv3D Net. Results: Our analysis showed that classification accuracy can be affected by many factors at every stage. Applying the AR method, for instance, can either enhance or degrade classification performance, depending on the subject and the specific network architecture. Transfer learning was effective in improving the performance of all networks for both raw and artifact-rejected data. However, the improvement in classification accuracy for artifact-rejected data was less pronounced compared to unfiltered data, resulting in reduced precision. For instance, the best classifier achieved 46.1% accuracy on unfiltered data, which increased to 63.5% with transfer learning. In the filtered case, accuracy rose from 45.5% to only 55.9% when transfer learning was applied. An unexpected outcome regarding frequency filtering was observed: networks demonstrated better classification performance when focusing on lower-frequency components. Higher frequency ranges were more discriminative for EEGNet and Shallow ConvNet, but only when cropped training was applied. Conclusions: The findings of this study highlight the complex interaction between processing techniques and neural network performance, emphasizing the necessity for customized processing approaches tailored to specific subjects and network architectures.</p>

                Background Quality Education is one of the primary requirements for the best survival. Pursuing higher education in a highly reputed institutions makes much difference in shaping the career of the individual. As many ranking and accreditation boards for higher education institutions like NAAC is prevalent, World ranking distinguishes institution reputation globally. The QS World University Ranking is a vital gauge for learners, educators, and institutions all over the world, allowing them to analyze and compare the quality and reputation of higher education. Predicting these rankings is difficult due to data availability concerns and QS’s frequent methodology revisions. Subjectivity and narrow criteria in rankings hamper the assessment of university greatness even more. Machine learning, data scraping, model adaptability, algorithm reversal, and short-term predictions are some existing ways of dealing with these difficulties. In this research, a prediction model for assessing institution performance in the QS World institution Rankings is designed using hybrid machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques. Two algorithms surpass others in forecasting ranks, according to the analysis. These hybrid models improves prediction accuracy of QS world rankings by integrating data analysis with model optimization using particle swarm optimization and Tabu search method.

                Background Pedagogical best practices play a pivotal role in ensuring the academic success of students within the higher education landscape. This study aims to systematically synthesize innovative pedagogical best practices within the university context. Methods We conducted a thorough systematic review using the rigorous PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. Our review involved comprehensive searches of scientific databases, including Eric, Scopus, and Proquest, covering both Spanish and English publications. We strategically employed Boolean operators like AND and OR to create a robust search equation. Our primary research question guiding this investigation was: “What innovative pedagogical practices have been developed in university settings to improve teaching and learning effectiveness?” This central question led us to delve deeply into the strategies utilized, pedagogical approaches adopted, and the noticeable impact achieved after their implementation. Additionally, we carefully established stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. Results A total of 25 scholarly articles that met the pre-established criteria were meticulously identified and included in this systematic review. The results were thoughtfully categorized into three distinct teaching strategies: the first emphasizing student-centered approaches, the second showcasing the integration of educational technology, and the third highlighting evaluation and feedback methodologies. Conclusions This systematic exploration of pedagogical best practices underscores their paramount importance in driving continuous improvement in teacher training and fostering innovation within the educational arena. Such practices not only create an engaging and effective learning environment but also set the stage for ongoing advancements in the teaching and learning processes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1528/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Rare Bilateral Double Profunda Femoris Artery Variation: Clinical Implications and Considerations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The profunda femoris artery (PFA) is the largest branch of the femoral artery supplying the thigh. The study reports a rare occurrence of bilateral double profunda artery in a male cadaver, aiming to inform surgeons of such variations to avoid complications during surgical interventions. Methods This study was conducted during routine dissections using 5-10% formalin-fixed lower limbs of a male cadaver at the Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, UAE Results In the right lower limb, two profunda femoris artery (PFA) branches arise from the common femoral artery (CFA) 5 cm from the inguinal ligament, one laterally and one posteromedially. The medial (MCFA) and lateral circumflex (LCFA) arteries branch from these PFAs respectively. The femoral nerve is anterior to the lateral PFA and LCFA and lateral to the posteromedial PFA. The obturator nerve runs posterior to the posteromedial PFA. In the left lower limb, two PFAs originate from the CFA, 2.5 and 5 cm from the inguinal ligament, lateral and posterior to the CFA, respectively. The LCFA stems from the upper PFA, while the medial MCFA arises from the CFA. The femoral nerve lies anterior to both the PFA and LCFA. The obturator nerve is posterior to the MCFA. The femoral vein crosses over the MCFA and the lower posterior PFA, distal to the MCFA origin. Conclusion This report enriches understanding of PFA anatomy and its variations, emphasizing the importance of tailored surgical approaches to minimize risks and ensure procedure success.

                Background Microbes living at extremes evolve unique survival strategies to adapt to challenging environmental conditions. Among these strategies is their distinctive metabolic potential and ability to produce specialized metabolites enabling them to compete for limited resources and defend against predators. These metabolites have significant potential in pharmaceutical and industrial applications, particularly in the development of drugs and biochemicals. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the culturable fungal communities associated with four desert plants and their surrounding soils in the Arabian Peninsula desert to identify their bioactive properties. Methods A total of 12 distinct fungal species were isolated from the plants and soils. Each plant hosted a unique set of fungi, demonstrating the diversity of desert-adapted fungal communities. Biological activities of the fungal extracts were evaluated through various assays, including antimicrobial, antifungal, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. Results Panicum turgidum harbors the most diverse fungal community, dominated by genera such as Mucor, Aspergillus, Colletotrichum, Alternaria, and Chaetomium. Aspergillus species comprise 33% of the total isolates, followed by Fusarium at 16%. All extracts exhibit diverse activities, with Aspergillus species demonstrating the highest antioxidant activities and total phenolic and flavonoid content. Fungi from P. turgidum, particularly Mucor sp., Aspergillus sp., and Curvularia sp., display potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while Mucor sp., Chaetomium sp., and Curvularia sp. exhibit moderate inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of exploring extremophilic microorganisms, such as those found in desert ecosystems, as they offer a wealth of compounds that could address current challenges in drug discovery and biotechnology.

                <p>by Abel Bernadou, Raphaël Jeanson</p>

Social insects, such as ants and bees, are known for their highly efficient and structured colonies. Division of labour, in which each member of the colony has a specific role, is considered to be one major driver of their ecological success. However, empirical evidence has accumulated showing that many workers, sometimes more than half, remain idle in insect societies. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain these patterns, but none provides a consensual explanation. Task specialisation exploits inter-individual variations, which are mainly influenced by genetic factors beyond the control of the colony. As a result, individuals may also differ in the efficiency with which they perform tasks. In this context, we aimed to test the hypothesis that colonies generate a large number of individuals in order to recruit only the most efficient to perform tasks, at the cost of producing and maintaining a fraction of workers that remain inactive. We developed a model to explore the conditions under which variations in the scaling of workers’ production and maintenance costs, along with activity costs, allow colonies to sustain a fraction of inactive workers. We sampled individual performances according to different random distributions in order to simulate the variability associated with worker efficiency. Our results show that the inactivity of part of the workforce can be beneficial for a wide range of parameters if it allows colonies to select the most efficient workers. In decentralised systems such as insect societies, we suggest that inactivity is a by-product of the random processes associated with the generation of individuals whose performance levels cannot be controlled.

                <p>by Masami Iwamoto, Satoko Hirabayashi, Noritoshi Atsumi</p>

Voluntary breathing (VB), short–term exercise (STE), and mental stress (MS) can modulate breathing rate (BR), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP), thereby affecting human physical and mental state. While existing experimental studies have explored the relationship between VB, STE, or MS and BR, HR, and BP changes, their findings remain fragmented due to individual differences and challenges in simultaneous, BR, HR, and BP measurements. We propose a computational approach for in–silico simultaneous measurements of the physiological values by comprehensive prediction of the respiratory and circulatory system responses to VB, STE, or MS. Our integrated model combines a respiratory system with a circulatory model, leveraging actor–critic reinforcement learning to control respiratory muscles. We introduce specific parameters to account for involuntary or VB and hyperventilation induced by STE. We modeled mental stress as an electrical input to the amygdala based on prior studies indicating that stress leads to amygdala hyperactivity. Our predictions for breathing rate (BR), tidal volume, minute ventilation, HR, and BP are validated against literature data obtained during various conditions, including different VB patterns (ranging from 6 to 14 bpm), active or passive knee flexion STE, and MS load. The model demonstrates good agreement with experimental results and highlights its ability to explore the mechanism of individual differences. Our model predicts heart rate variability (HRV) indices of total power spectral density and the ellipse area of Poincaré plot. Notably, slow deep breathing at a BR of 6 bpm increases HRV indices, promoting relaxation and cognitive performance. Conversely, MS elevates BP but reduces HRV indices, indicating an unstable and risky state for mental and physical health. Overall, our proposed computational approach provides simultaneous and reasonable predictions of various physiological values, accounting for individual variations through specific parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012216">Model supports asymmetric regulation across the intercellular junction for collective cell polarization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katherine Levandosky, Calina Copos</p>

Symmetry breaking, which is ubiquitous in biological cells, functionally enables directed cell movement and organized embryogenesis. Prior to movement, cells break symmetry to form a well-defined cell front and rear in a process called polarization. In developing and regenerating tissues, collective cell movement requires the coordination of the polarity of the migration machineries of neighboring cells. Though several works shed light on the molecular basis of polarity, fewer studies have focused on the regulation across the cell-cell junction required for collective polarization, thus limiting our ability to connect tissue-level dynamics to subcellular interactions. Here, we investigated how polarity signals are communicated from one cell to its neighbor to ensure coordinated front-to-rear symmetry breaking with the same orientation across the group. In a theoretical setting, we systematically searched a variety of intercellular interactions and identified that co-alignment arrangement of the polarity axes in groups of two and four cells can only be achieved with strong asymmetric regulation of Rho GTPases or enhanced assembly of complementary F-actin structures across the junction. Our results held if we further assumed the presence of an external stimulus, intrinsic cell-to-cell variability, or larger groups. The results underline the potential of using quantitative models to probe the molecular interactions required for macroscopic biological phenomena. Lastly, we posit that asymmetric regulation is achieved through junction proteins and predict that in the absence of cytoplasmic tails of such linker proteins, the likeliness of doublet co-polarity is greatly diminished.

Lipid metabolism is an essential component in reproductive physiology. While lipid mobilization has been implicated in the growth of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria parasites in their <i>Anopheles</i> vectors, the role of this process in the reproductive biology of these mosquitoes remains elusive. Here, we show that impairing lipolysis in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, the major malaria vectors, leads to embryonic lethality. Embryos derived from females in which we silenced the triglyceride lipase Ag<i>TL2</i> or the lipid storage droplet Ag<i>LSD1</i> develop normally during early embryogenesis but fail to hatch due to severely impaired metabolism. Embryonic lethality is efficiently recapitulated by exposing adult females to broad-spectrum lipase inhibitors prior to blood feeding, unveiling lipolysis as a potential target for inducing mosquito sterility. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the importance of maternal lipid mobilization in embryonic health that may inform studies on human reproduction.

Smith-Mahoney, Dante Bolzan, Weiwei Lin, Christina McConney, Jacob Porter, Jarrod Moore, Ahmed Youssef, Yashasvi Tharani, Xaralabos Varelas, Gerald V. Denis, Wilson W.

Repeated antigen exposure leads to T-cell exhaustion, a transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cellular state marked by loss of effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity, cytokine production/release), up-regulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1), and reduced proliferative capacity. Molecular pathways underlying T-cell exhaustion have been defined for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but which factors drive exhaustion in CD4+ T cells, that are also required for an effective immune response against a tumor or infection, remains unclear. Here, we utilize quantitative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular basis of the dysfunctional cell state induced by chronic stimulation of CD4+ memory T cells. We identified a dynamic response encompassing both known and novel up-regulated cell surface receptors, as well as dozens of unexpected transcriptional regulators. Integrated causal network analysis of our combined data predicts the histone acetyltransferase p300 as a driver of aspects of this phenotype following chronic stimulation, which we confirmed via targeted small molecule inhibition. While our integrative analysis also revealed large-scale metabolic reprogramming, our independent investigation confirmed a global remodeling away from glycolysis to a dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation-based metabolism coincident with oxidative stress. Overall, these data provide both insights into the mechanistic basis of CD4+ T-cell exhaustion and serve as a valuable resource for future interventional studies aimed at modulating T-cell dysfunction.

                <p>by Scott W. Emmons</p>

Despite decades of research on the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nervous system based on an anatomical description of synaptic connectivity, the circuits underlying behavior remain incompletely described and the functions of many neurons are still unknown. Updated and more complete chemical and gap junction connectomes of both adult sexes covering the entire animal including the muscle end organ have become available recently. Here, these are analyzed to gain insight into the overall structure of the connectivity network and to suggest functions of individual neuron classes. Modularity analysis divides the connectome graph into 10 communities that can be correlated with broad categories of behavior. A significant role of the body wall musculature end organ is emphasized as both a site of significant information convergence and as a source of sensory input in a feedback loop. Convergence of pathways for multisensory integration occurs throughout the network—most interneurons have similar indegrees and outdegrees and hence disperse information as much as they aggregate it. New insights include description of a set of high degree interneurons connected by many gap junctions running through the ventral cord that may represent a previously unrecognized locus of information processing. There is an apparent mechanosensory and proprioceptive field covering the entire body formed by connectivity of the many mechanosensory neurons of multiple types to 2 interneurons with output connections across the nervous system. Several additional significant, previously unrecognized circuits and pathways are uncovered, some involving unstudied neurons. The insights are valuable for guiding theoretical investigation of network properties as well as experimental studies of the functions of individual neurons, groups of neurons, and circuits.

                <p>by Gabriela Ribeiro, Ana B. Fernandes, Francisco P. M. Oliveira, João S. Duarte, Manuela Oliveira, Clotilde Limbert, Rui M. Costa, Durval C. Costa, Albino J. Oliveira-Maia</p>

Postingestive nutrient stimulation conditions food preferences through striatal dopamine and may be associated with blunted brain responses in obesity. In a cross-sectional study, we tested flavor-nutrient conditioning (FNC) with maltodextrin-enriched yogurt, with maltodextrin previously optimized for concentration and dextrose equivalents (<i>n</i> = 57), and to mask texture cues (<i>n</i> = 102). After conditioning, healthy volunteers (<i>n</i> = 52) increased preference for maltodextrin-paired (+102 kcal, CS<sup>+</sup>), relative to control (+1.8 kcal, CS<sup>-</sup>) flavors, as assessed according to intake, but not pleasantness. In a clinical study (<i>n</i> = 61), behavioral conditioning without effects on pleasantness was confirmed across pre-bariatric candidates with obesity, weight-stable post-surgery patients, and healthy controls, without significant differences between groups. Striatal dopamine D2-like receptor (DD2lR) availability, assessed with [<sup>123</sup>I]IBZM SPECT, was reduced in the obesity group and strongly correlated with conditioning strength and a measure of restrained eating in patients with gastric bypass. These results show that postingestive nutrient stimulation influences human food choices through behavioral reinforcement, and is conserved in obesity and after bariatric surgery.

Biogerontology research aims to explore the molecular basis of aging and discover new anti-aging therapeutic compounds or formulations to combat the detrimental effects of aging and promote a healthy life span. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been, and continues to be, an indispensable model organism in the field of biomedical research for discovering the molecular basis of aging S. cerevisiae has preserved nutritional signaling pathways (such as the target of rapamycin (TOR)-Sch9 and the Ras-AC-PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) pathways, and shows two distinct aging paradigms chronological life span (CLS) and replicative life span (RLS). This review explores the anti-aging properties of natural products, predominantly derived from plants, and phytoextracts using S. cerevisiae as a model organism.

                Background Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an important enzyme that metabolizes commonly used drugs, such as tramadol hydrochloride (a widely used opioid analgesic). Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 have been shown to influence the pharmacodynamic properties of administered drugs. This study aimed to screen 63 postoperative patients (wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and CYP2D6 multiplication) of Minangkabau ethnicity in West Sumatera, Indonesia, who received tramadol using a modified long PCR method, and to investigate the clinical impact of tramadol on these patients. This study had a retrospective clinical trial registry number NCT06642480. Methods The Reported Long PCR was modified using different DNA polymerases, optimizing annealing, and the number of step PCR to detect wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6. To ensure accurate PCR, the size of the PCR product was monitored: wild-type (5kb), CYP2D6*5 (6kb), and CYP2D6 multiplication genotype (10 kb). The wild-type PCR product was used as the internal control. The method was applied to screen 63 postoperative patients of Minangkabau ethnicity who received tramadol. The clinical impact was investigated and analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a chi-square test. Result The Long PCR was successfully modified with a two-step PCR at 68°C °C as the annealing and extension temperatures. The screened genotype patients were dominated by the wild-type, followed by CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6 with percentages of 89%, 6,3%, and 4,7% respectively. A total of 6.3% of CYP2D6*5 cases were classified as heterozygous and predicted as intermediate metabolizers. In addition, sex and age did not affect postoperative tramadol analgesia treatment, whereas weight had a significant impact (p=0.008). Conclusion The percentages of CYP2D6*5 and CYP2D6 multiplication genotypes were similar to those observed in another Asian population. Based on statistical analysis, tramadol was effective as an analgesic treatment for postoperative Minangkabau ethnicity patients with wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiple CYP2D6 genotypes. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are required to confirm these findings.

                Background Software Defect Prediction (SDP) enables developers to investigate unscrambled faults in the inaugural parts of the software progression mechanism. However, SDP faces the threat of high dimensionality. Feature selection (FS) selects the finest features while carefully discarding others. Several meta-heuristic algorithms, like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, and Ant Colony Optimization, have been used to develop defect prediction models. However, these models have drawbacks like high cost, local optima trap, lower convergence rate, and higher parameter tuning. This study applies an innovative FS technique (FSCOA) rooted in Chernobyl Disaster Optimizer (CDO) technique. The proposed procedure intends to unwrap the best features for a prediction model while minimizing errors. Methods The proposed FSCOA investigated twelve public NASA software datasets from the PROMISE archive on Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Quantitative Discriminant Analysis classifiers. Furthermore, the accuracy of the recommended FSCOA method was correlated with existing FS techniques, like FSDE, FSPSO, FSACO, and FSGA. The statistical merit of the proposed measure was verified using Friedman and Holm tests. Results The experiment indicated that the proposed FSCOA approach bettered the accuracy in majority of the instances and achieved an average rank of 1.75 among other studied FS approaches while applying the Friedman test. Furthermore, the Holm test showed that the p-value was lower than or equivalent to the value of α/(A-i), except for the FSCOA and FSGA and FSCOA and FSACO models. Conclusion The results illustrated the supremacy of the prospective FSCOA procedure over extant FS techniques with higher accuracy in almost all cases due to its advantages like enhanced accuracy, the ability to deal with convoluted, high-magnitude datasets not grounded in local optima, and a faster convergence rate. These advantages empower the suggested FSCOA method to overcome the challenges of the other studied FS techniques.

                Duque et al. show that astroglial calcium is recruited at active-to-passive transitions during learned-helplessness-like assays in both zebrafish and mice and that a variety of antidepressant compounds have consistent effects across both species. Ketamine, applied transiently, causes acute norepinephrine-mediated astrocytic hyperactivation followed by prolonged suppression to promote lasting behavioral resilience.

                We designed novel pre-drug compounds that transform into an active form that covalently modifies particular His residue in the active site, a difficult task to achieve, and applied to carbonic anhydrase (CAIX), a transmembrane protein, highly overexpressed in hypoxic solid tumors, important for cancer cell survival and proliferation because it acidifies tumor microenvironment helping invasion and metastases processes. The designed compounds have several functionalities: (1) primary sulfonamide group recognizing carbonic anhydrases (CA), (2) high-affinity moieties specifically recognizing CAIX among all CA isozymes, and (3) forming a covalent bond with the His64 residue. Such targeted covalent compounds possess both high initial affinity and selectivity for the disease target protein followed by complete irreversible inactivation of the protein via covalent modification. Our designed prodrug candidates bearing moderately active pre-vinylsulfone esters or weakly active carbamates optimized for mild covalent modification activity to avoid toxic non-specific modifications and selectively target CAIX. The lead inhibitors reached 2 pM affinity, the highest among known CAIX inhibitors. The strategy could be used for any disease drug target protein bearing a His residue in the vicinity of the active site.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100449">Control of 3′ splice site selection by the yeast splicing factor Fyv6</a></h4>

              
                Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed in two steps: 5ʹ splice site (SS) cleavage and exon ligation. A number of proteins transiently associate with spliceosomes to specifically impact these steps (first and second step factors). We recently identified Fyv6 (FAM192A in humans) as a second step factor in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>; however, we did not determine how widespread Fyv6’s impact is on the transcriptome. To answer this question, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze changes in splicing. These results show that loss of Fyv6 results in activation of non-consensus, branch point (BP) proximal 3ʹ SS transcriptome-wide. To identify the molecular basis of these observations, we determined a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast product complex spliceosome containing Fyv6 at 2.3 Å. The structure reveals that Fyv6 is the only second step factor that contacts the Prp22 ATPase and that Fyv6 binding is mutually exclusive with that of the first step factor Yju2. We then use this structure to dissect Fyv6 functional domains and interpret results of a genetic screen for <i>fyv6Δ</i> suppressor mutations. The combined transcriptomic, structural, and genetic studies allow us to propose a model in which Yju2/Fyv6 exchange facilitates exon ligation and Fyv6 promotes usage of consensus, BP distal 3ʹ SS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89950">Midbrain encodes sound detection behavior without auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Hearing involves analyzing the physical attributes of sounds and integrating the results of this analysis with other sensory, cognitive, and motor variables in order to guide adaptive behavior. The auditory cortex is considered crucial for the integration of acoustic and contextual information and is thought to share the resulting representations with subcortical auditory structures via its vast descending projections. By imaging cellular activity in the corticorecipient shell of the inferior colliculus of mice engaged in a sound detection task, we show that the majority of neurons encode information beyond the physical attributes of the stimulus and that the animals’ behavior can be decoded from the activity of those neurons with a high degree of accuracy. Surprisingly, this was also the case in mice in which auditory cortical input to the midbrain had been removed by bilateral cortical lesions. This illustrates that subcortical auditory structures have access to a wealth of non-acoustic information and can, independently of the auditory cortex, carry much richer neural representations than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88768">Statistical examination of shared loci in neuropsychiatric diseases using genome-wide association study summary statistics</a></h4>

              
                Continued methodological advances have enabled numerous statistical approaches for the analysis of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Genetic correlation analysis within specific regions enables a new strategy for identifying pleiotropy. Genomic regions with significant ‘local’ genetic correlations can be investigated further using state-of-the-art methodologies for statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation. We explored the utility of a genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis approach for identifying genetic overlaps between the candidate neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. The correlation analysis identified several associations between traits, the majority of which were loci in the human leukocyte antigen region. Colocalisation analysis suggested that disease-implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits and, in one locus, indicated a shared causal variant between ALS and AD. Our study identified candidate loci that might play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases and suggested the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite shared loci. The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis protocol designed for this study has been implemented in a flexible analysis pipeline that produces HTML reports and is available at: https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter.

                The vestibular system is integral to behavior; the loss of peripheral vestibular function leads to disabling consequences, such as blurred vision, dizziness, and unstable posture, severely limiting activities of daily living. Fortunately, the vestibular system’s well-defined peripheral structure and well-understood encoding strategies offer unique opportunities for developing sensory prostheses to restore vestibular function. While these devices show promising results in both animal models and implanted patients, substantial room for improvement remains. Research from an engineering perspective has largely focused on optimizing stimulation protocol to improve outcomes. However, this approach has often been pursued in isolation from research in neuroscience that has enriched our understanding of neural responses at the synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels. Accordingly, this review bridges the domains of neuroscience and engineering to consider recent progress and challenges in vestibular prosthesis development. We advocate for interdisciplinary approaches that leverage studies of neural circuits at the population level, especially in light of recent advancement in large-scale recording technology, to identify impediments still to overcome and to develop more naturalistic stimulation strategies. Fully integrating neuroscience and engineering in the context of prosthesis development will help advance the field forward and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

                The enhancer-promoter looping model, in which enhancers activate their target genes via physical contact, has long dominated the field of gene regulation. However, the ubiquity of this model has been questioned due to evidence of alternative mechanisms and the lack of its systematic validation, primarily owing to the absence of suitable experimental techniques. In this study, we present a new MNase-based proximity ligation method called MChIP-C, allowing for the measurement of protein-mediated chromatin interactions at single-nucleosome resolution on a genome-wide scale. By applying MChIP-C to study H3K4me3 promoter-centered interactions in K562 cells, we found that it had greatly improved resolution and sensitivity compared to restriction endonuclease-based C-methods. This allowed us to identify EP300 histone acetyltransferase and the SWI/SNF remodeling complex as potential candidates for establishing and/or maintaining enhancer-promoter interactions. Finally, leveraging data from published CRISPRi screens, we found that most functionally verified enhancers do physically interact with their cognate promoters, supporting the enhancer-promoter looping model.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99340">The theory of massively repeated evolution and full identifications of cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs)</a></h4>

              
                Tumorigenesis, like most complex genetic traits, is driven by the joint actions of many mutations. At the nucleotide level, such mutations are cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs). The full sets of CDNs are necessary, and perhaps even sufficient, for the understanding and treatment of each cancer patient. Currently, only a small fraction of CDNs is known as most mutations accrued in tumors are not drivers. We now develop the theory of CDNs on the basis that cancer evolution is massively repeated in millions of individuals. Hence, any advantageous mutation should recur frequently and, conversely, any mutation that does not is either a passenger or deleterious mutation. In the TCGA cancer database (sample size <b>n</b>=300–1000), point mutations may recur in <i>i</i> out of <b>n</b> patients. This study explores a wide range of mutation characteristics to determine the limit of recurrences (<i>i<sup>*</sup></i>) driven solely by neutral evolution. Since no neutral mutation can reach <i>i<sup>*</sup></i>=3, all mutations recurring at <i>i</i>≥3 are CDNs. The theory shows the feasibility of identifying almost all CDNs if <b>n</b> increases to 100,000 for each cancer type. At present, only &lt;10% of CDNs have been identified. When the full sets of CDNs are identified, the evolutionary mechanism of tumorigenesis in each case can be known and, importantly, gene targeted therapy will be far more effective in treatment and robust against drug resistance.

">Lifespan Normative Modeling of Brain Microstructure</a></h4>

              
                Normative models of brain metrics based on large populations could be extremely valuable for detecting brain abnormalities in patients with a variety of disorders, including degenerative, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, but no such models exist for the brain's white matter (WM) microstructure. Here we present the first large-scale normative model of brain WM microstructure-based on 19 international diffusion MRI datasets covering almost the entire lifespan (totaling N=54,583 individuals; age: 4-91 years). We extracted regional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics using a standardized analysis and quality control protocol and used hierarchical Bayesian regression (HBR) to model the statistical distribution of derived WM metrics as a function of age and sex. We extracted the average lifespan trajectories and corresponding centile curves for each WM region. We illustrate the utility of the method by applying it to detect and visualize profiles of WM microstructural deviations in a variety of contexts: in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome - a neurogenetic condition that markedly increases risk for schizophrenia. The resulting large-scale model provides a common reference to identify disease effects on the brain's microstructure in individuals or groups, and to compare disorders, and discover factors affecting WM abnormalities. The derived normative models are a new resource publicly available to the community, adaptable and extendable to future datasets as the available data expands.

">Where do I go? Decoding temporal neural dynamics of scene processing and visuospatial memory interactions using CNNs</a></h4>

              
                Visual scene perception enables rapid interpretation of the surrounding environment by integrating multiple visual features related to task demands and context, which is essential for goal-directed behavior. In the present work, we investigated the temporal neural dynamics underlying the interaction between the processing of visual features (i.e., bottom-up processes) and contextual knowledge (i.e., top-down processes) during scene perception. We analyzed EEG data from 30 participants performing scene memory and visuospatial memory tasks in which we manipulated the number of navigational affordances available (i.e., the number of open doors) while controlling for similar low-level visual features across tasks. We used convolutional neural networks (CNN) coupled with gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to assess the main channels and time points underlying neural processing for each task. We found that early occipitoparietal activity (50-250 ms post-stimulus) contributed most to the classification of several aspects of visual perception, including scene color, navigational affordances, and spatial memory content. In addition, we showed that the CNN successfully trained to detect affordances during scene perception was unable to detect the same affordances in the spatial memory task after learning, whereas a similarly trained and tested model for detecting wall color was able to generalize across tasks. Taken together, these results reveal an early common window of integration for scene and visuospatial memory information, with a specific and immediate influence of newly acquired spatial knowledge on early neural correlates of scene perception.

">Neural dynamics hierarchy in motor cortex and striatum across naturalistic behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Mammals perform a wide range of movements actuated by diverse patterns of muscle activity. Primary motor cortex (M1) and striatum are implicated in controlling these movements, but how their activity dynamics are organized to accommodate such diversity is poorly understood. We developed a paradigm that enabled us to investigate neural dynamics across diverse motor behaviors in mice. In contrast to existing views, we found neither behavior-specific nor behavior-invariant organization in single-neuron activity, population-level covariation, and muscle activity correlation. Instead, the similarity of activity dynamics between behaviors varied differentially across behavior pairs, forming a hierarchical organization. The same hierarchical organization was shared between M1 and striatum, despite stronger muscle activity correlation in M1 and greater behavior specificity in striatum. Network modeling indicated that striatal activity is sufficient to drive hierarchical dynamics in muscle pattern-generating circuits. These hierarchical dynamics may reflect a tradeoff between behavioral specialization and generalization in motor system function.

">Differential temporal filtering in the fly optic lobe</a></h4>

              
                Visual interneurons come in many different flavors, representing luminance changes at one location as ON or OFF signals with different dynamics, ranging from purely sustained to sharply transient responses. While the functional relevance of this representation for subsequent computations like direction-selective motion detection is well understood, the mechanisms by which these differences in dynamics arise are unclear. Here, I study this question in the fly optic lobe. Taking advantage of the known connectome I simulate a network of five adjacent optical columns each comprising 65 different cell types. Each neuron is modeled as an electrically compact single compartment, conductance-based element that receives input from other neurons within its column and from its neighboring columns according to the intra- and inter-columnar connectivity matrix. The sign of the input is determined according to the known transmitter type of the presynaptic neuron and the receptor on the postsynaptic side. In addition, some of the neurons are given voltage-dependent conductances known from the fly transcriptome. As free parameters, each neuron has an input and an output gain, applied to all its input and output synapses, respectively. The parameters are adjusted such that the spatio-temporal receptive field properties of 13 out of the 65 simulated neurons match the experimentally determined ones as closely as possible. Despite the fact that all neurons have identical leak conductance and membrane capacitance, this procedure leads to a surprisingly good fit to the data, where specific neurons respond transiently while others respond in a sustained way to luminance changes. This fit critically depends on the presence of an H-current in some of the first-order interneurons, i.e., lamina cells L1 and L2: turning off the H-current eliminates the transient response nature of many neurons leaving only sustained responses in all of the examined interneurons. I conclude that the diverse dynamic response behavior of the columnar neurons in the fly optic lobe starts in the lamina and is created by their different intrinsic membrane properties. I predict that eliminating the hyperpolarization-activated current by RNAi should strongly affect the dynamics of many medulla neurons and, consequently, also higher-order functions depending on them like direction-selectivity in T4 and T5 neurons.

">G protein Inactivation as a Mechanism for Addiction Treatment</a></h4>

              
                The endogenous dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system in the brain mediates the dysphoric effects of stress, and KOR antagonists may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of drug addiction, depression, and psychosis. One class of KOR antagonists, the long-acting norBNI-like antagonists, have been suggested to act by causing KOR inactivation through a cJun-kinase mechanism rather than by competitive inhibition. In this study, we screened for other opioid ligands that might produce norBNI-like KOR inactivation and found that nalfurafine (a G-biased KOR agonist) and nalmefene (a KOR partial agonist) also produce long-lasting KOR inactivation. Neither nalfurafine nor nalmefene are completely selective KOR ligands, but KOR inactivation was observed at doses 10-100 fold lower than necessary for mu opioid receptor actions. Daily microdosing with nalfurafine or nalmefene blocked KORs responsible for antinociceptive effects, blocked KORs mediating stress-induced aversion, and mitigated the aversion during acute and protracted withdrawal in fentanyl-dependent mice. Both nalfurafine and nalmefene have long histories of safety and use in humans and could potentially be repurposed for the treatment of dynorphin-mediated stress disorders.

">Dimorphic Neural Network Architecture Prioritizes Sexual-related Behaviors in Male C.elegans</a></h4>

              
                Neural network architecture determines its functional output. However, the detailed mechanisms are not well characterized. In this study, we focused on the neural network architectures of male and hermaphrodite C. elegans and the association with sexually dimorphic behaviors. We applied graph theory and computational neuroscience methods to systematically discern the features of these two neural networks. Our findings revealed that a small percentage of sexual-specific neurons exerted dominance throughout the entire male neural network, suggesting male's prioritized sexual-related behavior outputs. Based on the structural and dynamical characteristics of two complete neural networks,sub-networks containing sex-specific neurons and their immediate neighbors, or sub-networks exclusively comprising sex-shared neurons, we predicted dimorphic behavioral outcomes for males and hermaphrodites. To verify the prediction, we performed behavioral and calcium imaging experiments and dissected a circuit that is specific for the increased spontaneous local search in males for mate-searching. Our research sheds light on the neural circuits that underlie sexually dimorphic behaviors in C. elegans, and provides significant insights into the inter connected relationship between network architecture and functional outcomes at the whole-brain level.

">Mechanisms of Alpha-Synuclein Seeded Aggregation in Neurons Revealed by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</a></h4>

              
                The brains of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are characterized by the presence of Lewy body inclusions enriched with fibrillar forms of the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn). Despite related evidence that Lewy pathology spreads across different brain regions as the disease progresses, the underlying mechanism hence the fundamental cause of PD progression is unknown. The propagation of aSyn pathology is thought to potentially occur through the release of aSyn aggregates from diseased neurons, their uptake by neighboring healthy neurons via endocytosis, and subsequent seeding of native aSyn aggregation in the cytosol. A critical aspect of this process is believed to involve the escape of internalized aggregates from the endolysosomal compartment, though direct evidence of this mechanism in cultured neuron models remains lacking. In this study, we utilize a custom-built, time-gated fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM) to investigate the progression of seeded aggregation over time in live cortical neurons. By establishing fluorescence lifetime sensitivity to aSyn aggregation level, we are able to monitor the protein's aggregation state. Through a FLIM analysis of neurons expressing aSyn-mVenus and exposed to aSyn preformed fibrils labeled with the acid-responsive dye pHrodo, we reveal the protein's aggregation state in both the cytosol and the endolysosomal compartment. The results indicate that aSyn seeds undergo partial disassembly prior to escaping the endocytic pathway, and that this escape is closely linked to the aggregation of cytosolic aSyn. In certain neurons, monomeric aSyn is found to translocate from the cytosol into the endolysosomal compartment, where it apparently forms aggregates in proximity to retained seeds. Additional analyses reveals zones of neuritic aSyn aggregates that overlaps with regions of microtubule disruption. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of aSyn pathology propagation in PD and other synucleinopathies, motivate additional experiments along these lines, and offer a path to guide the development of disease-modifying therapies.

">Mutation in Wdr45 leads to early motor dysfunction and widespread aberrant axon terminals in a beta-propeller protein associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) patient-inspired mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Beta-propeller Protein Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a devastating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease linked to variants in WDR45. Currently, there is no cure or disease altering treatment for this disease. This is, in part, due to a lack of insight into early phenotypes of BPAN progression and WDR45's role in establishing and maintaining neurological function. Here we generated and characterized a mouse model bearing a c52C>T BPAN patient variant in Wdr45. We show this mutation ablates WDR45 protein expression and alters autophagy in the brain. Behavioral analysis of these mice revealed characteristic signs of BPAN including cognitive impairment, hyperactivity, and motor decline. We show these behaviors coincide with widespread neuroinflammation and development of axonal spheroids in multiple neuron subclasses throughout the brain. Several lines of evidence suggest these spheroids arise from axon terminals. Transcriptomic analysis uncovered multiple disrupted pathways in the cortex including genes associated with synapses, neurites, endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and ferroptosis. This is supported by accumulation of the iron regulating transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) and the endoplasmic reticulum resident calreticulin (CALR) in the cortex as these animals age. CALR forms spheroid structures similar to the axonal spheroids seen in these animals. Taken together, our data demonstrate that WDR45 is necessary for healthy brain function and maintenance of axon terminals. This model opens the door to therapeutics targeting BPAN and further exploration of the role of WDR45 in neuronal function.

">Optogenetic inhibition quenches the integration of sensory input in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Many fundamental processes of brain computation, such as sensory perception and motor control, heavily rely on the mesoscopic dynamics of activity across the cerebral cortex. Manipulating mesoscale activity and observing its effects across multiple brain regions is crucial for understanding the causal link between cortical dynamics and behavior. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a novel all-optical system that allows inhibition of excitatory neurons while simultaneously monitoring cortical responses at arbitrary sites across the entire dorsal cortex of mice. Methods: We combined wide-field imaging and optogenetics to create a mesoscale all-optical approach, enabling simultaneous monitoring and manipulation of cortical activity using light. Intravenous injection of two PHP.eB AAVs enabled the whole-brain co-expression of the red-shifted calcium indicator jRCaMP1b and the inhibitory actuator stGtACR2, with stable expression over several weeks. This system was calibrated, and the effects of inhibition on sensory responses were tested. Results: Increasing laser power progressively reduced spontaneous activity at the site of irradiation. A single 5-second pulse on the barrel field cortex significantly decreased the amplitude of sensory-evoked responses, not only in the stimulated region but across the entire stimulated hemisphere. Conclusions: This novel all-optical system enables targeted inhibition while concurrently monitoring mesoscale cortical activity. It provides insights into the dynamics of cortical circuits and offers a milestone for investigating the causal links between neuronal activity and behavior. Future research can use this tool to address sensory responsiveness impairments in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Reduced enteric BDNF-TrkB signaling drives glucocorticoid-mediated GI dysmotility</a></h4>

              
                Stress affects gastrointestinal (GI) function causing dysmotility, especially in disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBI) patients. GI motility is regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS), suggesting that stress alters ENS biology to cause dysmotility. While stress increases glucocorticoid levels through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, how glucocorticoids affect GI motility is not known. Glucocorticoid signaling reduces expression of specific transcriptional isoforms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the central nervous system, altering signaling through its receptor Tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) to cause behavioral defects. However, since the nature of ENS-specific Bdnf isoforms and their response to glucocorticoids remains unknown, we are limited in studying how stress impacts the ENS to cause dysmotility. Here, in male and female mice, we establish that stress-responsive Bdnf isoforms that are transcriptionally regulated at exons 4 and 6 represent >85% of all Bdnf isoforms in the post-natal ENS, and that Bdnf and Ntrk2 (TrkB) are expressed by enteric neurons. We further show using male mice dosed with a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone (Dexa), that increased glucocorticoid signaling in ENS significantly reduces the expression of Bdnf transcripts and protein and that it significantly reduces GI motility. Finally, by using HIOC, a specific synthetic agonist of TrkB, we observe that HIOC treatment significantly improved GI motility of a cohort of Dexa-treated male mice, when compared to Dexa-treated and HIOC-untreated mice. Our results implicate BDNF- TrkB signaling in the etiology of stress-associated dysmotility and suggest that TrkB is a putative therapeutic target for dysmotility in DGBI patients.
