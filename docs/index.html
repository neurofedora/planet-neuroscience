">The ventral hippocampal-nucleus accumbens shell circuit drives approach decisions under social novelty and learned cue approach-avoidance conflict</a></h4>

              
                Successful resolution of approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) is fundamentally important for survival, and its dysregulation is a hallmark of many neuropsychiatric disorders, and yet the underlying neural circuit mechanisms are not well elucidated. Converging human and animal research has implicated the anterior/ventral hippocampus (vHPC) as a key node in arbitrating AAC in a region-specific manner. In this study, we sought to target the vHPC CA1 projection pathway to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to delineate its contribution to AAC decision-making, particularly in the arbitration of learned reward- and punishment signals, as well as innate signals. To this end, we used pathway-specific chemogenetics in male and female Long Evans rats to inhibit the NAc shell projecting vHPC CA1 neurons while rats underwent a test in which cues of positive and negative valence were presented concurrently to elicit AAC. Further behavioral assays of social preference and memory, reward and punishment cue processing, anxiety, and novelty processing were administered to further interrogate the conditions under which the vCA1-NAc shell pathway is recruited. Chemogenetic inhibition of the vCA1-NAc shell circuit resulted in animals exhibiting increased decision-making time and avoidance bias specifically in the face of motivational conflict, as the same behavioral phenotype was absent in separate conditioned cue preference and avoidance tests. vCA1-NAc shell inhibition also led to a reduction in seeking social interaction with a novel rat but did not alter anxiety-like behaviors. The vCA1-NAc shell circuit is therefore critically engaged in biasing decisions to approach in the face of social novelty and approach-avoidance conflict. Dysregulation of this circuit could lead to the precipitation of addictive behaviours in substance abuse, or potentiation of avoidance in situations of approach-avoidance conflict.

	<p>Menopause may increase the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) dementia. This study aimed to use young plasma therapy (YPT) to improve dementia caused by AD in aged ovariectomized rats. Female Wistar rats were used in the following groups: (a) young (CY) (180&amp;amp;ndash;200 g, 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 months, n = 10) and (b) old groups (250&amp;amp;ndash;350 g, 22&amp;amp;ndash;24 months, n = 60). The old rats were randomly assigned to six sub-groups: (1) control, (2) sham, (3) ovariectomized group (OVX), (4) OVX + Alzheimer disease (OVX + AD), (5) OVX + AD+ 17&amp;amp;beta;-Estradiol (OVX + AD + E), and (6) OVX + AD + young plasma (OVX + AD + YP). Cognitive behaviors were evaluated using NOR, MWM, and PAL tests. MiR-134a, SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF expressions were measured using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Oxidative stress in hippocampal tissue was assayed using ELISA kits. OVX and AD caused significant cognitive impairment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), up-regulated miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), down-regulated SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF protein expression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and decreased antioxidant marker levels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to the sham group. YPT significantly restored miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), SIRT-1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CREB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and BDNF (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) protein expression in OVX + AD rats. YPT, as much as or more than estrogen therapy (ERT), significantly improved oxidative stress and down-regulated miR-134a expression and the up-regulation of SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins in OVX + AD rats (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). YPT significantly improved histological alteration compared to the OVX + AD group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). As a non-pharmacological treatment, YPT can improve the expression of miR-134a and SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins as much as or more than estrogen therapy, ameliorating AD-induced dementia in aged OVX rats.</p>

	<p>This study examined the impact of personalizing muscle vibration parameters on trunk control. We assessed how altered trunk extensor muscle (TEM) proprioception affects seated trunk control in healthy controls (HCs). To explore the link between altered TEM proprioception and impaired trunk control in chronic low back pain (cLBP), we performed equivalence testing between HCs undergoing TEM vibration and cLBP without vibration. Twenty HCs performed active joint reposition error (AJRE) testing to determine personalized vibration parameters. Each participant maintained balance on an unstable chair with eyes open and closed, with and without TEM vibration. We compared trunk control between HCs and twenty age- and sex-matched cLBP participants, using mean velocity and 95% confidence ellipse area of center-of-pressure changes to quantify trunk postural control. Equivalence was examined by comparing mean difference scores to minimal detectable change values and calculating between-group effect sizes. Personalized vibration parameters led to larger lumbopelvic repositioning errors (d = 0.89) than any single vibration frequency (d = 0.31&amp;amp;ndash;0.36). In healthy adults with no back pain, vision had large effects on postural control (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.604&amp;amp;ndash;0.842), but TEM vibration had no significant effects (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.105) or interactions with vision (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.423). Between-group effect sizes (d = 0.32&amp;amp;ndash;0.51) exceeded our threshold for performance equivalence (d &amp;amp;lt; 0.2). Muscle vibration altered position sense during AJRE testing, and personalizing parameters amplified this effect. However, TEM vibration had minimal impact on seated trunk postural control in adults with no back pain and did not lead to performance degradation comparable to that in cLBP.</p>

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.'s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates impacting periodontal disease were considered, and demographic and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health's impact on periodontal disease. Results Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried subjects affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between subjects with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Within study limitations, it is concluded that no significant difference exists in periodontal status between individuals with compromised mental health and those without. The findings underscore potential associations between mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance with periodontal disease.

We use the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab <I>Cancer borealis</I> to investigate mechanisms of internetwork coordination, due to its small, well-characterized feeding-related networks (gastric mill [chewing, ~0.1&nbsp;Hz]; pyloric [filtering food, ~1&nbsp;Hz]). Here, we investigate coordination between these networks during the Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide neuropeptide modulatory state. Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide activates a unique triphasic gastric mill rhythm in which the typically pyloric-only LPG neuron generates dual pyloric-plus gastric mill-timed oscillations. Additionally, the pyloric rhythm exhibits shorter cycles during gastric mill rhythm-timed LPG bursts, and longer cycles during IC, or IC plus LG gastric mill neuron bursts. Photoinactivation revealed that LPG is necessary to shorten pyloric cycle period, likely through its rectified electrical coupling to pyloric pacemaker neurons. Hyperpolarizing current injections demonstrated that although LG bursting enables IC bursts, only gastric mill rhythm bursts in IC are necessary to prolong the pyloric cycle period. Surprisingly, LPG photoinactivation also eliminated prolonged pyloric cycles, without changing IC firing frequency or gastric mill burst duration, suggesting that pyloric cycles are prolonged via IC synaptic inhibition of LPG, which indirectly slows the pyloric pacemakers via electrical coupling. Thus, the same dual-network neuron directly conveys excitation from its endogenous bursting and indirectly funnels synaptic inhibition to enable one network to alternately decrease and increase the cycle period of a related network.</p>

                Background The goal of the Fifth Annual Baylor College of Medicine & DNAnexus Structural Variation Hackathon was to push forward the research on structural variants (SVs) by rapidly developing and deploying open-source software. The event took place in-person and virtually in August 2023, when 49 scientists from 14 countries and 8 U.S. states collaboratively worked on projects to address critical gaps in the field of genomics. The hackathon projects concentrated on developing bioinformatic workflows for the following challenges: RNA transcriptome comparison, simulation of mosaic variations, metagenomics, Mendelian variation, SVs in plant genomics, and assembly vs. mapping SV calling comparisons. Methods As a starting point we used publicly available data from state-of-the-art long- and short-read sequencing technologies. The workflows developed during the hackathon incorporated open-source software, as well as scripts written using Bash and Python. Moreover, we leveraged the advantages of Docker and Snakemake for workflow automation. Results The results of the hackathon consists of six prototype bioinformatic workflows that use open-source software for SV research. We made the workflows scalable and modular for usability and reproducibility. Furthermore, we tested the workflows on example public data to show that the workflows can work. The code and the data produced during the event have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics) to reproduce and built upon in the future. Conclusions The following sections describe the motivation, lessons learned, and software produced by teams during the hackathon. Here, we describe in detail the objectives, value propositions, implementation, and use cases for our workflows. In summary, the article reports the advancements in the development of software for SV detection made during the hackathon.

                Background Increasing the participation of peer educators (PEs) to deliver HIV/AIDS services in a limited income context remains challenging, despite their profound effectiveness, and this has become more evident since the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examines the roles of PEs and the current challenges in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam. Methods A mixed-method approach was employed. The study was conducted in seven large provinces in Vietnam from December 2021 to March 2022. An online cross-sectional survey was administered to 63 health staff and 147 PEs to collect quantitative data on PEs’ roles. Qualitative interviews included seven focus-group discussions with 39 PEs and in-depth interviews with 25 key informants, including seven leaders and 14 health staff from district health centers and provincial centers for disease control (CDCs), one national-level HIV/AIDS program manager, one non-government organization representative, and two senior experts. Results Results show the diversified roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS activities in Vietnam. The roles could be categorized into two main groups, including community-based activities and facilities-based activities. Prominent roles are identifying and referring customers to HIV testing services, conducting communication and education activities, and referring patients to treatment services. The study shows a decrease in the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam despite the high demand for their participation from healthcare providers. Critical challenges in employing PEs in HIV/AIDS services are related to lack of funding, inadequate training, lack of recognition, and stigma. Conclusion To keep the right path to the goal of ending the HIV pandemic by 2030, it is important to maintain and increase the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services. Raising better acknowledgment from stakeholders of PEs’ roles could help overcome the remaining challenges and expand their participation toward this goal.

                <p>by Youcheng Li, Leann Lac, Qian Liu, Pingzhao Hu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics has gained popularity over the past decade due to its ability to evaluate transcriptome data while preserving spatial information. Cell segmentation is a crucial step in spatial transcriptomic analysis, as it enables the avoidance of unpredictable tissue disentanglement steps. Although high-quality cell segmentation algorithms can aid in the extraction of valuable data, traditional methods are frequently non-spatial, do not account for spatial information efficiently, and perform poorly when confronted with the problem of spatial transcriptome cell segmentation with varying shapes. In this study, we propose ST-CellSeg, an image-based machine learning method for spatial transcriptomics that uses manifold for cell segmentation and is novel in its consideration of multi-scale information. We first construct a fully connected graph which acts as a spatial transcriptomic manifold. Using multi-scale data, we then determine the low-dimensional spatial probability distribution representation for cell segmentation. Using the adjusted Rand index (ARI), normalized mutual information (NMI), and Silhouette coefficient (SC) as model performance measures, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline models in selected datasets and is efficient in computational complexity.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012195">Prioritizing drug targets by perturbing biological network response functions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew C. Perrone, Michael G. Lerner, Matthew Dunworth, Andrew J. Ewald, Joel S. Bader</p>

Therapeutic interventions are designed to perturb the function of a biological system. However, there are many types of proteins that cannot be targeted with conventional small molecule drugs. Accordingly, many identified gene-regulatory drivers and downstream effectors are currently undruggable. Drivers and effectors are often connected by druggable signaling and regulatory intermediates. Methods to identify druggable intermediates therefore have general value in expanding the set of targets available for hypothesis-driven validation. Here we identify and prioritize potential druggable intermediates by developing a network perturbation theory, termed NetPert, for response functions of biological networks. Dynamics are defined by a network structure in which vertices represent genes and proteins, and edges represent gene-regulatory interactions and protein-protein interactions. Perturbation theory for network dynamics prioritizes targets that interfere with signaling from driver to response genes. Applications to organoid models for metastatic breast cancer demonstrate the ability of this mathematical framework to identify and prioritize druggable intermediates. While the short-time limit of the perturbation theory resembles betweenness centrality, NetPert is superior in generating target rankings that correlate with previous wet-lab assays and are more robust to incomplete or noisy network data. NetPert also performs better than a related graph diffusion approach. Wet-lab assays demonstrate that drugs for targets identified by NetPert, including targets that are not themselves differentially expressed, are active in suppressing additional metastatic phenotypes.

                <p>by Apolline Louvet, Clément Mantoux, Nathalie Machon</p>

As the spatial arrangement of trees planted along streets in cities makes their bases potential ecological corridors for the flora, urban tree bases may be a key contributor to the overall connectivity of the urban ecosystem. However, these tree bases are also a highly fragmented environment in which extinctions are frequent. The goal of this study was to assess the plant species’ ability to survive and spread through urban tree bases. To do so, we developed a Bayesian framework to assess the extinction risk of a plant metapopulation using presence/absence data, assuming that the occupancy dynamics was described by a Hidden Markov Model. The novelty of our approach is to take into account the combined effect of low-distance dispersal and the potential presence of a seed bank on the extinction risk. We introduced a metric of the extinction risk and examined its performance over a wide range of metapopulation parameters. We applied our framework to yearly floristic inventories carried out in 1324 tree bases in Paris, France. While local extinction risks were generally high, extinction risks at the street scale varied greatly from one species to another. We identified 10 plant species that could survive and spread through urban tree bases, and three plant traits correlated with the extinction risk at the metapopulation scale: the maximal height, and the beginning and end of the flowering period. Our results suggest that some plant species can use urban tree bases as ecological corridors despite high local extinction risks by forming a seed bank. We also identified other plant traits correlated with the ability to survive in tree bases, related to the action of gardeners. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that our Bayesian estimation framework based on percolation theory has the potential to be extended to more general metapopulations.

                <p>by Caleb J. Holt, Kenneth D. Miller, Yashar Ahmadian</p>

When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column’s receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.

                <p>by Devon J. Boland, Nicola M. Ayres</p>

AlphaFold2 is an Artificial Intelligence-based program developed to predict the 3D structure of proteins given only their amino acid sequence at atomic resolution. Due to the accuracy and efficiency at which AlphaFold2 can generate 3D structure predictions and its widespread adoption into various aspects of biochemical research, the technique of protein structure prediction should be considered for incorporation into the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. A module for introducing AlphaFold2 into a senior-level biochemistry laboratory classroom was developed. The module’s focus was to have students predict the structures of proteins from the MPOX 22 global outbreak virus isolate genome, which had no structures elucidated at that time. The goal of this study was to both determine the impact the module had on students and to develop a framework for introducing AlphaFold2 into the undergraduate curriculum so that instructors for biochemistry courses, regardless of their background in bioinformatics, could adapt the module into their classrooms.

Throughout history, humans have relied on plants as a source of medication, flavoring, and food. Plants synthesize large chemical libraries and release many of these compounds into the rhizosphere and atmosphere where they affect animal and microbe behavior. To survive, nematodes must have evolved the sensory capacity to distinguish plant-made small molecules (SMs) that are harmful and must be avoided from those that are beneficial and should be sought. This ability to classify chemical cues as a function of their value is fundamental to olfaction and represents a capacity shared by many animals, including humans. Here, we present an efficient platform based on multiwell plates, liquid handling instrumentation, inexpensive optical scanners, and bespoke software that can efficiently determine the valence (attraction or repulsion) of single SMs in the model nematode, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Using this integrated hardware-wetware-software platform, we screened 90 plant SMs and identified 37 that attracted or repelled wild-type animals but had no effect on mutants defective in chemosensory transduction. Genetic dissection indicates that for at least 10 of these SMs, response valence emerges from the integration of opposing signals, arguing that olfactory valence is often determined by integrating chemosensory signals over multiple lines of information. This study establishes that <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> is an effective discovery engine for determining chemotaxis valence and for identifying natural products detected by the chemosensory nervous system.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002665">From hidden hearing loss to supranormal auditory processing by neurotrophin 3-mediated modulation of inner hair cell synapse density</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lingchao Ji, Beatriz C. Borges, David T. Martel, Calvin Wu, M. Charles Liberman, Susan E. Shore, Gabriel Corfas</p>

Loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and inner hair cells (IHC synaptopathy) leads to an auditory neuropathy called hidden hearing loss (HHL) characterized by normal auditory thresholds but reduced amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials. It has been proposed that synaptopathy and HHL result in poor performance in challenging hearing tasks despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse counts were increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 knockdown or overexpression reduces or increases, respectively, IHC synapse density and suprathreshold amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials without changing cochlear thresholds. We now show that IHC synapse density does not influence the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex or its prepulse inhibition. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test for auditory temporal processing, is reduced or enhanced according to Ntf3 expression levels. These results indicate that IHC synaptopathy causes temporal processing deficits predicted in HHL. Furthermore, the improvement in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1183/v2?src=rss">The influence of the fourth industrial revolution in teaching and learning: the COVID-19 context [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The aim of this paper was to explore how the Fourth Industrial Revolution shapes teaching and learning during COVID-19 in some of the schools located in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, South Africa. This paper employed qualitative interpretative multiple case study design. Purposive sampling was used to sample our participants. Methods We selected four teachers who separately taught at the early childhood development stage, intermediate phase, senior phase, and further education and training phases. Data was collected telephonically through semi-structured interviews with teachers from Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. Data was collected from their experiences of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. Collected data was analysed using a typology approach whereby themes that derived from the literature reviewed and research questions were used. Results We inferred from the results of the paper that teachers had challenges with teaching and availability of learning resources, such as limited access to internet and socio-economic backgrounds, which hindered the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the teaching and learning process. There were also challenges related to teachers’ background on the usage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the lack of school management teams support. The paper revealed that the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in teaching and learning was affected negatively by the existence of the above-mentioned challenges, which needs to be addressed. Conclusions Therefore, we recommended that the government and stakeholders within the education sector provide resources such as smart-boards, computers, and network access in schools lacking such facilities, as well as providing professional development interventions and training teachers to have an in-depth understanding of the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the teaching and learning context.

                Fish species are commonly used as experimental models in the laboratory. DNA is routinely collected from these animals to permit identification of their genotype. The current standard procedure to sample DNA is fin clipping, which involves anaesthetising individuals and removing a portion of the caudal fin. While fin clipping reliably generates good quality DNA samples for downstream applications, there is evidence that it can alter health and welfare, and impact the fish’s behaviour. This in turn can result in greater variation in the data collected. In a recent study we adapted a skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA from small-bodied fish, including sticklebacks and zebrafish, without the use of analgesics, anaesthetics or sharp instruments. A rayon-tipped swab was used to collect mucus from the flank of the fish, which was then used for DNA extraction. We subsequently demonstrated that compared to fin clipping, skin swabbing triggered fewer changes in stress axis activation and behaviour. We also found that gene expression and behaviour data collected from swabbed fish were less variable than similar data collected from fish that had been fin clipped. This potentially allows smaller sample sizes in experimental groups to be used after skin swabbing, thereby reducing animal use. Here we provide a detailed protocol explaining how to collect DNA samples from small laboratory fish using skin swabs.

                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                Background Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and the expression was weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which was an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

                Background In Sierra Leone, the National Emergency Medical Services (NEMS) was designed to facilitate maternal and under-five referrals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health facilities were repurposed and mobility restrictions were introduced, and this might have negatively influenced access to care. Thus, we compared utilization, timeliness and outcomes of referrals between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Methods This was a cohort study using routinely collected data by the NEMS. There were 65 weeks in the pre-COVID-19 period (week one of January 2019 to week three of March 2020) and 91 weeks in the COVID-19 period (week four of March 2020 to week four of December 2021). We compared weekly referrals and the duration from initiating the NEMS for a referral to the patient reaching the receiving facility (prehospital delay) using the Mann–Whitney U test. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the mode of transportation and referral outcomes. Results Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, there was significant decrease during the COVID-19 period in the median number of weekly maternal referrals (277 to 205), under-five referrals (177 to 104) and transfers on NEMS ambulances (348 to 269). The prehospital delays increased during the COVID-19 period for both maternal (72 to 86 minutes) and under-five (75 to 90 minutes) referrals (p<0.001). The percentage of NEMS ambulance transfers for maternal referrals was similar in both periods (90%), but for under-five referrals this decreased between the pre-COVID-19 (72%) and COVID-19 (68%) periods. In both periods, maternal (98%) and under-five (96%) referrals were successfully admitted to the receiving facilities. Conclusions The performance of the NEMS system in terms of referrals reaching the receiving health facilities was maintained during the pandemic. However, there is a need to sustain the current performance of the NEMS system while making more efforts to increase utilization and reduce delays during outbreaks/pandemics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-702/v1?src=rss">Management of Strangulated Richter’s Hernia in a Resource-Limited Setting: Report of Two Cases and Literature Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Richter’s hernia is a rare type of abdominal wall hernia characterized by high morbidity and mortality. It occurs when the anti-mesenteric border of the bowel is partially trapped in a tight hernial ring. The femoral ring is the most common site, with the ileum being the most frequently involved intestinal segment. However, the advent of laparoscopic surgery has introduced another potential site for Richter’s hernia formation. In our region, this pathological entity is exceptionally diagnosed due to limited access to abdominal imaging and delayed management. Additionally, the wide variety of clinical manifestations resulting from incomplete intestinal obstruction makes it particularly difficult to diagnose. Consequently, it is usually identified during surgery. We present here the case of two adult patients (a 33-yeairs-old woman and a 59-year-old man), the first with a history of surgical procedures and the second with a spontaneously reducible painless inguinal swelling. They were transferred to the surgical emergency department for an acute abdomen with abdominal distension and cessation of matter and gas. Clinical and paraclinical examinations (including hydroaeric level on abdominal X-ray) indicated mechanical intestinal obstruction. Emergency laparotomy, necessitated by the unavailability of abdominal computed tomography due to financial constraints, confirmed the diagnosis of Richter's hernia, with the first case located in the right inguinal region and the second in the linea alba. Surgical management involved reduction of the hernia contents and suture repair in both cases. Despite requiring bowel resection in the second patient, the postoperative course was straightforward. These two rare cases highlight that emergency exploratory laparotomy is the cornerstone of Richter hernia management in resource-limited conditions.

                Liver transplantation is the ultimate therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease. The clinical management of transplant patients significantly impacts their prognosis, with outcomes influenced by multiple interacting variables. Cardiovascular complications count as a leading cause of both short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients. In this respect, accurate risk assessment and stratification are crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significant potential for early risk prediction, providing comprehensive risk assessments in both diagnosed cohorts and early clinical phase patients. This systematic review examines the state of the art in AI applications for predicting cardiovascular risks in liver transplantation, identifying current issues, challenges, and future research directions. We reviewed articles from digital repositories such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect published between 2000 and 2023, using keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, cardiovascular, and liver transplantation. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of machine learning algorithms used in this domain. Despite the potential, only 12 papers met the criteria for adequate topic coverage, highlighting a scarcity of research at this intersection. Key challenges include integrating diverse datasets, isolating cardiovascular effects amid multifaceted influences, ensuring data quality and quantity, and the issues to extrapolate machine learning models to day-to-day clinical practice. Nevertheless, leveraging AI for risk prediction in liver transplantation could significantly enhance patient management and resource optimization, indicating a shift towards more personalized and effective medical practices.

                Background Statistical process control (SPC) is utiled in manufacturing and service applications. It is used to monitor the behavior of the process, also to discover and solve the issues in internal systems. SPC allows immediate corrective actions to prevent defects and maintain process stability. There are two types of control charts are available in the literature: variable control charts and attribute control charts. Methods The use of attribute control charts for two positively skewed distributions such as power function distribution and weighted power function distribution is discussed in this research paper. We compared the behavior of both types of control charts and presented the results in form of tables. Results We conclude that control charts under a weighted power function distribution perform better than control charts using a power function distribution. Furthermore, these results will help in the early detection of errors that enhance the process reliability of the telecommunications and financing industries.

                Background Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) at home might be an alternative choice to identify optimal treatment pressure for OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment. Data on the association of effective treatment pressure between laboratory polysomnography (in-lab PSG) and home APAP has been limited. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of effective CPAP pressure between in-lab PSG and home APAP. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted. OSA participants aged 18 years or older who required CPAP therapy were included. Patients underwent in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration to identify an effective treatment pressure. Patients also underwent APAP at home for 2 weeks to identify 95 percentile treatment pressure as an effective pressure. Results Fifty OSA patients (82% male) were included. Mean age was 48.9±14.6 years. Body mass index was 28.7±6.1 kg/m2. Polysomnographic data showed the effective treatment pressure of 10.4±2.9 cmH2O and the apnea-hypopnea index was 55.1±29.0 events/hour. Severe OSA was 76%. Home APAP data showed effective treatment pressure of 10.8±1.8 cmH2O. There was positive correlation of effective pressure between home APAP and in-lab PSG (r=0.472, P=0.001). The equation for predicting an in-lab effective pressure was: predicted pressure (cmH2O) = 2 + (home APAP ⁎ 0.78). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of -0.428 cmH2O and 96% within the limit of agreement. Conclusions Home APAP pressure is moderately positively correlated with in-lab PSG effective pressure. The accuracy of home APAP is in agreement with in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration. This APAP might be able to determine an effective therapeutic pressure in the sleep laboratory for OSA treatment.

                Background Sexual violence is prevalent in higher education institutions in Nigeria and stakeholders have encouraged staff and students to blow the whistle whenever they fall victim to or are aware of any sexual violence case. However, there is lack of data about whether the staff and students of these institutions have the intention to blow the whistle internally (within the institution) or not. There is also a lack of data on the existing reporting mechanisms or preferred whistleblowing mechanisms in these institutions. These have hindered the analysis of stakeholders’ opinions on this topic. Methods This data note presents a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data set collected from staff and students of three categories of government owned higher education institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education) in Nigeria. Data collection was between February and December, 2021, during which quantitative data were collected from 21,937 students and 3,108 staff. Qualitatively, 138 students and 111 staff participated in a total of 35 focus group discussion sessions. The study provides unique information on respondents’ attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norm to sexual violence whistleblowing. It also provides information on self-reported sexual violence experiences, whistleblowing intention, reporting systems in higher institutions and the preferred sexual violence whistleblowing mechanisms. Conclusions In this data note, we provide a detailed account of the variables in the dataset and then highlight the potential of this study to contribute to improved sexual violence reporting in higher education institutions, thereby reducing the occurrence of the social menace.

                Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, apathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Method A systematic search was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework with studies published on leisure-based intervention from January 1990 to December 2023. Results The review included 11 articles in the study. In total two studies were pilot interventional study, one randomized controlled study, one case-control, one retrospective study, three were cross sectional, one was cross sectional longitudinal study and two were qualitative in nature. Studies used different types of leisure activities like cooking group, discussions, board games, arts and craft, painting, beading, sewing, clay work, paper craft, etc were used as an intervention. Qualitative studies found that individuals with schizophrenia spent less time in social and leisure activities and more time relaxing and doing nothing. Conclusion The study highlights the need to conduct further research on leisure-based interventions using various study designs like randomized controlled trials and mixed methods to understand its effectiveness among individuals with schizophrenia.

                Background: Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening disease characterized by diffuse bilateral cellulitis with an odontogenic origin. This unique infection is now rare owing to the antibiotic era. Case: This patient presented to the emergency room with trismus, jaw and neck swelling, mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, hyperthermia, and panic. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. As it is a quickly spreading infection, the patient was taken up for immediate surgical decompression leading to pus drainage, removal of the offending tooth, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and administration of empirical antibiotics. As we had operated promptly, there was no need for emergency airway intervention, and the patient had immediate relief from airway distress. Conclusions: Early accurate diagnosis with conservative surgical decompression, thereby negating the need for airway intervention, was vital to avoiding mortality which is always possible in such an expeditious infection.

                Background For more than 150 years, dental amalgam (DA) has been popular as a dental restorative material. Many organizations oppose its use due to perceived toxicity and environmental concerns. Hence, this study aimed to explore the continued use of DA from a South Indian dental practitioners’ perspective. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among fifty-two private and public dental practitioners of Udupi district in Southern India. A self‑administered questionnaire was distributed, that involved assessment of their preferences, continuation of use and concerns of using DA as a restorative material. The percentage contribution of each variable was calculated. Preferences for continuation of use of silver amalgam based upon the age, experience and mercury toxicity as a risk factor were analyzed using Students-t test and Fisher’s Exact Test test. Results Most dentists were satisfied (87%) with the results of the DA, found minimal failures (96%) and found DA more economical (89%). More than half (54%) of the participants reported that they would not continue the use of DA owing to mercury toxicity and environmental concerns. Dentists with higher age and longer clinical experience preferred continuation of DA. Conclusions Despite satisfaction with DA for its minimal failure, longevity and affordability, the authors found that most practitioners did not prefer its continued usage. This highlights their concerns over mercury toxicity and soft tissue lesions and accentuates their community social responsibility. There is also an urgent need to educate dentists on mercury hygiene, mercury waste management and disposal.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 56.6% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 18.1% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.

                Changes in pupil size offer a rich, continuous, and integrated neurophysiological readout of attention and cognition. I here briefly reintroduce examples of a vast, forgotten literature, full of inspiring ideas, which described attentional modulations of pupil size decades earlier than often assumed. I outline parallels between these early studies and recent developments in pupillometry.

                Hirsch et al. subjected primary human CD8 T cells to IRF4 overexpression or knockout and assessed T cell functions and the transcriptome. The TCR-induced transcription factor IRF4 promotes proliferation and PD-1 expression but hampers effector functions and expression of NF-κB-regulated genes. They also compared CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to activated T cells in patients with COVID-19.

                Nishizawa et al. discover that the transcription factor BACH1 induces ferroptosis and suppresses cellular senescence in surrounding cells by secreting FGF21 from ferroptotic cells. Additionally, they find that BACH1-induced ferroptotic FGF21 secretion contributes to obesity suppression and longevity in vivo.

                Liu et al. find a mechanism deployed by cells to respond to ER stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) selectively down-regulates a subunit of the signal recognition particle, SRP14. This causes a decrease of protein translocation into the ER lumen, thus reducing ER burden to alleviate cellular stress.

                Cellular stress may contribute to neurodegeneration. Huang et al. demonstrate that stress-induced nuclear condensation of the neurodegeneration-linked TDP-43 protein causes its transient inactivation and loss of function in splicing. Although these changes are reversible, some TDP-43 splicing targets, e.g., STMN2, recover slowly, rendering them prone to misregulation under chronic stress.

">Highly synchronized inhibition from Purkinje cells entrains cerebellar output in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar function, known to be important for motor learning and motor coordination, is mediated by efferent neurons that project to diverse motor areas. To understand cerebellar function, it is imperative to study how these efferent neurons integrate inputs from the principal neurons of the cerebellar cortex, the inhibitory Purkinje neurons (PNs). In zebrafish, PNs are bistable and we show here that bistability influences spike synchrony among PNs. Bistability also alters spike correlation with motor bouts. We asked how PN population synchrony influences Eurydendroid cells (ECs), which are postsynaptic targets of PNs and are the cerebellar efferent cells in zebrafish. Using optogenetics, we artificially modulated population synchrony of PNs over millisecond time scales and showed that under conditions of high synchrony, EC firing is briefly suppressed and entrained by PN spiking. However, the magnitude of such modulation is relatively small and indicates a strong combined influence of other synaptic inputs on EC spiking.

">Providing context: Extracting non-linear and dynamic temporal motifs from brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Approaches studying the dynamics of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) activity often focus on time-resolved functional connectivity (tr-FC). While many approaches have been proposed, these typically focus on linear approaches like computing the linear correlation at a timestep or within a window. In this work, we propose to use a generative non-linear deep learning model, a disentangled variational autoencoder (DSVAE), that factorizes out window-specific (context) information from timestep-specific (local) information. This has the advantage of allowing our model to capture differences at multiple temporal scales. For the timestep-specific scale, which has higher temporal precision, we find significant differences between schizophrenia patients and control subjects in their temporal step distance through our model's latent space. We also find that window-specific embeddings, or as we refer to them, context embeddings, more accurately separate windows from schizophrenia patients and control subjects than the standard tr-FC approach. Moreover, we find that for individuals with schizophrenia, our model's context embedding space is significantly correlated with both age and symptom severity. Interestingly, patients appear to spend more time in three clusters, one closer to controls which shows increased visual-sensorimotor, cerebellar-subcortical, and reduced cerebellar-sensorimotor functional network connectivity (FNC), an intermediate station showing increased subcortical-sensorimotor FNC, and one that shows decreased visual-sensorimotor, decreased subcortical-sensorimotor, and increased visual-subcortical domains. We verify that our model captures features that are complementary to - but not the same as - standard tr-FC features. Our model can thus help broaden the neuroimaging toolset in analyzing fMRI dynamics and shows potential as an approach for finding psychiatric links that are more sensitive to individual and group characteristics.

">Distinct dopaminergic spike-timing-dependent plasticity rules are suited to different functional roles</a></h4>

              
                Various mathematical models have been formulated to describe the changes in synaptic strengths resulting from spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). A subset of these models include a third factor, dopamine, which interacts with the timing of pre- and postsynaptic spiking to contribute to plasticity at specific synapses, notably those from cortex to striatum at the input layer of the basal ganglia. Theoretical work to analyze these plasticity models has largely focused on abstract issues, such as the conditions under which they may promote synchronization and the weight distributions induced by inputs with simple correlation structures, rather than on scenarios associated with specific tasks, and has generally not considered dopamine-dependent forms of STDP. In this paper, we analyze, mathematically and with simulations, three forms of dopamine-modulated STDP in three scenarios that are relevant to corticostriatal synapses. Two of the models considered comprise previously proposed STDP rules with modifications to incorporate dopamine, while the third is a corticostriatal dopamine-dependent STDP rule adapted from a similar one already in the literature. We test the ability of each of the three models to maintain its weights in the face of noise and to complete simple reward prediction and action selection tasks, studying the learned weight distributions and corresponding task performance in each setting. Interestingly, we find that each of the three plasticity rules is well suited to a subset of the scenarios studied but falls short in others. These results show that different tasks may require different forms of synaptic plasticity, yielding the prediction that the precise form of the STDP mechanism may vary across regions of the striatum, and other brain areas impacted by dopamine, that are involved in distinct computational functions.

">A functional network model for body column neural connectivity in Hydra</a></h4>

              
                Hydra is a non-senescent animal with a relatively small number of cell types and overall low structural complexity, but a surprisingly rich behavioral repertoire. The main drivers of Hydra's behavior are neurons that are arranged in two nerve nets comprising several distinct neuronal populations. Among these populations is the ectodermal nerve net N3 which is located throughout the animal. It has been shown that N3 is necessary and sufficient for the complex behavior of somersaulting and is also involved in Hydra feeding behavior. Despite being a behavioral jack-of-all-trades, there is insufficient knowledge on the coupling structure of neurons in N3, its connectome, and its role in activity propagation and function. We construct a model connectome for the part of N3 located on the body column. Using experimental data on the placement of neuronal somata and the spatial dimensions of the body column, we show that a generative network model combining non-random placement of neuronal somata and the preferred orientation of primary neurites yields good agreement with experimentally observed distributions of connection distances, connection angles, and the number of primary neurites per neuron. Having validated the N3 connectome model in this fashion, we place a simple excitable dynamical model on each node of the body column network and show that it generates directed, short-lived, fast propagating patterns of activity. In addition, by slightly changing the parameters of the dynamical model, the same structural network can also generate persistent activity. Finally, we use a neuromorphic circuit based on the Morris-Lecar model to show that the same structural connectome can, in addition to through-conductance with biologically plausible time scales, also host a dynamical pattern related to the complex behavioral pattern of somersaulting. We speculate that such different dynamical regimes act as dynamical substrates for the different functional roles of N3, allowing Hydra to exhibit behavioral complexity with a relatively simple nervous system that does not possess modules or hubs.

">Hypothalamic prostaglandins facilitate recovery from hypoglycemia but exacerbate recurrent hypoglycemia in mice</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamus regulates systemic glucose metabolism by monitoring glucose levels. In response to hypoglycemia, glucose-inhibited (GI) neurons promote counter-regulatory responses (CRRs) stimulating glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol secretions. Recurrent hypoglycemia (RH) attenuates CRRs. Here, we show that prostaglandins are produced in the hypothalamus during hypoglycemia to activate GI neurons and thus increase glucagon secretion. RH attenuated glucose production by decreasing glucagon secretion. RH caused a metabolic adaptation and preserved intermediates of glycolysis and amino acids in the hypothalamus during hypoglycemia. Inhibition of prostaglandin production by using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) against cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in the hypothalamus decreased the attenuation of CRRs by RH. CRR hormones and the activity of GI neurons were not changed in the shRNA-treated group. Our data suggest that hypothalamic prostaglandins are critical for recovering from acute hypoglycemia by affecting glucose-sensing neurons. Hypothalamic prostaglandins are also essential to develop an attenuation of CRRs during RH.

                Brain recordings collected at different resolutions support statistically distinct signatures of information processing, leading to scale-dependent theories of brain function. Here, we demonstrate that these disparate neural-coding signatures emerge from the same multiscale functional organisation of neuronal activity across calcium-imaging recordings collected from the whole brains of zebrafish and nematode, as well as sensory regions of the fly, mouse, and macaque brain. Network simulations show that hierarchical-modular structural connectivity facilitates multiscale functional coordination, enhancing information processing benefits such as a maximal dynamic range. Finally, we demonstrate that this cross-scale organisation supports distinct behavioural states across species by reconfiguring functional affiliation and temporal dynamics at the mesoscale. Our findings suggest that self-similar scaling of neuronal activity is a universal principle that reconciles scale-dependent theories of brain function, facilitating both efficiency and resiliency while enabling significant reconfiguration of mesoscale cellular ensembles to accommodate behavioural demands.

">Food and water uptake are regulated by distinct central amygdala circuits revealed using intersectional genetics</a></h4>

              
                The central amygdala (CeA) plays a crucial role in defensive and appetitive behaviours. It contains genetically defined GABAergic neuron subpopulations distributed over three anatomical subregions, capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), and medial (CeM). The roles that these molecularly- and anatomically- defined CeA neurons play in appetitive behavior remain unclear. Using intersectional genetics, we found that neurons driving food or water consumption are confined to the CeM. Separate CeM subpopulations exist for water only versus water or food consumption. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that CeMHtr2a neurons promoting feeding are responsive towards appetitive cues with little regard for their physical attributes. CeMSst neurons involved in drinking are sensitive to the physical properties of salient stimuli. Both CeM subtypes receive inhibitory input from CeL and send projections to the parabrachial nucleus to promote appetitive behavior. These results suggest that distinct CeM microcircuits evaluate liquid and solid appetitive stimuli to drive the appropriate behavioral responses.

">Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 protein expression profile in the adult mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) is a multifunctional signaling protein that serves as a natural suppressor of synaptic plasticity in the mouse brain. Our previous studies showed that RGS14 is highly expressed in postsynaptic dendrites and spines of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 of the developing mouse brain. However, our more recent work with adult rhesus macaque brain shows that RGS14 is found in multiple neuron populations throughout hippocampal area CA1 and CA2, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and amygdala in the adult rhesus monkey brain. In the mouse brain, we also have observed RGS14 protein in discrete limbic regions linked to reward behavior and addiction, including the central amygdala and the nucleus accumbens, but a comprehensive mapping of RGS14 protein expression in the adult mouse brain is lacking. Here, we report that RGS14 is more broadly expressed in mouse brain than previously known. Intense RGS14 staining is observed in specific neuron populations of the hippocampal formation, amygdala, septum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis and ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens. RGS14 is also observed in axon fiber tracts including the dorsal fornix, fimbria, stria terminalis, and the ventrohippocampal commissure. Moderate RGS14 staining is observed in various other adjacent regions not previously reported. These findings show that RGS14 is expressed in brain regions that govern aspects of core cognitive functions such as sensory perception, emotion, memory, motivation, and execution of actions, and suggests that RGS14 may serve to suppress plasticity and filter inputs in these brain regions to set the overall tone on experience-to-action processes.

">ComBatLS: A location- and scale-preserving method for multi-site image harmonization</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has leveraged massive datasets and advanced harmonization methods to construct normative models of neuroanatomical features and benchmark individuals' morphology. However, current harmonization tools do not preserve the effects of biological covariates including sex and age on features' variances; this failure may induce error in normative scores, particularly when such factors are distributed unequally across sites. Here, we introduce a new extension of the popular ComBat harmonization method, ComBatLS, that preserves biological variance in features' locations and scales. We use UK Biobank data to show that ComBatLS robustly replicates individuals' normative scores better than other ComBat methods when subjects are assigned to sex-imbalanced synthetic "sites". Additionally, we demonstrate that ComBatLS significantly reduces sex biases in normative scores compared to traditional methods. Finally, we show that ComBatLS successfully harmonizes consortium data collected across over 50 studies. R implementation of ComBatLS is available at https://github.com/andy1764/ComBatFamily.

">Forelimb motor recovery by modulating extrinsic and intrinsic signaling as well as neuronal activity after the cervical spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Singular strategies for promoting axon regeneration and motor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) have been attempted with limited success. Here, we propose the combinatorial approach of deleting extrinsic and intrinsic factors paired with neural stimulation, will enhance adaptive axonal growth and motor recovery after SCI. We previously showed the deletion of RhoA and Pten in corticospinal neurons inhibits axon dieback and promotes axon sprouting after lumbar SCI. Here, we examined the effects of RhoA;Pten deletion coupled with neural stimulation after cervical SCI. This combinatorial approach promoted more boutons on injured corticospinal neurons in the spinal cord compared to sole RhoA;Pten deletion. Although RhoA;Pten deletion does not promote motor recovery in the forelimb after SCI, stimulating corticospinal neurons in those mice results in partial motor recovery. These results demonstrate that a combinatorial approach that pairs genetic modifications with neuronal stimulation can promote axon sprouting and motor recovery following SCI.

">Highly effective verified lucid dream induction using combined cognitive-sensory training and wearable EEG: a multi-centre study</a></h4>

              
                The state of becoming aware that one is dreaming within an ongoing dream, referred to as lucid dreaming (LD), can occur spontaneously. Yet, since the occurrence of spontaneous LD is relatively rare, various methods have been proposed to induce LD. Existing scientific literature, however, has been constrained by either small sample sizes with limited generalizability, or by reliance on subjective measures without physiological signals. To address these limitations, we recorded verifiable LD using 2-channel EEG and an open-source dream engineering toolbox (Dreamento) in a large sample size of 60 participants collected across a multi-center study in the Netherlands (NL), Italy (IT), and Canada (CA). We employed a novel combination of the senses-initiated lucid dreaming (SSILD) method and a targeted lucidity reactivation (TLR) protocol. Our final sample consists of 60 participants who came twice to the lab for morning naps with a pre-sleep lucidity training paired with multimodal sensory cues (visual, auditory, tactile). Cues were presented again in REM sleep in one of the two naps (stimulation and sham conditions counterbalanced). This preprint reports results from NL and IT in 40 participants: we successfully induced signal-verified lucid dreams (SVLD) in 65% and 45% of NL and IT participants, respectively. Among these, 45% and 35% (NL and IT) of REM cueing and 35% and 15% (NL and IT) of REM sham sessions resulted in at least one SVLD. In NL, the REM cueing sessions yielded 37 predefined eye signals with an average continuously verified lucidity duration of 78.75 +- 54.85 s. The REM sham sessions resulted in 15 eye signals in the presence of LD report (i.e, SVLD) and had an average duration of 47.80 +- 22.49 s. In IT, 48 predefined eye signals were identified within REM cueing sessions, with an average overall duration (i.e., from the first to the last predefined eye signal) of 506.33 +- 643.73 s and an average continuously verified (consecutive eye signals) duration of 91.13 +- 70.87 s. In contrast, 10 predefined eye signals were identified during REM sham sessions, with an average overall duration of 546.5 +- 744.58 s and a single continuously verified episode that lasted 20 s. Preliminary findings suggest that REM cueing aids the initiation and maintenance of lucidity, facilitates objective estimation of LD duration, and increases dream control. Future research should focus on automating the tools we provided and conducting larger-scale fully automatised studies at home to further explore factors contributing to such high success rates.

">Interplay of Long- and Short-term Synaptic Plasticity in a Spiking Network Model of Rat's Episodic Memory</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the interaction of long-term episodic processes with effects of short-term dynamics of recency. This work takes inspiration from a seminal experimental work involving an odor-in-context association task conducted on rats (Panoz-Brown et al., 2016). In the experimental task, rats were presented with odor pairs in two arenas serving as old or new contexts for specific odors-items. Rats were rewarded for selecting the odor that was new to the current context. New odor items were deliberately presented with higher recency relative to old items, so that episodic memory was put in conflict with non-episodic recency effects. To study our hypothesis about the major role of synaptic interplay of long- and short-term plasticity phenomena in explaining rats' performance in such episodic memory tasks, we built a computational spiking model consisting of two reciprocally connected networks that stored contextual and odor information as consolidated and distributed memory patterns (cell assemblies). We induced context-item coupling between the two networks using Bayesian-Hebbian plasticity with eligibility traces to account for reward based learning. We first reproduced quantitatively and explained mechanistically the findings of the experimental study, and further simulated alternative tasks, e.g. where old odor items were instead encoded with higher recency, thus synergistically confounding episodic memory with effects of recency. Our model predicted that higher recency of old items enhances item-in-context memory by boosting the activations of old items resulting in further enhancement of memory performance. We argue that the model offers a computational framework for studying behavioral implications of the synaptic underpinning of different memory effects in experimental episodic memory paradigms.

">Causal Cortical and Thalamic Connections in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                The brain's functional architecture is intricately shaped by causal connections between its cortical and subcortical structures. Here, we studied 27 participants with 4864 electrodes implanted across the anterior, mediodorsal, and pulvinar thalamic regions, and the cortex. Using data from electrical stimulation procedures and a data-driven approach informed by neurophysiological standards, we dissociated three unique spectral patterns generated by the perturbation of a given brain area. Among these, a novel waveform emerged, marked by delayed-onset slow oscillations in both ipsilateral and contralateral cortices following thalamic stimulations, suggesting a mechanism by which a thalamic site can influence bilateral cortical activity. Moreover, cortical stimulations evoked earlier signals in the thalamus than in other connected cortical areas suggesting that the thalamus receives a copy of signals before they are exchanged across the cortex. Our causal connectivity data can be used to inform biologically-inspired computational models of the functional architecture of the brain.

">Post-retrieval noradrenergic activation impairs subsequent memory depending on cortico-hippocampal reactivation</a></h4>

              
                When retrieved, seemingly stable memories can become sensitive to modification through significant events, such as acute stress. While memory dynamics after retrieval have profound implications, for instance, in eyewitness testimony or aberrant memory in mental disorders, the mechanisms underlying these dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we show in healthy humans that increases in noradrenaline after memory retrieval impairs subsequent remembering, depending on hippocampal and cortical reactivation during retrieval. In a three-day fMRI study, we measured brain activity during initial encoding (Day 1), 24h-delayed memory cueing accompanied by administration of placebo, hydrocortisone, or the 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (Day 2), and final recall, 24h later (Day 3). While post-retrieval hydrocortisone did not affect subsequent memory (i.e., final recall), the impairing effect of yohimbine on final recall depended on the strength of hippocampal reactivation and category-level reinstatement in ventral temporal cortex during Day 2 retrieval. Notably, the effect of yohimbine on subsequent memory was contingent specifically on the neural reactivation during retrieval. While patterns from online reactivation were also reinstated in the post-retrieval rest-period, this offline reinstatement did not interact with the pharmacological manipulation. Additionally, the original memory trace from encoding was not significantly reactivated during retrieval and not reinstated offline during rest, further supporting the critical dependency of post-retrieval manipulations on the neural signal emerging during retrieval-related reactivation. Our findings demonstrate that, depending on the neural reactivation of memories, noradrenergic arousal after retrieval can alter the future accessibility of consolidated memories.

">Pregnancy History and Estradiol Influence Spatial Memory, Hippocampal Plasticity, and Inflammation in Middle-aged Rats</a></h4>

              
                Pregnancy and motherhood (parity) can have long-term effects on cognition and brain aging in both humans and rodents. Estrogens are related to cognitive function and neuroplasticity. Estrogens can improve cognition in postmenopausal women, but the evidence is mixed, in part due to differences in hormone therapy dose and composition. In addition, past pregnancy influences brain aging and cognition, with earlier age of first pregnancy being associated with poorer outcomes with aging. However, few studies have examined specific features of pregnancy history such as the age of first pregnancy or the possible mechanisms underlying these changes. We examined whether maternal age at first pregnancy and estradiol treatment differentially affected hippocampal neuroplasticity, inflammation, activation, and cognition in middle-age. Thirteen-month-old rats (who were nulliparous (never mothered) or previously primiparous (had a litter) at 3 months or 7 months) received daily injections of estradiol (or sesame oil vehicle) for sixteen days and were tested on the Morris Water Maze. An older age of first pregnancy was associated with impaired spatial memory but improved performance on reversal training, and increased new neurons in the ventral hippocampus compared to the other groups. Estradiol decreased total activation and percent activation of new neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, regardless of parity history. Estradiol also decreased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines based on age of first pregnancy. This work suggests that estradiol affects neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation in middle age, and that pregnancy history can have long lasting effects on hippocampus structure and function.

                Reduction of amyloid beta (Abeta) has been shown to be effective in treating Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but the underlying assumption that neurons are the main source of pathogenic Abeta; is untested. Here we challenge this prevailing belief by demonstrating that oligodendrocytes are an important source of Abeta, and play a key role in promoting abnormal neuronal hyperactivity in AD. We show that selectively suppressing oligodendrocyte Abeta production improves AD brain pathology and restores neuronal function in vivo. Our findings suggest that targeting oligodendrocyte Abeta production could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating AD.

">Confirmation Bias through Selective Use of Evidence in Human Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Decision-makers often process new evidence selectively, depending on their current beliefs about the world. We asked whether such confirmation biases result from biases in the encoding of sensory evidence in the brain, or alternatively in the utilization of encoded evidence for behavior. Human participants estimated the source of a sequence of visual-spatial evidence samples while we measured cortical population activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Halfway through the sequence, participants were prompted to judge the more likely source category. Their processing of subsequent evidence depended on its consistency with the previously chosen category, but the encoding of evidence in cortical activity did not. Instead, the encoded evidence in parietal and primary visual cortex contributed less to the estimation report when that evidence was inconsistent with the previous choice. We conclude that confirmation bias originates from the way in which decision-makers utilize information encoded in the brain. This provides room for deliberative control.

">Amygdala-predominant α-synuclein pathology exacerbates hippocampal neuron loss in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Misfolded -synuclein (Syn) protein accumulates in 43-63% of individuals with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two main patterns of co-morbid Syn pathology have been identified: caudo-rostral and amygdala-predominant, with the latter being more common in AD. Syn pathology has been shown to interact with DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau). These proteins tend to accumulate in the amygdala, yet the specific role of amygdala-predominant Syn pathology in the progression of AD and hippocampal degeneration remains unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 291 autopsy brains from both demented and non-demented elderly individuals neuropathologically. Neuronal density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was assessed using hematoxylin-stained sections for all cases. We semi-quantitatively evaluated Syn pathology severity in six brain regions and stratified the cases into the two spreading patterns. In 99 AD cases, we assessed limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 neuropathological changes (LATE-NC), CA1 pTau density, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Structural equation modeling analysis was conducted based on the assessed pathological parameters in AD patients. We identified an association between the amygdala-predominant Syn pathology pattern and decreased neuronal density in the CA1 region. AD patients with an amygdala-predominant Syn pattern exhibited the most severe pTDP-43 pathology among all groups, while those with the caudo-rostral pattern had the lowest severity of AD-related pathological changes including CAA type 1. Our model revealed that the relationship between Syn pathology and CA1 neuron loss is mediated through pTau and LATE-NC. Our results indicate that amygdala-predominant Syn pathology, in contrast to Syn pathology with a caudo-rostral pattern, significantly contributes to hippocampal neuron loss, potentially by accelerating TDP-43 and pTau pathologies. This finding, along with observed neuropathological differences between AD patients with these two Syn spreading patterns, underscores the need for precise stratification of patients. The stratification should consider the molecular and morphological identity of co-pathologies and the distribution pattern of the respective co-pathologies.

	<p>Dyslexia is a common learning disorder that hinders reading fluency and comprehension. Traditional treatments can be tedious for children, limiting their effectiveness. This study investigated the one-year effects of rehabilitation treatment with a virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) on children with dyslexia. Twenty-four children were divided into control (CG) and experimental (EG) groups. The CG underwent conventional neuropsychological treatment (CNT), while the EG underwent VR neurorehabilitation training (VRNT) using the VRRS. Neuropsychological evaluation was conducted before treatment, after six months, and again after one year for both groups. Compared to the control group, children who received VR training showed significant improvement in reading skills, especially in non-word reading and reading speed, even after one year without further VR intervention. VRRS can improve treatment adherence and minimize symptoms by offering engaging activities for children. These findings suggest VRRS may be a valuable tool for dyslexia rehabilitation with long-lasting effects.</p>

	<p>Sleep and brain/cognitive/neural reserve significantly impact well-being and cognition throughout life. This review aims to explore the intricate relationship between such factors, with reference to their effects on human cognitive functions. The specific goal is to understand the bidirectional influence that sleep and reserve exert on each other. Up to 6 February 2024, a methodical search of the literature was conducted using the PubMed database with terms related to brain, cognitive or neural reserve, and healthy or disturbed sleep. Based on the inclusion criteria, 11 articles were selected and analyzed for this review. The articles focus almost exclusively on cognitive reserve, with no explicit connection between sleep and brain or neural reserve. The results evidence sleep&amp;amp;rsquo;s role as a builder of cognitive reserve and cognitive reserve&amp;amp;rsquo;s role as a moderator in the effects of physiological and pathological sleep on cognitive functions. In conclusion, the findings of the present review support the notion that both sleep and cognitive reserve are critical factors in cognitive functioning. Deepening comprehension of the interactions between them is essential for devising strategies to enhance brain health and resilience against age- and pathology-related conditions.</p>

	<p>Somatosensory tactile experience is a key aspect of our interaction with the environment. It is involved in object manipulation, in the planning and control of actions and, in its affective components, in the relationships with other individuals. It is also a foundational component of body awareness. An intriguing aspect of sensory perception in general and tactile perception in particular is the way in which stimulation comes to consciousness. Indeed, although being aware of something seems a rather self-evident and monolithic aspect of our mental states, sensory awareness may be in fact modulated by many different processes that impact on the mere stimulation of the skin, including the way in which we perceive our bodies as belonging to us. In this review, we first took into consideration the pathological conditions of absence of phenomenal experience of touch, in the presence of implicit processing, as initial models for understanding the neural bases of conscious tactile experience. Subsequently, we discussed cases of tactile illusions both in normal subjects and in brain-damaged patients which help to understand which high-order processes impact tactile awareness. Finally, we discussed the observations reported in the review in light of some influential models of touch and body representation.</p>

	<p>Background: Specific phobias impact over 400 million people worldwide. Digitalizing mental health could alleviate the burden. Still, although the corporate-driven Metaverse is expanding rapidly, there needs to be more momentum in harnessing virtual reality exposure therapy uptake. Objective: This study aims to conceptualize, develop, and deploy a free Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) application specifically designed for treating acrophobia and claustrophobia. This pilot study, which holds the promise of a future where mental health is more accessible and effective, explores the feasibility of leveraging transdisciplinary collaboration among specialists to create a safe, accessible, and effective VRET solution. Methods: We conducted a Delphi heuristic approach involving bioethicists, neuroscientists, and tech developers. Second, we reviewed the existing psychological theories and therapeutic strategies for addressing phobias in VR. Third, we conceptualized a thematic analysis-derived framework for a safe, adaptive-gamified free exposure to virtual reality acrophobia and claustrophobia (SAFEvR ACT). Finally, we provide an overview of the iterative improvements made during 12 workshops and 76 weekly briefings on developmental implementations. Results: We developed the SAFEvR ACT into a proof-of-concept application freely deployed on the MentalVerse app platform. Our safety-focused approach can benefit from prevalidation perspectives within future randomized control trials. Conclusions: The resulting application derived from the SAFEvR ACT framework represents a blueprint to counter the current lack of iVR mental health uptake by offering a free VRET alternative. Future research should aim towards developing similar free platforms to lessen mental health burdens and gather quantitative data. We conclude with a call to action to researchers to fine-tune our current approach and take a stand for free digital mental health within MentalVeRse.app.</p>

	<p>Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively healthy aging and dementia, are characterized by subtle neurocognitive changes. Clinically, they can be grouped into two main variants, namely patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). The distinction of the two variants is known to be clinically significant as they exhibit different progression rates to dementia. However, it has been particularly challenging to classify the two variants robustly. Recent research indicates that linguistic changes may manifest as one of the early indicators of pathology. Therefore, we focused on MCI&amp;amp;rsquo;s discourse-level writing samples in this study. We hypothesized that a written picture description task can provide information that can be used as an ecological, cost-effective classification system between the two variants. We included one hundred sixty-nine individuals diagnosed with either aMCI or naMCI who received neurophysiological evaluations in addition to a short, written picture description task. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a BERT pre-trained language model were utilized to analyze the writing samples. We showed that the written picture description task provided 90% overall classification accuracy for the best classification models, which performed better than cognitive measures. Written discourses analyzed by AI models can automatically assess individuals with aMCI and naMCI and facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, therapy planning, and evaluation.</p>

	<p>Spinal cord epidural electrical stimulation (EES) has been successfully employed to treat chronic pain and to restore lost functions after spinal cord injury. Yet, the efficacy of this approach is largely challenged by the suboptimal spatial distribution of the electrode contacts across anatomical targets, limiting the spatial selectivity of stimulation. In this study, we exploited different ESS paradigms, designed as either Spatial-Selective Stimulation (SSES) or Orientation-Selective Epidural Stimulation (OSES), and compared them to Conventional Monopolar Epidural Stimulation (CMES). SSES, OSES, and CMES were delivered with a 3- or 4-contact electrode array. Amplitudes and latencies of the Spinally Evoked Motor Potentials (SEMPs) were evaluated with different EES modalities. The results demonstrate that the amplitudes of SEMPs in hindlimb muscles depend on the orientation of the electrical field and vary between stimulation modalities. These findings show that the electric field applied with SSES or OSES provides more selective control of amplitudes of the SEMPs as compared to CMES. We demonstrate that spinal cord epidural stimulation applied with SSES or OSES paradigms in the rodent model could be tailored to the functional spinal cord neuroanatomy and can be tuned to specific target fibers and their orientation, optimizing the effect of neuromodulation.</p>

	<p>Gene expression alterations in postmortem schizophrenia tissue are well-documented and are influenced by genetic, medication, and epigenetic factors. The Wingless/Integrated (WNT) signaling pathway, critical for cell growth and development, is involved in various cellular processes including neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. Despite its importance, WNT signaling remains understudied in schizophrenia, a disorder characterized by metabolic and bioenergetic defects in cortical regions. In this study, we examined the gene expression of 10 key WNT signaling pathway transcripts: IQGAP1, CTNN&amp;amp;beta;1, GSK3&amp;amp;beta;, FOXO1, LRP6, MGEA5, TCF4, &amp;amp;beta;TRC, PPP1C&amp;amp;beta;, and DVL2 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using postmortem tissue from schizophrenia subjects (n = 20, 10 males, 10 females) compared to age, pH, and postmortem interval (PMI)-matched controls (n = 20, 10 males, 10 females). Employing the R-shiny application Kaleidoscope, we conducted in silico &amp;amp;ldquo;lookup&amp;amp;rdquo; studies from published transcriptomic datasets to examine cell- and region-level expression of these WNT genes. In addition, we investigated the impact of antipsychotics on the mRNA expression of the WNT genes of interest in rodent brain transcriptomic datasets. Our findings revealed no significant changes in region-level WNT transcript expression; however, analyses of previously published cell-level datasets indicated alterations in WNT transcript expression and antipsychotic-specific modulation of certain genes. These results suggest that WNT signaling transcripts may be variably expressed at the cellular level and influenced by antipsychotic treatment, providing novel insights into the role of WNT signaling in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The central nervous system (CNS) exhibits remarkable adaptability throughout life, enabled by intricate interactions between neurons and glial cells, in particular, oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). This adaptability is pivotal for learning and memory, with OLs and OPCs playing a crucial role in neural circuit development, synaptic modulation, and myelination dynamics. Myelination by OLs not only supports axonal conduction but also undergoes adaptive modifications in response to neuronal activity, which is vital for cognitive processing and memory functions. This review discusses how these cellular interactions and myelin dynamics are implicated in various neurocircuit diseases and disorders such as epilepsy, gliomas, and psychiatric conditions, focusing on how maladaptive changes contribute to disease pathology and influence clinical outcomes. It also covers the potential for new diagnostics and therapeutic approaches, including pharmacological strategies and emerging biomarkers in oligodendrocyte functions and myelination processes. The evidence supports a fundamental role for myelin plasticity and oligodendrocyte functionality in synchronizing neural activity and high-level cognitive functions, offering promising avenues for targeted interventions in CNS disorders.</p>

	<p>In this study, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying action anticipation in volleyball players, especially concerned with the differences between experts and amateurs. Participants included both expert (male, N = 26) and amateur (male, N = 23) volleyball players, who were asked to predict spiking movements containing high, medium, and low levels of kinematic information while their electrophysiological activities were recorded. The high-information stimuli included the whole spiking action, the medium-information stimuli ended at 120 ms, and the low-information stimuli ended at 160 ms before hand&amp;amp;ndash;ball contact. The results showed that experts significantly outperformed amateurs in both prediction accuracy (68% in experts vs. 55% in amateurs) and reaction time (475.09 ms in experts vs. 725.81 ms in amateurs) under the medium-information condition. Analysis of alpha rhythm activity revealed that experts exhibited the strongest desynchronization under the low-information condition, suggesting increased attentional engagement. In contrast, amateurs showed the weakest desynchronization under the medium-information condition. Furthermore, mu rhythm activity analysis showed greater desynchronization in the duration of 100&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms before hand&amp;amp;ndash;ball contact for experts, correlating with their higher anticipation accuracy. These findings highlight the significant kinematic information-processing abilities of volleyball experts and elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying efficient attentional engagement and mirroring. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights for the development of targeted training programs through which to enhance athletic performance.</p>

	<p>The insular cortex, a critical hub in the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensory, cognitive, and emotional networks, remains an intriguing subject of study. In this article, we discuss its intricate functional neuroanatomy, emphasizing its pivotal role in processing olfactory information. Through concise exploration, we delve into the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s diverse connectivity and its involvement in sensory integration, particularly in olfaction. Stimulation studies in humans reveal compelling insights into the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s contribution to the perception of smell, hinting at its broader implications for cognitive processing. Additionally, we explore an avenue of research in which studying olfactory processing via insular stimulation could unravel higher-level cognitive processes. This innovative approach could help give a fresh perspective on the interplay between sensory and cognitive domains, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognition and emotion. In conclusion, future research efforts should emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced imaging and surgical techniques to explore the intricate functions of the human insula. Moreover, awake craniotomies could offer a unique opportunity for real-time observation, shedding light on its neural circuitry and contributions to higher-order brain functions. Furthermore, olfaction&amp;amp;rsquo;s direct cortical projection enables precise exploration of insular function, promising insights into cognitive and emotional processes. This multifaceted approach will deepen our understanding of the insular cortex and its significance in human cognition and emotion.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The integration of augmented reality (AR) in spine surgery marks a significant advancement, enhancing surgical precision and patient outcomes. AR provides immersive, three-dimensional visualizations of anatomical structures, facilitating meticulous planning and execution of spine surgeries. This technology not only improves spatial understanding and real-time navigation during procedures but also aims to reduce surgical invasiveness and operative times. Despite its potential, challenges such as model accuracy, user interface design, and the learning curve for new technology must be addressed. AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s application extends beyond the operating room, offering valuable tools for medical education and improving patient communication and satisfaction. Material and methods: A literature review was conducted by searching PubMed and Scopus databases using keywords related to augmented reality in spine surgery, covering publications from January 2020 to January 2024. Results: In total, 319 articles were identified through the initial search of the databases. After screening titles and abstracts, 11 articles in total were included in the qualitative synthesis. Conclusion: Augmented reality (AR) is becoming a transformative force in spine surgery, enhancing precision, education, and outcomes despite hurdles like technical limitations and integration challenges. AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s immersive visualizations and educational innovations, coupled with its potential synergy with AI and machine learning, indicate a bright future for surgical care. Despite the existing obstacles, AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on improving surgical accuracy and safety marks a significant leap forward in patient treatment and care.</p>

                <p>Sleep disruption and impaired synaptic processes are common features in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylated Tau is known to accumulate at neuronal synapses in AD, contributing to synapse dysfunction. However, it remains unclear how sleep disruption and synapse pathology interact to contribute to cognitive decline. Here, we examined sex-specific onset and consequences of sleep loss in AD/tauopathy model PS19 mice. Using a piezoelectric home-cage monitoring system, we showed PS19 mice exhibited early-onset and progressive hyperarousal, a selective dark-phase sleep disruption, apparent at 3 months in females and 6 months in males. Using the Morris water maze test, we report that chronic sleep disruption (CSD) accelerated the onset of decline of hippocampal spatial memory in PS19 males only. Hyperarousal occurs well in advance of robust forebrain synaptic Tau burden that becomes apparent at 6&ndash;9 months. To determine whether a causal link exists between sleep disruption and synaptic Tau hyperphosphorylation, we examined the correlation between sleep behavior and synaptic Tau, or exposed mice to acute or chronic sleep disruption at 6 months. While we confirm that sleep disruption is a driver of Tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons of the locus ceruleus, we were unable to show any causal link between sleep loss and Tau burden in forebrain synapses. Despite the finding that hyperarousal appears earlier in females, female cognition was resilient to the effects of sleep disruption. We conclude sleep disruption interacts with the synaptic Tau burden to accelerate the onset of cognitive decline with greater vulnerability in males.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e0050242024?rss=1">Differential Activation States of Direct Pathway Striatal Output Neurons during L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia Development</a></h4>

              
                <p><scp>l</scp>-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating motor side effect arising from chronic dopamine (DA) replacement therapy with <scp>l</scp>-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. LID is associated with supersensitivity of striatal dopaminergic signaling and fluctuations in synaptic DA following each <scp>l</scp>-DOPA dose, shrinking the therapeutic window. The heterogeneous composition of the striatum, including subpopulations of medium spiny output neurons (MSNs), interneurons, and supporting cells, complicates the identification of cell(s) underlying LID. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to establish a comprehensive striatal transcriptional profile during LID development. Male hemiparkinsonian mice were treated with vehicle or <scp>l</scp>-DOPA for 1, 5, or 10&nbsp;d, and striatal nuclei were processed for snRNA-seq. Analyses indicated a limited population of DA D1 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) formed three subclusters in response to <scp>l</scp>-DOPA treatment and expressed cellular markers of activation. These activated D1-MSNs display similar transcriptional changes previously associated with LID; however, their prevalence and transcriptional behavior were differentially influenced by <scp>l</scp>-DOPA experience. Differentially expressed genes indicated acute upregulation of plasticity-related transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, while repeated <scp>l</scp>-DOPA-induced synaptic remodeling, learning and memory, and transforming growth factor-&beta; (TGF-&beta;) signaling genes. Notably, repeated <scp>l</scp>-DOPA sensitized <I>Inhba</I>, an activin subunit of the TGF-&beta; superfamily, in activated D1-MSNs, and its pharmacological inhibition impaired LID development, suggesting that activin signaling may play an essential role in LID. These data suggest distinct subsets of D1-MSNs become differentially <scp>l</scp>-DOPA-responsive due to aberrant induction of molecular mechanisms necessary for neuronal entrainment, similar to processes underlying hippocampal learning and memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e0240242024?rss=1">Striatal Dopamine Contributions to Skilled Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coordinated multijoint limb and digit movements&mdash;"manual dexterity"&mdash;underlie both specialized skills (e.g., playing the piano) and more mundane tasks (e.g., tying shoelaces). Impairments in dexterous skill cause significant disability, as occurs with motor cortical injury, Parkinson's disease, and a range of other pathologies. Clinical observations, as well as basic investigations, suggest that corticostriatal circuits play a critical role in learning and performing dexterous skills. Furthermore, dopaminergic signaling in these regions is implicated in synaptic plasticity and motor learning. Nonetheless, the role of striatal dopamine signaling in skilled motor learning remains poorly understood. Here, we use fiber photometry paired with a genetically encoded dopamine sensor to investigate striatal dopamine release in both male and female mice as they learn and perform a skilled reaching task. Dopamine rapidly increases during a skilled reach and peaks near pellet consumption. In the dorsolateral striatum, dopamine dynamics are faster than in the dorsomedial and ventral striatum. Across training, as reaching performance improves, dopamine signaling shifts from pellet consumption to cues that predict pellet availability, particularly in medial and ventral areas of the striatum. Furthermore, performance prediction errors are present across the striatum, with reduced dopamine release after an unsuccessful reach. These findings show that dopamine dynamics during skilled motor behaviors change with learning and are differentially regulated across striatal subregions.</p>

                <p>The striatum plays a central role in directing many complex behaviors ranging from motor control to action choice and reward learning. In our study, we used 55 male CFW mice with rapid decay linkage disequilibrium to systematically mine the striatum-related behavioral functional genes by analyzing their striatal transcriptomes and 79 measured behavioral phenotypic data. By constructing a gene coexpression network, we clustered the genes into 13 modules, with most of them being positively correlated with motor traits. Based on functional annotations as well as Fisher's exact and hypergeometric distribution tests, brown and magenta modules were identified as core modules. They were significantly enriched for striatal-related functional genes. Subsequent Mendelian randomization analysis verified the causal relationship between the core modules and dyskinesia. Through the intramodular gene connectivity analysis, <I>Adcy5</I> and <I>Kcnma1</I> were identified as brown and magenta module hub genes, respectively. Knock outs of both <I>Adcy5</I> and <I>Kcnma1</I> lead to motor dysfunction in mice, and <I>KCNMA1</I> acts as a risk gene for schizophrenia and smoking addiction in humans. We also evaluated the cellular composition of each module and identified oligodendrocytes in the striatum to have a positive role in motor regulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e0569242024?rss=1">Impact of Extracellular Current Flow on Action Potential Propagation in Myelinated Axons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Myelinated axons conduct action potentials, or spikes, in a saltatory manner. Inward current caused by a spike occurring at one node of Ranvier spreads axially to the next node, which regenerates the spike when depolarized enough for voltage-gated sodium channels to activate, and so on. The rate at which this process progresses dictates the velocity at which the spike is conducted and depends on several factors including axial resistivity and axon diameter that directly affect axial current. Here we show through computational simulations in modified double-cable axon models that conduction velocity also depends on extracellular factors whose effects can be explained by their indirect influence on axial current. Specifically, we show that a conventional double-cable model, with its outside layer connected to ground, transmits less axial current than a model whose outside layer is less absorptive. A more resistive barrier exists when an axon is packed tightly between other myelinated fibers, for example. We show that realistically resistive boundary conditions can significantly increase the velocity and energy efficiency of spike propagation, while also protecting against propagation failure. Certain factors like myelin thickness may be less important than typically thought if extracellular conditions are more resistive than normally considered. We also show how realistically resistive boundary conditions affect ephaptic interactions. Overall, these results highlight the unappreciated importance of extracellular conditions for axon function.</p>

                <p>The third trimester is a critical period for the development of functional networks that support the lifelong neurocognitive performance, yet the emergence of neuronal coupling in these networks is poorly understood. Here, we used longitudinal high-density electroencephalographic recordings from preterm infants during the period from 33 to 45&nbsp;weeks of conceptional age (CA) to characterize early spatiotemporal patterns in the development of local cortical function and the intrinsic coupling modes [ICMs; phase&ndash;phase (PPCs), amplitude&ndash;amplitude (AACs), and phase&ndash;amplitude correlations (PACs)]. Absolute local power showed a robust increase with CA across the full frequency spectrum, while local PACs showed sleep state-specific, biphasic development that peaked a few weeks before normal birth. AACs and distant PACs decreased globally at nearly all frequencies. In contrast, the PPCs showed frequency- and region-selective development, with an increase of coupling strength with CA between frontal, central, and occipital regions at low-delta and alpha frequencies together with a wider-spread decrease at other frequencies. Our findings together present the spectrally and spatially differential development of the distinct ICMs during the neonatal period and provide their developmental templates for future basic and clinical research.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e1101232024?rss=1">The Time-Course of Food Representation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans make decisions about food every day. The visual system provides important information that forms a basis for these food decisions. Although previous research has focused on visual object and category representations in the brain, it is still unclear how visually presented food is encoded by the brain. Here, we investigate the time-course of food representations in the brain. We used time-resolved multivariate analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) data, obtained from human participants (both sexes), to determine which food features are represented in the brain and whether focused attention is needed for this. We recorded EEG while participants engaged in two different tasks. In one task, the stimuli were task relevant, whereas in the other task, the stimuli were not task relevant. Our findings indicate that the brain can differentiate between food and nonfood items from ~112&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. The neural signal at later latencies contained information about food naturalness, how much the food was transformed, as well as the perceived caloric content. This information was present regardless of the task. Information about whether food is immediately ready to eat, however, was only present when the food was task relevant and presented at a slow presentation rate. Furthermore, the recorded brain activity correlated with the behavioral responses in an odd-item-out task. The fast representation of these food features, along with the finding that this information is used to guide food categorization decision-making, suggests that these features are important dimensions along which the representation of foods is organized.</p>

                <p>Human experience is imbued by the sense of being an embodied agent. The investigation of such basic self-consciousness has been hampered by the difficulty of comprehensively modulating it in the laboratory while reliably capturing ensuing subjective changes. The present preregistered study fills this gap by combining advanced meditative states with principled phenomenological interviews: 46 long-term meditators (19 female, 27 male) were instructed to modulate and attenuate their embodied self-experience during magnetoencephalographic monitoring. Results showed frequency-specific (high-beta band) activity reductions in frontoparietal and posterior medial cortices (PMC). Importantly, PMC reductions were driven by a subgroup describing radical embodied self-disruptions, including suspension of agency and dissolution of a localized first-person perspective. Neural changes were correlated with lifetime meditation and interview-derived experiential changes, but not with classical self-reports. The results demonstrate the potential of integrating in-depth first&ndash;person methods into neuroscientific experiments. Furthermore, they highlight neural oscillations in the PMC as a central process supporting the embodied sense of self.</p>

                <p>MAGUK scaffold proteins play a central role in maintaining and modulating synaptic signaling, providing a framework to retain and position receptors, signaling molecules, and other synaptic components. In particular, the MAGUKs SAP102 and PSD-95 are essential for synaptic function at distinct developmental timepoints and perform both overlapping and unique roles. While their similar structures allow for common binding partners, SAP102 is expressed earlier in synapse development and is required for synaptogenesis, whereas PSD-95 expression peaks later and is associated with synapse maturation. PSD-95 and other key synaptic proteins organize into subsynaptic nanodomains that have a significant impact on synaptic transmission, but the nanoscale organization of SAP102 is unknown. How SAP102 is organized within the synapse, and how it relates spatially to PSD-95 on a nanometer scale, could underlie its unique functions and impact how SAP102 scaffolds synaptic proteins. Here we used DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy to measure SAP102 nano-organization and its spatial relationship to PSD-95 at individual synapses in mixed-sex rat cultured neurons. We found that like PSD-95, SAP102 accumulates in high-density subsynaptic nanoclusters (NCs). However, SAP102 NCs were smaller and denser than PSD-95 NCs across development. Additionally, only a subset of SAP102 NCs co-organized with PSD-95, revealing MAGUK nanodomains within individual synapses containing either one or both proteins. These MAGUK nanodomain types had distinct NC properties and were differentially enriched with the presynaptic release protein Munc13-1. This organization into both shared and distinct subsynaptic nanodomains may underlie the ability of SAP102 and PSD-95 to perform both common and unique synaptic functions.</p>

                <p>The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a small midbrain structure that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, regulates brain&ndash;body communication, and is often studied for its role in "fight-or-flight" and "freezing" responses to threat. We used ultra-high-field 7&nbsp;T fMRI to resolve the PAG in humans and distinguish it from the cerebral aqueduct, examining its in vivo function during a working memory task (<I>N</I> = 87). Both mild and moderate cognitive demands elicited spatially similar patterns of whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, and moderate cognitive demand elicited widespread BOLD increases above baseline in the brainstem. Notably, these brainstem increases were not significantly greater than those in the mild demand condition, suggesting that a subthreshold brainstem BOLD increase occurred for mild cognitive demand as well. Subject-specific masks were group aligned to examine PAG response. In PAG, both mild and moderate demands elicited a well-defined response in ventrolateral PAG, a region thought to be functionally related to anticipated painful threat in humans and nonhuman animals&mdash;yet, the present task posed only the most minimal (if any) "threat," with the cognitive tasks used being approximately as challenging as remembering a phone number. These findings suggest that the PAG may play a more general role in visceromotor regulation, even in the absence of threat.</p>

                <p>The N2pc and P3 event-related potentials (ERPs), used to index selective attention and access to working memory and conscious awareness, respectively, have been important tools in cognitive sciences. Although it is likely that these two components and the underlying cognitive processes are temporally and functionally linked, such links have not yet been convincingly demonstrated. Adopting a novel methodological approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW), we provide evidence that the N2pc and P3 ERP components are temporally linked. We analyzed data from an experiment where 23 participants (16 women) monitored bilateral rapid serial streams of letters and digits in order to report a target digit indicated by a shape cue, separately for trials with correct responses and trials where a temporally proximal distractor was reported instead (distractor intrusion). DTW analyses revealed that N2pc and P3 latencies were correlated in time, both when the target or a distractor was reported. Notably, this link was weaker on distractor intrusion trials. This N2pc&ndash;P3 association is discussed with respect to the relationship between attention and access consciousness. Our results demonstrate that our novel method provides a valuable approach for assessing temporal links between two cognitive processes and their underlying modulating factors. This method allows to establish links and their modulator for any two time-series across all domains of the field (general-purpose MATLAB functions and a Python module are provided alongside this paper).</p>

                <p>Aging is accompanied by a decline of working memory, an important cognitive capacity that involves stimulus-selective neural activity that persists after stimulus presentation. Here, we unraveled working memory dynamics in older human adults (male and female) including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a combination of behavioral modeling, neuropsychological assessment, and MEG recordings of brain activity. Younger adults (male and female) were studied with behavioral modeling only. Participants performed a visuospatial delayed match-to-sample task under systematic manipulation of the delay and distance between sample and test stimuli. Their behavior (match/nonmatch decisions) was fit with a computational model permitting the dissociation of noise in the internal operations underlying the working memory performance from a strategic decision threshold. Task accuracy decreased with delay duration and sample/test proximity. When sample/test distances were small, older adults committed more false alarms than younger adults. The computational model explained the participants&rsquo; behavior well. The model parameters reflecting internal noise (not decision threshold) correlated with the precision of stimulus-selective cortical activity measured with MEG during the delay interval. The model uncovered an increase specifically in working memory noise in older compared with younger participants. Furthermore, in the MCI group, but not in the older healthy controls, internal noise correlated with the participants&rsquo; clinically assessed cognitive integrity. Our results are consistent with the idea that the stability of working memory contents deteriorates in aging, in a manner that is specifically linked to the overall cognitive integrity of individuals diagnosed with MCI.</p>

                <p>The neurophysiological effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for chronic pain are poorly understood, resulting in inefficient failure-prone programming protocols and inadequate pain relief. Nonetheless, novel stimulation patterns are regularly introduced and adopted clinically. Traditionally, paresthetic sensation is considered necessary for pain relief, although novel paradigms provide analgesia without paresthesia. However, like pain relief, the neurophysiological underpinnings of SCS-induced paresthesia are unknown. Here, we paired biophysical modeling with clinical paresthesia thresholds (of both sexes) to investigate how stimulation frequency affects the neural response to SCS relevant to paresthesia and analgesia. Specifically, we modeled the dorsal column (DC) axonal response, dorsal column nucleus (DCN) synaptic transmission, conduction failure within DC fiber collaterals, and dorsal horn network output. Importantly, we found that high-frequency stimulation reduces DC fiber activation thresholds, which in turn accurately predicts clinical paresthesia perception thresholds. Furthermore, we show that high-frequency SCS produces asynchronous DC fiber spiking and ultimately asynchronous DCN output, offering a plausible biophysical basis for why high-frequency SCS is less comfortable and produces qualitatively different sensation than low-frequency stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that the model dorsal horn network output is sensitive to SCS-inherent variations in spike timing, which could contribute to heterogeneous pain relief across patients. Importantly, we show that model DC fiber collaterals cannot reliably follow high-frequency stimulation, strongly affecting the network output and typically producing antinociceptive effects at high frequencies. Altogether, these findings clarify how SCS affects the nervous system and provide insight into the biophysics of paresthesia generation and pain relief.</p>

                Background Muscle injuries are the most frequent in football and may lead to the end of a player’s career. Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of prevention programs for all injury types. Few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise on muscle injuries. Methods A documentary search was conducted in October 2022 from three databases: Medline via its PubMed interface, Google Scholar, and COCHRANE databases. We only included original articles published between October 2012 and October 2022 with a high level of evidence. The research was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. The target population consisted of professional and semi-professional footballers. The intervention in question was structured injury preventive protocols, including specific training or pre-established protocols such as the FIFA 11+ program, compared to each other or with regular training sessions. The main outcomes were the incidence rates of muscle injuries and severe injury in each group, as well as the time loss to injury. Results Seven randomized controlled trials with a high level of evidence confirmed using the PEDRO scale were included. There were 3815 male professional football players. There was heterogeneity in the age, hours of exposure, and duration of the intervention. The prevention protocols used were FIFA 11+, bounding exercises, NHE, and stretching exercises. Structured exercises significantly reduce the severity of muscle injury and, consequently, time loss to injury. Discussion Despite the diversity of prevention programs, teams still lack standardized programs. Structured exercises, such as FIFA 11+ and bounding exercises, which combine strengthening, body kinesthesic awareness, and neuromuscular control, reduce the incidence and severity of muscle injury. FIFA 11+ is the first and most complete structured program, but lacks some exercises, such as adductor strengthening. Conclusion This review showed the interest in structured exercises in reducing severity and time loss to injury in professional football players. Registration This review was registered on 8/17/2023 in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under the reference code CRD42023452202.

                <p>by Chengwei Ai, Hongpeng Yang, Xiaoyi Liu, Ruihan Dong, Yijie Ding, Fei Guo</p>

De novo drug design is crucial in advancing drug discovery, which aims to generate new drugs with specific pharmacological properties. Recently, deep generative models have achieved inspiring progress in generating drug-like compounds. However, the models prioritize a single target drug generation for pharmacological intervention, neglecting the complicated inherent mechanisms of diseases, and influenced by multiple factors. Consequently, developing novel multi-target drugs that simultaneously target specific targets can enhance anti-tumor efficacy and address issues related to resistance mechanisms. To address this issue and inspired by Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models, we propose an upgraded GPT model with generative adversarial imitation learning for multi-target molecular generation called MTMol-GPT. The multi-target molecular generator employs a dual discriminator model using the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method for a concurrently multi-target molecular generation. Extensive results show that MTMol-GPT generates various valid, novel, and effective multi-target molecules for various complex diseases, demonstrating robustness and generalization capability. In addition, molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping experiments demonstrate the drug-likeness properties and effectiveness of generated molecules potentially improve neuropsychiatric interventions. Furthermore, our model’s generalizability is exemplified by a case study focusing on the multi-targeted drug design for breast cancer. As a broadly applicable solution for multiple targets, MTMol-GPT provides new insight into future directions to enhance potential complex disease therapeutics by generating high-quality multi-target molecules in drug discovery.

                <p>by Heung-Yeol Lim, Inah Lee</p>

The perirhinal cortex (PER) supports multimodal object recognition, but how multimodal information of objects is integrated within the PER remains unknown. Here, we recorded single units within the PER while rats performed a PER-dependent multimodal object-recognition task. In this task, audiovisual cues were presented simultaneously (multimodally) or separately (unimodally). We identified 2 types of object-selective neurons in the PER: crossmodal cells, showing constant firing patterns for an object irrespective of its modality, and unimodal cells, showing a preference for a specific modality. Unimodal cells further dissociated unimodal and multimodal versions of the object by modulating their firing rates according to the modality condition. A population-decoding analysis confirmed that the PER could perform both modality-invariant and modality-specific object decoding—the former for recognizing an object as the same in various conditions and the latter for remembering modality-specific experiences of the same object.

                Background This study aimed to compare the effect on postoperative complications of prehabilitation targeting predefined co-existing risky lifestyle factors with usual preoperative routines in surgical patients. Methods This systematic review followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and the protocol (CRD42022282611). Five databases were searched from inception to November 7, 2022 for randomised controlled trials on prehabilitation targeting ≥2 predefined risky lifestyles compared with usual preoperative routines. Risky lifestyles included Smoking, Nutrition (malnutrition and/or BMI>25), risky Alcohol intake, and Physical inactivity (SNAP). Primary outcome was postoperative complications ≤30 days. Cochrane’s risk-of-bias tool 2 was used and meta-analyses were conducted. GRADE was used to assess certainty of evidence. Results The search resulted in 20,862 records. At full-text screening, only two (120 participants) of 24 identified trials on combined SNAP intervention had ≥2 predefined risk factors and were included. One (n=110) on intensive physical and brief nutritional intervention to frail patients with colorectal cancer resection reported complication rates of 45% in both groups (relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.51). The other study (n=10, subgroup) on intensive alcohol and smoking intervention in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy, reported complications in 3/7 vs 3/3 participants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.19). The meta-analysis estimated a RR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.51, I2 51%). Conclusion Two small of the 24 trials on prehabilitation targeted co-existing and predefined risky SNAP factors and the effect on postoperative complications is very uncertain. Future prehabilitation research involving patient needs is warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-693/v1?src=rss">Determinants of Household Resilience to Food Insecurity for Comparison: the Case of Chencha District, Southern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Food insecurity is a historical global human challenge, but has yet remained a burning development agenda. The capacity to withstand and recover from food insecurity shocks and stresses refereed as resilience, which is determined by a strand of factors. This paper deals with measuring and; identifying major determinants of household resilience to food insecurity among weaving-based livelihood system in Chencha district. Methods Multi-stage sampling technique was employed to generate data from 303 sample households through household survey, focus group discussion, and key informant interviews. The collected data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, household resilience index, chi-square test, one-way ANOVA and econometric model (probit regression). Results The household survey revealed that 59.04% households were non-resilient, 24.42% were moderately resilient, 10.89% resilient and 4.95% highly resilient. The Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests have shown a meaningful and statistically significant difference among resilience categories. Finally, probit model analysis indicated that access to credit, average years of family education, crop diversity, income diversity, landholding size, TLU, expected crop harvest, expected cash income from fruit trees, frequency of extension contact, FCS, annual food expenditure, ownerships of Radio, Jewelry, furnished bed, membership in local associations, and distance to local market have positively influenced the likelihood of attaining higher household resilience at CI 95% or P<1%, 5% and 10%. Whereas; lack of access to mobile phone, inability to read and write, family business, formal employment, and transfers of payment have decreased likelihood of households to achieve higher resilience level. Conclusions Therefore, improving household access to credit, education, income diversification, livestock and land, agricultural extension services, membership to local associations, mobile service, and income diversification would enhance household income and food security, which could in turn improve household resilience to food insecurity.

                Background Private universities in Peru still need to implement digital transformation models to enhance the job performance of faculty and staff, achieving consistent improvement in the performance levels of university teachers by deploying technological and didactic tools for students. Therefore, the study aims to determine the relationship between digital transformation and the job performance of employees at a Private University. Methods The research approach was quantitative, employing a non-experimental, longitudinal correlational design. The technique used was a survey, applied to a sample of 104 employees (school heads, faculty, and a director) from the university on a national level from a total population of 144. Results Descriptive results reveal that the university has regularly adopted tools related to digital transformation. In particular, it has efficiently employed agile technologies, Big Data, and various technological means, benefiting 90% (52% and 38%) of the staff. The study also showed a high positive correlation (0.92>0.7) between digital transformation and the job performance of staff at the Private University, confirming that there is a significant connection between the variables studied. Conclusions Therefore, creating an innovative culture across all hierarchical levels and identifying key technologies that add value to the learning flow can meet the needs of an increasingly demanding society.

                Background Non-contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) plays a pivotal role in assessing central nervous system disorders and is a crucial diagnostic method. Iterative reconstruction (IR) methods have enhanced image quality (IQ) but may result in a blotchy appearance and decreased resolution for subtle contrasts. The deep-learning image reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) into the reconstruction process, generates high-quality images with minimal noise. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the IQ of the Precise Image (DLIR) and the IR technique (iDose4) for the NCCT brain. Methods This is a prospective study. Thirty patients who underwent NCCT brain were included. The images were reconstructed using DLIR-standard and iDose4. Qualitative IQ analysis parameters, such as overall image quality (OQ), subjective image noise (SIN), and artifacts, were measured. Quantitative IQ analysis parameters such as Computed Tomography (CT) attenuation (HU), image noise (IN), posterior fossa index (PFI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum-semiovale (CSO) were measured. Paired t-tests were performed for qualitative and quantitative IQ analyses between the iDose4 and DLIR-standard. Kappa statistics were used to assess inter-observer agreement for qualitative analysis. Results Quantitative IQ analysis showed significant differences (p<0.05) in IN, SNR, and CNR between the iDose4 and DLIR-standard at the BG and CSO levels. IN was reduced (41.8-47.6%), SNR (65-82%), and CNR (68-78.8%) were increased with DLIR-standard. PFI was reduced (27.08%) the DLIR-standard. Qualitative IQ analysis showed significant differences (p<0.05) in OQ, SIN, and artifacts between the DLIR standard and iDose4. The DLIR standard showed higher qualitative IQ scores than the iDose4. Conclusion DLIR standard yielded superior quantitative and qualitative IQ compared to the IR technique (iDose4). The DLIR-standard significantly reduced the IN and artifacts compared to iDose4 in the NCCT brain.

                This narrative review explores loneliness among medical students, particularly heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review aims to narratively describe how the digital age, both pre- and post-pandemic, influences loneliness and to assess the psychological effects of the pandemic on medical students. Our literature search, adhering to SANRA guidelines, scrutinized studies published in the last ten years focusing on loneliness among medical students. Our findings reveal that medical students experienced significant loneliness during the pandemic, attributed to virtual learning environments and decreased social interactions. Notably, the transition to online education has mitigated and exacerbated feelings of isolation. The review also highlights the dual role of social media in either alleviating or intensifying loneliness, depending on usage patterns and platform types. Overall, our study underscores the need for targeted interventions and support systems to address the mental well-being of medical students in the digital age and beyond, providing crucial insights for future research and policy-making in educational and psychological support frameworks.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess comparative effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of off-label rituximab, compared with frequently used therapies approved for multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A Swedish cohort study of persons with relapsing–remitting MS, age 18 to 75 years at inclusion and with a first therapy start or a first therapy switch between 2011 and 2018. Low-dose rituximab was compared with MS-approved therapies. Primary outcomes were proportions with 12 months confirmed disability worsening and change in MS Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) scores, respectively. Secondary endpoints included relapses, therapy discontinuation, and serious adverse events. Analyses used an intention-to-treat approach and were adjusted for demographics, MS features, and health characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 2,449 participants as first therapy start and 2,463 as first therapy switch. Proportions with disability worsening at 3 years were 9.1% for rituximab as first therapy and 5.1% after therapy switch, with no differences to MS-approved comparators. Worsening on rituximab was mostly independent of relapses. MSIS-29 with rituximab at 3 years improved by 1.3/8.4 points (physical/psychological) for first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and 0.4/3.6 for DMT switch, and was mostly similar across therapies. Rituximab had lower relapse rates and higher therapy persistence in both groups. The rate of hospital-treated infections was higher with rituximab after a therapy switch, but not as a first therapy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This population-based real-world cohort study found low rates of disability progression, mostly independent of relapses, and without significant differences between rituximab and MS-approved comparators. Rituximab led to lower rates of inflammatory activity and higher treatment persistence, but was associated with an increased rate of serious infections. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Skin usually comprises both follicular and interfollicular epithelia. Most studies on skin barrier function focus on the interfollicular epidermis without considering the role of the follicular epithelium. Using a targetable genetic tool to disrupt barrier function, Ford et al. identify multiple ways by which hair follicles modulate the skin’s barrier.

                Fan et al. show that VEGF secretion by macrophages in the adrenal gland maintains specialized sinusoidal endothelial cells. Loss of VEGF signaling induces subendothelial fibrosis and aldosterone production, leading to hypokalemia and high blood pressure. These findings link immune cell function to vascular health, endocrine homeostasis, and blood pressure control.

Hepatocyte-macrophage crosstalk via the PGRN-EGFR axis manages self-dsRNA responses, with PGRN mediating interferon responses and macrophage recruitment. ADAR1 suppression of PGRN-EGFR signaling aids tumor immune evasion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95879">RNA polymerase III is involved in regulating Plasmodium falciparum virulence</a></h4>

              
                While often undetected and untreated, persistent seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections remain a global public health problem. Despite the presence of parasites in the peripheral blood, no symptoms develop. Disease severity is correlated with the levels of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) adhering within blood vessels. Changes in iRBC adhesion capacity have been linked to seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections, however how this is occurring is still unknown. Here, we present evidence that RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) transcription in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> is downregulated in field isolates obtained from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season. Through experiments with in vitro cultured parasites, we have uncovered an RNA Pol III-dependent mechanism that controls pathogen proliferation and expression of a major virulence factor in response to external stimuli. Our findings establish a connection between <i>P. falciparum</i> cytoadhesion and a non-coding RNA family transcribed by Pol III. Additionally, we have identified <i>P. falciparum</i> Maf1 as a pivotal regulator of Pol III transcription, both for maintaining cellular homeostasis and for responding adaptively to external signals. These results introduce a novel perspective that contributes to our understanding of <i>P. falciparum</i> virulence. Furthermore, they establish a connection between this regulatory process and the occurrence of seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94605">FAK loss reduces BRAFV600E-induced ERK phosphorylation to promote intestinal stemness and cecal tumor formation</a></h4>

              
                <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup> mutation is a driver mutation in the serrated pathway to colorectal cancers. BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> drives tumorigenesis through constitutive downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, but high-intensity ERK activation can also trigger tumor suppression. Whether and how oncogenic ERK signaling can be intrinsically adjusted to a ‘just-right’ level optimal for tumorigenesis remains undetermined. In this study, we found that FAK (Focal adhesion kinase) expression was reduced in <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup>-mutant adenomas/polyps in mice and patients. In <i>Vil1-Cre;BRAF</i><sup>LSL-V600E/+</sup>;<i>Ptk2</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, <i>Fak</i> deletion maximized BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>’s oncogenic activity and increased cecal tumor incidence to 100%. Mechanistically, our results showed that Fak loss, without jeopardizing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced ERK pathway transcriptional output, reduced EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)-dependent ERK phosphorylation. Reduction in ERK phosphorylation increased the level of Lgr4, promoting intestinal stemness and cecal tumor formation. Our findings show that a ‘just-right’ ERK signaling optimal for <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup>-induced cecal tumor formation can be achieved via Fak loss-mediated downregulation of ERK phosphorylation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95621">The neuron-specific IIS/FOXO transcriptome in aged animals reveals regulatory mechanisms of cognitive aging</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive decline is a significant health concern in our aging society. Here, we used the model organism <i>C. elegans</i> to investigate the impact of the IIS/FOXO pathway on age-related cognitive decline. The <i>daf-2</i> Insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutant exhibits a significant extension of learning and memory span with age compared to wild-type worms, an effect that is dependent on the DAF-16 transcription factor. To identify possible mechanisms by which aging <i>daf-2</i> mutants maintain learning and memory with age while wild-type worms lose neuronal function, we carried out neuron-specific transcriptomic analysis in aged animals. We observed downregulation of neuronal genes and upregulation of transcriptional regulation genes in aging wild-type neurons. By contrast, IIS/FOXO pathway mutants exhibit distinct neuronal transcriptomic alterations in response to cognitive aging, including upregulation of stress response genes and downregulation of specific insulin signaling genes. We tested the roles of significantly transcriptionally-changed genes in regulating cognitive functions, identifying novel regulators of learning and memory. In addition to other mechanistic insights, a comparison of the aged vs young <i>daf-2</i> neuronal transcriptome revealed that a new set of potentially neuroprotective genes is upregulated; instead of simply mimicking a young state, <i>daf-2</i> may enhance neuronal resilience to accumulation of harm and take a more active approach to combat aging. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for regulating cognitive function with age and offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for age-related cognitive decline.

                Accurate prediction of the structurally diverse complementarity determining region heavy chain 3 (CDR-H3) loop structure remains a primary and long-standing challenge for antibody modeling. Here, we present the H3-OPT toolkit for predicting the 3D structures of monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies. H3-OPT combines the strengths of AlphaFold2 with a pre-trained protein language model and provides a 2.24 Å average RMSD<sub>Cα</sub> between predicted and experimentally determined CDR-H3 loops, thus outperforming other current computational methods in our non-redundant high-quality dataset. The model was validated by experimentally solving three structures of anti-VEGF nanobodies predicted by H3-OPT. We examined the potential applications of H3-OPT through analyzing antibody surface properties and antibody–antigen interactions. This structural prediction tool can be used to optimize antibody–antigen binding and engineer therapeutic antibodies with biophysical properties for specialized drug administration route.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89319">Elevated glycolytic metabolism of monocytes limits the generation of HIF1A-driven migratory dendritic cells in tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                During tuberculosis (TB), migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the site of infection to the draining lymph nodes is known to be impaired, hindering the rapid development of protective T-cell-mediated immunity. However, the mechanisms involved in the delayed migration of DCs during TB are still poorly defined. Here, we found that infection of DCs with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) triggers HIF1A-mediated aerobic glycolysis in a TLR2-dependent manner, and that this metabolic profile is essential for DC migration. In particular, the lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor oxamate and the HIF1A inhibitor PX-478 abrogated Mtb-induced DC migration in vitro to the lymphoid tissue-specific chemokine CCL21, and in vivo to lymph nodes in mice. Strikingly, we found that although monocytes from TB patients are inherently biased toward glycolysis metabolism, they differentiate into poorly glycolytic and poorly migratory DCs compared with healthy subjects. Taken together, these data suggest that because of their preexisting glycolytic state, circulating monocytes from TB patients are refractory to differentiation into migratory DCs, which may explain the delayed migration of these cells during the disease and opens avenues for host-directed therapies for TB.

">Left-Right Brain-Wide Asymmetry of Neuroanatomy in the Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                Left-right asymmetry of the human brain is widespread through its anatomy and function. However, limited microscopic understanding of it exists, particularly for anatomical asymmetry where there are few well-established animal models. In humans, most of the brain shows subtle, population-average, regional asymmetries in cortical thickness or surface area. In addition, a macro-scale twisting called the cerebral petalia exists in which the right hemisphere protrudes anteriorly relative to the left. Here, we ask whether neuroanatomical asymmetries can be observed in mice, leveraging 6 different neuroimaging cohorts of animals from 5 different research groups (~3,500 animals in total). We found an anterior-posterior pattern of volume asymmetry in mice, where anterior regions are larger on the right while posterior regions are larger on the left. This pattern appears driven by a similar trend in surface area asymmetry and is supported by a concordant pattern of positional asymmetries. The cerebral hemisphere as a whole appears shifted anteriorly on the right while the brainstem and cerebellum appear shifted anteriorly on the left. These results together indicate a small torsion of the brain is present in mice, similar to the cerebral petalia in humans. By establishing a signature of anatomical brain asymmetry in mice, we aim to provide a foundation for future studies to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of anatomical brain asymmetry seen in humans - a feature of the brain with extremely limited understanding.

                Recent studies have identified multiple genetic variants of SEL1L-HRD1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in humans with neurodevelopmental disorders and locomotor dysfunctions, including ataxia. However, the relevance and importance of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in the pathogenesis of ataxia remain unexplored. Here we show that SEL1L deficiency in Purkinje cells leads to early-onset progressive cerebellar ataxia with progressive loss of Purkinje cells with age. Mice with Purkinje cell-specific deletion of SEL1L (Sel1LPcp2Cre) exhibit motor dysfunction beginning around 9 weeks of age. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals dilated ER and fragmented nuclei in Purkinje cells of adult Sel1LPcp2Cre mice, indicative of altered ER homeostasis and cell death. Lastly, loss of Purkinje cells is associated with a secondary neurodegeneration of granular cells, as well as robust activation of astrocytes and proliferation of microglia, in the cerebellum of Sel1LPcp2Cre mice. These data demonstrate the pathophysiological importance of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in Purkinje cells in the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxia.

">Midline Assembloids Reveal Regulators of Human Axon Guidance</a></h4>

              
                Organizers are specialized cell populations that orchestrate cell patterning and axon guidance in the developing nervous system. Although non-human models have led to fundamental discoveries about the organization of the nervous system midline by the floor plate, an experimental model of human floor plate would enable broader insights into regulation of human neurodevelopment and midline connectivity. Here, we have developed stem cell-derived organoids resembling human floor plate (hFpO) and assembled them with spinal cord organoids (hSpO) to generate midline assembloids (hMA). We demonstrate that hFpO promote Sonic hedgehog-dependent ventral patterning of human spinal progenitors and Netrin-dependent guidance of human commissural axons, paralleling non-human models. To investigate evolutionary-divergent midline regulators, we profiled the hFpO secretome and identified 27 evolutionarily divergent genes between human and mouse. Utilizing the hMA platform, we targeted these candidates in an arrayed CRISPR knockout screen and reveal that GALNT2, a gene involved in O-linked glycosylation, impairs floor plate-mediated guidance of commissural axons in humans. This novel platform extends prior axon guidance discoveries into human-specific neurobiology with implications for mechanisms of nervous system evolution and neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Evolution of iGluR ligand specificity, polyamine regulation, and ion selectivity inferred from a placozoan Epsilon receptor</a></h4>

              
                Epsilon ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) belong to a recently described sub-family of metazoan receptors that is distinct from the AMPA, Kainate, Delta, and Phi (i.e., AKDF) sub-family, the NMDA sub-family, and the Lambda subfamily. Here, we sought to better understand the evolutionary and functional properties of Epsilon receptors by focusing on homologues from the basal invertebrate Trichoplax adhaerens (phylum Placozoa). We provide an updated species-guided phylogeny of eukaryotic iGluRs, and a comprehensive phylogeny of placozoan receptors uncovering marked diversification of Epsilon receptors within three conserved subclades, and four invariable subclades of AKDF receptors. Detailed functional characterization of the T. adhaerens Epsilon receptor GluE1alphaA revealed robust activation by glycine, alanine, serine, and valine, but not glutamate. Through combined of structural modeling and mutation experiments, we used GluE1alphaA to test the hypothesis that only a small set of amino acids in the ligand binding domain determine ligand selectivity. Mutation of just three amino acids converted GluE1alphaA selectivity to glutamate, resulted in nascent sensitivity to AMPA, and increased sensitivity to the AMPA/Kainate receptor blocker CNQX. Lastly, combined modeling and mutation experiments revealed that an atypical serine residue in the pore NQR site of GluE1alphaA, along with an aspartate four amino acids downstream, confers sensitivity to voltage-dependent polyamine block, while the serine alone diminishes both polyamine block and Ca2+ permeation compared to asparagine and glutamine residues of AMPA and Kainate receptors. Altogether, we demonstrate conserved molecular determinants for polyamine regulation between Epsilon and AKDF receptors, and evidence that natural variations in NQR residues have important implications for ion permeation and regulation by polyamines.

">Anhedonic behaviour in a TLR7-driven neuroinflammation mouse model is associated with impaired thalamostriatal signalling and immune cell ingress into the brain</a></h4>

              
                Depression is a heterogenous condition driven by multiple aetiologies, which make its pathophysiology challenging to map. Stratifying depression by underlying biological causes may allow for more effective, targeted treatments. Immune-mediated inflammation is present in around 20% of individuals with depression and provides a potential mechanistic pathway for some key symptoms such as reward / hedonic impairment. Here we used a non-invasive model of neuroinflammation, topical application of Aldara (a TLR7/8 agonist) for 3 days in mice, to explore relationships between the intracerebral immune response, neural circuitry and behaviours closely linked to depression: motivation, reward and anxiety.

Mice that were treated with Aldara exhibited anhedonia-like behaviour and impairments in intrinsic motivational behaviours (measured through assays such as sucrose preference and nest-building tests) relative to untreated controls, but displayed little anxiety-like behaviour. Aldara-driven neuroinflammation was associated with evidence of immune cell (including lymphoid and myeloid cells) ingression into the brain, and both microglia and astrocytes showed evidence of activation. Within 4 to 6 hours of Aldara treatment, neurons in midline thalamus showed strongly increased Fos immunoreactivity relative to controls. Optogenetic activation of midline thalamic projections onto ventral striatum medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed that Aldara treatment substantially reduced the magnitude of the evoked thalamic AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC, but with no change to the AMPA/NMDA ratio nor change in the frequency of amplitude of spontaneous EPSP. Finally, whole brain transcriptome overrepresentation analysis revealed that Aldara treatment led to significant upregulation of genes associated with immune response and downregulation of genes associated with glutamate metabolism and synaptic transmission.

Altogether, our data suggest potential, testable mechanisms through which neuroinflammation can drive anhedonic-like behaviour through activation of resident neural cells, infiltrating activated immune cells and functional changes in thalamostriatal circuitry consistent with increased extrasynaptic glutamate.

">Structure transfer and consolidation in visual implicit learning</a></h4>

              
                Transfer learning, the re-application of previously learned higher-level regularities to novel input, is a key challenge in cognition. While previous empirical studies investigated human transfer learning in supervised or reinforcement learning for explicit knowledge, it is unknown whether such transfer occurs during naturally more common implicit and unsupervised learning and if so, how it is related to memory consolidation. We compared the transfer of newly acquired explicit and implicit abstract knowledge during unsupervised learning by extending a visual statistical learning paradigm to a transfer learning context. We found transfer during unsupervised learning but with important differences depending on the explicitness/implicitness of the acquired knowledge. Observers acquiring explicit knowledge during initial learning could transfer the learned structures immediately. In contrast, observers with the same amount but implicit knowledge showed the opposite effect, a structural interference during transfer. However, with sleep between the learning phases, implicit observers switched their behaviour and showed the same pattern of transfer as explicit observers did while still remaining implicit. This effect was specific to sleep and not found after non-sleep consolidation. Our results highlight similarities and differences between explicit and implicit learning while acquiring generalizable higher-level knowledge and relying on consolidation for restructuring internal representations.

                Cognitive neuroscience has advanced significantly due to the availability of openly shared datasets. Large sample sizes, large amounts of data per person, and diversity in tasks and data types are all desirable, but are difficult to achieve in a single dataset. Here, we present an open dataset with N = 101 participants and 6 hours of scanning per participant, with 6 multifaceted cognitive tasks including 2 hours of naturalistic movie viewing. This datasets' combination of ample sample size, extensive data per participant, more than 600 hours worth of data, and a wide range of experimental conditions - including cognitive, affective, social, and somatic/interoceptive tasks - positions it uniquely for probing important questions in cognitive neuroscience.

">Multi-talker speech comprehension at different temporal scales in listeners with normal and impaired hearing</a></h4>

              
                Comprehending speech requires deciphering a range of linguistic representations, from phonemes to narratives. Prior research suggests that in single-talker scenarios, the neural encoding of linguistic units follows a hierarchy of increasing temporal receptive windows. Shorter temporal units like phonemes and syllables are encoded by lower-level sensory brain regions, whereas longer units such as sentences and paragraphs are processed by higher-level perceptual and cognitive areas. However, the brains representation of these linguistic units under challenging listening conditions, such as a cocktail party situation, remains unclear. In this study, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) responses from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired participants as they listened to individual and dual speakers narrating different parts of a story. The inclusion of hearing-impaired listeners allowed us to examine how hierarchically organized linguistic units in competing speech streams affect comprehension abilities. We leveraged a hierarchical language model to extract linguistic information at multiple levels--phoneme, syllable, word, phrase, and sentence--and aligned these model activations with the EEG data. Our findings showed distinct neural responses to dual-speaker speech between the two groups. Specifically, compared to normal-hearing listeners, hearing-impaired listeners exhibited poorer model fits at the acoustic, phoneme, and syllable levels as well as the sentence levels, but not at the word and phrase levels. These results suggest that hearing-impaired listeners experience disruptions at both shorter and longer temporal scales, while their processing at medium temporal scales remains unaffected.

">Dopamine increases protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons enabling dopamine-dependent LTP</a></h4>

              
                The reward and novelty related neuromodulator dopamine plays an important role in hippocampal long-term memory, which is thought to involve protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the direct effects of dopamine on protein synthesis, and the functional implications of newly synthesized proteins for synaptic plasticity, have not yet been investigated. We have previously reported that timing-dependent synaptic depression (t-LTD) can be converted into potentiation by dopamine application during synaptic stimulation (Brzsoko et al., 2015) or postsynaptic burst activation (Fuchsberger et al., 2022). Here we show that dopamine increases protein synthesis in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons, enabling dopamine-dependent long-term potentiation (DA-LTP). We found that neuronal activity is required for the dopamine-induced increase in protein synthesis, which is mediated via the Ca2+-sensitive adenylate cyclase (AC) subtypes 1/8, cAMP, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Furthermore, dopamine induced a protein synthesis-dependent increase in the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, but not GluA2. We found that DA-LTP is absent in GluA1 knock-out mice and that it requires calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Taken together, our results suggest that dopamine together with neuronal activity controls synthesis of plasticity-related proteins, including GluA1, which enable DA-LTP via a signalling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP.

">Retinal microglial cells increase expression and release of IL-1β when exposed to ATP</a></h4>

              
                Cytokine IL-1{beta} is an early component of inflammatory cascades, with both priming and activation steps required before IL-1{beta} release. Here, the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) for ATP was shown to both prime and release IL-1{beta} from retinal microglial cells. Isolated retinal microglial cells increased expression of Il1b when stimulated with endogenous receptor agonist extracellular ATP; ATP also rapidly downregulated expression of microglial markers Tmem119 and Cd206. Changes to all three genes were reduced by specific P2X7R antagonist A839977, implicating the P2X7R. Microglial cells expressed the P2X7R on ramifications and responded to receptor agonist BzATP with robust and rapid rises in intracellular Ca2+. BzATP increased expression of IL-1{beta} protein colocalizing with CX3CR1-GFP in retinal wholemounts consistent with microglial cells. ATP also triggered release of IL-1{beta} from isolated retinal microglia into the bath; release was inhibited by A839977 and induced by BzATP, supporting a role for the P2X7R in release as well as priming. The IL-1{beta} release triggered by ATP was substantially greater from microglial cells compared to astrocytes from the optic nerve head region. Il1b expression was increased by a transient rise in intraocular pressure and Il1b levels remained elevated 10 days after a single IOP elevation. In summary, this study suggests the P2X7 receptor can both prime IL-1{beta} levels in microglial cells and trigger its release. The P2Y12R was previously identified as a chemoattractant for retinal microglia, suggesting the recruitment of the cells towards the source of released extracellular ATP could position microglia for P2X7R receptor, enabling both priming and release of IL-1{beta}.

">Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of striatal microglia reveals distinct transcriptomic signatures of acute stress and chronic exercise</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute stress can produce long lasting decreases in voluntary physical activity that contribute to degraded mental and physical health. Stress also produces enduring molecular changes in the striatum, a brain region that regulates voluntary wheel-running and other motivated behaviors. Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, have specialized functions in responding to stress, sensing changes in the striatum, and controlling neuronal activity. Thus, microglia are positioned at the interface between neural responses to stress and neural coordination of voluntary activity; however, the role of striatal microglia in stress-induced long-term suppression of voluntary activity remains unexplored. The present study employs single nucleus RNA-sequencing to investigate how stress and exercise impact the biology of microglia in the striatum. We find that stress-induced decreases in running behavior are associated with specific microglial activation profiles. Furthermore, we show that access to a running wheel is associated with an additional and distinct profile of microglia activation characterized by upregulation of complement components and phagocytosis pathways. Lastly, we find that distinct microglial gene sets are associated with general running (versus not running) and more subtle variation in genes with individual running levels. Taken together, our results contribute to a broader understanding of the diverse states that striatal microglia can assume in response to stress and exercise, and broadly suggest that microglia exhibit more nuanced functional responses to environmental perturbations than previously thought.

	<p>Introduction: According to leading occupational therapy models, the environment appears to be a key element in fostering occupational performance and participation. There is an emerging need to identify an instrument that can assess these aspects in the school environment. Currently, there are no rating scales in Italy for the school participation of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. For this reason, this study aims to culturally adapt and translate the School Participation Questionnaire (SPQ) to Italian and to pilot test the translated Italian version on children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods: The original scale was translated from English to Italian using the guidelines &amp;amp;ldquo;Translation and Cultural Adaptation of Patient Reported Outcomes Measures&amp;amp;mdash;Principles of Good Practice.&amp;amp;rdquo; The psychometric properties analyzed were the following: content validity, construct validity, cross-cultural validity, and internal consistency. Construct validity was assessed using the Italian version of the Sensory Processing Measure (SPM). Results: The Italian version of the SPQ was administered to 22 children. The mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD of the score was 9.32 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.36; Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; was 0.935 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation coefficient with the SPM scores was &amp;amp;minus;0.622 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: This pilot testing study for the validation of the Italian version of the SPQ showed good validity and reliability results. Thanks to this study, it would be possible to further analyze the tool for the evaluation of the environment and school participation of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular autism spectrum disorder. It is a quick and easy instrument that focuses on the environment as an active variable in the child&amp;amp;rsquo;s occupational performance.</p>

	<p>Motor intention is a high-level brain function related to planning for movement. Although studies have shown that motor intentions can be decoded from brain signals before movement execution, it is unclear whether intentions relating to mental imagery of movement can be decoded. Here, we investigated whether differences in spatial and temporal patterns of brain activation were elicited by intentions to perform different types of motor imagery and whether the patterns could be used by a multivariate pattern classifier to detect such differential intentions. The results showed that it is possible to decode intentions before the onset of different types of motor imagery from functional MR signals obtained from fronto-parietal brain regions, such as the premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex, while controlling for eye movements and for muscular activity of the hands. These results highlight the critical role played by the aforementioned brain regions in covert motor intentions. Moreover, they have substantial implications for rehabilitating patients with motor disabilities.</p>

	<p>The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of cognitive interventions based on modern board games in school settings to improve memory outcomes and math skills. A parallel, quasi-experimental study was carried out with children (n = 234) into third and fourth grades (8&amp;amp;ndash;10 years old). School centres were allocated into a general domain intervention (playing memory board games), a specific domain intervention (playing mathematical board games) or a control group (regular classes without playing). Teachers carried out bi-weekly sessions during the last 30 min of mathematical lessons (8 weeks, 15 sessions). Before and after intervention, we individually measured verbal and visuospatial memory outcomes (short-term memory and working memory updating) and mathematical skills (number operations, number ranking, number production and problem solving). The results showed significant transfer effects of both memory and math trainings. In third grade, we found that playing math games showed medium&amp;amp;ndash;large effect sizes in visuospatial short-term memory and updating memory, number operations and number ranking compared to the control group. In fourth grade, we found that playing memory games showed significant small effect sizes in problem solving compared to the control group. Playing board games could be a methodology that enhances cognitive and mathematical development in children.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy treatment primarily involves antiseizure medications (ASMs) to eliminate seizures and improve the quality of life, but many patients develop drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), necessitating alternative interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in managing DRE. We retrospectively analyzed data from 105 adult patients treated at Agostino Gemelli Hospital from 1994 to 2022. Among the 73 patients with follow-up data, 80.8% were responders, experiencing significant reductions in seizure frequency over an average follow-up period of 9.4 years. Although 19.2% were non-responders, many of these patients still opted for generator replacements due to improvements in quality of life, such as fewer falls and shorter post-ictal periods. The overall complication rate was 12.3%, with most complications being mild and manageable. These findings suggest that VNS offers substantial long-term benefits for patients with DRE, improving seizure control and quality of life. This study underscores the importance of VNS as a viable long-term treatment option for DRE, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>

	<p>Despite most episodes of low back pain (LBP) being short-lasting, some transition into persistent long-lasting problems. Hence, the need for a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms of this is pertinent. Therefore, the aims of the present study are (1) to map pain-induced changes in brain activity and blood gene expression associated with persistent LBP, and (2) to explore whether these brain and gene expression signatures show promise as predictive biomarkers for the development of persistent LBP. The participants will be allocated into three different pain groups (no pain, mild short-lasting, or moderate long-term). One in-person visit, where two blood samples will be collected and sent for RNA sequencing, along with resting 64-channel electro-encephalography measurements before, during, and after a cold pressor test, will be conducted. Thereafter, follow-up questionnaires will be distributed at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Recruitment will start during the second quarter of 2024, with expected completion by the last quarter of 2024. The results are expected to provide insight into the relationship between central nervous system activity, gene expression profiles, and LBP. If successful, this study has the potential to provide physiological indicators that are sensitive to the transition from mild, short-term LBP to more problematic, long-term LBP.</p>

	<p>Background: The recovery of locomotion is greatly prioritized, and neuromodulation has been emerging as a promising approach in recent times. Study design: Single-subject research designSettings: A laboratory at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Objectives: To investigate the effects of augmenting activity-based therapy (ABT) to transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (TSCS) on enhancing specific lower limb muscle strength and improving locomotor ability in an individual with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Methods: An individual with iSCI underwent two phases of treatment, ABT alone followed by combined ABT+TSCS, each for a period of 10 weeks. The TSCS stimulated T10-T11 and T12-L1 segments with a frequency of 30 Hz at an intensity between 105 mA and 130 mA. Manual muscle testing, 6 min walk test (6MWT), and surface electromyography (EMG) responses of specific lower limb muscles were measured. Additionally, spasticity and sensorimotor examinations were conducted every two weeks, while pain tolerance was recorded after each treatment session. Results: After the ABT+TSCS treatment, there was an increase in overall muscle strength grading (from 1.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.3 to 2.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.6 out of 5.0). The 6MWT showed a greater increase in walking distance (3.5 m to 10 m) after combined treatment than ABT alone. In addition, the EMG response of the anterior rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior after ABT+TSCS increased more than after ABT alone. The spasticity grade was reduced (from 0.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.7 to 0.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.6) whereas the average lower limb motor score increased from 17 to 23 points. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: ABT+TSCS increased the target-specific lower limb muscle strength and walking ability more than ABT alone in an individual with chronic iSCI.</p>

	<p>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment option for patients with dopaminergic complications of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and drug-refractory PD tremor. However, DBS and its indications can be challenging, and they are not often debated in the medical community. Through a critical narrative review, the objective of this paper is to improve the comprehension of DBS indications and help to solve the puzzle that this process can be. Proper patient selection is the first step for a good surgical outcome. In this review, then, relevant considerations are discussed, involving PD genes, PD phenotypes, indications of early stages, non-motor symptoms, neuroimaging predictors, comorbidities, and age. Individualized approaches are encouraged, including clinical and radiological factors. Social support during the whole follow-up and expectations alignment are necessary through this process and are also debated.</p>

	<p>One&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice undergoes unique processing that distinguishes it from others&amp;amp;rsquo; voices, and thus listening to it may have a special neural basis for self-talk as an emotion regulation strategy. This study aimed to elucidate how neural effects of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice differ from those of others&amp;amp;rsquo; voices on the implementation of emotion regulation strategies. Twenty-one healthy adults were scanned using fMRI while listening to sentences synthesized in their own or others&amp;amp;rsquo; voices for self-affirmation and cognitive defusion, which were based on mental commitments to strengthen one&amp;amp;rsquo;s positive aspects and imagining metaphoric actions to shake off negative aspects, respectively. The interaction effect between voice identity and strategy was observed in the superior temporal sulcus, middle temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal cortex, and activity in these regions showed that the uniqueness of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice is reflected more strongly for cognitive defusion than for self-affirmation. This interaction was also seen in the precuneus, suggesting intertwining of self-referential processing and episodic memory retrieval in self-affirmation with one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice. These results imply that unique effects of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice may be expressed differently due to the degree of engagement of neural sharpening-related regions and self-referential networks depending on the type of emotion regulation.</p>

	<p>Non-human primates, due to their similarities in immune response to humans, are the preferred model for studying infectious processes and any associated cognitive impairments. Behavioral tests are indispensable for investigating pathogenesis in neuroinfections, especially those that do not manifest with noticeable clinical symptoms, as well as in the transition to a chronic form of the disease. Modeling viral infection requires specialized experimental conditions. Our work describes techniques for investigating mnemonic functions, tiredness, attentional focus, quick-wittedness, and basic behavioral responses in primates under the assumed conditions for infections with viruses that do not have an airborne route of transmission. It also outlines approaches to the training and selection of primates for virological research, as well as analyzing gender differences in learning abilities, the impact of housing conditions on the results, and the correlation between training success and behavioral test scores. These methods will allow a more detailed study of non-human primates as a model for researching cognitive and behavioral impairments under infectious and immune stress, as well as the design of less energy-intensive experiments for evaluating the efficacy and safety of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies at early stages of infection.</p>

The causal reasoning is that Zika infection is linked to the development of microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. With no clinically approved antiviral treatment for ZIKV, the need for the development of potential inhibitors against the virus is essential. In this study, we aimed to screen phytochemicals from papaya (Carica papaya L.) against NS5 protein domains of ZIKV. Methods Approximately 193 phytochemicals from an online database (IMPACT) were subjected to molecular docking using AutoDock Vina against the NS5-MTase protein domain (5WXB) and -RdRp domain (5U04). Results Our results showed that β-sitosterol, carpaine, violaxanthin, pseudocarpaine, Δ7-avenasterols, Rutin, and cis-β-carotene had the highest binding affinity to both protein domains, with β-sitosterol having the most favorable binding energy. Furthermore, ADMET analysis revealed that selected compounds had good pharmacokinetic properties and were nontoxic. Conclusions Our findings suggest that papaya-derived phytochemicals could be potential candidates for developing antiviral drugs against ZIKV. However, further experimental studies using cell lines and in vivo models are needed to validate their efficacy and safety.

                Background Worldwide, e-commerce, as a business modality that uses information and communication technologies to make transactions of products and services, has become an indispensable part of the global retail market, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. E-commerce has experienced accelerated growth in recent years, driven by factors such as increased internet penetration, the expansion of mobile devices, user confidence and innovation of digital platforms. Dental offices have found e-commerce an opportunity to improve their competitiveness. The aim of the research was to establish the relationship between the indicators of efficiency maximization in sales and the type of modality of commerce used most by private dental offices within an emerging economy context in Latin-American city. Methods The study was classified as applied research with a non-experimental, correlational and exploratory design. The sample consisted of 34 private dental offices. A simple random probabilistic sampling was chosen. An instrument containing thirteen items including questions about payment, appointments or consultations, and advertising and indicators of efficiency maximization in sales, was used. Results The assessment of the relationship between the efficiency maximization indicators in sales and the commerce employed shows that, beyond cost reduction (PR=8, 95% CI [1.37; 46.81], p=0.021), the type does not have a statistically significant impact on the increase in clients, sales, revenues, and profit increase. (PR=3, 95% CI [0.28; 32.21], p=0.364). Conclusions E-commerce is significantly correlated with a reduction in operational costs.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The benefits of intravenous thrombolysis are time-dependent, with maximum efficacy when administered within the first “golden” hour after onset. Nevertheless, the impact of golden hour thrombolysis has not been well quantified.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception to August 27, 2023. We included studies that reported safety and efficacy outcomes of ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis in the golden hour versus later treatment window. The primary outcome was an excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days. The secondary efficacy outcome was a good functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2). The main safety outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seven studies involving 78,826 patients met the selection criteria. Golden hour thrombolysis was associated with higher odds of 90-day excellent functional outcomes (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16–1.67) and 90-day good functional outcomes (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.13–1.69) compared with thrombolysis outside the golden hour. The number needed to treat to benefit for golden hour thrombolysis to reduce disability by at least 1 level on the modified Rankin Scale per patient was 2.6. Rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality were similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Golden hour thrombolysis significantly improved acute ischemic stroke outcomes. The findings provide rationale for intensive efforts aimed at expediting thrombolytic therapy within the golden hour window following the onset of acute ischemic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The provision of community health services (CHS) is critical in accelerating primary health care delivery to vulnerable and deprived populations. This systematic review study has been conducted to interrogate the interrelationship between households and community health services in accelerating primary healthcare delivery synthesizing the available empirical studies. The findings are to inform a primary research on structural linkages between households and CHS in Kisumu County, Kenya. Methods This study applied a descriptive approach using a systematic review technique to provide context and substance to the two main research questions: (1) how does the interaction between households and CHWs affect utilization of CHS to promote equity and right to health? (2) How do health-seeking behaviours of households influence their decision-making regarding choices of CHS? We screened the literature from Google scholar, JSTOR, SAGE and EBSCO based on our inclusion criteria, resulting in 21 studies. These studies were assessed for quality and eligibility and data extracted based on relevance to the research study. Results Households place primacy on trust and confidentiality in the interaction with CHWs and this affects uptake of CHS. The social determinants of health are also critical in influencing the health-seeking behaviour of households and individuals and their choice of CHS. The successful models of CHS share the characteristic of community ownership and participation and provides for comprehensive health care teams. Conclusion CHS are critical for the acceleration of primary health care delivery. It forms an important pathway for the achievement of universal health coverage, which is an outcome required for Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health.

                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Gambling disorder (GD) has become a wide concern in Indonesia, as many negative consequences arise from this psychiatric condition. Prompt treatment with an appropriate method of delivery is required to achieve optimal outcomes in GD patients. This protocol paper outlines a study to determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) in treating GD in Indonesia. Methods This non-randomized pilot and feasibility study will recruit 20 people with GD. All participants will receive the iCBT intervention through self-learning videos and guided weekly group sessions. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed at baseline (week 0), post- treatment completion (week 10), and 6 weeks post-treatment (week 16). The outcomes measured will be the change in gambling symptoms, gambling urges, cognitive distortions, readiness to change, emotional problems, and quality of life of the participants. Discussion The feasibility of iCBT for GD patients in Indonesia will be assessed by this study. The study's results will give an indication of the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of a subsequent conclusive trial. The delivery of iCBT may help to address the issue of treatment access in an extensive geographical region and provide immediate implications as a treatment resource for GD in practice.
