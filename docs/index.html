[version</a></h4>

              
                Background Treatment-resistant chronic migraine patients constitute a heavily burdened patient population with need for novel treatment options. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), located deep within the facial structures, is a synaptic junction in the trigemino-autonomic reflex that is hypothesised to play a part in migraine pathophysiology. A 2017 open-label pilot study explored the SPG as a target for onabotulinumtoxinA injections in chronic migraine using a navigation-guided injection device, demonstrating a favourable safety profile and promising response on migraine related efficacy outcomes. Methods MiBlock is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, publicly funded, randomised, quadruple-blinded and placebo-controlled trial. Participation is voluntary and all participants must sign a written consent prior to inclusion. The study is approved by the Norwegian ethics committee and the Norwegian Medical Product Agency. Patients with treatment-resistant chronic migraine will be recruited from four Norwegian university hospitals until 170 have received study treatment. The study will investigate the efficacy of a single-session, bilateral, navigation-guided, percutaneous injection of either onabotulinumtoxinA (verum) or 0.9% NaCl (placebo) towards the SPG under local anaesthesia. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the frequency of moderate and severe headache days at weeks 5-8 post-injection. The primary efficacy outcome variable is collected prospectively through daily headache eDiary entries during the entire study participation. The treatment effect will be assessed by comparing the placebo and the treatment arm according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Discussion This trial addresses a novel treatment strategy in headache prevention. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA injection towards the SPG in chronic migraine, but results may shed light on the feasibility of navigation-guided SPG injections in several headache disorders. Results will be published in international open-access peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number EudraCT number: 2018-004053-24. ClinicalTrial ref: NCT04069897. Protocol version 4.2, Date 21.11.2019

                Background The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-980/v2?src=rss">Counterbalance Economics (CBE): Harnessing Aggregate Markups to Finance Voucher-Based Inequality Reduction [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Corporate markups have risen markedly since the 1980s, widening the gap between profits and wages and fuelling income inequality. Counterbalance Economics (CBE) converts a portion of those markup rents into firm-redeemable vouchers for low-income households, promising redistribution without incurring large public budgets. This paper tests whether in-kind financed voucher scheme can neutralise the inequality effect of markups across advanced and emerging OECD economies. Methodology We assemble an unbalanced panel of 12 countries (1982–2016) that combines Study/World Bank Gini indices with De Loecker–Eeckhout aggregate markups, macro controls (log GDP per capita, terms of trade, R&D intensity, unemployment) and a newly coded CBE dummy capturing six staggered adoptions of mark-up-funded voucher programmes. A two-way fixed-effects difference-in-differences model estimates the causal impact of markups, CBE, and their interaction on inequality, controlling for country–clustered errors. Results In the absence of a policy, a 10-percentage-point rise in markups increases the Gini coefficient by 1.23 points. Where CBE is in force, the interaction term turns significantly negative implying the same markup increase now lowers the Gini by 2.9 points. Disaggregating the data reveals a more minor but still significant reduction in developed economies and a larger effect in emerging economies, consistent with higher initial inequality and weaker traditional safety nets. Placebo and pre-trend tests detect no spurious effects, and synthetic-control replications for early adopters confirm the magnitude of the effect. Conclusions Markup rents are a potent driver of inequality, yet a modest, rule-based in-kind mechanism that recycles those rents into vouchers can more than offset their distributive harm. CBE therefore emerges as a market-compatible and potentially scalable complement to progressive taxation, whose effectiveness depends on institutional capacity, regulatory oversight, and interaction with existing redistributive systems—particularly in emerging economies facing fiscal and political constraints. Future research should pair industry-level markups with micro-data on voucher use to refine targeting and assess long-run growth effects.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04095">A computational account of dreaming: learning and memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of studies have concluded that dreaming is mostly caused by randomly arriving internal signals because "dream contents are random impulses", and argued that dream sleep is unlikely to play an important part in our intellectual capacity. On the contrary, numerous functional studies have revealed that dream sleep does play an important role in our learning and other intellectual functions. Specifically, recent studies have suggested the importance of dream sleep in memory consolidation, following the findings of neural replaying of recent waking patterns in the hippocampus. The randomness has been the hurdle that divides dream theories into either functional or functionless. This study presents a cognitive and computational model of dream process. This model is simulated to perform the functions of learning and memory consolidation, which are two most popular dream functions that have been proposed. The simulations demonstrate that random signals may result in learning and memory consolidation. Thus, dreaming is proposed as a continuation of brain's waking activities that processes signals activated spontaneously and randomly from the hippocampus. The characteristics of the model are discussed and found in agreement with many characteristics concluded from various empirical studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04492">Discovering Mechanistic Models of Neural Activity: System Identification in an in Silico Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing mechanistic models of neural circuits is a fundamental goal of neuroscience, yet verifying such models is limited by the lack of ground truth. To rigorously test model discovery, we establish an in silico testbed using neuromechanical simulations of a larval zebrafish as a transparent ground truth. We find that LLM-based tree search autonomously discovers predictive models that significantly outperform established forecasting baselines. Conditioning on sensory drive is necessary but not sufficient for faithful system identification, as models exploit statistical shortcuts. Structural priors prove essential for enabling robust out-of-distribution generalization and recovery of interpretable mechanistic models. Our insights provide guidance for modeling real-world neural recordings and offer a broader template for AI-driven scientific discovery.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04512">BrainVista: Modeling Naturalistic Brain Dynamics as Multimodal Next-Token Prediction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturalistic fMRI characterizes the brain as a dynamic predictive engine driven by continuous sensory streams. However, modeling the causal forward evolution in realistic neural simulation is impeded by the timescale mismatch between multimodal inputs and the complex topology of cortical networks. To address these challenges, we introduce BrainVista, a multimodal autoregressive framework designed to model the causal evolution of brain states. BrainVista incorporates Network-wise Tokenizers to disentangle system-specific dynamics and a Spatial Mixer Head that captures inter-network information flow without compromising functional boundaries. Furthermore, we propose a novel Stimulus-to-Brain (S2B) masking mechanism to synchronize high-frequency sensory stimuli with hemodynamically filtered signals, enabling strict, history-only causal conditioning. We validate our framework on Algonauts 2025, CineBrain, and HAD, achieving state-of-the-art fMRI encoding performance. In long-horizon rollout settings, our model yields substantial improvements over baselines, increasing pattern correlation by 36.0\% and 33.3\% on relative to the strongest baseline Algonauts 2025 and CineBrain, respectively.

                arXiv:2602.03896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson-distributed latent variable models are widely used in computational neuroscience, but differentiating through discrete stochastic samples remains challenging. Two approaches address this: Exponential Arrival Time (EAT) simulation and Gumbel-SoftMax (GSM) relaxation. We provide the first systematic comparison of these methods, along with practical guidance for practitioners. Our main technical contribution is a modification to the EAT method that theoretically guarantees an unbiased first moment (exactly matching the firing rate), and reduces second-moment bias. We evaluate these methods on their distributional fidelity, gradient quality, and performance on two tasks: (1) variational autoencoders with Poisson latents, and (2) partially observable generalized linear models, where latent neural connectivity must be inferred from observed spike trains. Across all metrics, our modified EAT method exhibits better overall performance (often comparable to exact gradients), and substantially higher robustness to hyperparameter choices. Together, our results clarify the trade-offs between these methods and offer concrete recommendations for practitioners working with Poisson latent variable models.

                arXiv:2602.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many fields collect large-scale temporal data through repeated measurements (trials), where each trial is labeled with a set of metadata variables spanning several categories. For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): animal choice. A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials. We demonstrate MILCCI's performance through both synthetic and real-world examples, including voting patterns, online page view trends, and neuronal recordings.

                arXiv:2412.12112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic framework for developing computational models of biological neural systems. In this framework, physiological recordings are viewed as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying continuous-time stochastic dynamical system which implements computations through its state evolution. To model this dynamical system, we employ a system of coupled stochastic differential equations with differentiable drift and diffusion functions and use variational inference to infer its states and parameters. This formulation enables seamless integration of existing mathematical models in the literature, neural networks, or a hybrid of both to learn and compare different models. We demonstrate this in our framework by developing a generative model that combines coupled oscillators with neural networks to capture latent population dynamics from single-cell recordings. Evaluation across three neuroscience datasets spanning different species, brain regions, and behavioral tasks show that these hybrid models achieve competitive performance in predicting stimulus-evoked neural and behavioral responses compared to sophisticated black-box approaches while requiring an order of magnitude fewer parameters, providing uncertainty estimates, and offering a natural language for interpretation.

Abstract: Biological memory solves a problem that eludes current AI: storing specific episodic facts without corrupting general semantic knowledge. Complementary Learning Systems theory explains this through two subsystems - a fast hippocampal system using sparse, pattern-separated representations for episodes, and a slow neocortical system using distributed representations for statistical regularities. Current AI systems lack this separation, attempting to serve both functions through neural weights alone. We identify the Orthogonality Constraint: reliable memory requires orthogonal keys, but semantic embeddings cannot be orthogonal because training clusters similar concepts together. The result is Semantic Interference (connecting to what cognitive psychologists have long observed in human memory), where neural systems writing facts into shared continuous parameters collapse to near-random accuracy within tens of semantically related facts. Through semantic density (rho), the mean pairwise cosine similarity, we show collapse occurs at N=5 facts (rho > 0.6) or N ~ 20-75 (moderate rho). We validate across modalities: 16,309 Wikipedia facts, scientific measurements (rho = 0.96, 0.02% accuracy at N=10,000), and image embeddings (rho = 0.82, 0.05% at N=2,000). This failure is geometric - no increase in model capacity can overcome interference when keys share semantic overlap. We propose Knowledge Objects (KOs): structured facts with hash-based identity, controlled vocabularies, and explicit version chains. On Wikipedia facts, KO retrieval achieves 45.7% where Modern Hopfield Networks collapse to near-zero; hash-based retrieval maintains 100%. Production systems (Claude Memory, ChatGPT Memory) store unstructured text, causing schema drift (40-70% consistency) and version ambiguity. Knowledge Objects provide the discrete hippocampal component that enables reliable bicameral memory.

                arXiv:2511.16465v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in neural stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link underlying microscopic tissue structure with macroscopic assumptions. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Conductivity variations within the cortex are expected given the differences in cell density and volume fraction across layers. We review recent efforts modeling microscopic and mesoscopic E-fields and outline approaches that bridge micro- and macroscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions. Using simplified microscopic models, effective tissue conductivity was estimated as a function of volume fraction of extracellular space, and the conductivities of different cortical layers were interpolated based on experimental volume fraction. The effective tissue conductivities were monotonically decreasing convex functions of the cell volume fraction. With decreasing cell volume fraction, the conductivity of cortical layers increased with depth from layer 2 to 6. Although the variation of conductivity within the cortex was small when compared to the conductivity of extracellular fluid (9% to 15%), the conductivity difference was considerably larger when compared between layers, e.g., with layer 3 and 6 being 20% and 50% more conductive than layer 2, respectively. The review and analysis provide a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural stimulation. Using layer-specific conductivity values within the cortex could improve the accuracy of estimations of thresholds and distributions of neural activation in E-field models of brain stimulation.

                arXiv:2602.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in automated algorithm design, giving rise to numerous powerful methods. However, these approaches retain critical limitations: they require extensive evaluation of the target problem to guide the search process, making them impractical for real-world optimization tasks, where each evaluation consumes substantial computational resources. This research proposes an innovative and efficient framework that decouples algorithm discovery from high-cost evaluation. Our core innovation lies in combining a Genetic Programming (GP) function generator with an LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm designer. The evolutionary direction of the GP-based function generator is guided by the similarity between the landscape characteristics of generated proxy functions and those of real-world problems, ensuring that algorithms discovered via proxy functions exhibit comparable performance on real-world problems. Our method enables deep exploration of the algorithmic space before final validation while avoiding costly real-world evaluations. We validated the framework's efficacy across multiple real-world problems, demonstrating its ability to discover high-performance algorithms while substantially reducing expensive evaluations. This approach shows a path to apply LLM-based automated algorithm design to computationally intensive real-world optimization challenges.

                arXiv:2602.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensory processing with neuromorphic systems is typically done by using either event-based sensors or translating input signals to spikes before presenting them to the neuromorphic processor. Here, we offer an alternative approach: direct analog signal injection eliminates superfluous and power-intensive analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions, making it particularly suitable for efficient near-sensor processing. We demonstrate this by using the accelerated BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic research platform and interfacing it directly to microphones and a servo-motor-driven actuator. Utilizing BrainScaleS-2's 1000-fold acceleration factor, we employ a spiking neural network to transform interaural time differences into a spatial code and thereby predict the location of sound sources. Our primary contributions are the first demonstrations of direct, continuous-valued sensor data injection into the analog compute units of the BrainScaleS-2 ASIC, and actuator control using its embedded microprocessors. This enables a fully on-chip processing pipeline$\unicode{x2014}$from sensory input handling, via spiking neural network processing to physical action. We showcase this by programming the system to localize and align a servo motor with the spatial direction of transient noise peaks in real-time.

Abstract: Spatial accelerators, composed of arrays of compute-memory integrated units, offer an attractive platform for deploying inference workloads with low latency and low energy consumption. However, fully exploiting their architectural advantages typically requires careful, expert-driven mapping of computational graphs to distributed processing elements. In this work, we automate this process by framing the mapping challenge as a black-box optimization problem. We introduce the first evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop mapping framework for neuromorphic accelerators, enabling users without deep hardware knowledge to deploy workloads more efficiently. We evaluate our approach on Intel Loihi 2, a representative spatial accelerator featuring 152 cores per chip in a 2D mesh. Our method achieves up to 35% reduction in total latency compared to default heuristics on two sparse multi-layer perceptron networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to multi-chip systems and observe an up to 40% improvement in energy efficiency, without explicitly optimizing for it.

                arXiv:2602.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work tackles two critical challenges related to the development of metaheuristics for Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOOPs): the exponential growth of non-dominated solutions and the tendency of metaheuristics to disproportionately concentrate their search on a subset of the Pareto Front. To counteract the first, bounded archives are employed as a strategic mechanism for effectively managing the increasing number of non-dominated solutions. Addressing the second challenge involves an in-depth exploration of solution diversity algorithms found in existing literature. Upon recognizing that current approaches predominantly center on diversity within the objective space, this research introduces innovative methods specifically designed to enhance diversity in the solution space. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the Hamming Distance Archiving Algorithm, one of the newly proposed algorithms for multi-objective local search, surpassing the performance of the Adaptive Grid Archiving and the Hypervolume Archiving, both drawn from the literature. This outcome suggests a promising avenue for enhancing the overall efficiency of metaheuristics employed for solving MOOPs.

Abstract: The pursuit of optimal trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under stringent computational constraints poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary multi-objective optimization. We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low. Experiments on DTLZ and ZDT suites and a subsurface energy extraction task show that NeuroPareto consistently outperforms classifier-enhanced and surrogate-assisted baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume.

                arXiv:2602.03967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful and popular dimensionality reduction technique. However, due to its linear nature, it often fails to capture the complex underlying structure of real-world data. While Kernel PCA (kPCA) addresses non-linearity, it sacrifices interpretability and struggles with hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition. We introduce a novel, granular objective function that maximizes the individual variance contribution of each variable providing a stronger learning signal than global variance maximization. This approach natively handles categorical and ordinal variables without the dimensional explosion associated with one-hot encoding. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance across synthetic and real-world datasets. At the same time, it preserves PCA's interpretability, enabling visualization and analysis of feature contributions using standard tools such as biplots. The code can be found on GitHub.

                arXiv:2602.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical behaviour of reasoning probes in a stylized model of looped reasoning, given by Boolean circuits whose computational graph is a perfect $\nu$-ary tree ($\nu\ge 2$) and whose output is appended to the input and fed back iteratively for subsequent computation rounds. A reasoning probe has access to a sampled subset of internal computation nodes, possibly without covering the entire graph, and seeks to infer which $\nu$-ary Boolean gate is executed at each queried node, representing uncertainty via a probability distribution over a fixed collection of $\mathtt{m}$ admissible $\nu$-ary gates. This partial observability induces a generalization problem, which we analyze in a realizable, transductive setting.
  We show that, when the reasoning probe is parameterized by a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis class and queries $N$ nodes, the worst-case generalization error attains the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log(2/\delta)}/\sqrt{N})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$, for $\delta\in (0,1)$. Our analysis combines snowflake metric embedding techniques with tools from statistical optimal transport. A key insight is that this optimal rate is achievable independently of graph size, owing to the existence of a low-distortion one-dimensional snowflake embedding of the induced graph metric. As a consequence, our results provide a sharp characterization of how structural properties of the computational graph govern the statistical efficiency of reasoning under partial access.

Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.

                arXiv:2503.08301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many-task optimization scenarios, surrogate models are valuable for mitigating the computational burden of repeated fitness evaluations across tasks. This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15371">Event2Vec: Processing Neuromorphic Events Directly by Representations in Vector Space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic event cameras possess superior temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing methods either convert the events into dense synchronous frame representations for processing by powerful CNNs or Transformers, but lose the asynchronous, sparse and high temporal resolution characteristics of events during the conversion process; or adopt irregular models such as sparse convolution, spiking neural networks, or graph neural networks to process the irregular event representations but fail to take full advantage of GPU acceleration.Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing capabilities of Transformers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks, showing that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, features high throughput and low latency, and achieves high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events or low spatial resolutions. Event2vec introduces a novel paradigm by demonstrating for the first time that sparse, irregular event data can be directly integrated into high-throughput Transformer architectures. This breakthrough resolves the long-standing conflict between maintaining data sparsity and maximizing GPU efficiency, offering a promising balance for real-time, low-latency neuromorphic vision tasks. The code is provided in https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Panda/event2vec.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02345">Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured Compression</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.02345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma

                <p>The cerebellum is well established in subsecond motor timing, but its role in suprasecond interval timing remains unclear. Here, we investigated how cerebellar output influences time estimation over longer timescales. Male rats performed a nose-poke interval timing task in which reward availability could be predicted either from a fixed 2.5&nbsp;s auditory cue (cued trials) or had to be estimated internally during uncued 3.5&nbsp;s trials that demanded self-timing. Chemogenetic inhibition of the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) produced bidirectional effects: delayed action initiation in predictable trials and premature (~100&ndash;160&nbsp;ms) responses when self-timing was required. Despite a slowing of movement, overall task success rates remained unchanged. Because motor slowing is likely to lead to later, not earlier, action initiation, these results implicate the LCN in computing internal time estimates. These findings demonstrate that the cerebellum integrates motor and cognitive processes for suprasecond timing, with differential effects on externally guided and self-generated timing.</p>

                <p>Age-related vascular changes accompany or precede the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The comorbidity of AD and arterial stiffening suggests that vascular changes have a pathogenic role. Carotid artery mechanics and hemodynamics have been associated with age-related cognitive decline. However, the impact of hemodynamics and vascular mechanics on regional vulnerability within the brain has not been thoroughly explored. Compared with the arterial system, brain venous circulation in cognitive impairment is less understood despite the venous system's role in transport. To study vasculature impact on biochemistry in AD models, we must first establish the differences in vasculature mechanics and hemodynamics in a common AD model compared with healthy controls. With this baseline data, future studies on manipulating vasculature integrity in mice become feasible. Young and aged female 3xTg mice and age-matched controls were imaged using a combination of ultrasound and mass spectrometry. Wall shear stress varied across age and AD models. Mean velocity and pulsatility index varied across age and AD. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of brain tissue revealed several lipids that were statistically different<I></I> between age and AD, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS imaging revealed region-specific differences between groups. Combining both ultrasound and mass spectrometry, we were able to detect significant changes in the vascular biomechanics of neck vasculature prior to observing significant changes in the brain biochemistry. Our work revealed significant vascular differences in the 3xTg compared with controls and, to our knowledge, is the first to study vascular biomechanics via ultrasound in the 3xTg AD mouse model.</p>

                <p>by Gaurav Sharma, Bernard Marius ’t Hart, Jean-Jacques Orban de Xivry, Denise Y.P. Henriques, Mireille E. Broucke</p>

A fundamental problem of visuomotor adaptation research is to understand how the brain is capable to asymptotically remove a predictable exogenous disturbance from a visual error signal using limited sensor information by re-calibration of hand movement. From a control theory perspective, the most striking aspect of this problem is that it falls squarely in the realm of the internal model principle of control theory. Despite this fact, the relationship between the internal model principle and models of visuomotor adaptation is currently not well developed.
This paper aims to close this gap by proposing an abstract discrete-time state space model of visuomotor adaptation based on the internal model principle. The proposed <i>DO Model</i>, a metonym for its most important component, a disturbance observer, addresses key modeling requirements: modular architecture, physically relevant signals, parameters tied to atomic behaviors, and capacity for abstraction. The two main computational modules are a disturbance observer, a recently developed class of internal models, and a feedforward system that learns from the disturbance observer to improve feedforward motor commands.

                <p>by Khady Diagne, Thomas M. Bury, Morgan E. Pettebone, Marc W. Deyell, Zachary Laksman, Alvin Shrier, Leon Glass, Gil Bub, Emilia Entcheva</p>

Phase resetting of cardiac oscillators underlies some complex arrhythmias. Here we use optogenetic stimulation to construct phase response curves (PRC) for spheroids of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and a computational cardiomyocyte model to identify ionic mechanisms shaping the PRC. The clinical utility of the human PRCs is demonstrated by adding a patient-based conduction delay to the same equations to explain complex multi-day Holter ECG dynamics and cardiac arrhythmias. Periodic stimulation of these patient-based models and the computational model of human iPSC-CM reveal similar bifurcation patterns and entrainment zones. Cell therapy by injecting iPSC-CM into diseased hearts can induce ectopic foci-based engraftment arrhythmias. The PRC analysis offers a potential strategy to entrain these foci in a parameter space that avoids such arrhythmias.

                <p>by Joel Eliason, Michele Peruzzi, Arvind Rao</p>

Motivation: Understanding how different cell types interact spatially within tissue microenvironments is critical for deciphering immune dynamics, tumor progression, and tissue organization. Many current spatial analysis methods assume symmetric associations or compute image-level summaries separately without sharing information across patients and cohorts, limiting biological interpretability and statistical power.
Results: We present SHADE (Spatial Hierarchical Asymmetry via Directional Estimation), a multilevel Bayesian framework for modeling asymmetric spatial interactions across scales. SHADE quantifies direction-specific cell-cell associations using smooth spatial interaction curves (SICs) and integrates data across tissue sections, patients, and cohorts. Through simulation studies, SHADE demonstrates improved accuracy, robustness, and interpretability over existing methods. Application to colorectal cancer multiplexed imaging data demonstrates SHADE’s ability to quantify directional spatial patterns while controlling for tissue architecture confounders and capturing substantial patient-level heterogeneity. The framework successfully identifies biologically interpretable spatial organization patterns, revealing that local microenvironmental structure varies considerably across patients within molecular subtypes.

                <p>by Nathaniel Deimler, David V. Ho, Norbert Paul, Zoë Gill, Peter Baumann</p>

Long-read sequencing has transformed many areas of biology and holds significant promise for telomere research by enabling analysis of nucleotide-level resolution chromosome arm–specific telomere length in both model organisms and humans. However, the adoption of new technologies, particularly in clinical or diagnostic contexts, requires careful validation to recognize potential technical and computational limitations. We present TARPON (Telomere Analysis and Research Pipeline Optimized for Nanopore), a best-practices Nextflow pipeline designed for the analysis of telomeres sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform. TARPON can be executed via the command line or integrated into ONT’s EPI2ME agent, providing a user-friendly graphical interface for those without computational training. Nextflow’s container-based architecture eliminates dependency conflicts, thereby streamlining deployment across platforms. TARPON isolates telomeric repeat–containing reads, assigns strand specificity, and identifies enrichment probes that can be used both for demultiplexing and for confirming capture-based library preparation. To ensure that the analysis is restricted to full-length telomeres, reads lacking a capture probe or non-telomeric sequence on the opposite end are excluded. A sliding-window approach defines the subtelomere-to-telomere boundary, followed by quality filtering to remove low-quality or subtelomeric reads that passed earlier steps. The pipeline generates customizable statistics, text-based summaries, and publication-ready visualizations (HTML, PNG, PDF). While default settings are optimized for diagnostic workflows, all parameters are easily adjustable via the GUI or command line to support diverse applications. These include telomere analyses in variant-rich samples (e.g., ALT-positive tumors) and organisms with non-canonical telomeric repeats such as some insects (GTTAG) and certain plants (GGTTTAG). TARPON is the first complete and experimentally validated pipeline for Nanopore-based telomere analysis requiring no data pre-processing or prior bioinformatics expertise, while offering flexibility for advanced users.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfields differentially develop and age, and they vary in vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases. Innovation in high-resolution imaging has accelerated clinical research on human hippocampal subfields, but substantial differences in segmentation protocols impede comparisons of results across laboratories. The Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG) is an international organization seeking to address this issue by developing a histologically valid, reliable, and freely available segmentation protocol for high-resolution <i>T</i>
<sub>2</sub>-weighted 3 T MRI (<a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com">http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com</a>). Here, we report the first portion of the protocol focused on subfields in the hippocampal body; protocols for the head and tail are in development. The body protocol includes definitions of the internal boundaries between subiculum, Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1–3 subfields, and dentate gyrus, in addition to the external boundaries of the hippocampus apart from surrounding white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The segmentation protocol is based on a novel histological reference dataset labeled by multiple expert neuroanatomists. With broad participation of the research community, we voted on the segmentation protocol via an online survey, which included detailed protocol information, feasibility testing, demonstration videos, example segmentations, and labeled histology. All boundary definitions were rated as having high clarity and reached consensus agreement by Delphi procedure. The harmonized body protocol yielded high inter- and intra-rater reliability. In the present paper we report the procedures to develop and test the protocol, as well as the detailed procedures for manual segmentation using the harmonized protocol. The harmonized protocol will significantly facilitate cross-study comparisons and provide increased insight into the structure and function of hippocampal subfields across the lifespan and in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                Background This study explores how sensory experiences within hospital environments influence the emotional responses of pediatric cancer patients, particularly those undergoing palliative chemotherapy. Pediatric journeys through healthcare spaces are not solely defined by clinical interactions but are shaped by continuous sensory exposure. This research aims to examine how visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory inputs during hospital stays affect emotional regulation, stress, and readiness for treatment among children. Methods A qualitative, exploratory design was used, applying an interpretive approach to capture nuanced emotional experiences. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews with pediatric patients and caregivers, direct environmental observation, and multisensory journey mapping. Emotional responses were coded and interpreted using thematic analysis, supported by the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) emotional framework to identify patterns of engagement and disengagement across different sensory touchpoints. Result Findings show that children exposed to coherent multisensory environments—those with soft lighting, comforting textures, and calming sounds—demonstrated reduced anxiety and enhanced emotional coping. In contrast, fragmented environments with clinical noises, sterile visuals, and abrupt transitions intensified emotional distress, confusion, and behavioral withdrawal. Key friction points were not associated with medical procedures alone but often emerged from sensory overload or absence of meaningful sensory stimuli during waiting or transitional phases. Conclusion Hospital environments in pediatric oncology settings significantly contribute to the emotional quality of care. Sensory design that integrates adaptable, trauma-informed, and child-centered features can reduce stress and foster emotional resilience. This study suggests the need for multisensory design frameworks that move beyond aesthetics to support children’s agency and well-being throughout their treatment journey.

                Background Chronic migraine is frequently refractory to available preventive therapies. Image-guided cryoneurolysis of the greater occipital nerve (CryoGON) may provide longer-lasting relief than conventional greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. This Stage 1 Registered Report describes a prospective, exploratory study evaluating whether response to a conventional GON block predicts subsequent response to CryoGON, and assesses open-label safety, tolerability, feasibility and efficacy of CryoGON. Methods The study is planned as a single-site, investigator-initiated, open-label clinical investigation. Adults with chronic migraine will complete a ≥28-day electronic baseline diary before receiving bilateral conventional GON blocks, followed by a ≥28-day observation. Eligible participants then undergo navigation-guided CryoGON with 12-week follow-up. The primary endpoint is the association between change in moderate-to-severe headache days after GON block (weeks 1–4) and after CryoGON (weeks 9–12). Key secondary endpoints estimate the diagnostic performance of GON-block response applying a ≥30% reduction threshold for treatment effect to identify CryoGON responders, including sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Additional endpoints include change in migraine days, patient-reported global impression of change, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire v2.1, procedure tolerability, technical success, and safety (treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse device effects). Women of childbearing potential, including pregnant and breastfeeding participants, are eligible for participation. Discussion This study will provide the first systematic evaluation of whether a simple, widely available GON block can guide patient selection for CryoGON and will generate foundational open-label data on its clinical performance and safety. Findings will inform the design and justification of a subsequent sham-controlled trial. Trial registration and approvals The study will preregister at ClinicalTrials.gov. and obtain all necessary ethical approvals before study initiation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-186/v1?src=rss">Transmedia Storytelling Research Trends: A Bibliometric Analysis (2020–2025) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Transmedia storytelling has emerged as an essential strategy for connecting content across multiple formats, languages, and platforms, particularly in educational, cultural, and social domains. Despite growing interest, there is still a lack of comprehensive bibliometric syntheses that map global research trends and the intellectual structure of the field. Methods A descriptive and retrospective bibliometric study was conducted using the Scopus database to identify scientific production on transmedia storytelling between 2020 and 2025. The study followed the PRISMA methodology under a mixed post-positivist and constructivist approach and applied the ARA framework (Authors, Journals, Contributions) as the main analytical model. Thirty Scopus-indexed journal articles were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer (2025) was used to generate co-occurrence maps and identify conceptual clusters. Results The analysis revealed a predominance of qualitative studies, with strong contributions from Spain, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Portugal. Spanish and Brazilian authors accounted for more than 60% of the output, confirming an Ibero-American dominance. Thematic analysis identified five major domains: education, cultural heritage, social activism, media innovation, and psychosocial health. Ten main conceptual categories were detected, including transmedia storytelling, adaptation, transmediality, interactive narrative, convergence, higher education, and media convergence. Articles were mainly published in Q1–Q2 Scopus journals in communication, digital education, and cultural studies. Conclusions Although still a relatively young field, transmedia storytelling research shows clear interdisciplinary expansion and diversification. The findings highlight the growing academic and social relevance of transmedia storytelling as a driver of social transformation, meaningful learning, and critical participation. Future studies should deepen methodological diversification, promote international collaboration, and strengthen the empirical assessment of social impact, particularly in underrepresented regions of the Global South.

Schaeffer et al. show that angiotensin II damages endothelium, oligodendrocyte precursors, and interneurons via AT1 signaling, independent of blood pressure. Targeting this pathway may protect the brain beyond pressure control alone.

                Short-term plasticity (STP) filters synaptic inputs across rapid timescales. Nowacka et al. show that postsynaptic AMPAR desensitization and diffusion-trapping, shaped by auxiliary subunits and activity-dependent signaling, generate synapse-specific gain control. By broadening temporal filtering and adjusting short-term depression, receptor mobility emerges as a central regulator of circuit information processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106410">Single-cell transcriptomics of X-ray irradiated Drosophila wing discs reveals heterogeneity related to cell-cycle status and cell location</a></h4>

              
                Even seemingly homogeneous populations of cells can express phenotypic diversity in response to environmental changes. Thus, X-ray irradiation of tissues composed of diverse cell types can have complex outcomes. We have used single-cell RNA sequencing to study the effects of X-ray radiation on the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc, a relatively simple tissue composed mostly of epithelial cells. Transcriptomic clustering of cells collected from the wing disc generates clusters that are mainly grouped based on proximodistal cell location. To quantify heterogeneity of gene expression among clusters, we adapted a metric used to study market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Genes involved in DNA damage repair, defense against reactive oxygen species, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis are expressed relatively uniformly. In contrast, genes encoding a subset of ligands, notably cytokines that activate the JAK/STAT pathway, some transcription factors, including <i>Ets21C</i>, previously implicated in regeneration, and several signaling proteins are expressed more regionally. Though the radiation-responsive transcription factor p53 is expressed relatively uniformly in the wing disc, several regionally induced genes still require p53 function, indicating that regional and radiation-induced factors combine to regulate their expression. We also examined heterogeneity within regions using a clustering approach based on cell cycle gene expression. A subpopulation of cells, characterized by high levels of <i>tribbles</i> expression, is amplified in irradiated discs. Remarkably, this subpopulation accounts for a considerable fraction of radiation-induced gene expression, indicating that cellular responses are non-uniform even within regions. Thus, both inter-regional and intra-regional heterogeneity are important features of tissue responses to X-ray radiation.

">APOE ε4 defines a systemic immune endophenotype independent of clinical trajectory in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is clinically heterogeneous, and genetic modifiers may drive molecular endophenotypes without obvious clinical stratification. The apolipoprotein E {varepsilon}4 (APOE {varepsilon}4) allele is a major Alzheimers disease risk allele, but its biological impact in ALS remains unclear. Methods: Using the Answer ALS cohort, longitudinal motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric measures were modelled using mixed-effects approaches. Patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neuron multiomics (chromatin accessibility, transcriptomics, and proteomics) were analysed using supervised machine learning. Plasma SomaScan profiling was used to derive an APOE {varepsilon}4-associated protein signature and to test its stability across serial visits, biological pathway enrichment, and associations with clinical progression. Results: APOE {varepsilon}4 carriage was not associated with baseline severity or rate of functional decline and showed no consistent effects on cognitive or neuropsychiatric trajectories. Motor neuron multiomic profiles similarly demonstrated no reproducible APOE {varepsilon}4 signal and did not reliably classify genotype. In contrast, plasma proteomics identified an APOE {varepsilon}4 protein signature that classified {varepsilon}4 status with high accuracy in ALS (AUC 0.98) and non-ALS motor neuron disease (AUC 0.86) and was enriched for immune and inflammatory biology. This systemic signature was highly stable across repeated sampling, indicating a persistent genotype-associated state. Within this plasma endophenotype, a small set of proteins tracked functional decline and a composite score stratified fast versus slow progression. Baseline composite scores were elevated in APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers in both ALS and neurologically unimpaired controls, consistent with a stable systemic shift detectable beyond overt disease status. Conclusions: APOE {varepsilon}4 defines a persistent, immune-enriched systemic proteomic endophenotype in ALS that is not captured by clinical trajectories or motor neuron-only profiling yet relates to disease progression. Plasma-based, genotype-informed endophenotyping offers a translational pathway for biomarker stratification and therapeutic prioritisation in ALS and potentially other heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders.

                During development, dendrites undergo structural plasticity in response to neural activity; however, whether spatiotemporal activity patterns can instruct dendritic growth remains unclear. Prior to vision, the developing mouse retina exhibits spontaneous retinal waves with a nasal propagation bias that mimics forward optic flow. Here, we reveal that starburst amacrine cells use direction-selective dendritic computations to transform this propagation bias into asymmetric dendrite growth, linking activity patterns to structural development.

                Objectives: This study examined whether bilingualism is associated with episodic memory (EM) and executive function (EF) in older Mandarin-speaking adults and whether associations differ by clinical diagnosis. Methods: 189 Mandarin-speaking older adults completed Mandarin-administered neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and clinical diagnosis. English proficiency test was administered to determine whether they were bilinguals or monolinguals. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in an education-matched subgroup (16 years). Results: Bilingualism was associated with higher EF, with a significant bilingualism by diagnosis interaction indicating larger bilingual advantages among cognitively impaired participants. However, bilingualism was not associated with EM. Findings were preserved in education-matched analysis. Conclusions: Results support a domain-specific association between bilingualism and executive function in later life, consistent with cognitive maintenance mechanisms preferentially supporting executive processes rather than global protection.

">Distinct activation thresholds of unmyelinated C-fiber afferents by dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Sensitization of C-fiber nociceptors plays a critical role in spontaneous and ongoing pain in patients with chronic pain. We recently demonstrated that C-fiber afferents can be reversibly blocked through activity-dependent conduction slowing, suggesting that selective activation of C-fiber afferents may represent a novel strategy for pain relief. We hypothesized that electrical peripheral nerve stimulation (ePNS) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation exhibit distinct activation thresholds for unmyelinated C-fiber afferents. Materials and Methods: We characterized the activation thresholds of A- and C-fiber afferents during ePNS and DRG stimulation using single-fiber electrophysiological recordings from split nerve filaments and optical GCaMP6f imaging of intact DRGs. We further quantified the distribution of the sodium channel subtype NaV1.6 in afferent axons and somata and evaluated its contribution to neuronal excitability using NEURON-based computational modeling. Results: Single-fiber recordings showed that activation of C-fiber axons required approximately tenfold higher stimulus amplitudes than A/{beta}-fiber axons during ePNS. In contrast, DRG stimulation within a narrow amplitude range robustly activated both small- and large-diameter DRG neurons, with putative C-fiber afferents comprising 57% of the activated population, indicating markedly reduced differential activation thresholds compared with ePNS. Analysis of published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets revealed high NaV1.6 expression in TRPV1-positive C-fiber nociceptors. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated prominent clustering of NaV1.6 in the stem axons of most DRG neurons, including small-diameter C-fiber afferents, whereas NaV1.6 was absent from C-fiber axons in the sciatic nerve. NEURON simulations further showed that NaV1.6 clustering at the stem axon is a key determinant of activation thresholds during DRG stimulation. Conclusions: These findings identify a structural and molecular mechanism underlying the efficient activation of C-fiber afferents by DRG stimulation and provide mechanistic insight into the superior therapeutic efficacy of DRG stimulation for the treatment of C-fiber mediated chronic pain.

">Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Environmental and Genetic Models of Parkinsons Disease Highlights the Role of Purine Metabolism.</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, with many cases being attributed to environmental contaminant exposures. Paraquat (PQ), is a pesticide and environmental neurotoxicant that has been strongly associated with increased risk of PD. PQ is known to be a weak inhibitor of complex I of the electron transport chain, and while its acute toxicity is well understood, the underlying mechanism by which PQ exposure contributes to PD pathophysiology remains unclear. Additionally, the mechanism of PQ neurotoxicity has yet to be fully characterized and linked to genetic forms of PD. Given that PD is a heterogeneous disease with both genetic and environmental determinants, we sought to systematically compare the proteomic changes that occur in different genetic and environmental models of PD. In this study, we leveraged untargeted omics approaches to differentiate between systemic, peripheral, and CNS-specific changes in the proteome. We did this by performing a comparative proteomic analysis on the heads and bodies of Drosophila models of PQ ingestion and neuronal -synuclein expression in males. Additionally, we validated the findings with metabolomic analysis of male and female brain stems from a murine PQ inhalation model using C57BL/6J mice. Our findings indicate shared dysregulated pathways across all models, highlighting similar mechanisms of action. Specifically, we identified a glia-specific role in purine nucleotide metabolism upstream of inosine catabolism, which may protect against PQ neurotoxicity. This work identifies potential early points for biomarker detection and potential targets for drug intervention.

">Vagally Mediated Heart Rate Variability During REM Sleep is Associated with Retention of Fear Extinction in Generalized Anxiety Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Fear extinction processes are central to the pathology and treatment of anxiety disorders. Emerging evidence implicates rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the consolidation of extinction memory. Separately, converging theory and empirical work suggest that vagally mediated heart rate variability (VmHRV) serves as a peripheral index of cortico-subcortical regulatory capacity relevant to extinction circuitry. On this basis, we tested the hypothesis that VmHRV during REM sleep would be associated with the retention of extinction memory in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Participants underwent a validated two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Subjective extinction retention (sERI) was quantified during a recall test 24 hours after learning, and ambulatory polysomnography was recorded on the intervening night. As hypothesized, higher REM VmHRV was significantly associated with better extinction retention. This association remained robust after controlling psychotropic medication use and REM density. In contrast, VmHRV during SWS or wakefulness, as well as other REM sleep measures, were not associated with extinction retention. These findings identify REM VmHRV as a significant predictor of extinction memory retention in GAD, extending prior findings in trauma-exposed individuals. We propose that reduced vagal tone indexes compromised prefrontal inhibitory control over amygdala and noradrenergic circuits, thereby impairing REM sleep-dependent consolidation. These results position VmHRV during REM sleep as a potential transdiagnostic biomarker of extinction memory processing and suggest that interventions enhancing vagal tone could improve treatment outcomes in anxiety disorders.

">Gaussian Process Inference Reveals Non-separability of Positionand Velocity Tuning in Grid Cells</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) support spatial navigation by responding to multiple variables, including position, speed, and head direction. While tuning curves for each of these variables has been examined individually at the level of single-cells, less is known about the conjunctive coding of grid cells for these properties. To investigate this, we analyzed neural recordings of freely foraging rats and constructed four-dimensional (4D) tuning curves across 2D position and 2D velocity. In order to combat the sparse sampling of such a large behavioral space, we applied Gaussian Process (GP) methods to estimate firing rate at un-sampled points. Comparison GP model-derived tuning curves to those predicted by a fully separable model revealed that some cells exhibited significant non-separability of position and velocity tuning, and suggested a data coverage threshold necessary to observe this non-separability. In summary, our use of GPs allowed us to distinguish interactions in position-velocity tuning across a 4D behavioral space that have not been apparent in 2D analyses.

">Shared Transcriptomic Signatures in Perilesional and Contralesional Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Stroke induces a transient period of heightened plasticity during which functional recovery is most pronounced. Work in rodent models of stroke has identified key mechanisms in both the ipsilesional and contralesional cortex that contribute to functional and structural post-stroke plasticity. To date, most gene expression studies have focused on the infarct core and the immediately surrounding tissue, peri-lesional cortex (PLC). We sought to understand whether the contralesional cortex (CLC), a region that shows robust structural and molecular remodeling despite its distance from the lesion, mounts a distinct transcriptional response to stroke. Direct comparisons of molecular pathways governing these regions, particularly across sexes, are limited. To address this gap, we performed bulk RNA sequencing of the PLC and CLC at 7 days post-stroke, a critical time point for initiating repair, in male and female mice. Our results indicate that despite distinct positions from the lesion, both regions share a robust upregulation of inflammatory signaling, with Gene Ontology enrichment indicating activation of cytokine signaling, leukocyte activation, and gliogenesis pathways. Further analysis of this shared gene expression signature revealed reactive microglia signaling as the dominant pathway. Surprisingly, the CLC did not show a distinct transcriptional response. These findings were consistent across males and females, which also showed similar CLC-derived corticospinal tract axonal sprouting at 6 weeks post-stroke. Together, these findings support a shared microglia-centered neuroinflammatory transcriptional response in the PLC and CLC and suggest that microglial reactivity is a key early process for post-stroke cortical plasticity in both male and female mice.

">Attention level assessment by means of HRV data extracted from fNIRS signals</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention is an important requirement for high performance in all cognitive processes. Quantifying the level of sustained attention to prevent attention lapses is therefore necessary for effective human-machine interfacing. Furthermore, sustained attention evaluation can help diagnose and treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. Attention level can be assessed by brain and heart signals. This study employed functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and the heart rate variability (HRV) information extracted from the fNIRS signals to differentiate the rest and three levels of sustained attention states. Sustained attention states are induced by three modified versions of continuous performance tests (CPT). Eight subjects engaged in three sessions of attention tests. fNIRS brain signals were recorded from the right prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. HRV information was then extracted by processing the fNIRS signals. For attention classification, support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF) algorithms with mutual information based feature selection were applied on the fNIRS and HRV data, both separately and together. In the classification of the three levels of attention using fNIRS and HRV data, the LDA classifier showed the best performance accuracy of (80.9 +/- 1.5%) and (56.2 +/- 1.0%), respectively. For two-class classification between the rest and the attention states (all together), the accuracies of (98.9 +/- 0.3%), (95.6 +/- 1.2%), and (99.5 +/- 0.2%) were obtained using the RF classifier on the fNIRS, HRV, and combined data, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HRV data for classifying sustained attention states. Moreover, using the combined fNIRS and HRV data provides better classification accuracy.

">Single Plaque Proteomics Reveals the Composition and Dynamics of the Amyloid Microenvironment in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques that form complex microenvironments in the brain.. However, the molecular composition of these plaques and their temporal regulation are not well defined. Here, we developed a sensitive workflow for quantitative proteomic profiling of single plaques using refined laser capture microdissection and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (LCM-DIA-MS). From >200 plaques and control regions in AD mouse models (5xFAD and APP-KI) and human brains, we quantified >7,000 proteins, revealing stage-dependent, cell-type-related remodeling of the amyloid proteome (amyloidome). Temporal profiling uncovered early immune and lysosomal activation followed by engagement of RNA processing and synaptic pathways. Cross-model and cross-species analyses determined a conserved amyloidome including APOE, MDK, PTN, and HTRA1, validated by co-localization in imaging analysis. Network analysis highlighted modules in lipid transport, vesicle organization, and autophagy. These findings establish amyloid plaques as conserved, dynamic multicellular hubs that link amyloid accumulation to downstream cellular events.

">ExSEnt for explainable dementia detection: disentangling temporal and amplitude-driven complexity boosts EEG-based classification</a></h4>

              
                Early detection of dementia enables timely intervention and better care planning. Electroencephalography, being accessible and noninvasive, offers a practical avenue for monitoring pathological alterations in neural activity. Classical biomarkers like the theta-to-alpha power ratio TAR along with complexity measures, are common methods that are usually evaluated and used for dementia detection. In this study, we aimed to assess the discriminative ability of a novel entropy-based family of measures, Extrema-Segmented Entropy (ExSEnt), summarized by multiple robust statistics per subject for dementia, along with classical measures, and evaluate the incremental value of these metrics. We analyzed an EEG dataset comprising healthy controls, individuals with Alzheimer's disease, or frontotemporal dementia. Following preprocessing and group-level analyses of independent components, we focused on source-space activity from the prefrontal cortex and visual association cortices, regions implicated in early disease. From these sources, we computed complexity metrics: Sample Entropy, Katz Fractal Dimension, Higuchi Fractal Dimension, and Hurst exponent and ExSEnt metrics along with TAR and band-limited power at delta, beta, low, and high gamma bands. Using stability-based selection with elastic net logistic models, we identified a reliable set of discriminative features and quantified their cross-subject robustness. This framework isolates interpretable and trustworthy source-local biomarkers from single-region time series. We observed that the alpha/theta temporal entropy measures (ExSEnt) are selected as the most reliably informative metrics in the left prefrontal cortex, yielding a classification performance comparable to what was recently reported with high-dimensional deep learning methods for this dataset, with a simple logistic regression model on a single brain source.

">A Real-Time Functional Localization Method Based on Dynamic Connectivity for Coupled Brain Regions</a></h4>

              
                In the rapidly growing field of dynamic connectivity (dyC)-based real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) neurofeedback training, participants receive feedback on the dynamical coupling of brain nodes based on real-time dynamic connectivity measurements between multiple regions-of-interest. Given the fundamental role of regions-of-interest in this context, their signal-to-noise-ratio is critical. In closely related activity-based rtfMRI neurofeedback, region-of-interest selection is guided by functional localization methods informed by the BOLD-signal during a functional localizer experiment conducted prior to neurofeedback. However, methods that account for dynamic coupling of multiple brain regions remain lacking. Here, we develop a method based on dynamic connectivity between two brain areas that aligns with conventional activity-based localization approaches and is applicable for rtfMRI-NF. The proposed pipeline adapts processing steps from activity-based methods and was successfully implemented in a dyC-informed neurofeedback study. We observed a significant increase in dyC signal-to-noise-ratio during the localizer experiment and the first three blocks of neurofeedback training. Importantly, dyC values also correlated with anxiodepressive symptom levels, serving as proof of sensitivity, as changes in dyC reflect not only task-related neural dynamics but also individual differences in anxiodepressive traits. Our findings demonstrate that functional localization methods can be extended to dynamic connectivity, improving rtfMRI feedback accuracy, and with evidence to serve as sensitive measure for emotional states. This approach may enable precise targeting of coupled brain regions in neurofeedback and holds potential for personalized clinical applications, with broader implications beyond neurofeedback discussed.

">Distinct neural dynamics in prefrontal and premotor cortex during flexibleperceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms underlying flexible perceptual decisions, where the mapping between sensory input and motor action changes depending on context, remain unclear. Here we show that prefrontal and premotor cortex use distinct neural dynamics to implement different computations during flexible decisions. We trained monkeys to discriminate the dominant color of a red-green checkerboard and report their decision by choosing one of two targets. By randomizing the target configuration on a trial-by-trial basis, we ensured a flexible mapping between color (red vs. green) and action choice (left vs. right), necessitating a nonlinear exclusive-or (XOR) computation. We found that neural dynamics in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) led to higher-dimensional population representations than those in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Neural activity in DLPFC first separated by target configuration, then by color choice and action choice after stimulus onset, reflecting the XOR computation. In contrast, neural dynamics in PMd led to lower-dimensional representations that only reflected action choice, the output of the XOR computation. These higher-dimensional representations in DLPFC enabled earlier decoding of both color choice and action choice compared to PMd, and were strongest in anterior and ventral DLPFC. These findings reveal distinct computations by neural dynamics: prefrontal cortex implements flexible sensorimotor mappings through high-dimensional representations while dorsal premotor cortex reflects only the selected action.

">Visual search is constrained by the variability of object-category templates</a></h4>

              
                Real-world visual search is often performed at the category level: we search for shoes or bags without knowing their exact features in advance. This requires categorical search templates that accommodate the inherent variability within the target category. Here, we examine how the variability in search templates across categories constrains visual search performance. We quantify template variability by measuring variability in object drawings from a large online dataset (Experiment 1) and from a controlled lab-based drawing task (Experiment 2) and in turn relate this variability to performance in categorical search. Across both experiments, higher category variability, and thus broader search templates, were associated with slower responses. Moreover, the observer's most prioritized object template predicted their search performance better than other observers' templates, indicating that individual differences in template variability shape visual search. Together, our findings demonstrate that naturalistic visual search is governed by structured variability across both object categories and observers.

">Population receptive field properties of the human visual claustrum zone</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum is a thin, bilateral sheet of grey matter between the insula and putamen that stands out by its high interconnectivity with almost the entire cortex. Despite continuing research in humans and animals, its functional role remains largely unknown. In the present study, we explored the topographic organization of the recently described human visual claustrum zone. We performed a population receptive field (pRF) analysis on the 7T retinotopy dataset of the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (N = 181, 109 female) comparing the visual claustrum with established visual field properties of the lateral geniculate nucleus, the primary visual cortex, and higher-level topographic maps of the dorsal and the ventral stream. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the human visual claustrum showed several topographic properties typical for visual areas, including a representational bias towards the contralateral visual field, and a pRF size increase with increasing eccentricity. At the same time, the claustrum also exhibited a positive eccentricity gradient along the posterior-anterior axis, an extended representation of the visual periphery compared to other areas and a lack of horizontal meridian bias. These latter two properties highlight the claustrums role as a higher-level nucleus which is less dependent on sensory input. This study is the first to characterize the topographic organization of the visual claustrum zone in humans, highlighting its uniqueness among the known visually responsive regions.

">Deep Learning Reveals Cross-Modal Neural Representations of Auditory and Visual Mental Imagery in MEG</a></h4>

              
                Mental imagery provides a unique window into the brain's ability to internally simulate sensory experiences, offering valuable insights for both cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface (BCI) research. This study examined the neural representations of imagined auditory and visual stimuli using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and assessed the ability of machine learning models to decode these mental processes. MEG data were recorded from 18 right-handed participants during auditory and visual imagery tasks and source-reconstructed within modality-specific cortical regions of interest. We compared a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a linear logistic regression model within a subject-specific classification framework. Both approaches achieved above-chance decoding accuracies, with the CNN outperforming the linear model in the auditory task, whereas the linear model showed slightly higher accuracy for visual imagery. Notably, the CNN achieved significant decoding performance even when trained on non-task-relevant cortical regions, indicating that imagined stimuli are represented in distributed and partially overlapping neural networks across modalities. This cross-modal decoding capability highlights the potential of deep learning models to capture complex, multimodal neural patterns and suggests that future brain-computer interfaces could benefit from integrating auditory and visual information. A secondary, behavioral analysis revealed correlation of memory capacity and individual learning preferences with decoding performances, suggesting that individual cognitive differences may further shape the quality of neural representations. Together, these findings advance our understanding of cross-modal mental imagery and point toward more flexible and personalized approaches in BCI design.

">Impacts of heminode disruption on auditory processing of noisy sound stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Hidden hearing loss (HHL) is an auditory neuropathy characterized by altered auditory nerve responses despite normal hearing thresholds. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that permanent disruptions to heminode positions in spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) fibers can contribute to these deficits. However, the interaction between heminode disruption and noisy backgrounds ubiquitous in daily listening remains unexplored. This study investigates how background noise affects auditory processing with these peripheral disorders and how deficits propagate to downstream sound localization circuits in the superior olivary complex. We developed computational models of SGN fibers with mild and severe degrees of heminode disruption, subjected to sinusoidal tone stimuli in the presence of background noise with varying spectral characteristics. We analyzed the phase-locking of SGN fiber responses to the stimulus tone and modeled the subsequent effects on interaural time difference (ITD) sensitivity in the medial superior olive (MSO) using a binaural localization network. We found that near-tone-frequency noise disrupted SGN phase locking through cycle-to-cycle variability in spike phases, with effects consistent across tone frequencies. Mild heminode disruption produced frequency-dependent degradation in SGN phase locking, with effects observed only at higher frequencies tested (600-1000 Hz), without reducing overall firing rates. Critically, the effects of noise and heminode disruption were additive, with combined exposure leading to reduced ITD sensitivity and large temporal fluctuations in MSO responses. Severe heminode disruption, which additionally reduced firing rates at the SGN fibers and subsequent stages, produced profound localization deficits across all frequencies tested. Thus, our model results suggest that noisy environments exacerbate auditory deficits from peripheral disorders implicated in HHL and could potentially impair speech intelligibility through degradation in localization ability. This model may be useful for understanding the downstream impacts of SGN neuropathies.

">Cell type-resolved proteomics reveals intra- and intercellular signalingin Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) arises from pathological interactions among diverse brain cell types, but cell-specific proteomic changes remain underexplored. Here, we present deep proteomic profiling of sorted or proximity-labeled brain cells from AD mouse models (5xFAD and AppNL-G-F) at multiple ages, quantifying 13,411 proteins in microglia (three subtypes), astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and neurons. We identified 3,028 differentially abundant proteins across these cell types, the majority of which were not detected in bulk proteomic datasets, and constructed cell type-specific networks to define functional modules and hub proteins. Comparison with transcriptomic data revealed that ~30% of proteomic changes are RNA-independent. Further analyses uncovered cross-cell type signaling proteins conserved in human AD brains, such as pleiotrophin (Ptn), which is transcriptionally enriched in astrocytes but accumulates in microglia. Importantly, recombinant PTN directly activates induced microglia-like (iMG) human cells. Thus, these findings provide a comprehensive cell type-resolved proteomic atlas of AD models, highlighting novel intra- and intercellular signaling events.

">Neuronal synapses are stabilised by activity-dependent vesicular release from oligodendrocyte precursor cells</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent regulation of synapses has long been attributed to interactions between neurons alone. Here, using in vivo imaging in the zebrafish visual system we show that one type of glia called the oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) closely interacts with pre-synapses of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons, and exhibits activity-dependent Vamp2/3-mediated vesicular release. Critically, blocking OPC vesicle release using botulinum toxin, and silencing OPC activity integration through dampening calcium signalling, destabilises RGC pre-synapses. These observations suggest that OPCs provide a non-neuronal pathway for activity-dependent feedback to shape circuit wiring.

">Enhanced Ba2+-sensitive inward rectifying potassium conductance reduces intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary auditory cortex of Fmr1 knockout mice</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is frequently associated with auditory hypersensitivity and altered cortical processing, yet the intrinsic ionic mechanisms shaping auditory cortex excitability remain incompletely defined. Here, we tested whether subthreshold conductances contribute to compensatory changes in intrinsic excitability in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the primary auditory cortex (AC) in Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mice. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute slices from juvenile mice (P28-P42) and quantified passive properties, firing output, synaptic potentials, and subthreshold currents under pharmacological isolation. Compared with wild type (WT), Fmr1-KO L2/3 neurons displayed a more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, reduced input resistance, elevated rheobase, prolonged first-spike latency, and reduced firing across depolarizing steps, consistent with a hypoexcitable state. Bath application of BaCl2 depolarized the membrane, increased input resistance, and restored firing output and rheobase toward WT levels, indicating that a Ba2+-sensitive potassium conductance strongly constrains excitability in Fmr1-KO neurons. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed a larger Ba2+-sensitive inwardly rectifying (Kir-like) current in Fmr1-KO neurons, supporting increased functional Ba2+-sensitive inwardly rectifying conductance. In contrast, blocking Ih with ZD7288 produced modest changes in passive properties but induced genotype-dependent effects on excitability and enhanced synaptic activity and EPSP summation preferentially in Fmr1-KO neurons, consistent with a role for Ih in input filtering rather than setting basal conductance. Together, these findings identify enhanced Ba2+-sensitive potassium conductance as a primary determinant of the Fmr1-KO subthreshold conductance state in AC L2/3 pyramidal neurons, suggesting an intrinsic homeostatic mechanism that stabilizes output in the presence of elevated excitatory drive.

">Nullcline Analysis Provides Dynamic Mechanisms for the Differences in Electrical Activity of Distinct Subpopulations of Midbrain Dopamine Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Previously, electrophysiological differences between subpopulations of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons were identified based on projection targets, including distinct responses to hyperpolarization and in the regularity of pacemaking. Here we explored single-compartment models of three subpopulations of DA neurons, projecting to medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (VTA-mNAcc), dorsomedial striatum (SNc-DMS) or dorsolateral striatum (SNc-DLS). We reduced the dimensionality to a phase plane consisting of membrane potential and one slow variable, either total slow potassium conductance or Kv4 channel inactivation. Nullclines are curves on which the rate of change of each variable is zero, given the value of the other variable. The voltage nullclines had three branches: upper spiking, unstable middle, and lower quiescent branch. Recruitment of Kv4 channels by the more prominent after-hyperpolarizing potential (AHP) in the DA-DMS and DA-DLS models channels stabilized pacemaking by creating a restorative moving fixed point along the quiescent branch. The slow inactivation of KV4 channels dominated and regularized the dynamics during the interspike interval; a dominant slow process may be a general mechanisn for stable regular pacemaking in a frequency range between 1-10 Hz. In contrast, the smaller AHP in VTA-mNAcc models prevented recruitment of this Kv4-mediated moving fixed point, which increased the sensitivity to synaptic inputs. On rebound from hyperpolarization the ability to produce robust ramps reverses between the DA neurons: now VTA-mNAcc projecting DA models fully recruited Kv4 channels and produced stable ramp-like pauses, whereas SNc-DLS projecting cells recruited significant regenerative inward CaV3 channels that overwhelmed Kv4 channels and produced  rebound bursts.

">ASCL1 and OLIG2 Expression Dynamics Control Glial Cell Fate and Regional Diversity in the Dorsal Forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Gliogenesis is a multistep process that begins with the specification of glial progenitors (GPs) into migrating and proliferating precursor cells, which later differentiate into mature astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. How these developmental processes are coordinated to generate the diverse glial lineages in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in the brain remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor ASCL1 serves as a direct mechanistic link between glial cell fate specification, migration, proliferation, and differentiation in the dorsal forebrain. Notably, ASCL1 is dynamically expressed in GPs, initiating in the ventricular zone (VZ), peaking in the intermediate zone (IZ), but is downregulated once GPs enter the cortical plate. Lineage tracing of ASCL1+ GPs demonstrates that they subsequently co-express OLIG2 to generate both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in an outside-in pattern starting from the upper cortex inward to the corpus callosum, the opposite pattern of neurogenesis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments further reveal that a sustained ASCL1 expression is essential for inducing sufficient levels of OLIG2 required to specify oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) fate. Interestingly, a persistent ASCL1 expression also maintains OPCs into postnatal stages by promoting their self-renewal while suppressing their differentiation into postmitotic oligodendrocytes. Together, these findings establish ASCL1 as a key regulator of the spatiotemporal order of glial lineage diversity in cortical GM and callosal WM and implicate ASCL1 dysregulation as an underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of gliomas.

                <p>Nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is characterized by the interaction of multiple oscillations essential for memory consolidation, alongside a dynamic arrhythmic 1/<I>f</I> scale-free background that may also contribute to its functions. Recent spectral parametrization methods, such as fitting oscillation and one-and-over-F and irregular resampling auto-spectral analysis, enable the dissociation of rhythmic and arrhythmic components in the spectral domain; however, they do not resolve these processes in the time domain. Instantaneous measures of frequency, amplitude, and phase&ndash;amplitude coupling (PAC) are thus still confounded by fluctuations in arrhythmic activity. This limitation represents a pitfall for studies of NREM sleep relying on instantaneous estimates to investigate oscillatory coupling. To address this limitation, we introduce "Rhythms and Background" (RnB), a novel wavelet-based methodology designed to dynamically denoise time series data of arrhythmic interference. This enables the extraction of purely rhythmic time series, suitable for enhanced time-domain analyses of sleep rhythms. We first validate RnB through simulations, demonstrating it accurately estimates the spectral profiles of individual and multiple oscillations across a range of arrhythmic conditions. We then apply RnB to publicly available intracranial electroencephalogram sleep recordings, showing that it provides an improved spectral and time-domain representation of hallmark NREM rhythms. Finally, we demonstrate that RnB significantly enhances the assessment of PAC between cardinal NREM oscillations, outperforming traditional methods that conflate rhythmic and arrhythmic components. This methodological advance offers a substantial improvement in the analysis of sleep oscillations, providing greater precision in the study of rhythmic activity critical to NREM sleep functions.</p>

                <p>There are a wide variety of commercially available antibodies for labeling microglial cells based on different protein targets, as well as antibodies for the same protein target made in different species. While this array of targets and hosts allows for flexibility in immunohistochemical experiments, it is important to validate that different antibodies provide comparable and accurate immunodetection prior to experimental data collection. We found that a commercially available anti-Iba1 antibody, made in goat, produces irregular staining patterns in specific regions of the mouse brain in both sexes, prompting a further investigation into the phenomenon. This Iba1-goat antibody displayed increased numbers of labeled cells when compared with expression of a CX3CR1-GFP reporter and IHC detection of P2RY12, two common microglial markers. Furthermore, immunodetection by other common anti-Iba1 antibodies made in rabbit and chicken did not display the excessive cell labeling when compared with the CX3CR1-GFP reporter. Upon further investigation, this Iba1-goat antibody was observed to highly colocalize with vasopressin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SON), the two main sites of vasopressin production in the brain. Other anti-Iba1 antibodies made in other species did not show this same colocalization with vasopressin. Finally, this effect was species-specific, as Wistar rats did not display erroneous cell labeling by the Iba1-goat antibody. In sum, the present study employs both qualitative and quantitative data to highlight the importance of validating antibody efficacy and specificity in a region- and species-specific manner.</p>

                <p>by Jiayi Liu, Jonathan E. Ron, Giulia Rinaldi, Ivanna Williantarra, Antonios Georgantzoglou, Ingrid de Vries, Michael Sixt, Milka Sarris, Nir S. Gov</p>

Cell migration <i>in vivo</i> is often guided by chemical signaling, i.e., chemotaxis. For immune cells performing chemotaxis in the organism, this process is influenced by the complex geometry of the tissue environment. In this study, we use a theoretical model of branched cell migration on a network to explore the cellular response to chemical gradients. The model predicts the response of a branched cell to a chemical gradient: how the cell reorients its internal polarity and how it navigates through a complex environment up a chemical gradient. We then compare the model’s predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of a laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and neutrophils migrating <i>in vitro</i> inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the subcellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as qualitative characteristics of the large-scale migration, suggesting that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, which explains the functionality of these immune cells.

                <p>by Yin Guo, Izaskun Mallona, Mark D. Robinson, Limin Li</p>

The integration of single-cell multi-omics data provides a powerful approach for understanding the complex interplay between different molecular modalities, such as RNA expression, chromatin accessibility and protein abundance, measured through assays like scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and CITE-seq, at single-cell resolution. However, most existing single-cell technologies focus on individual modalities, limiting a comprehensive understanding of their interconnections. Integrating such diverse and often unpaired datasets remains a challenging task due to unknown cell correspondences across distinct feature spaces and limited insights into cell-type-specific activities in non-scRNA-seq modalities. In this work, we propose BiCLUM, a Bilateral Contrastive Learning approach for Unpaired single-cell Multi-omics integration, which simultaneously enforces cell-level and feature-level alignment across modalities. BiCLUM first transforms one modality, such as scATAC-seq, into the data space of another modality, such as scRNA-seq, using prior genomic knowledge. It then learns cell and gene embeddings simultaneously through a bilateral contrastive learning framework, incorporating both cell-level and feature-level contrastive losses. Across multiple RNA+ATAC and RNA+protein datasets, BiCLUM consistently outperforms or matches existing integration methods in both visualization and quantitative benchmarks. Importantly, BiCLUM embeddings preserve biologically meaningful regulatory relationships between chromatin accessibility and gene expression, as evidenced by significantly higher gene–peak correlations than random controls. Downstream analyses further demonstrate that BiCLUM-derived embeddings facilitate transcription factor activity inference, identification of cell-type-specific marker genes, functional enrichment, and cell–cell interaction mapping. Comprehensive hyperparameter sensitivity and ablation analyses further establish BiCLUM as a robust and interpretable framework that not only achieves effective cross-modal alignment but also retains the underlying regulatory and functional landscape across single-cell modalities.

                <p>by Tsukushi Kamiya, Mircea T. Sofonea, Michael France, Nicolas Tessandier, Ignacio G Bravo, Carmen Lia Murall, Jacques Ravel, Samuel Alizon</p>

The vaginal microbiota is associated with the health of women and newborns alike. Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort. The insights gleaned from this study shed light on potential pathways for BV prevention and treatment.

                Background Using herbal medicine and supplements in treatment of pediatric diarrhea is used by around 80% of people worldwide. Sagwa is popularly used mainly in rural areas in Iraq. Potential toxicity may include neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic and cardiotoxic effects. Aim This study was carried out to determine the morbidity and mortality linked to Sagwa use in acute gastroenteritis in infants with contributing factors. Patients and Methods A prospective case-control study in Al-Fallujah, Iraq from July 1st, 2022, to Jan 1st, 2023. The participants were infants with acute diarrhea who were admitted to pediatric wards and emergency departments. The cases were those infants with diarrhea who have been given Sagwa. Controls were age- and sex-matched who had acute diarrhea without use of Sagwa. The data of patients included: the number of times of having Sagwa, the duration between exposure and hospital admission, duration of hospital stay, the grandmother responsibility, the severity of dehydration, the presence of renal failure, the need for dialysis, convulsion, coma and death. Results The study included 50 cases and 50 controls. No significant differences in age and sex were observed but there was a significant association with rural residence, not educated mothers, grandma responsibility, severe dehydration, convulsions, and death. No significant differences were observed considering renal failure, dialysis and coma. A highly significant association was observed between oral & scalp administration routes and convulsions and renal failure. Conclusion Sagwa use in infants with diarrhea is dangerous and contributes to morbidity and mortality which are preventable. Cultural education against its use should target mothers and grandmothers in rural areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-183/v1?src=rss">Mechanisms of Neuroimmune Interactions in Stress Physiology, Health Implications, and Emerging Therapeutic Targets. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress provokes maladaptive neuroimmune responses that disrupt the balance between the central nervous system and immune regulation. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) system, and peripheral immune circuits sustains microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The process is responsible for driving persistent neuroinflammation. These changes impair synaptic plasticity, compromise blood-brain barrier integrity, and predispose individuals to psychiatric illness, cognitive dysfunction, and systemic comorbidities. Recent advances reveal key molecular mechanisms, including glucocorticoid receptor resistance, epigenetic reprogramming, and cytokine-neurotransmitter cross-talk that explain how stress reshapes brain-immune communication. This review critically examines the evidence linking chronic stress to neuroimmune dysfunction, emphasizing both translational challenges and therapeutic opportunities. Emerging interventions such as cytokine blockade, microglial modulation, specialized pro-resolving mediators, neurosteroids, and microbiome-based strategies highlight the potential of mechanism-based treatments. However, clinical translation is hampered by heterogeneity in inflammatory phenotypes, limited biomarker validation, and insufficient longitudinal data. Future research must prioritize precision medicine approaches that integrate multi-omics profiling, sex- and hormone-specific analyses, and digital biosensing tools. By bridging neuroscience, immunology, and systems biology, targeted strategies can be developed to prevent and treat stress-related disorders more effectively.

                Background Epigenetic alteration through promoter DNA methylation is associated with gastric carcinogenesis. This study assessed the association between Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically cagA-positive strains, and MGMT promoter hypermethylation within the gastroduodenal disease spectrum in an Iraqi cohort. Methods The study conducted a case control study of 120 participants (40 endoscopy confirmed controls without gastroduodenal disease and 80 patients with gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, lymphoma, or gastric adenocarcinoma). Standard OGD biopsies were collected. H. pylori status was determined by rapid urease testing, selective culture on blood agar with biochemical identification, and PCR confirmation; cagA was detected by conventional PCR using validated primers and cycling conditions. Genomic DNA was separated and bisulfite treatment converted. MGMT promoter methylation was measured by methylation specific PCR primers and bisulfate treatment. Statistical analyses used chi-square or chi-square and reported odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results The results showed a significantly greater incidence of H. pylori than controls (72.5% vs. 0%; χ2=56.129, p<0.001; OR=210.60, 95% CI 12.42–3572.22). CagA was found in 56.3% of patients and 0% of controls (χ2=36.000, p<0.001; OR=103.82, 95% CI 6.17–1747.38). MGMT promoter hypermethylation was observed in 66.3% of patients, whereas none of the controls exhibited this condition (χ2=47.463, p<0.001; OR=157.58, 95% CI 9.33–2661.18). Methylation varied across disease categories (χ2(15)=66.433, p<0.001), exhibiting heightened hypermethylation in gastritis (acute/chronic), peptic ulcer disease, gastric lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma, whereas controls remained uniformly unmethylated. In the complete cohort, H. pylori positivity exhibited a significant correlation with hypermethylation (43/58 vs 10/62; χ2=40.892, p<0.001; OR=14.91, 95% CI 6.09–36.60), while cagA positivity demonstrated an even more pronounced association (41/45 vs 12/75; χ2=64.345, p<0.001; OR=53.81, 95% CI 16.24–178.31). There was a link between smoking and hypermethylation (χ2(2)=15.218, p<0.001), but sex, residence, chronic disease, and therapy were not significant (all p>0.10). Conclusions MGMT promoter hypermethylation is prevalent in gastroduodenal diseases in Iraqi cases, with H. pylori infection strongly correlated with MGMT hypermethylation, suggesting MGMT methylation as a biomarker for risk stratification.

                Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is still working on making a multilingual model that incorporates the Hungarian language. We introduce a hybrid Hungarian and English model, one of the biggest challenges is to recognize handwritten text. We are going to investigate a set of models in this research, such as TrOCR large-handwritten, leveraging PULI-BERT, and Roberta-base with Diet models. The digitization of documents, and the preservation of cultural heritage specifically, has long been a research problem related to text recognition. We use an extensive text on the recognition approach using pre-trained visual and language transformer models. We pre-train the TrOCR proposed by Microsoft researchers for both large and base models at the first phase and then fine-tune them on human data at the second stage. Then, leverage new pre-trained transformers models such as Roberta-base, and PULI-BERT, as decoders and Diet, Vit, and Beit as encoder models at the pre-training phase on generated synthetic data and then fine-tune them on a small amount of human-annotated data provided by (DH-Lab) researchers with augmentation and without augmentation. Developed using tiny-scale Synthetic data of around three-million-line text open-source corpus, and subsequently refined using tiny person-labeled datasets. Experiments showed that the best CER is 3.681 in the TrOCR large handwritten, and the best WER is 16.091 by leveraging the PULI-BERT with the Deit model. These fine-tuned models outperform the currently existing state-of-the-art TrOCR models on historical Hungarian handwriting, according to the benchmark results on the János Arany dataset.

                Background The contemporary world is undergoing rapid changes due to digitization and globalization, requiring institutions, especially in the financial sector, to adapt to complex multicultural and technological environments. Many organizations, particularly in the Iraqi financial sector, struggle to achieve effective smart governance and fully realize digital transformation due to limited integration of institutional cultural intelligence in their administrative and digital practices. Objective This study aims to examine the role of institutional cultural intelligence in enhancing digital transformation and smart governance at the Central Bank of Iraq, focusing on its cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral dimensions. Methods A quantitative field study was conducted using structured questionnaires distributed to 120 employees from senior and middle management at the Central Bank of Iraq. A total of 114 valid responses were analyzed. The study employed a descriptive-analytical approach to examine the relationships between institutional cultural intelligence, digital transformation, and smart governance. Results Institutional cultural intelligence was found to significantly contribute to digital transformation, explaining 62.9% of the variance, and had a moderate effect on smart governance, accounting for 26.5% of the variance. Behavioral intelligence emerged as the most influential dimension. Conclusions The findings indicate that fostering cultural and technical development programs is essential to strengthen digital integration, improve governance performance, and support strategic organizational outcomes. This study underscores the practical and managerial implications of leveraging institutional cultural intelligence to enhance both digital and governance capacities in financial institutions.

                Background Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children, predominantly among critically ill patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Early diagnosis has been shown to improve patient prognosis. The objective of this study was to understand the role of systemic inflammatory indices as predictors of sepsis in children admitted to the PICU. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted to compare systemic inflammatory indices between two groups: one with sepsis and another without sepsis. Of the 138 PICU patients, 69 had sepsis and 69 were grouped under non-sepsis. Systemic inflammatory indices were calculated for NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, SIRI, and PIV in both groups and compared. ROC analysis was conducted to measure the predictive value. Results NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, SIRI, and PIV were significant predictors of sepsis among PICU patients. NLR was the best predictor, with an AUC of 1.000 at a cut-off of 1.957, with 100% sensitivity and specificity. SIRI and SII had predictive powers, with AUCs of 0.950 and 0.944, respectively. With a sensitivity of 92.8% and specificity of 89.9%, the optimal cut-off for the SII was found to be 571727.208. Conclusion Systemic inflammatory indices are accurate predictors of sepsis in patients in The PICU, enabling them to diagnose and intervene at an early stage. Their use may reduce pediatric sepsis-related morbidity and mortality by enabling bedside diagnoses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-178/v1?src=rss">Risk Factors and Prognostic Impact of Depression and Anxiety in Gastric Cancer: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Gastric cancer is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. Patients often experience anxiety and depression, which are associated with a poor health-related quality of life. Furthermore, anxiety and depression have been associated with worse survival in patients with cancer. Therefore, this systematic review aims to identify the risk factors and prognostic impacts of anxiety and depression in gastric cancer. Methods We searched for relevant literature published up to April 7, 2025 from the MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest databases. We included studies that evaluated the risk factors and prognostic impact of anxiety and depression in gastric cancer. Studies that also included other types of cancers or only analyzed risk factors of psychological distress were excluded. Quality of studies was analyzed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was performed if the adjusted odds ratio for a specific risk factor was evaluated in ≥ 3 studies. Otherwise, only qualitative analysis was performed. Results Fourteen studies were included in the review with a total number of 31,660 patients. From the included studies, we identified various risk factors that were significantly associated with anxiety or depression. We classified those risk factors based on Engel’s biopsychosocial model. Meta-analysis for eligible risk factors showed that female sex (adjusted OR = 3.04; 95% CI 2.04–4.54) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR = 4.78; 95% CI 2.46–9.28) were independently associated with higher odds of depression in gastric cancer. Furthermore, most studies showed that anxiety or depression was associated with worse survival in patients with gastric cancer. Conclusions We identified various risk factors for anxiety and depression in gastric cancer based on the available literature. It is important to screen for anxiety and depression in gastric cancer because of their negative prognostic impact on the patients.

                Over the past decade, the statistical and reliability literature has seen an enormous rise in the number of various probability distributions. Many of them are designed to integrate, enhance, or add to traditional models. This rise shows that people are becoming more aware of empirical integrity, flexibility, and adaptability, especially when it comes to modeling income distributions, dependability difficulties, and longevity statistics. In this paper, more general and flexible distributions are provided by employing a technique that generates the T−R {Y} family distributions as well as a brief overview for this kind of family. This technique may be applied to agree with certain data distribution types, including very left, right, thin or heavy tailed distribution, or to develop new distributions that are very applicable and flexible. In this context, produces a distinct member of a new sub-family called the IDNAI distribution, which is referred to the Lomax–Rayleigh {Exponential} distribution. The most important statistical and mathematical characteristics of the new family distribution are discussed. In order to estimate the parameters of the new class distribution, two estimation techniques will be additionally presented: the maximum likelihood method (MLE) and the least square method (LS). In order to analyze the effectiveness of suggested estimation techniques, simulation tools have been constructed. The results of the comparison indicated that the maximum likelihood method performed better than the least squares approach in terms of bias and mean squared error criteria. However, the application of a real dataset showed that, depending on several kinds of information criteria, the new class distribution fit the data more effectively than the specific classical and moderate distributions.

                Objective To evaluate the association between Fusobacterium nucleatum and c-Myc expression in Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMDs) and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) and to explore its potential role in oral carcinogenesis. Materials and Methods A total of 32 histopathologically confirmed cases (18 OPMDs and 14 OSCC) were analyzed. Anaerobic cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect F. nucleatum. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess c-Myc expression. Statistical analysis was conducted using Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results F. nucleatum was detected in eight OSCC and two OPMD cases, with higher colony counts in OSCC. All samples were positive for c-Myc, but their expression levels varied. In OPMDs, positivity was mainly observed in the basal and suprabasal epithelial layers, whereas OSCC showed both peripheral and central tumor cell localization. F. nucleatum–positive OSCC cases demonstrated strong nuclear c-Myc staining (50–75% positive cells). Tobacco habits, particularly combined smoking and smokeless use, were more common in F. nucleatum–positive OSCC cases. Conclusion F. nucleatum colonization correlates with increased c-Myc expression in OPMDs and OSCC, supporting its possible role in microbially driven oral carcinogenesis. These findings suggest its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target.

                Background Environmental Awareness (EA) research is part of character education that is still ignored by most students in the era of globalization. The purpose of this research is to analyze the effectiveness and contribution of the Javanese Culture Ethno-Socioscientific Issues (Ethno-SSI) Learning Model in strengthening the EA of high school students. Methods The Design-based Research (DBR) with quantitaive and qualitative approaches. The research subjects were high school students in Wonosobo (Area 1), Boyolali (Area 2), and Temanggung Regency (Area 3) Central Java Province, Indonesia with a purposive sampling technique based on the distance of the district area to the city center (City, Middle, and Village Categories) (N = 9 high schools = 241 students). The data collection methods were standardized Fischer EA tests and questionnaires. The analysis techniques using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 25.0 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. Results The results of the study show that differences in school background are not the main factor in strengthening environmental awareness, but rather based on character and science learning habits. Based on the highest average EA, the Senior high schools (SMA) Village 2 Group (SMA-V2) of 85.0068, and the lowest group is SMA village 3 (SMA-V3) of 75.5648. Based on the ANOVA test, there are significant differences and influences between each SMA category. R Squared The multiple determination value of all high school groups with EA shows an R Squared value of 0.60, meaning that the size of the independent variable can influence EA by 60%. Conclusions The Javanese Ethno-SSI Cultural Model contributes to EA through learning designs that emphasize concern for respecting, being responsive, and preserving traditions and culture. The Ethno-SSI model is able to contribute to preserving traditions and culture by providing students with the opportunity to respond and find solutions to environmental problems.

                Background Data on Canalis Sinuosus (CS) morphology in South Asian populations remain limited, despite frequent anterior maxillary implant placements. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence, positional characteristics, and morphometric features of the CS in Indian adults using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and to assess sex-related differences. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 245 CBCT scans with intact maxillary incisors and canines. Multiplanar reconstructions were used to identify the CS and document its laterality, tooth relationship, and orientation. Measurements included canal diameter at the alveolar crest and distances to the alveolar crest, buccal cortical plate, and nasal floor. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Cohen’s κ. Sex differences were analyzed using χ2 and independent-samples t-tests (α = 0.05). Results CS was detected in 67.3% of individuals, with bilateral presentation in 55.9% and unilateral in 11.4%. Detection rates were similar between sides (left: 62.4%, right: 60.8%). The canal was most frequently adjacent to the lateral incisor (44.7% left, 50.3% right), and approximately half of the canals showed palatal orientation. The mean canal diameter was 0.8 mm. Mean distances to the alveolar crest, buccal cortical plate, and nasal floor were 9.2 mm, 7.0 mm, and 11.5 mm, respectively. Males showed significantly larger canal diameters on the left side (p = 0.008), greater buccal cortical distances bilaterally (p < 0.001), and larger right nasal floor distances (p = 0.011). Conclusions The CS is a frequently observed, typically bilateral anatomical structure in the anterior maxilla of Indian adults, mostly located palatal adjacent the lateral incisor. The morphometric and sex-specific data obtained provide valuable reference parameters for implant planning and minimizing surgical complications.

                Objective Physiologic gingival pigmentation may negatively impact smile esthetics, particularly in individuals with high smile lines. This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of three minimally invasive depigmentation techniques: microneedling with Triphala Curna, microneedling with vitamin C, and 445-nm diode laser ablation. Materials and Methods Eighteen systemically healthy patients with physiologic gingival pigmentation were enrolled and allocated into three groups (n = 6 each) via block randomization. Group 1 received microneedling followed by topical Triphala Curna application; Group 2 received microneedling with vitamin C; and Group 3 underwent diode laser depigmentation at a wavelength of 445 nm. In Groups 1 and 2, the procedure was repeated after two weeks. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months for gingival pigmentation (Peeran Index), gingival thickness, and patient satisfaction (VAS scores). Statistical analysis included paired and independent t tests, chi-square tests, and descriptive statistics, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results All the groups showed progressive clinical improvement. Complete depigmentation (grade 0) at 6 months was observed in 66.7% of patients in the Triphala group, 50.0% in the vitamin C group, and 33.3% in the laser group. Gingival thickness increased significantly in all groups, with the greatest increase observed in the Triphala group (from 1.10 ± 0.36 mm to 1.95 ± 0.41 mm, p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction also improved across all groups, with Triphala receiving the highest mean VAS score. No adverse events or pigmentation relapses were reported during study period. Conclusion Microneedling-assisted gingival depigmentation using Triphala Curna demonstrated the most favourable clinical and esthetic outcomes among the tested modalities. Results of vitamin C treatment were comparable to those of diode laser therapy, suggesting that herbal therapies combined with microneedling can serve as viable, biologically compatible alternatives to conventional laser techniques. Trial registration: CTRI/2025/09/095158.

                This article analyzes the determinants of consumers’ purchase and consumption of geographical indication (GI) agricultural products through a ten-year systematic review. There exist growing concerns about food safety, quality, and health, increasing consumer attention to origin labelled foods. GI agricultural products have gained a stable position in global food markets. This study pursues two objectives. First, it identifies and classifies the key determinants of GI agricultural product consumption reported in the literature. Second, it compares insights from five existing review studies on closely related themes to clarify what is already established and what remains contested. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a transparent and reproducible systematic literature review, including structured searching, screening, and data extraction procedures. The results summarize how consumers respond to GI cues and identify factors associated with heterogeneous responses across contexts. By integrating fragmented evidence, this review clarifies consumption relevant mechanisms and offers implications for GI governance and marketing, helping firms better understand consumer decision making and supporting value capture for farmers, producers, and regional stakeholders.

                Background Recent advances in computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) have ushered in a new era of restorative dentistry, facilitating the utilization of innovative materials such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK) in lieu of conventional metal alloys for removable partial dentures (RPDs). Methods This study aimed to scrutinize the retentive efficacy of RPD clasps fabricated from PEEK and cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy through Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Employing in vitro experimentation on Maxillary Kennedy Class I cases, two distinct experimental models were devised, each representing varying degrees of retentive undercuts to simulate diverse clinical scenarios. Employing the Rest Proximal Aker (RPA) clasp design for both materials, this investigation integrates a comprehensive consideration of material properties, FEA modelling, and meticulous data analysis to evaluate the mechanical performance of PEEK clasps within a simulated oral environment. These models were systematically refined using optimization algorithms to enhance the design of PEEK clasps. Results Extensive stress analysis, strain distribution mapping, and deformation profiling were performed under diverse loading conditions. The FEA outcomes reveal that both PEEK and Co-Cr alloys are suitable as materials for RPD clasps, each presenting distinct advantages; however, PEEK demonstrates a more promising prospect as a superior alternative to the Co-Cr alloy. Conclusions Material selection should be tailored to individual patient-specific considerations and clinician expertise. The analysis of the stress distribution, strain patterns, and deformation tendencies aids in pinpointing potential weak areas or failure zones, thereby guiding future design enhancements and clinical applications.

                Abstract* Background Indonesia faces a growing double burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly cancer. The latest data from the Global Cancer Observatory (Globocan) indicates over 408,661 new cases and 242,099 cancer-related deaths in 2022, with a projected 63% increase in the case burden between 2025 and 2040 without strategic intervention. Although a new legal framework through Health Law No. 17 of 2023 and the Minister of Health Decree (KMK) No. HK.01.07/MENKES/2180/2023 has mandated palliative care as an integral component of health services, its implementation still faces significant systemic barriers. Policy and Implications This policy brief analyzes the disconnection between the policy mandate and on-the-ground reality, identifying critical gaps in accessibility, healthcare workforce capacity particularly among nursesand financing mechanisms through the National Health Insurance (JKN) program. The failure to effectively integrate palliative care not only causes unnecessary suffering for millions of patients but also burdens the health system with inefficient costs and suboptimal end-of-life care, reflected in the high “financial toxicity” experienced by patients. Recommendations We recommend a four-pillar strategy: (1) Formalize and standardize palliative services within the JKN benefits package with a clear financing model to address regulatory ambiguity; (2) Develop a national competency-based palliative education and training strategy for all health workers, with a focus on empowering nurses in primary care; (3) Implement a decentralized and tiered palliative care delivery model centered on Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) to ensure equitable access; and (4) Launch a national public education campaign to destigmatize palliative care and increase awareness. Conclusion The integration of palliative care is not merely an option but a strategic and ethical imperative for achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Indonesia. It is a cost-effective investment to improve patients’ quality of life, support families, and ensure the sustainability of the national health system in facing future non-communicable disease challenges.

                Dopamine suppresses GABA release from striatal terminals in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Molinari et al. recently demonstrated that this suppression is frequency-dependent—instituting a high-pass filter on striatal ‘direct pathway’ transmission—and does not require dopamine receptors. Rather, dopamine upregulates serotonin, activating presynaptic 5HT1B receptors to exert its effects.
