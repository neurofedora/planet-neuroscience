                <p><b>Brain Sciences, Vol. 14, Pages 792: Echoes from Sensory Entrainment in Auditory Working Memory for Pitch</b></p>

	<p>Ongoing neural oscillations reflect cycles of excitation and inhibition in local neural populations, with individual neurons being more or less likely to fire depending upon the oscillatory phase. As a result, the oscillations could determine whether or not a sound is perceived and/or whether its neural representation enters into later processing stages. While empirical support for this idea has come from sound detection studies, large gaps in knowledge still exist regarding memory for sound events. In the current study, it was investigated how sensory entrainment impacts the fidelity of working memory representations for pitch. In two separate experiments, an 8 Hz amplitude modulated (AM) entraining stimulus was presented prior to a multitone complex having an f0 between 270 and 715 Hz. This &amp;amp;ldquo;target&amp;amp;rdquo; sound could be presented at phases from 0 to 2&amp;amp;pi; radians in relation to the previous AM. After a retention interval of 4 s (Experiment 1; n = 26) or 2 s (Experiment 2; n = 28), listeners were tasked to reproduce the target sound&amp;amp;rsquo;s pitch by moving their finger along the horizontal axis of a response pad. It was hypothesized that if entrainment modulates auditory working memory fidelity, reproductions of a target&amp;amp;rsquo;s pitch would be more accurate and precise when targets were presented in phase with the entrainment. Cosine fits of the average data for both experiments showed a significant entrainment &amp;amp;ldquo;echo&amp;amp;rdquo; in the accuracy of pitch matches. There was no apparent echo in the matching precision. Fitting of the individual data accuracy showed that the optimal phase was consistent across individuals, aligning near the next AM peak had the AM continued. The results show that sensory entrainment modulates auditory working memory in addition to stimulus detection, consistent with the proposal that ongoing neural oscillatory activity modulates higher-order auditory processes.</p>

                Lutein, a plant-derived xanthophyl-carotenoid, is an exceptional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituent found in food. High dietary intake of lutein is beneficial against eye disease, improves cardiometabolic health, protects from neurodegenerative diseases, and is beneficial for liver, kidney, and respiratory health. Lutein protects against oxidative and nitrosative stress, both of which play a major role in post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Lutein is an important natural agent for therapeutic use against oxidative and nitrosative stress in chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. It can also potentially inhibit spike protein-induced inflammation. Rich dietary supplementation of lutein, naturally derived in non-biodegradable Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), can most optimally be used against oxidative and nitrosative stress during post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Due to its high oleic acid (OA) content, EVOO supports optimal absorption of dietary lutein. The main molecular pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces pathology, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated B cells (NF-κB) and activated protein (AP)-1, can be suppressed by lutein. Synergy with other natural compounds for spike protein detoxification is likely.

                Background when family planning methods not use, there is a higher chance of high fertility, which raises health risks for both mother and infant and lowers quality of life by limiting access to jobs employment, education, and nutrition. Unsatisfactory needs and poor family planning use can be explained by fear of negative impacts, rejection from couples, limits in knowledge, and social condemnation. Objectives To understanding the Middle East women’s barriers about make decisions and use of family planning methods Methodology A descriptive and analytic (cross sectional) study, conducted at six Arabic countries includes a non-probability (purposive sample) consist of (198) women. Which were selected according to inclusion criteria that are women in reproductive age, primiparous and multiparous mothers, and mothers who attended primary healthcare centers. Results Women are with average age of 32.23±7.9 years in which the highest percentage is seen with age group of 30-39 (40.4%). women have high affective barrier to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.60); have high behavioral barriers to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.56); and have high cognitive barriers to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.56). So, the mean scores indicate high among most of affective, behavioral, and cognitive barriers. Conclusions There are many potential barriers which can negatively impact the Middle East women’s decision about their reproductive life (affective, behavioral and cognitive) barriers. Despite the fact that family planning faces several challenges in the Middle East, governments and civil society organizations are working to find solutions to improve access to family planning services, promote education, hold candid conversations about reproductive health with local communities. Empowering the role of nurse in family planning to educate the couples about contraceptive methods and how to help them to choice the appropriate method.

                Background Medical imaging has seen significant advancements through machine learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These technologies have transformed the analysis of pathological images, enhancing the accuracy of diagnosing and classifying cellular anomalies. Digital pathology methodologies, including image analysis, have improved cervical cancer diagnostics. However, existing commercial platforms are often costly and restrictive, limiting customization and scalability. Methods CINNAMON-GUI is an open-source digital pathology tool based on CNNs for classifying Pap smear images. Transitioning to a Shiny app in Python, it offers enhanced user interface and interactivity. The application supports dynamic web interactions, advanced features for image analysis, and state-of-the-art CNN models tailored for digital pathology. Key features include intuitive UI components, real-time image and plot generation, memory-efficient data handling, and robust training capabilities with customizable CNN architectures. The tool also integrates with Labelme for defining regions of interest and allows testing on external biospecimens. Results Model A (seed 42, 100 epochs) and Model B (same architecture with adjusted augmentation parameters) were compared. Model A stabilized with training accuracy around 0.88 and validation accuracy around 0.913. Model B showed improved performance with training accuracy around 0.91 and validation accuracy around 0.95. Feature mapping highlighted critical morphological aspects, improving classification accuracy. Model B reduced misclassification errors significantly compared to Model A. Conclusions CINNAMON-GUI demonstrates the potential of an open-source platform in digital pathology, providing transparency and collaborative opportunities. The tool enhances diagnostic accuracy through feature map analysis and optimized CNN training. Future development aims to extend its application to other cancer types, leveraging its dynamic and user-friendly interface for broader use in diagnostics.

                <p>by Jiaping Liu, Zhenglun Cai, Paul Gustafson, Daniel J. McDonald</p>

To understand the transmissibility and spread of infectious diseases, epidemiologists turn to estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number. While many estimation approaches exist, their utility may be limited. Challenges of surveillance data collection, model assumptions that are unverifiable with data alone, and computationally inefficient frameworks are critical limitations for many existing approaches. We propose a discrete spline-based approach that solves a convex optimization problem—Poisson trend filtering—using the proximal Newton method. It produces a locally adaptive estimator for instantaneous reproduction number estimation with heterogeneous smoothness. Our methodology remains accurate even under some process misspecifications and is computationally efficient, even for large-scale data. The implementation is easily accessible in a lightweight R package rtestim.

                Background The acquisition and development of prosodic aspects of vocal intonation are of special interest within the larger context of language acquisition. Method The present study explored the developmental trajectories of infant prosodic abilities from 4 to 16 months of life with an intensive time points assessment. Several aspects were considered: an acoustic analysis of infant vocal productions with specific software, the analyses of all the prosodic variables associated with the fundamental frequency (F0 mean, F0 range, and F0 final contours), the individual variability and the complexity of the vocal productions of the infants. Results The multi-level analysis evidenced specific prosodic developmental trajectories that differ for the different kind of vocal productions since the first months of life. Conclusions The findings suggest that in the second half of the first year of life infants show an intonational repertoire that may help manage interactions with their caregiver and that individual variability has to be taken in consideration when assessing infants’ prosody.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1403/v2?src=rss">Comparative Analysis of Psychological Well-Being and Emotional Education in Graduate Students [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The growing importance of emotional intelligence in academic and professional contexts has generated a need to explore its linkage with psychological well-being. Furthermore, understanding how various demographic and academic factors can influence students' emotional perception and management is crucial for optimizing educational and intervention strategies. In this context, the primary purpose of this study was to analyze the existing relationship between emotional education and psychological well-being in graduate students. Methods The objective was to conduct a comparative analysis of perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) in different study programs offered at a specific university. The methodology, framed within a positivist paradigm, was based on a quantitative approach and examines the responses of 1,522 university students using the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24). Results This tool, which is divided into three dimensions (emotional attention, emotional clarity, and emotional repair), was analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and ANOVA tests to determine demographic and academic influences on the scores. The findings indicate deficiencies in the areas of Emotional Attention and Emotional Repair, contrasting with a marked prevalence in Emotional Clarity. Variables such as sex, age, and field of study demonstrated an influence on the dimensions of PEI. Notably, significant differences in emotional perception were found between sex and academic fields. Conclusions Specifically, training directed towards empathy proved to be a prominent factor in the perception of emotional competencies. This study highlights the influence of demographic and academic variables on emotional competencies, underscoring the need to adapt strategies in education and therapy.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is considered essential for several forms of declarative memory, including spatial and social memory. Despite the extensive research of the classic subfields of the hippocampus, the fasciola cinerea (FC)—a medially located structure within the hippocampal formation—has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we performed a morpho-functional characterization of principal neurons in the mouse FC. Using in vivo juxtacellular recording of single neurons, we found that FC neurons are distinct from neighboring CA1 pyramidal cells, both morphologically and electrophysiologically. Specifically, FC neurons displayed non-pyramidal morphology and granule cell-like apical dendrites. Compared to neighboring CA1 pyramidal neurons, FC neurons exhibited more regular in vivo firing patterns and a lower tendency to fire spikes at short interspike intervals. Furthermore, tracing experiments revealed that the FC receives inputs from the lateral but not the medial entorhinal cortex and CA3, and it provides a major intra-hippocampal projection to the septal CA2 and sparser inputs to the distal CA1. Overall, our results indicate that the FC is a morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct subfield of the hippocampal formation; given the established role of CA2 in social memory and seizure initiation, the unique efferent intra-hippocampal connectivity of the FC points to possible roles in social cognition and temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>

                Background The response of heart rate to changes in exercise intensity is comprised of several dynamic modes with differing magnitudes and temporal characteristics. Investigations of empirical identification of dynamic models of heart rate showed that second-order models gave substantially and significantly better model fidelity compared to the first order case. In the present work, we aimed to reanalyse data from previous studies to more closely consider the effect of including a zero and a pure delay in the model. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 22 treadmill (TM) and 54 cycle ergometer (CE) data sets from a total of 38 healthy participants. A linear, time-invariant plant model structure with up to two poles, a zero and a dead time is considered. Empirical estimation of the free parameters was performed using least-squares optimisation. The primary outcome measure is model fit, which is a normalised root-mean-square model error. Results A model comprising parallel connection of two first-order transfer functions, one with a dead time and one without, was found to give the highest fit (56.7 % for TM, 54.3 % for CE), whereby the non-delayed component appeared to merely capture initial transients in the data and the part with dead time likely represented the true dynamic response of heart rate to the excitation. In comparison, a simple first-order model without dead time gave substantially lower fit than the parallel model (50.2 % for TM, 47.9 % for CE). Conclusions This preliminary analysis points to a linear first-order system with dead time as being an appropriate model for heart rate response to exercise using treadmill and cycle ergometer modalities. In order to avoid biased estimates, it is vitally important that, prior to parameter estimation and validation, careful attention is paid to data preprocessing in order to eliminate transients and trends.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) reside in the brain and participate in the mechanism of neurogenesis that permits the brain to generate the building blocks for enhancement of cognitive abilities and acquisition of new skills. The existence of NPCs in brain has opened a novel dimension of research to explore their potential for treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. The present study provides novel insights into the intracellular mechanisms in neuronal cells proliferation, maturation and differentiation regulated by Quinic acid (QA). Furthermore, this study might help in discovery and development of lead molecule that can overcome the challenges in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The growth supporting effect of QA was studied using MTT assay. For that purpose, hippocampal cell cultures of neonatal rats were treated with different concentrations of QA and incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. Gene and protein expressions of the selected molecular markers nestin, neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1), neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), neuronal differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuroligin (NLGN) and vimentin were analyzed. QA-induced cell proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal progenitor cells was also accompanied by significantly increased expression of progenitor and immature neuronal marker, mature neuronal marker and differentiating factor, that is, nestin, Tuj-1, NeuN and NeuroD1, respectively. On the other hand, vimentin downregulation and constant GFAP expression were observed following QA treatment. Additionally, the effects of QA on the recovery of stressed cells was studied using in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). It was observed that hippocampal cells were able to recover from OGD following the treatment with QA. These findings suggest that QA treatment promotes hippocampal neurogenesis by proliferating and differentiating of NPCs and recovers neurons from stress caused by OGD. Thus, the neurogenic potential of QA can be explored for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1382/v3?src=rss">The impact of energy releasing B-vitamin intake on indices of obesity and cardiac function: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background B vitamins play a crucial role in the balance and metabolism of energy. Energy metabolism mainly benefits from the B-complex vitamins. Specifically, decarboxylation, transamination, acylation, oxidation, and reduction of substrates that are ultimately employed in energy intake require thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B6. Vitamin deficiency could lead to chronic disease occurrence. Objectives To assess the impact of energy-releasing B-vitamins intake (B1, B2, B3, and B6) on selected indices of obesity and cardiac function. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed on 491 apparently healthy adults (18-64 years old) between January and May 2019 at Hashemite University, Jordan. Anthropometric measurements were taken, lipid profiles were analyzed, and indices of obesity and cardiac function were calculated. The typical dietary intake of B1, B2, B3, and B6 vitamins was calculated. Results Conicity index (CI) and abdominal volume index (AVI) scores significantly decreased with the increased adjusted vitamin B1 and B6 intake. Also, body roundness index (BRI), weight-adjusted-waist index (WWI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) scores were decreased with the increase of adjusted B6 intake (p<0.05). The total sample showed a significant inverse weak correlation between energy-adjusted intake of B1 and AVI (r= -0.156, p=0.001) and BRI (r= 0.111, p=0.014). Similar correlations were detected among male participants between energy-adjusted B1 intake and BAI, AVI, and BRI. Female participants had a significant weak inverse correlation between BAI and energy-adjusted B2 (r= -0.180, p=0.029) and B6 intake (r= -0.212, p=0.010). Only B1, the vitamin, significantly explained 2.43 and 1.24% of changes observed in the AVI and BRI scores, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusions Increasing the consumption of B1, B2, and B6 may significantly lower values of indices of obesity and cardiac function regardless of sex differences. Thus reducing the occurrence of obesity and related coronary heart diseases.

                Abstract* Background Recent advancements in online gambling have significantly increased the popularity and participation in gambling activities among the general population, specifically the young generations. These changes are reshaping gambling behaviors, attracting a growing number of enthusiasts. This paper describes a dataset that maps online gambling activities among young individuals in Portugal, providing insights into their gambling prevalence, habits, behaviors, preferences, and potential antecedents and consequences of these activities. Methods A survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,993 young people in Portugal, aged between 18 and 34, to gather data on their activities. This methodology involved a quantitative telephone survey conducted in March and April 2023, utilizing quota sampling to ensure representation across various regions. The data collection process employed Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and involved rigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy and reliability. Conclusion The dataset generated from this survey provides valuable insights into the patterns of online gambling activities among young Portuguese individuals. It allows researchers to explore potential risk factors, including gambling-related harm, and to understand the sociodemographic factors influencing gambling behaviors. The findings can inform interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of online gambling among youth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-892/v1?src=rss">A Revolutionary Device for Endovascular Aortic Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Pilot Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has been the gold standard since it was established in 1991. Various graft configurations have been developed to overcome the limitations of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), including contralateral gate cannulation (CGC). We propose a new device and technique intended to simplify endovascular AAA repair, along with reports of its application in six patients. Intervention The Taofan and Kang (T&K) bidirectional endovascular aortic repair (B-EVAR (B-EVAR) device uses a main-body stent graft, two-limb extensions, and bare metal stent. The procedure involved accessing the right and left femoral arteries, followed by standard aortography evaluation using a pigtail catheter through the contralateral femoral access. The main body stent graft is deployed through ipsilateral femoral access using a balloon catheter, while the contralateral gate is cannulated with a hydrophilic coated wire. Both balloons were inflated simultaneously to ensure that the wires were in different lumens. Contralateral and ipsilateral extensions were deployed using a limb extension stent graft. Standard aortography evaluation was repeated. Result T&K B-EVAR pilot procedures proved successful in various cases, from simple to complex anatomy, and even with varied graft stent deployment strategies. None of the patients had complications or prolonged length of stay (LOS). Follow-up CT did not reveal any high-pressure endoleaks. Conclusion T&K B-EVAR has been proven to simplify endovascular AAA repair in six patients with excellent results. It is also reproducible, potentially universally applicable, and can offer operators ease of use, faster procedure times, reduced fluoroscopy times, and reduced contrast usage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-891/v1?src=rss">Case Report: The Sausage Technique using Anorganic Bovine Bone Mineral for Horizontal Bone Augmentation at the Crestal Part of a Posterior Mandibular Ridge: A Case Report. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Following tooth extraction, the alveolar bone goes through a natural remodeling process resulting in a significant bone resorption which may complicate dental implant placement without prior bone augmentation treatment. The sausage technique is a modified guided bone regeneration (GBR) method that has been successfully used for horizontal bone augmentation. This technique was developed to increase the bone growth at the alveolar crest. Although the sausage technique uses a combination of autograft chips and xenograft particles with a native collagen membrane, several studies have questioned whether adding autograft chips is essential for bone formation with guided bone regeneration. Moreover, harvesting the bone graft may increase the donor site morbidity and patient discomfort. This case report aimed to investigate the bone gain radiologically when the sausage technique was applied to treat a healthy, thirty-year-old patient with a horizontal defect in the posterior mandibular region using anorganic bovine bone mineral (ABBM) particles with Jason membrane, assess the implant primary stability in the augmented ridge, and present the surgical procedure steps in details. After nine months of healing, the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) revealed approximately 4.32 mm of bone gain at the alveolar crest in the buccal-lingual direction. The graft particles were well integrated into the newly formed bone. Two implants were inserted with an insertion torque of 35 N/cm. The ISQ values were 76 for the most anterior implant and 78 for the posterior implant. Within the limitations of this case report, the sausage technique using ABBM particles without autograft chips was an effective approach in achieving the prerequisite bone width at the crest in cases with horizontal bone defects.

                Background Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is considered the most suitable approach for relative performance efficiency calculation for banks as it is believed to be superior to traditional ratio-based analysis and other conventional performance evaluations. This study provides statistical evidence on the sampling error that can creep into performance evaluation studies using the DEA methodology. Inferences are drawn based on samples, and various preventive measures must be taken to eliminate or avoid sampling errors and misleading results. This study demonstrates the possibility of sampling error in DEA with the secondary data available in financial statements and reports from a sample set of banks. Methods The samples included 15 public sectors and five leading private sector banks in India based on their market share, and the data for calculating efficiencies were retrieved from the published audited reports. The sample data was collected from 2014 to 2017 because the banking sector in India witnessed a series of mergers of public sector banks post-2017, and the data after that would be skewed and not comparable due to the demonetization policy implementation and merger process-related consolidation implemented by the Government of India. The efficiency measures thus computed are further analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results We found statistically significant discrepancies in the efficiency score calculations using DEA approach when specific outlier values. Evidence is provided on statistically significant differences in the efficiencies due to the inclusion and exclusion of particular samples in the DEA. Conclusion The study offers a novel contribution along with statistical evidence on the possible sampling error that can creep into the performance evaluation of organizations while applying the DEA methodology.

These data link disrupted neoteny of human neurons to an ID/ASD gene mutation.

VAP-Pma1 interaction via an FFAT-like motif is crucial for pH homeostasis. They propose that VAPs sustain cytosolic pH by gearing their interactions between Pma1 and pH-sensory phospholipids at ER-PM contacts.

                Numerous lipids are heterogeneously distributed among organelles. Most lipid trafficking between organelles is achieved by a group of lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) that carry lipids using their hydrophobic cavities. The human genome encodes many intracellular LTPs responsible for lipid trafficking and the function of many LTPs in defining cellular lipid levels and distributions is unclear. Here, we created a gene knockout library targeting 90 intracellular LTPs and performed whole-cell lipidomics analysis. This analysis confirmed known lipid disturbances and identified new ones caused by the loss of LTPs. Among these, we found major sphingolipid imbalances in ORP9 and ORP11 knockout cells, two proteins of previously unknown function in sphingolipid metabolism. ORP9 and ORP11 form a heterodimer to localize at the ER-<i>trans</i>-Golgi membrane contact sites, where the dimer exchanges phosphatidylserine (PS) for phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) between the two organelles. Consequently, loss of either protein causes phospholipid imbalances in the Golgi apparatus that result in lowered sphingomyelin synthesis at this organelle. Overall, our LTP knockout library toolbox identifies various proteins in control of cellular lipid levels, including the ORP9-ORP11 heterodimer, which exchanges PS and PI(4)P at the ER-Golgi membrane contact site as a critical step in sphingomyelin synthesis in the Golgi apparatus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92595">Signatures of Bayesian inference emerge from energy-efficient synapses</a></h4>

              
                Biological synaptic transmission is unreliable, and this unreliability likely degrades neural circuit performance. While there are biophysical mechanisms that can increase reliability, for instance by increasing vesicle release probability, these mechanisms cost energy. We examined four such mechanisms along with the associated scaling of the energetic costs. We then embedded these energetic costs for reliability in artificial neural networks (ANNs) with trainable stochastic synapses, and trained these networks on standard image classification tasks. The resulting networks revealed a tradeoff between circuit performance and the energetic cost of synaptic reliability. Additionally, the optimised networks exhibited two testable predictions consistent with pre-existing experimental data. Specifically, synapses with lower variability tended to have (1) higher input firing rates and (2) lower learning rates. Surprisingly, these predictions also arise when synapse statistics are inferred through Bayesian inference. Indeed, we were able to find a formal, theoretical link between the performance-reliability cost tradeoff and Bayesian inference. This connection suggests two incompatible possibilities: evolution may have chanced upon a scheme for implementing Bayesian inference by optimising energy efficiency, or alternatively, energy-efficient synapses may display signatures of Bayesian inference without actually using Bayes to reason about uncertainty.

">Complex impact of stimulus envelope on motor synchronization to sound</a></h4>

              
                The human brain tracks temporal regularities in acoustic signals faithfully. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown complex modulations of synchronized neural activities to the shape of stimulus envelopes. How to connect neural responses to different envelope shapes with listeners' perceptual ability to synchronize to acoustic rhythms requires further characterization. Here we examine participants' motor and sensory synchronization to noise stimuli with periodic amplitude modulations (AM). We used three envelope shapes that varied in the sharpness of amplitude onset. In a synchronous motor finger-tapping task, we show that participants more consistently align their taps to the same phase of stimulus envelope when listening to stimuli with sharp onsets than to those with gradual onsets. This effect is replicated in a sensory synchronization task, suggesting a sensory basis for the facilitated phase alignment to sharp-onset stimuli. Surprisingly, despite less consistent tap alignments to the envelope of gradual-onset stimuli, participants are equally effective in extracting the rate of amplitude modulation from both sharp and gradual-onset stimuli, and they tapped consistently at that rate alongside the acoustic input. This result demonstrates that robust tracking of the rate of acoustic periodicity is achievable without the presence of sharp acoustic edges or consistent phase alignment to stimulus envelope. Our findings are consistent with assuming distinct processes for phase and rate tracking during sensorimotor synchronization. These processes may be underpinned by different neural mechanisms whose relative strengths are modulated by specific temporal dynamics of stimulus envelope characteristics.

">Synergistic control of axon regeneration and functional recovery by let-7 miRNA and Insulin signalling (IIs) pathways</a></h4>

              
                The capability of neurons to regenerate after injury becomes poor in adulthood. Previous studies indicated that loss of either let-7 miRNA or components of Insulin signalling (IIs) can overcome the age-related decline in axon regeneration in C. elegans. In this study, we wanted to understand the relationship between these two pathways in axon regeneration. We found that the simultaneous removal of let-7 and the gene for insulin receptor daf-2 synergistically increased the functional recovery involving posterior touch sensation following axotomy of PLM neuron in adulthood. Conversely, the loss of let-7 could bypass the regeneration block due to the loss of DAF-16, a transcriptional target of DAF-2. Similarly, the loss of daf-2 could bypass the requirement of LIN-41, a transcriptional co-factor of the let-7 pathway. Our analysis revealed that these two pathways synergistically control targeting of the regenerating axon to the ventral nerve cord, which leads to functional recovery. The computational analysis of the gene expression data revealed a large number of genes, their interacting modules, and hub genes under let-7 and IIs pathway are exclusive in nature. Our study highlights a potential to promote neurite regeneration by harnessing the independent gene expression program involving the let-7 and Insulin signalling pathways.

">Dynamic adaptation to novelty in the brain is related to arousal and intelligence</a></h4>

              
                How does the human brain respond to novelty? Here, we address this question using fMRI data wherein human participants watch the same movie scene four times. On the first viewing, this movie scene is novel, and on later viewings it is not. We find that brain activity is lower-dimensional in response to novelty. At a finer scale, we find that this reduction in the dimensionality of brain activity is the result of increased coupling in specific brain systems, most specifically within and between the control and dorsal attention systems. Additionally, we found that novelty induced an increase in between-subject synchronization of brain activity in the same brain systems. We also find evidence that adaptation to novelty, herein operationalized as the difference between baseline coupling and novelty-response coupling, is related to fluid intelligence. Finally, using separately collected out-of-sample data, we find that the above results may be linked to psychological arousal.

">TAM receptors mediate the Fpr2-driven pain resolution and fibrinolysis after nerve injury</a></h4>

              
                Nerve injury causes neuropathic pain and multilevel nerve barrier disruption. Nerve barriers consist of perineurial, endothelial, and myelin barriers. So far, it is unclear whether resealing nerve barriers fosters pain resolution and recovery. To this end, we analysed the nerve barrier property portfolio, pain behaviour battery, and lipidomics for precursors of specialized pro-resolving meditators (SPMs) and their receptors in chronic constriction injury of rat sciatic nerve to identify targets for pain resolution by resealing the selected nerve barriers. Of the three nerve barriers - perineurium, capillaries, and myelin - only capillary tightness specifically against larger molecules, such as fibrinogen, recuperated with pain resolution. Fibrinogen immunoreactivity was not only elevated in rats at the time of neuropathic pain but also in nerve biopsies from patients with (but not without) painful polyneuropathy indicating that sealing of the vascular barrier might be novel approach in pain treatment. 15R-HETE (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid), a precursor of aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4, were specifically upregulated at the beginning of pain resolution. Repeated local application of resolvin D1-laden nanoparticles or Fpr2 agonists sex-independently resulted in accelerated pain resolution and fibrinogen removal. Clearing macrophages (Cd206) and fibrinolytic pathways (Plat) were also induced while inflammation (Tnf) and inflammasomes (Nlrp3) were unaffected by this treatment. Blocking TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) and tyrosine kinase receptors linking haemostasis and inflammation completely inhibited all the effects. In summary, nanoparticles can be used as transporters for fleeting lipids, such as SPMs, and therefore expand the array of possible therapeutic agents. Thus, the Fpr2-Cd206-TAM receptor axis may be a suitable target for strengthening the capillary barrier, removing endoneurial fibrinogen, and boosting pain resolution in patients with chronic neuropathic pain.

">The interplay between motor cost and self-efficacy related to walking across terrain in gaze and walking decisions</a></h4>

              
                Movement-related decisions, such as where to step and which path to take, happen throughout each day. Shifts in gaze serve to extract task-relevant information necessary to make these decisions. We are only beginning to appreciate the factors that affect this information-seeking gaze behaviour. Here, we aimed to determine how a person's belief in their ability to perform an action (i.e., self-efficacy) affected gaze and path choice when choosing between walking paths with different terrains and/or lengths (reflecting different energetic costs). We demonstrated that, when manipulated separately (i.e., paths had different lengths or different terrains), participants looked longer and more frequently and chose the paths with either less expected energetic cost or those for which they had a higher self-efficacy rating. When encountering environments where paths differed in both length and terrain, participants directed gaze progressively more to the longer path as the self-efficacy rating of this path increased and the disparity in rating with the shorter (less costly) path grew; they also chose the higher-rated path more frequently regardless of path length. These results provide evidence for a contribution of self-efficacy and energetic cost in guiding gaze and walking decisions. Interestingly, self-efficacy beliefs appear to play a more dominant role in both behaviours.

                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is likely associated with complex transcriptional alterations in addiction-relevant brain regions. We characterize AUD-associated differences in cell type-specific gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the caudate nucleus by conducting a single-nucleus RNA-seq assay and a single-nucleus RNA-seq + ATAC-seq (multiome) assay on caudate tissue from 143 human postmortem brains (74 with AUD). We identified 17 cell types. AUD was associated with a higher proportion of microglia in an activated state and more astrocytes in a reactive state. There was widespread evidence for differentially expressed genes across cell types with the most identified in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, including genes involved in immune response and synaptic regulation, many of which appeared to be regulated in part by JUND and OLIG2. Microglia-astrocyte communication via interleukin-1 beta, and microglia-astrocyte-oligodendrocyte interaction via transforming growth factor beta 1 were increased in individuals with AUD. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis revealed potential driver genes of AUD, including ADAL, that may protect against AUD in medium spiny neurons and interneurons. This work provides a thorough profile of the effects of AUD in the human brain and identifies several promising genes for further study.

">Generating Synthetic Task-based Brain Fingerprints for Population Neuroscience Using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tb-fMRI) provides valuable insights into individual differences in the neural basis of cognitive functions because it links specific cognitive tasks to their evoked neural responses. Yet, it is challenging to scale to population-level data due to its cognitive demands, variations in task design across studies, and a limited number of tasks acquired in typical large-scale studies. Here, we present DeepTaskGen, a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach that enables us to generate synthetic task-based contrast maps from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. Our method outperforms several benchmarks, exhibiting superior reconstruction performance while retaining inter-individual variation essential for biomarker development. We showcase DeepTaskGen by generating synthetic task images from the UK Biobank cohort, achieving competitive or greater performance compared to actual task contrast maps and resting-state connectomes for predicting a wide range of demographic, cognitive, and clinical variables. This approach will facilitate the study of individual differences and the generation of task-related biomarkers by enabling the generation of arbitrary functional cognitive tasks from readily available rs-fMRI data.

">A dorsal hippocampus-prodynorphinergic dorsolateral septum-to-lateral hypothalamus circuit mediates contextual gating of feeding</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive regulation of feeding depends on linkage of internal states and food outcomes with contextual cues. Human brain imaging has identified dysregulation of a hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) network in binge eating, but mechanistic instantiation of underlying cell-types and circuitry is lacking. Here, we identify an evolutionary conserved and discrete Prodynorphin (Pdyn)-expressing subpopulation of Somatostatin (Sst)-expressing inhibitory neurons in the dorsolateral septum (DLS) that receives primarily dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampal inputs. DLS(Pdyn) neurons inhibit LHA GABAergic neurons and confer context- and internal state-dependent calibration of feeding. Viral deletion of Pdyn in the DLS mimicked effects seen with optogenetic silencing of DLS Pdyn INs, suggesting a potential role for DYNORPHIN-KAPPA OPIOID RECEPTOR signaling in contextual regulation of food-seeking. Together, our findings illustrate how the dorsal hippocampus has evolved to recruit an ancient LHA feeding circuit module through Pdyn DLS inhibitory neurons to link contextual information with regulation of food consumption.

">Cortical Complexity Alterations in Motor Subtypes of Parkinson's Disease: A Surface-Based Morphometry Analysis of Fractal Dimension</a></h4>

              
                Background: Based on motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) can be classified into tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes. This study aimed to investigate differences in cortical complexity and gray matter volume (GMV) between TD and PIGD. Methods: We enrolled 36 TD patients, 27 PIGD patients, and 66 healthy controls (HC) from the PPMI (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) database. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM) were utilized to assess differences in GMV, cortical thickness, and cortical complexity. Additionally, correlations between clinical data and structural changes were examined. Results: In comparison with HCs, PIGD patients exhibited a significant fractal dimension (FD) decrease in many cortical regions, such as the bilateral insula, right superior temporal, and left rostral middle frontal. Moreover, PIGD patients showed significant FD reduction in various regions, including the left supramarginal gyrus, left lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, left lateral occipital gyrus, and bilateral insula, compared to the TD group. A significant negative correlation between age and FD was observed in the left insula for the PIGD patients and in the bilateral insula for the TD patients. However, no significant differences were found in GMV, cortical thickness, or other complexity indices. Conclusion: Altered FD, particularly in bilateral insula, indicates that postural instability and gait disturbances in PD may result from a failure to integrate information from various structures, whereas parkinsonian tremor is not associated with this integration.

">Understanding Electric Brain Stimulation Through the Reciprocity Theorem</a></h4>

              
                Lee et al. recently reported robust, frequency-independent subthreshold membrane coupling to extracellular current stimulation across cell classes and brain regions, in both human and mice cortical slices. Specifically, small extracellular sinusoidal electrical stimulations (ES) at frequencies between 1-140 Hz induced a local oscillation in the extracellular potential, leading to sub-threshold (< 0.5 mV) sinusoidal potentials across the cell membrane of nearby cell bodies. Surprisingly, these induced changes in Vm did not decrease with frequency. This seems to imply that ES is a fundamentally different stimulus than equivalent intracellular stimulation that results in strong membrane filtering, caused by the frequency-dependent membrane capacitance. Here we would like to draw attention to the reciprocity theorem as a powerful and (to the best of our knowledge) as-of-yet-unused tool for understanding the effects of ES on neural dynamics, and this counterintuitive result in particular.

">Geometry representations along visual pathways in human spatial navigation</a></h4>

              
                The representation of geometric structures in the environments is key to self-localization during human spatial navigation. Its spatial organization in the visual system is not fully characterized. Using brain activity from 20 participants watching videos from identical realistic virtual environments under different weather and lighting conditions, we found a compact representation of scene geometric structures encoded in a large network of brain regions, allowing for reconstructing depth. It forms a continuous map composed of three parallel pathways that we jointly coin as "geometry visual pathways", starting from the primary visual cortex: the dorsal and medial pathways end in the intraparietal areas, while the ventral pathway arrives at the hippocampus via the parahippocampal gyrus. Furthermore, road types, a more abstract representation of geometry, are encoded in overlapping pathways excluding early visual cortex (V1, V2, V3). The geometry visual pathways provide new insights into the traditional dichotomy between "what" and "where" pathways.

">Constraint Induced Movement Therapy Confers only a Transient Behavioral Benefit but Enduring Functional Circuit-Level Changes after Experimental TBI.</a></h4>

              
                Although the behavioral outcome of Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is well known, and that a combination of CIMT and arm use training potentiates the effect, there has been limited study of the brain circuits involved that respond to therapy. An understanding of CIMT from a brain network level would be useful for guiding the duration of effective therapy, the type of training regime to potentiate the outcome, as well as brain regional targets that might be amenable for direct neuromodulation. Here we investigated the effect of CIMT therapy alone unconfounded by additional rehabilitation training in order to determine the impact of intervention at the circuit level. Adult rats were injured by controlled cortical impact injury and studied before and then after 2wks of CIMT or noCIMT at 1-3wks post-injury using a combination of forelimb behavioral tasks and task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 and 7wks post-injury and compared to sham rats. There was no difference in behavior or functional imaging between CIMT and noCIMT after injury before intervention so that data are unlikely to be confounded by differences in injury severity. CIMT produced only a transient reduction in limb deficits compared to noCIMT immediately after the intervention, but no difference thereafter. However, CIMT resulted in a persistent reduction in contralesional limb-evoked activation and a corresponding ipsilesional cortical plasticity compared to noCIMT that endured 4wks after intervention. This was associated with a significant amelioration of intra and inter-hemispheric connectivity present in the noCIMT group at 7wks post-injury.

">Bridging tuning and invariance with equivariant neuronal representations</a></h4>

              
                As we move through the world, we see the same visual scenes from different perspectives. Although we experience perspective deformations, our perception of a scene remains stable. This raises the question of which neuronal representations in visual brain areas are perspective-tuned and which are invariant. Focusing on planar rotations, we introduce a mathematical framework based on the principle of equivariance, which asserts that an image rotation results in a corresponding rotation of neuronal representations, to explain how the same representation can range from being fully tuned to fully invariant. We applied this framework to large-scale simultaneous neuronal recordings from four visual cortical areas in mice, where we found that representations are both tuned and invariant but become more invariant across higher-order areas. While common deep convolutional neural networks show similar trends in orientation-invariance across layers, they are not rotation-equivariant. We propose that equivariance is a prevalent computation of populations of biological neurons to gradually achieve invariance through structured tuning.

                Virtual Reality (VR) can be used to design and create new types of psychophysical experiments. Its main advantage is that it frees us from the physical limitations of real-life experiments and the hardware and software limitations of experiments running on 2D displays and computer graphics. However, color calibration of the displays is often required in vision science studies. Recent studies have shown that a standard color calibration of a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) can be very challenging and comes with significant drawbacks. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that allows for successful color calibration of an HMD and overcomes the disadvantages associated with other solutions. We utilize a new VR engine, Three.js, which offers several advantages. This paper details our setup and methodology, and provides all the elements required to reproduce the method, including the source code. We also apply our method to evaluate and compare three different HMDs: HTC Vive Pro Eye, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3. The results show that the HTC Vive Pro Eye performs excellently, the Meta Quest Pro performs well, and the Meta Quest 3 performs poorly.

">Minimally invasive activation of spared interneurons alleviates local CA1 hypersynchrony and behavioral deficits in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is associated with severe cognitive impairments including memory deficits. The dysfunction of hippocampal inhibitory neurons is proposed as a key mechanism and possible target for therapeutic approaches. However, the nature and extent of alterations in hippocampal inhibitory neurons remain unclear, as does their impact on behavioral impairments associated with TLE. Methods: We investigated the role of inhibitory neurons from the CA1 hippocampal region on memory deficits associated with TLE, considering both the survival and changes in the activity of a large population of interneurons. To this end, we used a combination of immunolabelling, calcium imaging, electrophysiology, human-applicable chemogenetic tools, and behavioral testing on a reliable mouse pilocarpine TLE model. Results: We show that in TLE mice with severely disturbed spatial behavior, CA1 major interneuron populations are spared from histological damages that affect the epileptic hippocampus (e.g., sclerosis). However, CA1 interneurons fire less in epileptic than in control conditions, resulting in increased synchronization and activity of the epileptic CA1 network in vitro. Restoring CA1 interneuron discharge using a chemogenetic strategy rescued CA1 activity and synchronization in vitro. In vivo, the minimally invasive chemogenetic activation of hippocampal interneurons does not affect generalized seizures but reduces behavioral alterations. Conclusions: Our data suggest that rescuing CA1 local network dynamics using interneurons as a lever could be sufficient to decrease behavioral deficits related to TLE.

                We investigated the effects of brain states on human perception and early visual response comparing focused wakefulness (ON state) to external inattention (OFF state). In two experiments, we investigated the temporal kinetics of brain states changes during stimulus processing and assessed fluctuations across extended periods of time. We used a classifier to distinguish between these states on a single trial level using theta activity in MEG sensors. We found that participants shifted from an ON to an OFF state as rapidly as two seconds. Visual target discrimination was comparable in both states, but reaction times were slower and more variable during the OFF state. Broad band high-frequency activity (BHA) recorded in MEG sensors covering the occipital cortex tracked target grating orientation. BHA was reduced during the OFF state but participants were still able to distinguish sensory information highlighting the role of BHA in visual perception across cognitive brain states.

">Anodal tsDCS restores the structure and function of the disrupted proprioceptive Ia synapses on spinal motoneurons in the SOD1 G93A mouse model of ALS</a></h4>

              
                An imbalance between cells' intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation levels is the basis of spinal motoneuron (MN) pathophysiology in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Recently, a restoration of the deficient Ia synaptic excitation of spinal MNs was achieved by applying acute trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) to presymptomatic SOD1 G93A mice. Here we investigate whether two-week repeated tsDCS applied to presymptomatic SOD1 animals can provoke spinal MN neuroplasticity and reduce the disease burden. Anodal, cathodal or sham polarisation of 100 microA was applied to P30-P35 SOD1 G93A mice; passive membrane properties and Ia excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) characteristics were investigated by intracellular recordings of spinal MNs in vivo. A second cohort of polarized animals was used to test the impact of our intervention on Ia synapse morphology, MN intracellular metabolic pathways activity, and disease markers. Anodal tsDCS evoked a strong increase in maximal Ia EPSPs, coupled with a significant upregulation of vesicular glutamate transporter levels and GlurR4 subunits of AMPA receptors at the Ia synapse. On the other hand, cathodal polarisation failed to induce any significant alteration to Ia synapse morphology but did increase both peak and plateau input resistance and recovered the abnormal paired-pulse ratio. Unexpectedly, the changes in MN electrophysiological profile and Ia synapse morphology did not translate into alterations of intracellular pathways activity and did not decrease the disease burden. Altogether our results indicate a strong polarity-dependent plasticity of spinal MNs in SOD1 G93A mice in response to tsDCS, which nevertheless appears insufficient to alter disease dynamics.

                Functional connectivity (FC)-based neural fingerprinting is an approach that promises to distinguish subjects within a cohort on the basis of the patterns of statistical dependencies between time series recorded mostly if not always noninvasively, with electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The message is that brain activity is what differentiates subjects, or in other words, what makes a neural fingerprint "unique". In EEG- and MEG-derived FC fingerprinting, the activity recorded at the sensors is projected back into cortical sources by means of an inverse model containing the shape of the head and its conductivity, and further averaged to obtain time series of regional activity, used to compute FC. In this study we investigated the role of the head model in fingerprinting. Through a set of experiments aimed to decouple recorded activity and head model for each subject, we found that the head model has a strong influence on the fingerprinting performance, according to two different sets of metrics.

">Evaluating permutation-based inference for partial least squares analysis of neuroimaging data</a></h4>

              
                Partial least squares (PLS) is actively leveraged in neuroimaging work, typically to map latent variables (LVs) representing brain-behaviour associations. Canonically, LVs are considered statistically significant if they tend to capture more covariance than LVs derived from permuted data, with a Procrustes rotation applied to map each set of permuted LVs to the space defined by the originals, creating an 'apples to apples' comparison. Yet, it has not been established whether applying the rotation makes the permutation test more sensitive to the true LVs in a dataset, and it is unclear if significant LVs can be drawn from data with no meaningful between-feature covariance. Accordingly, we performed PLS analyses across a range of simulated datasets with known latent effects, observing that the Procrustes rotation systematically weakened the null distributions for the first LV. By extension, the first LV was nearly always significant, regardless of whether the effect was weak, undersampled, noisy, or simulated at all. But, if no rotation was applied, all possible LVs tended to be significant as we increased the sample size of UK BioBank datasets. Meanwhile, LV strength and stability metrics accurately tracked our confidence that effects were present in simulated data, and allowed for a more nuanced assessment of which LVs may be relevant in the UK BioBank. We end by presenting a list of considerations for researchers implementing PLS permutation testing, and by discussing promising alternative tests which may alleviate the concerns raised by our findings.

">Effects of Aging, Fitness, and Cerebrovascular Status on White Matter Microstructural Health</a></h4>

              
                White matter (WM) microstructural health declines with increasing age, with evidence suggesting that improved cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may mitigate this decline. Specifically, higher fit older adults tend to show preserved WM microstructural integrity compared to their lower fit counterparts. However, the extent to which fitness and aging independently impact WM integrity across the adult lifespan is still an open question, as is the extent to which cerebrovascular health mediates these relationships. In a large sample (N = 125, aged 25-72), we assessed the impact of age and fitness on fractional anisotropy (FA, derived using diffusion weighted imaging, DWI) and probed the mediating role of cerebrovascular health (derived using diffuse optical tomography of the cerebral arterial pulse, pulse-DOT) in these relationships. After orthogonalizing age and fitness and computing a PCA on whole brain WM regions, we found several WM regions impacted by age that were independent from the regions impacted by fitness (hindbrain areas, including brainstem and cerebellar tracts), whereas other areas showed interactive effects of age and fitness (midline areas, including fornix and corpus callosum). Critically, cerebrovascular health mediated both relationships suggesting that vascular health plays a linking role between age, fitness, and brain health. Secondarily, we assessed potential sex differences in these relationships and found that, although females and males generally showed the same age-related FA declines, males exhibited somewhat steeper declines than females. Together, these results suggest that age and fitness impact specific WM regions and highlight the mediating role of cerebrovascular health in maintaining WM health across adulthood.

">Multiscale heterogeneity of white matter morphometry in psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Background: Interindividual variability in neurobiological and clinical characteristics in mental illness is often overlooked by classical group mean case control studies. Studies using normative modelling to infer person specific deviations of grey matter volume have indicated that group means are not representative of most individuals. The extent to which this variability is present in white matter morphometry, which is integral to brain function, remains unclear. Methods: We applied Warped Bayesian Linear Regression normative models to T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging data and mapped interindividual variability in person specific white matter volume deviations in 1,294 cases (58% male) diagnosed with one of six disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity, autism, bipolar, major depressive, obsessive compulsive and schizophrenia) and 1,465 matched controls (54% male) recruited across 25 scan sites. We developed a framework to characterize deviation heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, from individual voxels, through inter-regional connections, specific brain regions, and spatially extended brain networks. Results: The specific locations of white matter volume deviations were highly heterogeneous across participants, affecting the same voxel in fewer than 8% of individuals with the same diagnosis. For autism and schizophrenia, negative deviations (i.e., areas where volume is lower than normative expectations) aggregated into common tracts, regions and large scale networks in up to 35% of individuals. Conclusions: The prevalence of white matter volume deviations was lower than previously observed in grey matter, and the specific location of these deviations was highly heterogeneous when considering voxelwise spatial resolution. Evidence of aggregation within common pathways and networks was apparent in schizophrenia and autism but not other disorders.

">Individual alpha frequency tACS reduces functional connectivity across the default mode network</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Research on the influence of transcranial alternating current stimulation over alpha functional connectivity (FC) is scarce, and at the same time poses as a potential treatment for various diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effects of individualized alpha frequency tACS (IAF-tACS) on FC within the default mode network (DMN) in healthy individuals, particularly focusing on the precuneus (PCU) as a major hub within the network. Materials and Methods: 27 healthy participants were recruited, which underwent a 20-minute IAF-tACS session and three magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings: two pre-stimulation and one post-stimulation. Participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation or sham group. FC was evaluated through the corrected imaginary phase locking value (ci-PLV) and leakage corrected amplitude envelope correlation (AEC-c). Statistical analyses compared both Pre-Post FC ratio between groups through ratio t-tests and intragroup FC changes through repeated measures t-tests, with FDR correction applied to account for multiple comparisons. An additional analysis simulated the influence of the cortical folding on the effect of tACS over FC. Results: IAF-tACS significantly decreased AEC-c within the PCU and DMN in the stimulation group compared to the sham group, especially influencing antero-posterior links between hubs of the DMN. No significant changes were observed in ci-PLV connectivity metrics. Negative correlations were found between AEC-c FC changes and power alterations in posterior DMN areas, suggesting a complex interaction between cortical folding and electric field direction. Conclusions: Against our initial hypothesis, IAF-tACS reduced FC in the DMN, possibly due to phase disparities introduced by cortical gyrification. These findings suggest that tACS might modulate FC in a more complex manner than previously thought, highlighting the need for further research into the personalized application of neuromodulation techniques, as well as its potential therapeutic implications for conditions like Alzheimer's disease.

">Head down tilt 15° increases cerebral perfusion before recanalization in acute ischemic stroke: a pre-clinical MRI study.</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the therapeutic effect of head down positioning at -15{degrees} (head down tilt; HDT15) on cerebral collateral flow and infarct growth in a rat model of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke, using multimodal MRI. Twenty-eight Wistar rats were randomly assigned to HDT15 or flat position for 60 minutes, starting 30 minutes after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, followed by reperfusion. The perfusion shift analysis, comparing post- versus pre-treatment voxel-level changes in time-to-peak perfusion maps, showed a significant increase in cerebral perfusion in the HDT15 group (common odds ratio 1.50; 95% CI 1.41-1.60; p < 0.0001), but not in the flat group (common odds ratio 0.97; 95% CI 0.92-1.03; p = 0.3503). Infarct growth at 24 hours was + 31.4% in the flat group (343 versus 250 mm3; 95% CI 2.4 to 165.1; p = 0.0447) and + 15.4% in the HDT15 group (224 versus 192 mm3; 95% CI -26.9 to 85.9; p = 0.2272). Our findings indicate that HDT15 acutely increases cerebral perfusion in LVO acute ischemic stroke and provides a tissue-saving effect before recanalization. Further research is needed to develop HDT15 as an emergency therapy to acutely increase collateral flow in ischemic stroke prior to recanalization therapy.

">Understanding the Sport Viewership Experience using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                Subjective evaluation of a sport event in real time is normally assessed using self-report measures, but neural indices of evaluative processing may provide new insights. The extent of evaluative processing of a sporting event at the neural level may depend on the degree of emotional investment by the viewer, as well as the key moment of the game play being observed. Those with high ego involvement might show more activation within evaluative processing nodes, and this pattern may be most pronounced during critical moments of game play. In the current study, we examined neural activations within the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex during game play as a function of ego-involvement, using video clips featuring key moments in a European league ice hockey game. A total of 343 participants were pre-screened to identify 20 high and low ego-involved individuals. These subgroups then viewed a game segment containing 12 key play moments, while undergoing neuroimaging using fNIRS. Findings indicated more engagement of the dmPFC throughout all key moments for high ego-involved participants, but particularly during critical game moments. Overall, findings suggest that neural indices of evaluative processing might contribute meaningfully to understanding when emotionally invested individuals are most engaged in an action sequence during a sporting event.

">Transmission of Mixed Convergent Signals at the Mouse Retinogeniculate Synapse</a></h4>

              
                There are two broad modes of information transfer in the brain: the labeled line model, where neurons relay inputs they receive, and the mixed tuning model, where neurons transform and integrate different inputs. In the visual pathway, information transfer between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) neurons is primarily viewed as a labeled line. However, recent work in mice has demonstrated that different RGC types, encoding distinct visual features, can converge onto a dLGN neuron, raising the fundamental question of whether the dLGN transforms visual information. Using optogenetics we activated distinct RGC populations and assessed spiking output of dLGN neurons by in vivo recordings. We found that visual response properties of dLGN neurons driven by a specific RGC population largely matched properties of the activated RGCs. Furthermore, in vitro dual-opsin experiments demonstrate that strong functional convergence from distinct RGC types rarely occurs. Thus, retinogeniculate information transfer in mice largely adheres to a labeled line model.

">Sex-specific behavioral and thalamo-accumbal circuit adaptations after oxycodone abstinence.</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use disorder is marked by a progressive change in the motivation to administer the drug even in the presence of negative consequences. After long periods of abstinence, the urge to return to taking the drug intensifies over time, known as incubation of craving. Conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli, can acquire motivational properties and exert control over motivated behaviors leading to relapse. Although, preclinical data suggest that the behavioral expression of opioid use is similar between male and female rodents, we do not have conclusive results on sex differences on craving and relapse across abstinence periods. Here, we investigated the effects of abstinence from oxycodone self-administration on neurotransmission in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) pathway in male and female rats. Using optogenetics and ex vivo electrophysiology, we assessed synaptic strength and glutamate release probability in this pathway, as well as NAcSh medium spiny neurons (MSN) intrinsic excitability, in slices from rats which were subjected to either 1 (acute) or 14 (prolonged) days of forced abstinence after self-administration. Our results revealed no sex differences in oxycodone self-administration or somatic withdrawal symptoms following acute abstinence. However, we found a sex-specific enhancement in cue-induced relapse after prolonged, but not acute, abstinence from oxycodone self-administration, with females exhibiting higher relapse rates. Notably, prolonged abstinence led to similar increases in synaptic strength at PVT-NAcSh inputs compared to saline controls in both sexes, which was not observed after acute abstinence. Thus, prolonged abstinence results in a time-dependent increase in PVT-NAcSh synaptic strength and sex-specific effects on cue-induced relapse rates. These findings suggest that prolonged abstinence leads to significant synaptic changes, contributing to heightened relapse vulnerability, highlighting the need for targeted therapeutic strategies in opioid use disorder.

">Model selection for spectral parameterization</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological brain activity comprises rhythmic (periodic) and arrhythmic (aperiodic) signal elements, which are increasingly studied in relation to behavioral traits and clinical symptoms. Current methods for spectral parameterization of neural recordings rely on user-dependent parameter selection, which challenges the replicability and robustness of findings. Here, we introduce a principled approach to model selection, relying on Bayesian information criterion, for static and time-resolved spectral parameterization of neurophysiological data. We present extensive tests of the approach with ground-truth and empirical magnetoencephalography recordings. Data-driven model selection enhances both the specificity and sensitivity of spectral and spectrogram decompositions, even in non-stationary contexts. Overall, the proposed spectral decomposition with data-driven model selection minimizes the reliance on user expertise and subjective choices, enabling more robust, reproducible, and interpretable research findings.

">Tet2 loss suppress α-synuclein pathology by stimulating ciliogenesis</a></h4>

              
                There are no approved treatments that slow Parkinsons disease (PD) progression and therefore it is important to identify novel pathogenic mechanisms that can be targeted. Loss of the epigenetic marker, Tet2 appears to have some beneficial effects in PD models, but the underlying mechanism of action is not well understood. We performed an unbiased transcriptomic analysis of cortical neurons isolated from patients with PD to identify dysregulated pathways and determine their potential contributions to the disease process. We discovered that genes associated with primary cilia, non-synaptic sensory and signaling organelles, are upregulated in both early and late PD patients. Enhancing ciliogenesis in primary cortical neurons via sonic hedgehog signaling suppressed the accumulation of alpha-synuclein pathology in vitro. Interestingly, deletion of Tet2 in mice also enhanced the expression of primary cilia and sonic hedgehog signaling genes and rescued the accumulation of alpha-synuclein pathology and dopamine neuron degeneration in vivo. Our findings demonstrate the crucial role of Tet2 loss in regulating ciliogenesis and potentially affecting the progression of PD pathology.

	<p>Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) represents one of the core features of the disorder and has a significant impact on functional and rehabilitation outcomes of people living with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). The aim of this critical review is to highlight the most recent evidence on effective treatments available for CIAS, to discuss the current challenges in this field, and to present future perspectives that may help to overcome them. Concerning psychopharmacological approaches, among the most indicated strategies for the management and prevention of CIAS is to favor second-generation antipsychotic medications and avoid long-term and high-dose treatments with anticholinergic medications and benzodiazepines. Moreover, non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive remediation and physical exercise-based programs represent evidence-based interventions in the treatment of CIAS that have shown reliable evidence of effectiveness on both cognitive and functional outcomes. These treatments, however, are still delivered to people accessing mental health services with a diagnosis of CIAS in an uneven manner, even in high-income countries. Academic and clinical partnership and collaboration, as well as advocacy from service users, families, carers, and stakeholders&amp;amp;rsquo; organizations could help to reduce the bench to bedside gap in the treatment of CIAS. Future perspectives include the development of novel pharmacological agents that could be effective in the treatment of CIAS, the implementation of novel technologies such as telemedicine and virtual reality in the delivery of evidence-based interventions to improve accessibility and engagement, and further research in the field of non-invasive brain stimulation.</p>

                Background COVID-19 pandemics increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk during hospitalization, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Limited radiological diagnosis in pandemic requires a guided protocol for anticoagulant adjustment. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center as part of a quality improvement program evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation protocols. The study focused on implementing a guideline for anticoagulant dosing protocol based on dynamic changes in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The dosing guideline allowed for dose escalation from standard prophylactic levels to escalated prophylactic or therapeutic levels, depending on the patient's risk profile for VTE. The primary endpoints included in-hospital survival comparing between fix and dynamic adjustment treatment groups. Secondary endpoints encompassed major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events, incidence of breakthrough thrombosis, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, days of mechanical ventilator use, and survival duration. Findings Among the 260 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020. The patients received fixed anticoagulant dosage in 188, 72.3%) patients, while 72 (27.7%) were up-titrated according to the protocol. In-hospital survival at 30 days demonstrated superiority among patients whose anticoagulation was up-titrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (80.2%) compared to receiving fixed anticoagulant dosage (51.3%) (p=0.01). Bleeding events were significantly higher in up-titrate group (12.5%) compared to fixed anticoagulant dosage group (2.13%). Most of them are CRNMB. Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer-based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 holds promise in improving in-hospital mortality rates without a significant increase in fatal bleeding events.

                Background The danger of earthquakes poses a serious threat to people worldwide. One of the most significant challenges is preparing communities to cope effectively with this disaster. Therefore, understanding earthquake hazards is critically important for preparedness, mitigation, and an effective response to this threat. This report aims to observe and conduct a preliminary assessment of the degree to which community preparedness for earthquake disasters has been implemented. Methods Empirical data were obtained from survey respondents and interviews. The respondents were members of a community affected by the Cianjur earthquake, which occurred on November 21, 2022. The data were analysed using the mean range approach, based on Likert scales. Additionally, the Spearman correlation method was employed to indicate the relationship between community awareness and infrastructure readiness. Result Based on empirical evidence and preliminary analysis, it is evident that the preparedness of the community to respond effectively to earthquake catastrophes is inadequate. An apparent lack of readiness is observed in the inadequate construction of housing that fails to meet disaster standards, and the absence of disaster response facilities is notable. Conclusions Based on our initial assumption, it appears that knowledge related to disaster resilience in this area has not been adequately disseminated or socialized. However, this premise requires further investigation.

                Background The mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 has been commonly considered the best response to the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis. However, to assess its real-world overall effects, the best way can be the analysis of all-cause mortality by vaccination status. The UK is perhaps the only country which has made publicly available all-cause mortality data by vaccination status. Methods Data from April 2021 to May 2023 published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) were retrospectively analyzed by age groups and vaccination status; the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality was calculated against the corresponding unvaccinated groups. Results We found that across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs increased from a certain date, dependent on the age group. Across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs were initially much lower than 1. However, due to their increase, by a certain date for the 18-39, 80-89 and 90+ age groups they exceeded the reference value. For the other age groups, the date at which the SMR would reach 1 can be predicted, provided the trend is maintained. Non-COVID-19 SMRs’ trends were very similar. Their initial values much lower than 1 are suggestive of significant biases in the ONS dataset, leading to underestimate the risks for the vaccinated people, as it is implausible that COVID-19 vaccines protect against non-COVID-19 deaths. Conclusions The increase over time in all-cause death SMRs in vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated, and their excess from the reference values for certain age groups, should be carefully considered to understand the underlying factors. It would be desirable for other major countries to systematically collect all-cause mortality by vaccination status and, in the meantime, a moratorium on promoting mass vaccination campaigns should be implemented.

                <p>The frontal cortex-striatum circuit plays a pivotal role in adaptive goal-directed behaviors. However, it remains unclear how decision-related signals are mediated through cross-regional transmission between the medial frontal cortex and the striatum by neuronal ensembles in making decision based on outcomes of past action. Here, we analyzed neuronal ensemble activity obtained through simultaneous multiunit recordings in the secondary motor cortex (M2) and dorsal striatum (DS) in rats performing an outcome-based left-or-right choice task. By adopting tensor component analysis (TCA), a single-trial&ndash;based unsupervised dimensionality reduction approach, for concatenated ensembles of M2 and DS neurons, we identified distinct three spatiotemporal neural dynamics (TCA components) at the single-trial level specific to task-relevant variables. Choice-position&ndash;selective neural dynamics reflected the positions chosen and was correlated with the trial-to-trial fluctuation of behavioral variables. Intriguingly, choice-pattern&ndash;selective neural dynamics distinguished whether the incoming choice was a repetition or a switch from the previous choice before a response choice. Other neural dynamics was selective to outcome and increased within-trial activity following response. Our results demonstrate how the concatenated ensembles of M2 and DS process distinct features of decision-related signals at various points in time. Thereby, the M2 and DS collaboratively monitor action outcomes and determine the subsequent choice, whether to repeat or switch, for action selection.</p>

                Background: Phlebotomy is a medical procedure that is performed frequently in the blood collection activities of medical institutions. The procedure involves close interaction with different types of patients—some of whom are cooperative and others, who, for many reasons, are not (for example, patients who have a fear of needles). Blood extraction is an essential skill in several medical specialties, such as in laboratory sciences. Lesson planning in phlebotomy education is mainly focused on procedural skills, and very little attention is given towards teaching communication skills despite the close patient interaction in phlebotomy. In this paper, I propose a lesson plan for teaching communication skills to medical laboratory sciences and nursing students based on Gagne’s instructional design. Methods: The training session included two main parts: training session using Gange’s instructional design and at the end of the session, the participants were surveyed for the effectiveness of the training session. Results: 17 participants were included in the study. Overall, the majority of the participants were highly satisfied with the effectiveness of the training session in teaching communication skills with all seven survey questions receiving a mean score of 4.58 on a Likert scale of 1-5. Conclusion: We demonstrated the effectiveness of Gange’s instructional beyond theoretical lesson planning to teach communication skills through role-play in phlebotomy education.

                Background Preterm birth, which is child delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy, is the primary cause of perinatal mortality worldwide. Preterm birth remains a major public health challenge in Rwanda, affecting approximately 13.8% of birth. The World Health Organization estimates that 15 million babies are born prematurely each year. While the association between periodontitis and preterm deliveries is increasingly recognized, little is known about this link in Rwanda. This policy brief aims to bridge this knowledge gap by presenting the findings of a recent study investigating the prevalence of periodontitis among pregnant women in Rwanda and its association with preterm deliveries. This policy brief also aims to inform and guide decision making towards incorporating periodontal screening into the antenatal care package in Rwanda. This has the potential to improve pregnancy outcomes and contribute to improved oral health in the future. Policy outcome and Implications Contemporary evidence has shown a six-fold increased risk of preterm delivery for women with periodontitis in Rwanda, with a concerningly high prevalence (60%) among pregnant women. Additionally, nurses working in antenatal clinics displayed insufficient knowledge about gum disease. Actionable recommendations The adoption of basic periodontal screening within existing antenatal care packages is recommended. This, coupled with nurse training and public awareness campaigns, can empower women and healthcare professionals to prioritize oral health for better pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Integrating periodontal screening into antenatal care has the potential to significantly reduce preterm deliveries and contribute to a healthier future generation in Rwanda.

                Background Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, has emerged as a global health concern due to the migration of infected individuals. With its epidemiological complexity, by difficulty to obtain appropriate diagnoses and poor treatment, the search for novel therapeutic options remains. Methods In this context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies employing animal models to verify the progress in CD treatment. We searched the PubMed database for CD treatment studies published between 1990 and 2023, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Results Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that the fifteen treatment alternatives examined, mainly between 2010 and 2014, demonstrated efficacy in experimental CD models, evidenced by significant parasitemia reduction. Bis-triazole DO870 and VNI were effective in the acute and chronic phases, respectively. However, of these emerging therapies, only posaconazole and fexinidazole have progressed to clinical trials, yielding unsatisfactory outcomes as CD monotherapies Conclusions This meta-analysis highlights the existence of promising new drug candidates for CD treatment, but most remain in the preclinical stages. Those that reached clinical trials did not demonstrate optimal results, underscoring the ongoing challenges in CD therapy. Collaborative efforts among the academic community, pharmaceutical industries, funding agencies, and government agencies are urgently needed to accelerate the development of more effective medications against CD.

                Background: Mammary cancer, called breast cancer in humans, results from the abnormal growth of cells in the mammary glands that attack the surrounding tissue. The process of carcinogenesis at the molecular level can be monitored through the production of proteins as biomarkers for carcinogenesis. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) is a known carcinogenic compound. This study aimed to analyze the proteomic profile as critical data regarding DMBA-induced carcinogenesis in Sprague‒Dawley rats. Methods: Experimental animals were divided into two groups: a treatment group given DMBA at a dose of 10 mg/kg (intramammary) at intervals of 48 hours for a total of 10 doses, and a negative control group that was not given any treatment. Measurement of the total protein concentration was carried out using a spectrophotometer, and the data were analyzed using a t-test, while the characterization of protein profiles was carried out based on molecular weight data using SDS‒PAGE. Mammary gland histopathology was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Results: The results showed a significant (p<0.05) increase of 27% in the total protein concentration in the rat mammary cancer model. The results of proteomic characterization showed a protein profile containing proteins of 187, 169, 68, 64, 53, 41, 24, 18, and 14 kDa, which were suspected to be HER-2, Nischarin, COX-2, Albumine, Vimentin, ACTB, TNF, p16, and fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), respectively. Histopathology of the mammary glands showed an irregular and indistinct arrangement of the alveoli and extensive epithelial cell proliferation from the surface to the lumen of the mammary ducts, and the mammary stroma showed the formation of new epithelial cells, which were cancer cells that spread to surrounding tissue. Conclusions: The proteomic profile was strongly associated with morphological alterations in mammary carcinogenesis in a rat model of DMBA-induced mammary cancer.

                Background. The return to normality post-pandemic brought some inconveniences to the population, especially students. To evaluate the frequency of awake bruxism behaviors through the use of an app on smartphones in dental students returning to presential classes. Awake bruxism was evaluated with the creation of an app that according to the authors evaluates: relaxed jaw muscles, dental contact, jaw effort, clenching teeth and teeth grinding, 5 frequent oral conditions in the population. The frequency of awake/daytime bruxism (AB) in healthy individuals when comparing other populations with possible risk factors for additive bruxism (psychological factors, depression, suicide delusions, etc.), evaluating consequent clinical signs (fatigue, muscle pain, attritions and dental openings). Methods: The sample of three hundred (n=300) young adults legally enrolled in two Ecuadorian universities, the sample was selected among fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth semester students legally enrolled and who are attending Faculty of Dentistry classes in 2 different cities (Quito and Guayaquil). The app was configured to provide 20 alerts during the day x seven days a week, in real time. Results. The study obtained 95% reliability and 5% error in research, was used. The relaxation condition was present in all users, but 40% of the alerts were associated with jaw and tooth discomfort, 39% corresponded to the discomfort of mandibular clenching, and 24% corresponded to tooth contact. A direct significant association was found between the state of relaxation and nonrelaxation, with a high probability of reports related to nonrelaxation (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: Awake bruxism with the app was evaluated, identifying 5 behaviors such as: relaxed mandibular muscles, dental contact, mandibular effort, clenching and grinding teeth, frequent conditions in the population; reporting a state of mandibular relaxation, there is a high probability that a condition of nonrelaxation would be reported (p≤0.05).

                Background Women’s educational attainment and their generation of value through education has increased the prospects for achieving economic equality between men and women. However, women continue to earn lower wages than men, reflecting growing inequality in several countries. Therefore, the objective of the study is to estimate the impact of education on the gender wage gap in Peru over the period 2017-2021. Methods Quantitative, explanatory study aimed at identifying the impact of education on the gender wage gap in Peru during the period 2017-2021. The research design is non-experimental and uses a time series that analyses the influence of the latent variable of education on the gender wage gap. This is a continuous variable to estimate the Tobit model. Results The results show that the gender gap in Peru exhibited a decreasing trend between men and women during the period 2017-2020, with an average reduction of 10% until 2020 due to the health crisis. The highest average salary was achieved by men in 2019, reaching S/2289.97 soles, while women reached an average salary of S/1368.85 soles. In the post-pandemic scenario for 2021, the gender gap increased by 3%, with men earning an average salary of S/1999.63 soles and women earning an average salary of S/1281.16 soles. The analysis from 2017-2021 shows that years of education had a positive impact on the gender wage gap in Peru based on the Tobit model estimation. Conclusions During the analysis period of 2017-2021, years of education had a positive impact on the gender wage gap in Peru, with the greatest impact occurring during the health crisis. The probability of women’s incomes improving with an increase in years of education was 2.35%, while for men, the highest impact was in 2018, with a probability of income improvement of 2.16% in terms of marginal effect.

                Background Research waste has become an increasing issue for research institutions and researchers due to poor research reproducibility and replicability. Interventions to improve research quality at research institutions are important to reduce research waste. This review aims to identify and classify possible interventions to improve research quality, reduce waste, and improve reproducibility and replicability within research-performing institutions. Methods Steps to develop the taxonomy were 1) Use an exemplar paper looking at journal-level interventions to improve research quality, 2) Adapt intervention titles to align with Michie’s behaviour change wheel, 3) Conduct a 2-stage search in PubMed using seed articles and reviews, and a forward and backward citation search to identify articles that evaluated or described the implementation of interventions to improve research quality, 4) Pilot draft taxonomy with researchers at an openscience conference workshop, and 5) Iterative drafting and revisions by the research team. Results Overall, 93 individual interventions were identified through the peer-review literature and researcher reporting. Eleven peer-reviewed articles were identified. Interventions identified covered research stages from before, during, and after study conduct, and whole of institution. Types of intervention included: Tools, Education & Training, Incentives, Modelling and Mentoring, Review & Feedback, Expert involvement, and Policies & Procedures. The taxonomy identified areas for research institutions to focus on to improve research quality, reproducibility, and replicability. Conclusions Areas of focus and future research include improving incentives to implement quality research practices, evaluating current interventions, encouraging no- or low-cost and high-benefit interventions, examining institution culture and individual research ethos, and encouraging researcher mentor-mentee relationships.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                <p>by Seth Commichaux, Tu Luan, Harihara Subrahmaniam Muralidharan, Mihai Pop</p>

For decades, the 16S rRNA gene has been used to taxonomically classify prokaryotic species and to taxonomically profile microbial communities. However, the 16S rRNA gene has been criticized for being too conserved to differentiate between distinct species. We argue that the inability to differentiate between species is not a unique feature of the 16S rRNA gene. Rather, we observe the gradual loss of species-level resolution for other nearly-universal prokaryotic marker genes as the number of gene sequences increases in reference databases. This trend was strongly correlated with how represented a taxonomic group was in the database and indicates that, at the gene-level, the boundaries between many species might be fuzzy. Through our study, we argue that any approach that relies on a single marker to distinguish bacterial taxa is fraught even if some markers appear to be discriminative in current databases.

                <p>by Michael B. Sohn, Cynthia Monaco, Steven R. Gill</p>

In many omics data, including microbiome sequencing data, we are only able to measure relative information. Various computational or statistical methods have been proposed to extract absolute (or biologically relevant) information from this relative information; however, these methods are under rather strong assumptions that may not be suitable for multigroup (more than two groups) and/or longitudinal outcome data. In this article, we first introduce the minimal assumption required to extract absolute from relative information. This assumption is less stringent than those imposed in existing methods, thus being applicable to multigroup and/or longitudinal outcome data. We then propose the first normalization method that works under this minimal assumption. The optimality and validity of the proposed method and its beneficial effects on downstream analysis are demonstrated in extensive simulation studies, where existing methods fail to produce consistent performance under the minimal assumption. We also demonstrate its application to real microbiome datasets to determine biologically relevant microbes to a specific disease/condition.

                <p>by Anton Suvorov, Daniel R. Schrider</p>

A phylogenetic tree represents hypothesized evolutionary history for a set of taxa. Besides the branching patterns (i.e., tree topology), phylogenies contain information about the evolutionary distances (i.e. branch lengths) between all taxa in the tree, which include extant taxa (external nodes) and their last common ancestors (internal nodes). During phylogenetic tree inference, the branch lengths are typically co-estimated along with other phylogenetic parameters during tree topology space exploration. There are well-known regions of the branch length parameter space where accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees is especially difficult. Several novel studies have recently demonstrated that machine learning approaches have the potential to help solve phylogenetic problems with greater accuracy and computational efficiency. In this study, as a proof of concept, we sought to explore the possibility of machine learning models to predict branch lengths. To that end, we designed several deep learning frameworks to estimate branch lengths on fixed tree topologies from multiple sequence alignments or its representations. Our results show that deep learning methods can exhibit superior performance in some difficult regions of branch length parameter space. For example, in contrast to maximum likelihood inference, which is typically used for estimating branch lengths, deep learning methods are more efficient and accurate. In general, we find that our neural networks achieve similar accuracy to a Bayesian approach and are the best-performing methods when inferring long branches that are associated with distantly related taxa. Together, our findings represent a next step toward accurate, fast, and reliable phylogenetic inference with machine learning approaches.

                <p>by Jonathan da Silva Ramos, Ivo Henrique Provensi Vieira, Wan Song Rocha, Rosimar Pires Esquerdo, Carolina Yukari Veludo Watanabe, Fernando Berton Zanchi</p>

<i>Plasmodium</i> parasites cause Malaria disease, which remains a significant threat to global health, affecting 200 million people and causing 400,000 deaths yearly. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> remain the two main malaria species affecting humans. Identifying the malaria disease in blood smears requires years of expertise, even for highly trained specialists. Literature studies have been coping with the automatic identification and classification of malaria. However, several points must be addressed and investigated so these automatic methods can be used clinically in a Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) scenario. In this work, we assess the transfer learning approach by using well-known pre-trained deep learning architectures. We considered a database with 6222 Region of Interest (ROI), of which 6002 are from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC), and 220 were acquired locally by us at Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) in Porto Velho Velho, Rondônia—Brazil, which is part of the legal Amazon. We exhaustively cross-validated the dataset using 100 distinct partitions with 80% train and 20% test for each considering circular ROIs (rough segmentation). Our experimental results show that DenseNet201 has a potential to identify <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites in ROIs (infected or uninfected) of microscopic images, achieving 99.41% AUC with a fast processing time. We further validated our results, showing that DenseNet201 was significantly better (99% confidence interval) than the other networks considered in the experiment. Our results support claiming that transfer learning with texture features potentially differentiates subjects with malaria, spotting those with <i>Plasmodium</i> even in Leukocytes images, which is a challenge. In Future work, we intend scale our approach by adding more data and developing a friendly user interface for CAD use. We aim at aiding the worldwide population and our local natives living nearby the legal Amazon’s rivers.

                <p>by Alireza Zaeemzadeh, Giulio Tononi</p>

Originally developed as a theory of consciousness, integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to quantify the causal irreducibility of systems and subsets of units in the system. Specifically, <i>mechanism integrated information</i> quantifies how much of the causal powers of a subset of units in a state, also referred to as a mechanism, cannot be accounted for by its parts. If the causal powers of the mechanism can be fully explained by its parts, it is reducible and its integrated information is zero. Here, we study the upper bound of this measure and how it is achieved. We study mechanisms in isolation, groups of mechanisms, and groups of causal relations among mechanisms. We put forward new theoretical results that show mechanisms that share parts with each other cannot all achieve their maximum. We also introduce techniques to design systems that can maximize the integrated information of a subset of their mechanisms or relations. Our results can potentially be used to exploit the symmetries and constraints to reduce the computations significantly and to compare different connectivity profiles in terms of their maximal achievable integrated information.

                <p>by Andrew A. Schmidt, Alexander Y. Grosberg, Anna Grosberg</p>

Understanding muscle contraction mechanisms is a standing challenge, and one of the approaches has been to create models of the sarcomere–the basic contractile unit of striated muscle. While these models have been successful in elucidating many aspects of muscle contraction, they fall short in explaining the energetics of functional phenomena, such as rigor, and in particular, their dependence on the concentrations of the biomolecules involved in the cross-bridge cycle. Our hypothesis posits that the stochastic time delay between ATP adsorption and ADP/Pi release in the cross-bridge cycle necessitates a modeling approach where the rates of these two reaction steps are controlled by two independent parts of the total free energy change of the hydrolysis reaction. To test this hypothesis, we built a two-filament, stochastic-mechanical half-sarcomere model that separates the energetic roles of ATP and ADP/Pi in the cross-bridge cycle’s free energy landscape. Our results clearly demonstrate that there is a nontrivial dependence of the cross-bridge cycle’s kinetics on the independent concentrations of ATP, ADP, and Pi. The simplicity of the proposed model allows for analytical solutions of the more basic systems, which provide novel insight into the dominant mechanisms driving some of the experimentally observed contractile phenomena.

Cells exhibit various morphological characteristics due to their physiological activities, and changes in cell morphology are inherently accompanied by the assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Stress fibers are a prominent component of the actin-based intracellular structure and are highly involved in numerous physiological processes, e.g., mechanotransduction and maintenance of cell morphology. Although it is widely accepted that variations in cell morphology interact with the distribution and localization of stress fibers, it remains unclear if there are underlying geometric principles between the cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton. Here, we present a machine learning system that uses the diffusion model to convert the cell shape to the distribution and alignment of stress fibers. By training with corresponding cell shape and stress fibers datasets, our system learns the conversion to generate the stress fiber images from its corresponding cell shape. The predicted stress fiber distribution agrees well with the experimental data. With this conversion relation, our system allows for performing virtual experiments that provide a visual map showing the probability of stress fiber distribution from the virtual cell shape. Our system potentially provides a powerful approach to seek further hidden geometric principles regarding how the configuration of subcellular structures is determined by the boundary of the cell structure; for example, we found that the stress fibers of cells with small aspect ratios tend to localize at the cell edge while cells with large aspect ratios have homogenous distributions.

                <p>by Rune Höper, Daria Komkova, Tomáš Zavřel, Ralf Steuer</p>

The metabolism of phototrophic cyanobacteria is an integral part of global biogeochemical cycles, and the capability of cyanobacteria to assimilate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> into organic carbon has manifold potential applications for a sustainable biotechnology. To elucidate the properties of cyanobacterial metabolism and growth, computational reconstructions of genome-scale metabolic networks play an increasingly important role. Here, we present an updated reconstruction of the metabolic network of the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and its quantitative evaluation using flux balance analysis (FBA). To overcome limitations of conventional FBA, and to allow for the integration of experimental analyses, we develop a novel approach to describe light absorption and light utilization within the framework of FBA. Our approach incorporates photoinhibition and a variable quantum yield into the constraint-based description of light-limited phototrophic growth. We show that the resulting model is capable of predicting quantitative properties of cyanobacterial growth, including photosynthetic oxygen evolution and the ATP/NADPH ratio required for growth and cellular maintenance. Our approach retains the computational and conceptual simplicity of FBA and is readily applicable to other phototrophic microorganisms.

                <p>by Teemu J. Rintala, Vittorio Fortino</p>

Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. We present the COPS R-package, tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies.

                <p>by The CRyPTIC consortium </p>

There remains a clinical need for better approaches to rapid drug susceptibility testing in view of the increasing burden of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Binary susceptibility phenotypes only capture changes in minimum inhibitory concentration when these cross the critical concentration, even though other changes may be clinically relevant. We developed a machine learning system to predict minimum inhibitory concentration from unassembled whole-genome sequencing data for 13 anti-tuberculosis drugs. We trained, validated and tested the system on 10,859 isolates from the CRyPTIC dataset. Essential agreement rates (predicted MIC within one doubling dilution of observed MIC) were above 92% for first-line drugs, 91% for fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, and 90% for new and repurposed drugs, albeit with a significant drop in performance for the very few phenotypically resistant isolates in the latter group. To further validate the model in the absence of external MIC datasets, we predicted MIC and converted values to binary for an external set of 15,239 isolates with binary phenotypes, and compare their performance against a previously validated mutation catalogue, the expected performance of existing molecular assays, and World Health Organization Target Product Profiles. The sensitivity of the model on the external dataset was greater than 90% for all drugs except ethionamide, clofazimine and linezolid. Specificity was greater than 95% for all drugs except ethambutol, ethionamide, bedaquiline, delamanid and clofazimine. The proposed system can provide quantitative susceptibility phenotyping to help guide antimicrobial therapy, although further data collection and validation are required before machine learning can be used clinically for all drugs.

                <p>by Chadi M. Saad-Roy, Sinead E. Morris, Mike Boots, Rachel E. Baker, Bryan L. Lewis, Jeremy Farrar, Madhav V. Marathe, Andrea L. Graham, Simon A. Levin, Caroline E. Wagner, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Bryan T. Grenfell</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has generated a considerable number of infections and associated morbidity and mortality across the world. Recovery from these infections, combined with the onset of large-scale vaccination, have led to rapidly-changing population-level immunological landscapes. In turn, these complexities have highlighted a number of important unknowns related to the breadth and strength of immunity following recovery or vaccination. Using simple mathematical models, we investigate the medium-term impacts of waning immunity against severe disease on immuno-epidemiological dynamics. We find that uncertainties in the duration of severity-blocking immunity (imparted by either infection or vaccination) can lead to a large range of medium-term population-level outcomes (<i>i.e</i>. infection characteristics and immune landscapes). Furthermore, we show that epidemiological dynamics are sensitive to the strength and duration of underlying host immune responses; this implies that determining infection levels from hospitalizations requires accurate estimates of these immune parameters. More durable vaccines both reduce these uncertainties and alleviate the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in pessimistic outcomes. However, heterogeneity in vaccine uptake drastically changes immune landscapes toward larger fractions of individuals with waned severity-blocking immunity. In particular, if hesitancy is substantial, more robust vaccines have almost no effects on population-level immuno-epidemiology, even if vaccination rates are compensatorily high among vaccine-adopters. This pessimistic scenario for vaccination heterogeneity arises because those few individuals that are vaccine-adopters are so readily re-vaccinated that the duration of vaccinal immunity has no appreciable consequences on their immune status. Furthermore, we find that this effect is heightened if vaccine-hesitants have increased transmissibility (<i>e.g</i>. due to riskier behavior). Overall, our results illustrate the necessity to characterize both transmission-blocking and severity-blocking immune time scales. Our findings also underline the importance of developing robust next-generation vaccines with equitable mass vaccine deployment.

Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous across the kingdoms of life and serve important roles in regulating physiology and behavior at many levels. These rhythms occur in ~24-hour cycles and are driven by a core molecular oscillator. Circadian timekeeping enables organisms to anticipate daily changes by timing their growth and internal processes. <i>Neurospora crassa</i> is a model organism with a long history in circadian biology, having conserved eukaryotic clock properties and observable circadian phenotypes. A core approach for measuring circadian function in Neurospora is to follow daily oscillations in the direction of growth and spore formation along a thin glass tube (race tube). While leveraging robust phenotypic readouts is useful, interpreting the outputs of large-scale race tube experiments by hand can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To provide the field with an efficient tool for analyzing race tubes, we present Rhythmidia, a graphical user interface (GUI) tool written in Python for calculating circadian periods and growth rates of Neurospora. Rhythmidia is open source, has been benchmarked against the current state-of-the-art, and is easily accessible on GitHub.

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria. Many of them produce specific enzymes called depolymerases to break down external polysaccharide structures. Accurate annotation and domain identification of these depolymerases are challenging due to their inherent sequence diversity. Hence, we present DepoScope, a machine learning tool that combines a fine-tuned ESM-2 model with a convolutional neural network to identify depolymerase sequences and their enzymatic domains precisely. To accomplish this, we curated a dataset from the INPHARED phage genome database, created a polysaccharide-degrading domain database, and applied sequential filters to construct a high-quality dataset, which is subsequently used to train DepoScope. Our work is the first approach that combines sequence-level predictions with amino-acid-level predictions for accurate depolymerase detection and functional domain identification. In that way, we believe that DepoScope can greatly enhance our understanding of phage-host interactions at the level of depolymerases.

                <p>by Priscilla E. Greenwood, Lawrence M. Ward</p>

Synchronous neural oscillations are strongly associated with a variety of perceptual, cognitive, and behavioural processes. It has been proposed that the role of the synchronous oscillations in these processes is to facilitate information transmission between brain areas, the ‘communication through coherence,’ or CTC hypothesis. The details of how this mechanism would work, however, and its causal status, are still unclear. Here we investigate computationally a proposed mechanism for selective attention that directly implicates the CTC as causal. The mechanism involves alpha band (about 10 Hz) oscillations, originating in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, being sent to communicating cortical areas, organizing gamma (about 40 Hz) oscillations there, and thus facilitating phase coherence and communication between them. This is proposed to happen contingent on control signals sent from higher-level cortical areas to the thalamic reticular nucleus, which controls the alpha oscillations sent to cortex by the pulvinar. We studied the scope of this mechanism in parameter space, and limitations implied by this scope, using a computational implementation of our conceptual model. Our results indicate that, although the CTC-based mechanism can account for some effects of top-down and bottom-up attentional selection, its limitations indicate that an alternative mechanism, in which oscillatory coherence is caused by communication between brain areas rather than being a causal factor for it, might operate in addition to, or even instead of, the CTC mechanism.

Bacterial pathogens utilize the factors of their hosts to infect them, but which factors they exploit remain poorly defined. Here, we show that a pathogenic <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>Tm) exploits host polyamines for the functional expression of virulence factors. An <i>S</i>Tm mutant strain lacking principal genes required for polyamine synthesis and transport exhibited impaired infectivity in mice. A polyamine uptake-impaired strain of <i>S</i>Tm was unable to inject effectors of the type 3 secretion system into host cells due to a failure of needle assembly. <i>S</i>Tm infection stimulated host polyamine production by increasing arginase expression. The decline in polyamine levels caused by difluoromethylornithine, which inhibits host polyamine production, attenuated <i>S</i>Tm colonization, whereas polyamine supplementation augmented <i>S</i>Tm pathogenesis. Our work reveals that host polyamines are a key factor promoting <i>S</i>Tm infection, and therefore a promising therapeutic target for bacterial infection.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The master control of mammalian circadian rhythms is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is formed by the ventral and dorsal regions. In SCN neurons, GABA has an important function and even excitatory actions in adulthood. However, the physiological role of this neurotransmitter in the developing SCN is unknown. Here, we recorded GABAergic postsynaptic currents (in the perforated-patch configuration using gramicidin) to determine the chloride reversal potential (E<sub>Cl</sub>) and also assessed the immunological expression of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) at early ages of the rat (postnatal days (P) 3 to 25), during the day and night, in the two SCN regions. We detected that E<sub>Cl</sub> greatly varied with age and depending on the SCN region and time of day. Broadly speaking, E<sub>Cl</sub> was more hyperpolarized with age, except for the oldest age studied (P20–25) in both day and night in the ventral SCN, where it was less negative. Likewise, E<sub>Cl</sub> was more hyperpolarized in the dorsal SCN both during the day and at night; while E<sub>Cl</sub> was more negative at night both in the ventral and the dorsal SCN. Moreover, the total NKCC1 fluorescent expression was higher during the day than at night. These results imply that NKCC1 regulates the circadian and developmental fluctuations in the [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to fine-tune E<sub>Cl</sub>, which is crucial for either excitatory or inhibitory GABAergic actions to occur in the SCN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27035?af=R">Prediction of Cognitive Heterogeneity in Parkinson's Disease: A 4‐Year Longitudinal Study Using Clinical, Neuroimaging, Biological and Electrophysiological Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) can show a very heterogeneous trajectory among patients. Here, we explored the mechanisms involved in the expression and prediction of different cognitive phenotypes over 4 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 2 independent cohorts (total n = 475), we performed a cluster analysis to identify trajectories of cognitive progression. Baseline and longitudinal level II neuropsychological assessments were conducted, and baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging, resting electroencephalogram and neurofilament light chain plasma quantification were carried out. Linear mixed-effects models were used to study longitudinal changes. Risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia were estimated using multivariable hazard regression. Spectral power density from the electroencephalogram at baseline and source localization were computed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two cognitive trajectories were identified. Cluster 1 presented stability (PD-Stable) over time, whereas cluster 2 showed progressive cognitive decline (PD-Progressors). The PD-Progressors group showed an increased risk for evolving to PD mild cognitive impairment (HR 2.09; 95% CI 1.11–3.95) and a marked risk for dementia (HR 4.87; 95% CI 1.34–17.76), associated with progressive worsening in posterior-cortical-dependent cognitive processes. Both clusters showed equivalent clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and neurofilament light chain levels at baseline. Conversely, the PD-Progressors group showed a fronto-temporo-occipital and parietal slow-wave power density increase, that was in turn related to worsening at 2 and 4 years of follow-up in different cognitive measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the absence of differences in baseline cognitive function and typical markers of neurodegeneration, the further development of an aggressive cognitive decline in PD is associated with increased slow-wave power density and with a different profile of worsening in several posterior-cortical-dependent tasks.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Training clinician–scientists is a primary objective of many academic neurology departments, as these individuals are uniquely positioned to perform insightful clinical or laboratory-based research informed both by clinical knowledge and their own experiences caring for patients. Despite its importance, training clinician–scientists has perhaps never been so challenging. The National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) R25 program was designed in an attempt to support these individuals, decrease the time needed to obtain National Institutes of Health K awards, and to help educate a cohort of trainees preparing for a career in academic neurology. We endeavored to describe the structure and features of the program while examining its outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>R25 outcome data from 2009 to 2024 were reviewed. Statistical comparisons were made using 2-sided Mann–Whitney <i>U</i> testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 67% of adult neurologists who received an R25 had a successful application for a National Institutes of Health K award compared with 45% of adult neurologists who had not received R25 support (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Among child neurologists, 73% who applied went on to receive K funding after R25 support, compared with 45% who had not been part of the R25 program (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The average time between completion of residency and obtaining a K award for R25 participants was decreased by 26 months among those with an MD/PhD degree, and 32 months for those with an MD degree compared with non-R25 individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The R25 program has been successful in achieving its training goals, but stands as only one component of support for aspiring clinician–scientists. Investments and commitments made by academic neurology departments are key to supporting this success. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90565">Combining array tomography with electron tomography provides insights into leakiness of the blood-brain barrier in mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Like other volume electron microscopy approaches, automated tape-collecting ultramicrotomy (ATUM) enables imaging of serial sections deposited on thick plastic tapes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ATUM is unique in enabling hierarchical imaging and thus efficient screening for target structures, as needed for correlative light and electron microscopy. However, SEM of sections on tape can only access the section surface, thereby limiting the axial resolution to the typical size of cellular vesicles with an order of magnitude lower than the acquired xy resolution. In contrast, serial-section electron tomography (ET), a transmission electron microscopy-based approach, yields isotropic voxels at full EM resolution, but requires deposition of sections on electron-stable thin and fragile films, thus making screening of large section libraries difficult and prone to section loss. To combine the strength of both approaches, we developed ‘ATUM-Tomo, a hybrid method, where sections are first reversibly attached to plastic tape via a dissolvable coating, and after screening detached and transferred to the ET-compatible thin films. As a proof-of-principle, we applied correlative ATUM-Tomo to study ultrastructural features of blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around microthrombi in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Microthrombi and associated sites of BBB leakiness were identified by confocal imaging of injected fluorescent and electron-dense nanoparticles, then relocalized by ATUM-SEM, and finally interrogated by correlative ATUM-Tomo. Overall, our new ATUM-Tomo approach will substantially advance ultrastructural analysis of biological phenomena that require cell- and tissue-level contextualization of the finest subcellular textures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95680">Disparity in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiological and fMRI signals</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state brain networks (RSNs) have been widely applied in health and disease, but the interpretation of RSNs in terms of the underlying neural activity is unclear. To address this fundamental question, we conducted simultaneous recordings of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and electrophysiology signals in two separate brain regions of rats. Our data reveal that for both recording sites, spatial maps derived from band-specific local field potential (LFP) power can account for up to 90% of the spatial variability in RSNs derived from rsfMRI signals. Surprisingly, the time series of LFP band power can only explain to a maximum of 35% of the temporal variance of the local rsfMRI time course from the same site. In addition, regressing out time series of LFP power from rsfMRI signals has minimal impact on the spatial patterns of rsfMRI-based RSNs. This disparity in the spatial and temporal relationships between resting-state electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals suggests that electrophysiological activity alone does not fully explain the effects observed in the rsfMRI signal, implying the existence of an rsfMRI component contributed by ‘electrophysiology-invisible’ signals. These findings offer a novel perspective on our understanding of RSN interpretation.

                Bathymodioline mussels dominate deep-sea methane seep and hydrothermal vent habitats and obtain nutrients and energy primarily through chemosynthetic endosymbiotic bacteria in the bacteriocytes of their gill. However, the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate mussel host–symbiont interactions remain unclear. Here, we constructed a comprehensive cell atlas of the gill in the mussel <i>Gigantidas platifrons</i> from the South China Sea methane seeps (1100 m depth) using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and whole-mount in situ hybridisation. We identified 13 types of cells, including three previously unknown ones, and uncovered unknown tissue heterogeneity. Every cell type has a designated function in supporting the gill’s structure and function, creating an optimal environment for chemosynthesis, and effectively acquiring nutrients from the endosymbiotic bacteria. Analysis of snRNA-seq of in situ transplanted mussels clearly showed the shifts in cell state in response to environmental oscillations. Our findings provide insight into the principles of host–symbiont interaction and the bivalves' environmental adaption mechanisms.

">Aversion-induced drug taking and escape behavior involve similar nucleus accumbens core dopamine signaling signatures</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) has long been associated with the promotion of motivated behavior. However, inhibited dopamine signaling can increase behavior in certain settings, such as during drug self-administration. While aversive environmental stimuli can reduce dopamine, it is unclear whether such stimuli reliably engage this mechanism in different contexts. Here we compared the physiological and behavioral responses to the same aversive stimulus in different designs to determine if there is uniformity in the manner that aversive stimuli are encoded and promote behavior. NAcC dopamine was measured using fiber photometry in male and female rats during cocaine self-administration sessions in which an acutely aversive 90 dB white noise was intermittently presented. In a separate group of rats, aversion-induced changes in dopamine were measured in an escape design in which operant responses terminated aversive white noise. Aversive white noise significantly reduced NAcC dopamine and increased cocaine self-administration in both male and female rats. The same relationship was observed in the escape design, in which white noise reduced dopamine and promoted escape attempts. In both designs, the magnitude of the dopamine reduction predicted behavioral performance. While prior research demonstrated that pharmacologically reduced dopamine signaling can promote intake, this report demonstrates that this physiological mechanism is naturally engaged by aversive environmental stimuli and generalizable to non-drug contexts. These findings illustrate a common physiological signature in response to aversion that may promote both adaptive and maladaptive behavior.

">Amyloid, Tau, and APOE in Alzheimer's Disease: Impact on White Matter Tracts</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss due to the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau tangles in the brain; its onset and progression also depend on genetic factors such as the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Understanding how these factors affect the brain's neural pathways is important for early diagnostics and interventions. Tractometry is an advanced technique for 3D quantitative assessment of white matter tracts, localizing microstructural abnormalities in diseased populations in vivo. In this work, we applied BUAN (Bundle Analytics) tractometry to 3D diffusion MRI data from 730 participants in ADNI3 (phase 3 of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; age range: 55-95 years, 349M/381F, 214 with mild cognitive impairment, 69 with AD, and 447 cognitively healthy controls). Using along-tract statistical analysis, we assessed the localized impact of amyloid, tau, and APOE genetic variants on the brain's neural pathways. BUAN quantifies microstructural properties of white matter tracts, supporting along-tract statistical analyses that identify factors associated with brain microstructure. We visualize the 3D profile of white matter tract associations with tau and amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease; strong associations near the cortex may support models of disease propagation along neural pathways. Relative to the neutral genotype, APOE epsilon3/epsilon3, carriers of the AD-risk conferring APOE epsilon4 genotype show microstructural abnormalities, while carriers of the protective epsilon2 genotype also show subtle differences. Of all the microstructural metrics, mean diffusivity (MD) generally shows the strongest associations with AD pathology, followed by axial diffusivity (AxD) and radial diffusivity (RD), while fractional anisotropy (FA) is typically the least sensitive metric. Along-tract microstructural metrics are sensitive to tau and amyloid accumulation, showing the potential of diffusion MRI to track AD pathology and map its impact on neural pathways.

                Understanding the mechanisms of viral disease tolerance in bats has significant scientific implications for human health. Dai et al. investigate bat immune tolerance through the perspective of the antiviral RNA interference response. This RNA-based antiviral immunity, an energy-conserving pathway, may be particularly beneficial for bats.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal region of the hippocampus (dHC) mediates many of the mnemonic functions traditionally associated with the hippocampus proper, such as spatial and episodic memory, whereas ventral hippocampus (vHC) has been extensively implicated in emotional memory and motivational processes. By contrast, the functions of the intermediate hippocampus (iHC) are far less understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mnemonic functions of iHC by reversibly inactivating iHC prior to testing memory in behavioral tasks dependent on the integrity of dHC, iHC, or vHC, namely, rapid place water maze, inhibitory avoidance, spontaneous alternation, and temporal ordering of odors. Given our previous findings showing that dHC and vHC are involved in mnemonic control of ingestive behavior, we also assessed the effects of iHC inactivation on sucrose intake. The results showed that pharmacological inhibition of iHC impairs rapid place water maze memory, which has been previously shown to be dependent on iHC but not dHC or vHC. iHC inactivation does not impact memory dependent on dHC (spontaneous alternation), vHC (temporal odor memory), or either dHC or vHC (inhibitory avoidance), and only modestly affects sucrose intake. These findings provide support for the involvement of iHC in mnemonic functions that are distinct from dHC and vHC and highlight the need to further advance our understanding of the functions of this hippocampal region that has been relatively understudied.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the hippocampus has been implicated in both the temporal organization of memories and association of scene elements, some theoretical accounts posit that the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory is largely atemporal. In this study, we set out to explore this discrepancy by identifying hippocampal activity patterns related to scene construction while participants performed a temporal order memory task. Participants in the fMRI scanner were shown a sequence of photographs, each consisting of a central object and a contextual background scene. On each retrieval trial, participants were shown a pair of the original photographs (FULL), objects from the scenes without the background (OBJ), or background contexts without the main foreground object (BACK). In the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, participants judged the temporal order of the pair of scenes; in the Viewing trials, two identical scenes were shown without any task. First, we found that the anterior hippocampus—particularly the CA1 and subiculum—showed similar patterns of activation between the BACK and OBJ conditions, suggesting that scene construction occurred spontaneously during both TOJ and Viewing. Furthermore, neural markers of scene construction in the anterior hippocampus did not apply to incorrect trials, showing that successful temporal memory retrieval was functionally linked to scene construction. In the cortex, time-processing areas, such as the supplementary motor area and the precuneus, and scene-processing areas, such as the parahippocampal cortex, were activated and functionally connected with the hippocampus. Together, these results support the view that the hippocampus is concurrently involved in scene construction and temporal organization of memory and propose a model of hippocampal episodic memory that takes both processes into account.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. Objective surrogate markers sensitive to detect changes in disease severity are needed to reduce sample sizes in interventional trials and identification of predictors of faster disease progression would facilitate patient selection, enrichment, or stratification in such trials.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal, multimodal study in 34 ataxic SCA1 individuals and 21 healthy controls. We collected clinical, patient-reported outcomes, biochemical and magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers at baseline and after 1 year. We determined 1-year progression and evaluated the potential predictive value of several baseline markers on 1-year disease progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, multiple structural and spectroscopic MR markers in pons and cerebellum differentiated SCA1 from healthy controls and correlated with disease severity. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) chain and CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were elevated in SCA1. In longitudinal analysis, total brainstem and pontine volume change, inventory of non-ataxia signs (INAS) count, and SCA functional index (SCAFI) showed larger responsiveness compared to the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).</p>
<p>Longer disease duration, longer non-expanded CAG repeat length, and higher disease burden were associated with faster SARA increase after 1-year in the SCA1 group. Similarly, lower baseline brainstem, pontine, and cerebellar volumes, as well as lower levels of N-acetylaspartate and glutamate in the cerebellar white matter, were also associated with faster SARA increase.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results guide the selection of the most sensitive measures of disease progression in SCA1 and have identified features associated with accelerated progression that could inform the design of clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To develop a multiparametric machine-learning (ML) framework using high-resolution 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) fingerprinting (MRF) data for quantitative characterization of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>We included 119 subjects, 33 patients with focal epilepsy and histopathologically confirmed FCD, 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs), and 26 disease controls (DCs). Subjects underwent whole-brain 3 Tesla MRF acquisition, the reconstruction of which generated T1 and T2 relaxometry maps. A 3D region of interest was manually created for each lesion, and z-score normalization using HC data was performed. We conducted 2D classification with ensemble models using MRF T1 and T2 mean and standard deviation from gray matter and white matter for FCD versus controls. Subtype classification additionally incorporated entropy and uniformity of MRF metrics, as well as morphometric features from the morphometric analysis program (MAP). We translated 2D results to individual probabilities using the percentage of slices above an adaptive threshold. These probabilities and clinical variables were input into a support vector machine for individual-level classification. Fivefold cross-validation was performed and performance metrics were reported using receiver-operating-characteristic-curve analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>FCD versus HC classification yielded mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.945, 0.980, and 0.962, respectively; FCD versus DC classification achieved 0.918, 0.965, and 0.939. In comparison, visual review of the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected 48% (16/33) of the lesions by official radiology report. In the subgroup where both clinical MRI and MAP were negative, the MRF-ML models correctly distinguished FCD patients from HCs and DCs in 98.3% of cross-validation trials for the magnetic resonance imaging negative group and MAP negative group. Type II versus non-type-II classification exhibited mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.835, 0.823, and 0.83, respectively; type IIa versus IIb classification showed 0.85, 0.9, and 0.87. In comparison, the transmantle sign was present in 58% (7/12) of the IIb cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The MRF-ML framework presented in this study demonstrated strong efficacy in noninvasively classifying FCD from normal cortex and distinguishing FCD subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27047?af=R">Evaluation of Glymphatic System Development in Neonatal Brain via Diffusion Analysis along the Perivascular Space Index</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system is a recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system associated with numerous neurological diseases. However, little is known about glymphatic system development in neonates. We sought to evaluate diffusion along the perivascular space (ALPS) index, a proxy for glymphatic system function, in neonates and investigate its potential associations with maturation, sex, and preterm birth.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 418 neonates, including 92 preterm neonates (57 males) and 326 term neonates (175 males), from the Developing Human Connectome Project were used for evaluating ALPS index. Linear regression modeling was performed to assess group differences in the ALPS index according to preterm birth and sex. Pearson's and partial correlation analysis were performed to assess the association between the ALPS index and gestational age (GA) as well as postmenstrual age (PMA) at MRI. Moderation analysis was performed to assess the moderation effect of preterm birth on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to term neonates, preterm neonates exhibited lower ALPS indices (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The ALPS index positively correlated with PMA (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and GA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Preterm birth (<i>p</i> = 0.013) had a significant moderation effect on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA. Sex had no significant direct effect (<i>p</i> = 0.639) or moderation effect (<i>p</i> = 0.333) on ALPS index.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system development is a dynamic process in neonates, which can be moderated by preterm birth, the ALPS index could serve as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring this process. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

Brain-specific gene co-expression analysis was performed for D/EE-SWAS genes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified the etiology in 42/91 (46%) patients in our Core cohort, including 29/44 (66%) with DEE-SWAS and 13/47 (28%) with EE-SWAS. A genetic etiology was identified in 31/91 (34%). D/EE-SWAS genes were highly co-expressed in brain, highlighting the importance of channelopathies and transcriptional regulators. Structural etiologies were found in 12/91 (13%) individuals. We identified 10 novel D/EE-SWAS genes with a range of functions: <i>ATP1A2</i>, <i>CACNA1A</i>, <i>FOXP1</i>, <i>GRIN1</i>, <i>KCNMA1</i>, <i>KCNQ3</i>, <i>PPFIA3</i>, <i>PUF60</i>, <i>SETD1B, and ZBTB18</i>, and 2 novel copy number variants, 17p11.2 duplication and 5q22 deletion. Although developmental regression patterns were similar in both syndromes, DEE-SWAS was associated with a longer duration of epilepsy and poorer intellectual outcome than EE-SWAS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS have highly heterogeneous genetic and structural etiologies. Phenotypic analysis highlights valuable clinical differences between DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS which inform clinical care and prognostic counseling. Our etiological findings pave the way for the development of precision therapies. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has been shown to increase the outcome of speech and language therapy (SLT) in chronic aphasia. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of add-on tDCS on SLT in the early stage of aphasia; this may be due to methodological reasons, in particular the influence of spontaneous remission and the difficulty of establishing stimulation protocols in clinical routines. Thirty-seven participants with subacute aphasia (PwA) after stroke (23 men, 14 women; mean age 62 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12 years; mean duration 49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28 days) were included in two consecutive periods of treatment lasting two weeks each. During the first period (P1) the participants received 10 sessions of SLT, during the second period (P2) the aphasia therapy was supplemented by anodal left hemispheric 2 mA tDCS over the left hemisphere. Severity-specific language tests (Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT), n = 27 and Bielefeld Aphasia Screening-Reha (BIAS-R), n = 10) were administered before P1, between P1 and P2, and after P2. Where information was available, the results were corrected for spontaneous remission (AAT sample), and the therapy outcomes of P1 and P2 were compared. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; overall language abilities improved significantly during P1 and P2. However, improvement&amp;amp;mdash;as measured by the AAT profile level or the BIAS-R mean percentage value&amp;amp;mdash;during P2 (with tDCS) was significantly higher than during P1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; AAT sample and p = 0.005; BIAS-R sample). Thus, tDCS protocols can be implemented in early aphasia rehabilitation. Despite the limitations of the research design, which are also discussed from an implementation science perspective, this is preliminary evidence that an individually tailored anodal tDCS can have a significant add-on effect on the outcome of behavioral aphasia therapy in subacute aphasia.</p>

                <p>Cognitive dysfunction is associated with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to examine the involvement of either Group 2 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) or mGlu3 receptors in memory deficit induced by methamphetamine in mice. Methamphetamine treatment (1&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 5&nbsp;d followed by 7&nbsp;d of withdrawal) caused an impaired performance in the novel object recognition test in wild-type mice, but not in mGlu2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> or mGlu3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Memory deficit in wild-type mice challenged with methamphetamine was corrected by systemic treatment with selectively negative allosteric modulators of mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors (compounds VU6001966 and VU0650786, respectively). Methamphetamine treatment in wild-type mice caused large increases in levels of mGlu2/3 receptors, the Type 3 activator of G-protein signaling (AGS3), Rab3A, and the vesicular glutamate transporter, vGlut1, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Methamphetamine did not alter mGlu2/3-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation but abolished the ability of postsynaptic mGlu3 receptors to boost mGlu5 receptor-mediated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in PFC slices. Remarkably, activation of presynaptic mGlu2/3 receptors did not inhibit but rather amplified depolarization-induced [<sup>3</sup>H]-D-aspartate release in synaptosomes prepared from the PFC of methamphetamine-treated mice. These findings demonstrate that exposure to methamphetamine causes changes in the expression and function of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, which might alter excitatory synaptic transmission in the PFC and raise the attractive possibility that selective inhibitors of mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors (or both) may be used to improve cognitive dysfunction in individuals affected by MUD.</p>

                Background: Cataracts are common causes of visual impairment. Preventing blindness requires an early and accurate diagnosis. This review examines current cataract diagnosis strategies, explores data-driven machine learning algorithms for early detection, investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, assesses improvements in cataract detection accuracy, identifies research gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies. Methods: We gathered labelled cataract and non-cataract fundus data from the Kaggle. Scholarly publications were sourced from reliable databases such as ProQuest, IEEE, ELSEVIER, Google Scholar, and PubMed. A detailed literature search with specific terms expanded the scope of this review. We included studies that used cataract and non-cataract fundus eye images from cross-sectional, retrospective, and prospective studies. The quality assessment used the AMSTAR tool, considering factors such as literature search comprehensiveness, study selection criteria, data extraction methodologies, and study validity (Table 1). Results: This study encompassed 130 research publications, focusing on machine learning models and clinical-based diagnostic approaches for early-stage cataract identification. The performance of machine-learning models is influenced by factors such as dataset noise and limited reliable data. Barriers to the successful implementation of AI for cataract diagnosis were identified. Conclusions: This review emphasises the obstacles hindering the broad application of AI in cataract diagnosis. Addressing these findings is vital for developing strategies to overcome these challenges and enhance cataract detection systems. To achieve improved accuracy and efficiency in cataract diagnosis, future research should prioritise efforts to enhance dataset availability and quality, reduce data noise, and refine machine-learning algorithms. Unlocking the full potential of AI and/or machine learning can lead to significant breakthroughs in cataract diagnosis, ultimately resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced visual impairments.

                Lymphomas of the oral and oropharyngeal regions are rather uncommon, and diagnosis can be challenging and confusing due to the multiple histological subgroups. Lymphomas are the third most common type of tumor in the head and neck region and are brought on by the lymphoreticular system. The two forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case report of oropharyngeal lymphoma. The female patient reported with a complaint of swelling over the palatal region for two to three months. An ulceroproliferative lesion was evident over the posterior palatal region. We diagnosed reactive lymphadenitis based on an incisional biopsy. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions, a punch biopsy followed by immunohistochemical studies were done. Features suggestive of activated B-cell-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were confirmed. Among malignant lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most prevalent variety. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of this disease. In this case report, we aim to correlate the clinical presentation, histology features and immunohistochemical significance in order to promote early discovery, diagnosis, and treatment for a better prognosis of the patient.

                Introduction and importance The cholecystoenteric fistula, a rare complication of cholelithiasis, usually occurs as an internal biliary fistula. Our case features a cholecystoduodenal fistula presenting with severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding originating from the cystic artery. Symptoms vary, and preoperative diagnosis is uncommon. Case presentation A 63-year-old diabetic patient, who had undergone surgical treatment for a left forearm fracture, presented with persistent bleeding, hematemesis, and melena. Diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an actively bleeding ulcer on the duodenal bulb, with an attempted hemostasis. Initial stabilization was achieved, but a recurrence occurred after 17 hours with hemodynamic instability. Emergency laparotomy revealed cholecystitis with a cholecystoduodenal fistula, necessitating cholecystectomy and ulcer resection. The source of bleeding was the cystic artery. The patient had a positive postoperative outcome with no recurrence of hemorrhage. Clinical discussion Cholecystoenteric fistulas, forming from obstructed cystic duct inflammation, are rare complications of biliary lithiasis. Most cases are spontaneous, linked to gallstones. Severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding from cholecystoduodenal fistulas is uncommon, often requiring surgical intervention due to cystic artery erosion. Despite advancements in laparoscopic methods, open operations are preferred for anatomical distortion and inflammation. A clear diagnosis involves hepatic angiography and may necessitate embolization. The rarity of this condition emphasizes the need for vigilant diagnosis, especially in patients with gallstone history. Conclusion Massive bleeding from cystic artery erosion by duodenal ulcer through cholecystoduodenal fistula underscores the need for clinicians’ vigilance. Recognition of gallstone disease history is crucial for timely diagnosis in this rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding.

                Background The absence of a culturally adapted and validated Smile Aesthetics Scale for Peruvian university students reveals a significant gap in aesthetic dentistry and public health research. Addressing this gap is essential for accurately assessing dental aesthetic satisfaction within this demographic, ensuring the scale’s relevance and effectiveness across Spanish-speaking cultures. The aim of the study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Smile Aesthetics Satisfaction Scale for Peruvian university students. Methods This research was applied, with an instrumental, cross-sectional, and descriptive design. Face validity was conducted with 10 students through unstructured interviews. Content validity was carried out by three experts. The validation of psychometric properties was performed on 190 students recruited through university dentistry social networks using simple random probability sampling. The Aiken test was used for face and content validity. Construct validity and internal consistency were examined through principal component and exploratory factor analysis, using promax and varimax rotations, and internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s Alpha. Results Face and content validity confirmed that the items were relevant and applicable, highlighting the significance of the construct evaluated within the specific cultural context of the research. The adapted scale reflected high content validity, with a global Aiken’s V of 0.83, emphasizing the clarity, coherence, and relevance of the items according to expert evaluation. The psychometric properties of the adapted scale were exceptional among the student population, evidenced by a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.889. Conclusions The translation and cultural adaptation process of the Smile Aesthetics Satisfaction Scale has proven to be successful not only in terms of coherence and fidelity with the original instrument but also in its applicability and relevance within the context of university dental students.

                Introduction Due to the specific work content, healthcare workers (HCWs) showed a high risk of mental health and well-being issues. And the COVID-19 pandemic has increased this effect. At the same time, the psychological well-being of HCWs from Central Asian countries remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health and well-being of HCWs from Central Asian countries, as well as associated factors, including the role of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional questioner-based study was carried out among HCWs from Central Asian countries during the July-November, 2022. The study included socio-demographic questions, DASS-21 scale, WHO-5 Well-being Index, and questions to assess the impact of COVID-19 on personal life and work of HCWs. Results The study involved 2,685 HCWs from the Kazakhstan (1,817), Kyrgyzstan (534), and Uzbekistan (334). The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 17.7%, 24.9% and 5.2%, respectively. Socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, marital and family status, occupation, managerial position; as well as pandemic-related frontline work history and changes in work and social life were associated with mental health and well-being. Conclusion The study underscores the pressing need to address the mental health challenges faced by HCWs in Central Asia, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings reveal concerning levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among HCWs, with socio-demographic factors and pandemic-related experiences influencing mental well-being.

Understanding the computational mechanisms that underlie the encoding and decoding of environmental stimuli is a crucial investigation in neuroscience. Central to this pursuit is the exploration of how the brain represents visual information across its hierarchical architecture. A prominent challenge resides in discerning the neural underpinnings of the processing of dynamic natural visual scenes. Although considerable research efforts have been made to characterize individual components of the visual pathway, a systematic understanding of the distinctive neural coding associated with visual stimuli, as they traverse this hierarchical landscape, remains elusive. In this study, we leverage the comprehensive Allen Visual Coding—Neuropixels dataset and utilize the capabilities of deep learning neural network models to study neural coding in response to dynamic natural visual scenes across an expansive array of brain regions. Our study reveals that our decoding model adeptly deciphers visual scenes from neural spiking patterns exhibited within each distinct brain area. A compelling observation arises from the comparative analysis of decoding performances, which manifests as a notable encoding proficiency within the visual cortex and subcortical nuclei, in contrast to a relatively reduced encoding activity within hippocampal neurons. Strikingly, our results unveil a robust correlation between our decoding metrics and well-established anatomical and functional hierarchy indexes. These findings corroborate existing knowledge in visual coding related to artificial visual stimuli and illuminate the functional role of these deeper brain regions using dynamic stimuli. Consequently, our results suggest a novel perspective on the utility of decoding neural network models as a metric for quantifying the encoding quality of dynamic natural visual scenes represented by neural responses, thereby advancing our comprehension of visual coding within the complex hierarchy of the brain.

                <p>by Ulysse Rançon, Timothée Masquelier, Benoit R. Cottereau</p>

Sounds are temporal stimuli decomposed into numerous elementary components by the auditory nervous system. For instance, a temporal to spectro-temporal transformation modelling the frequency decomposition performed by the cochlea is a widely adopted first processing step in today’s computational models of auditory neural responses. Similarly, increments and decrements in sound intensity (i.e., of the raw waveform itself or of its spectral bands) constitute critical features of the neural code, with high behavioural significance. However, despite the growing attention of the scientific community on auditory OFF responses, their relationship with transient ON, sustained responses and adaptation remains unclear. In this context, we propose a new general model, based on a pair of linear filters, named <i>AdapTrans</i>, that captures both sustained and transient ON and OFF responses into a unifying and easy to expand framework. We demonstrate that filtering audio cochleagrams with AdapTrans permits to accurately render known properties of neural responses measured in different mammal species such as the dependence of OFF responses on the stimulus fall time and on the preceding sound duration. Furthermore, by integrating our framework into gold standard and state-of-the-art machine learning models that predict neural responses from audio stimuli, following a supervised training on a large compilation of electrophysiology datasets (ready-to-deploy PyTorch models and pre-processed datasets shared publicly), we show that AdapTrans systematically improves the prediction accuracy of estimated responses within different cortical areas of the rat and ferret auditory brain. Together, these results motivate the use of our framework for computational and systems neuroscientists willing to increase the plausibility and performances of their models of audition.

Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) are novel cellular models that maintain the genetic, phenotypic and structural features of patient tumor tissue and are useful for studying tumorigenesis and drug response. When integrated with advanced 3D imaging and analysis techniques, PDTOs can be used to establish physiologically relevant high-throughput and high-content drug screening platforms that support the development of patient-specific treatment strategies. However, in order to effectively leverage high-throughput PDTO observations for clinical predictions, it is critical to establish a quantitative understanding of the basic properties and variability of organoid growth dynamics. In this work, we introduced an innovative workflow for analyzing and understanding PDTO growth dynamics, by integrating a high-throughput imaging deep learning platform with mathematical modeling, incorporating flexible growth laws and variable dormancy times. We applied the workflow to colon cancer organoids and demonstrated that organoid growth is well-described by the Gompertz model of growth. Our analysis showed significant intrapatient heterogeneity in PDTO growth dynamics, with the initial exponential growth rate of an organoid following a lognormal distribution within each dataset. The level of intrapatient heterogeneity varied between patients, as did organoid growth rates and dormancy times of single seeded cells. Our work contributes to an emerging understanding of the basic growth characteristics of PDTOs, and it highlights the heterogeneity in organoid growth both within and between patients. These results pave the way for further modeling efforts aimed at predicting treatment response dynamics and drug resistance timing.

                <p>by Janani Ravi, Kewalin Samart, Jason Zwolak</p>

Budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, is widely used as a model organism to study the genetics underlying eukaryotic cellular processes and growth critical to cancer development, such as cell division and cell cycle progression. The budding yeast cell cycle is also one of the best-studied dynamical systems owing to its thoroughly resolved genetics. However, the dynamics underlying the crucial cell cycle decision point called the START transition, at which the cell commits to a new round of DNA replication and cell division, are under-studied. The START machinery involves a central cyclin-dependent kinase; cyclins responsible for starting the transition, bud formation, and initiating DNA synthesis; and their transcriptional regulators. However, evidence has shown that the mechanism is more complicated than a simple irreversible transition switch. Activating a key transcription regulator SBF requires the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, Whi5, or an SBF/MBF monomeric component, Swi6, but not necessarily both. Also, the timing and mechanism of the inhibitor Whi5’s nuclear export, while important, are not critical for the timing and execution of START. Therefore, there is a need for a consolidated model for the budding yeast START transition, reconciling regulatory and spatial dynamics. We built a detailed mathematical model (START-BYCC) for the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle based on established molecular interactions and experimental phenotypes. START-BYCC recapitulates the underlying dynamics and correctly emulates key phenotypic traits of ~150 known START mutants, including regulation of size control, localization of inhibitor/transcription factor complexes, and the nutritional effects on size control. Such a detailed mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamics gets us closer towards deconvoluting the aberrant cellular development in cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011854">scaDA: A novel statistical method for differential analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fengdi Zhao, Xin Ma, Bing Yao, Qing Lu, Li Chen</p>

Single-cell ATAC-seq sequencing data (scATAC-seq) has been widely used to investigate chromatin accessibility on the single-cell level. One important application of scATAC-seq data analysis is differential chromatin accessibility (DA) analysis. However, the data characteristics of scATAC-seq such as excessive zeros and large variability of chromatin accessibility across cells impose a unique challenge for DA analysis. Existing statistical methods focus on detecting the mean difference of the chromatin accessible regions while overlooking the distribution difference. Motivated by real data exploration that distribution difference exists among cell types, we introduce a novel composite statistical test named “scaDA”, which is based on zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB), for performing differential distribution analysis of chromatin accessibility by jointly testing the abundance, prevalence and dispersion simultaneously. Benefiting from both dispersion shrinkage and iterative refinement of mean and prevalence parameter estimates, scaDA demonstrates its superiority to both ZINB-based likelihood ratio tests and published methods by achieving the highest power and best FDR control in a comprehensive simulation study. In addition to demonstrating the highest power in three real sc-multiome data analyses, scaDA successfully identifies differentially accessible regions in microglia from sc-multiome data for an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) study that are most enriched in GO terms related to neurogenesis and the clinical phenotype of AD, and AD-associated GWAS SNPs.

                Background Body goes through significant hormonal and physiological changes during pregnancy, which could be linked to changes in oral health. Many women are unaware of the negative consequences of poor dental health during and after pregnancy, both for themselves and their children. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing (MI) and cross platform messaging application (WhatsApp messenger) for oral health education on the oral health knowledge, attitude and behaviours among pregnant women attending ante natal care. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 84 pregnant women. Simple random sampling was employed to select participants after oral examination. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups (Group 1: Cross-platform messaging application [WhatsApp]; Group 2: MI) using a lottery method. Pregnant women aged 18 years and older, gestational age between 8 and 30 weeks were included. A face-to-face interview and oral examination were conducted to assess baseline knowledge and oral hygiene status. A follow-up examination was conducted after one month of intervention. Inferential statistics, including the chi-square test and independent t-test, were used to compare variables between the two groups. Results The mean knowledge score at baseline was comparable between Group 1 (WhatsApp) and Group 2 (MI). However, post-intervention, Group 2 showed a significantly higher mean knowledge score compared to Group 1. Post-intervention, Group 2 exhibited a significantly better oral hygiene status compared to Group 1. Significant improvements in oral health behaviours were observed in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (p < 0.001). Conclusions The findings suggested that while both interventions were effective, MI showed superior results in improving knowledge, oral hygiene status, and oral health behaviours. The personalized and client-centred approach of MI enables participants to explore and resolve ambivalence, promoting a deeper understanding of the importance of oral health during pregnancy.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation and considered an inborn error of metabolism. In recent years, we have diagnosed an increasing number of patients where, despite extensive investigation, no disease-causing mutations have been found. We therefore investigated a cohort of consecutive patients, with the objective to detect possible non-genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We searched the patient records and the registry of muscle biopsies, for patients with MADD, diagnosed within the past 10 years. The patient records were reviewed regarding symptoms, clinical findings, comorbidities, drugs, diagnostic investigations, and response to treatment. In addition, complementary investigations of muscle tissue were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 9 patients diagnosed with late-onset MADD. All presented with muscle weakness and elevated levels of creatine kinase. A lipid storage myopathy was evident in the muscle biopsies, as was elevated acylcarnitines in blood. Despite thorough genetic investigations, a probable genetic cause was found in only 2 patients. Remarkably, all 7 patients without disease-causing mutations were treated with sertraline. In some cases, a deterioration of symptoms closely followed dose increase, and discontinuation resulted in an improved acylcarnitine profile. All 9 patients responded to riboflavin treatment with normalization of creatine kinase and muscle biopsy findings, and in 8 patients the clinical symptoms clearly improved.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings strongly suggest that sertraline may induce an acquired form of MADD in some patients. Importantly, riboflavin treatment seems to be similarly effective as in genetic MADD, but discontinuation of sertraline is reasonably warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal area CA2 has garnered attention in recent times owing to its significant involvement in social memory and distinctive plasticity characteristics. Research has revealed that the CA2 region demonstrates a remarkable resistance to plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer Collateral (SC)-CA2 pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Nogo-A, a well-known axon growth inhibitor and more recently discovered plasticity regulator, in modulating plasticity within the CA2 region. The findings demonstrate that blocking Nogo-A in male rat hippocampal slices facilitates the establishment of both short-term and long-term plasticity in the SC-CA2 pathway, while having no impact on the Entorhinal Cortical (EC)-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the study reveals that inhibiting Nogo-A enables association between the SC and EC pathways. Mechanistically, we confirm that Nogo-A operates through its well-known co-receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), and its downstream signaling factor such as Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), as their inhibition also allows plasticity induction in the SC-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in both the EC and SC-CA2 pathways led to persistent LTD, which was not affected by Nogo-A inhibition. Our study demonstrates the involvement of Nogo-A mediated signaling mechanisms in limiting synaptic plasticity within the CA2 region.</p>

Matthew Schrag was unaware of Ghribi's actions and not in any way involved, and agrees with this decision. Sunita Sharma, Holly Brown-Borg, and Othman Ghribi did not respond.</p>

                Muik et al. show that, in individuals pre-immunized with SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain mRNA vaccines, cross-reactive humoral immunity targeting conserved epitopes remains dominant after two exposures to Omicron BA.1 spike. Their observations indicate that persistent immune imprinting may limit strain-specific naive B cell priming even after repeated variant spike exposure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96257">Dual targeting of histone deacetylases and MYC as potential treatment strategy for H3-K27M pediatric gliomas</a></h4>

              
                Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94903">Metabolic disruption impairs ribosomal protein levels, resulting in enhanced aminoglycoside tolerance</a></h4>

              
                Aminoglycoside antibiotics target ribosomes and are effective against a wide range of bacteria. Here, we demonstrated that knockout strains related to energy metabolism in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed increased tolerance to aminoglycosides during the mid-exponential growth phase. Contrary to expectations, these mutations did not reduce the proton motive force or aminoglycoside uptake, as there were no significant changes in metabolic indicators or intracellular gentamicin levels between wild-type and mutant strains. Our comprehensive proteomics analysis unveiled a noteworthy upregulation of proteins linked to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mutant strains during the mid-exponential growth phase, suggesting that these strains compensate for the perturbation in their energy metabolism by increasing TCA cycle activity to maintain their membrane potential and ATP levels. Furthermore, our pathway enrichment analysis shed light on local network clusters displaying downregulation across all mutant strains, which were associated with both large and small ribosomal binding proteins, ribosome biogenesis, translation factor activity, and the biosynthesis of ribonucleoside monophosphates. These findings offer a plausible explanation for the observed tolerance of aminoglycosides in the mutant strains. Altogether, this research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of aminoglycoside tolerance, paving the way for novel strategies to combat such cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84875">Spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent mitotic delay is required for cell division in absence of centrosomes</a></h4>

              
                The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) temporally regulates mitosis by preventing progression from metaphase to anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle. Centrosomes refine the spatial organization of the mitotic spindle at the spindle poles. However, centrosome loss leads to elongated mitosis, suggesting that centrosomes also inform the temporal organization of mitosis in mammalian cells. Here, we find that the mitotic delay in acentrosomal cells is enforced by the SAC in a MPS1-dependent manner, and that a SAC-dependent mitotic delay is required for bipolar cell division to occur in acentrosomal cells. Although acentrosomal cells become polyploid, polyploidy is not sufficient to cause dependency on a SAC-mediated delay to complete cell division. Rather, the division failure in absence of MPS1 activity results from mitotic exit occurring before acentrosomal spindles can become bipolar. Furthermore, prevention of centrosome separation suffices to make cell division reliant on a SAC-dependent mitotic delay. Thus, centrosomes and their definition of two spindle poles early in mitosis provide a ‘timely two-ness’ that allows cell division to occur in absence of a SAC-dependent mitotic delay.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95257">Deciphering the actin structure-dependent preferential cooperative binding of cofilin</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism underlying the preferential and cooperative binding of cofilin and the expansion of clusters toward the pointed-end side of actin filaments remains poorly understood. To address this, we conducted a principal component analysis based on available filamentous actin (F-actin) and C-actin (cofilins were excluded from cofilactin) structures and compared to monomeric G-actin. The results strongly suggest that C-actin, rather than F-ADP-actin, represented the favourable structure for binding preference of cofilin. High-speed atomic force microscopy explored that the shortened bare half helix adjacent to the cofilin clusters on the pointed end side included fewer actin protomers than normal helices. The mean axial distance (MAD) between two adjacent actin protomers along the same long-pitch strand within shortened bare half helices was longer (5.0–6.3 nm) than the MAD within typical helices (4.3–5.6 nm). The inhibition of torsional motion during helical twisting, achieved through stronger attachment to the lipid membrane, led to more pronounced inhibition of cofilin binding and cluster formation than the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in solution. F-ADP-actin exhibited more naturally supertwisted half helices than F-ADP.Pi-actin, explaining how Pi inhibits cofilin binding to F-actin with variable helical twists. We propose that protomers within the shorter bare helical twists, either influenced by thermal fluctuation or induced allosterically by cofilin clusters, exhibit characteristics of C-actin-like structures with an elongated MAD, leading to preferential and cooperative binding of cofilin.

	<p>To better understand the individual differences in fairness, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the fairness characteristics of deaf college students through the ultimatum game task. Behaviorally, the significant main effect of the proposal type was found, which meant both deaf and hearing college students showed a lower acceptance rate for the more unfair proposal. Interestingly, we found a significant interaction between group and proposal type in the early stage (N1). Moreover, in the deaf college group, N1 (induced by moderately and very unfair proposals) was significantly larger than that of fair proposals. However, we found that deaf college students had smaller amplitudes on P2 and P3 than hearing college students. These results suggested that deaf college students might pursue more equity strongly so they are more sensitive to unfair information in the early stage. In a word, we should provide more fair allocations for deaf college students in our harmonious society.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive impairment is common in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and occurs through multiple mechanisms, including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pathology and the involvement of &amp;amp;alpha;-synucleinopathies. We aimed to investigate the pathological biomarkers of both PD and AD in plasma and neuronal extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their association with different types of cognitive impairment in PD patients. Methods: A total of 122 patients with PD and 30 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional cohort study between March 2021 and July 2023. Non-dementia PD patients were divided into amnestic and non-amnestic groups according to the memory domain of a neuropsychological assessment. Plasma and neuronal EV biomarkers, including &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein (&amp;amp;alpha;-syn), beta-amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;), total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), were measured using a single-molecule array and a chemiluminescence immunoassay, respectively. Results: Neuronal EV but not plasma &amp;amp;alpha;-syn levels, were significantly increased in PD as compared to healthy controls, and they were positively associated with UPDRS part III scores and the severity of cognitive impairment. A lower plasma A&amp;amp;beta;42 level and higher neuronal EV T-tau level were found in the amnestic PD group compared to the non-amnestic PD group. Conclusions: The results of the current study demonstrate that neuronal EV &amp;amp;alpha;-syn levels can be a sensitive biomarker for assisting in the diagnosis and disease severity prediction of PD. Both AD and PD pathologies are important factors in cognitive impairment associated with PD, and AD pathologies are more involved in amnestic memory deficit in PD.</p>

	<p>Incidental visuospatial learning acquired under incidental conditions is more vulnerable to aging than in the intentional case. The theta and gamma correlates of the coding and retrieval of episodic memory change during aging. Based on the vulnerability of incidental coding to aging, different theta and gamma correlates could occur under the incidental versus intentional coding and retrieval of visuospatial information. Theta and gamma EEG was recorded from the frontotemporal regions, and incidental/intentional visuospatial learning was evaluated in young (25&amp;amp;ndash;60 years old) and elderly (60&amp;amp;ndash;85 years old) participants. The EEG recorded during encoding and retrieval was compared between incidental low-demand, incidental high-demand, and intentional conditions through an ANCOVA considering the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s gender, IQ, and years of schooling as covariates. Older adults exhibited worse performances, especially in place&amp;amp;ndash;object associations. After the intentional study, older participants showed a further increase in false-positive errors. Higher power at the theta and gamma bands was observed for frontotemporal derivations in older participants for both encoding and retrieval. Under retrieval, only young participants had lower power in terms of errors compared with correct responses. In conclusion, the different patterns of power and coherence support incidental and intentional visuospatial encoding and retrieval in young and elderly individuals. The correlates of power with behavior are sensitive to age and performance.</p>

                <p>Language is an evolutionarily salient faculty for humans that relies on a distributed brain network spanning across frontal, temporal, parietal, and subcortical regions. To understand whether the complex language network shares common or distinct genetic mechanisms, we examined the relationships between the genetic effects underlying the brain responses to language and a set of object domains that have been suggested to coevolve with language: tools, faces (indicating social), and body parts (indicating social and gesturing). Analyzing the twin datasets released by the Human Connectome Project that had functional magnetic resonance imaging data from human twin subjects (monozygotic and dizygotic) undergoing language and working memory tasks contrasting multiple object domains (198 females and 144 males for the language task; 192 females and 142 males for the working memory task), we identified a set of cortical regions in the frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical regions whose activity to language was significantly genetically influenced. The heterogeneity of the genetic effects among these language clusters was corroborated by significant differences of the human gene expression profiles (Allen Human Brain Atlas dataset). Among them, the bilateral basal ganglia (mainly dorsal caudate) exhibited a common genetic basis for language, tool, and body part processing, and the right superior temporal gyrus exhibited a common genetic basis for language and tool processing across multiple types of analyses. These results uncovered the heterogeneous genetic patterns of language neural processes, shedding light on the evolution of language and its shared origins with tools and bodily functions.</p>

                Background The global construction industry causes considerable stress to workers, affecting them physically and mentally. Stress, a reaction to difficult situations, can cause negative health effects. The demanding environment of a construction site increases stress, which leads to psychological, physical, and behavioral reactions. Traditional treatments often have side effects and social stigma. Hydrotherapy, which uses water for healing, offers a promising alternative that promotes relaxation and detoxification. Its multiple benefits make it a valuable stress management tool. This scoping review aims to critically analyze existing interventions on physiological well-being popular in the construction industry and to investigate the biological responses of hydrotherapy to stress markers. Finally, make recommendations that support the health of construction industry workers. Methods An evaluation funneled by the Arksey and O’Malley framework, improvements plus suggestions by Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien, Daudt et al., with the 2015 Johanna Briggs Institute guidelines will be performed. Organized electronic explorations of records and search engines including Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Google Scholar, plus IEEE Xplore will be conducted to retrieve distributed peer-reviewed articles from all research projects, excluding reviews and gray published works. All literature, research questions and sub-questions meeting the inclusion criteria will be integrated in this evaluation. All searched literature is transferred to the Endnote 21 library. The quality evaluation of the involved papers will be achieved by applying the MMAT 2018 version. Discussion We envision charting applicable sources on stress, researching the efficacy of treatment alternatives for stress as well as assessing their correlation with quality of life in construction workers. This study is expected to expose research gaps, which could guide future accomplishment research on stress treatment mediations.

                Background Academic achievement is the result of both effort and perseverance exerted by the students. This mixed-methods study aims to investigate the factors affecting the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was utilized. In the quantitative phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 1008 students (773 females and 235 males) from 23 Syrian universities. A questionnaire consisting of 48 items was designed to be completed by pharmacy students using a 5-point Likert scale. In the qualitative phase, twelve questions were developed to interview thirty pharmacy students from five Syrian universities to obtain in-depth insights into the factors influencing their academic achievement. Results A significant number of students lacked effective time management skills, identified as a weakness among students. The majority of students faced challenges in maintaining a consistent study routine, averaging a score of (2.0). Motivation towards learning emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing academic performance. Lecturers in the pharmacy faculty employed traditional teaching methods (2.01), and the pharmacy curriculum was perceived as lacking modernity (1.92). Quantitative findings demonstrated that pharmacy students experienced exam-related anxiety (2.05), identified as a weakness in the qualitative phase. Factors associated with the Syrian crisis, like unreliable electricity (1.87) and transportation issues (1.83), could have an impact on academic achievement. Economic conditions were identified as challenging to students’ academic performance, negatively affecting the learning process (1.98). Conclusion The results of the study demonstrate that personal factors, lecturers, educational environment, exams, and the Syrian crisis influence the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-867/v1?src=rss">More foreign-accented but more comprehensible: Attrition and amelioration of L1 speech in proficient L2 learners [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background There is an increasing interest in cross-linguistic influences of the second language (L2) on the first (L1), but its communicative impact remains to be elucidated. This study investigates how L2 learners’ L1 pronunciation is perceived as foreign-accented and (in) comprehensible as a function of their L2 learning experience and proficiency levels. Methods Read speech of 154 L1 Japanese learners of L2 English in the J-AESOP corpus was examined, where approximately one-third of them had lived in English-speaking countries and the rest had never lived outside of Japan. Their L1 speech was rated by another group of native Japanese listeners for accentedness and comprehensibility (from October 25, 2022 to August 20, 2023), while their L2 speech was previously rated by native American English listeners for nativelikeness or proficiency. The speakers’ vowel acoustics were also examined. Results More proficient L2 speakers were perceived as more foreign-accented in their L1, but only if they had lived overseas; their length of residence abroad predicted the degree of perceived accentedness. In contrast, more proficient L2 speakers were consistently perceived as more comprehensible in the L1, regardless of prior overseas experience. Acoustic analyses indicated that perceived accentedness is associated with a clockwise chain shift of all vowel categories in the vowel space. It was also revealed that the dispersion, rather than compactness, of vowel production contributed to perceived comprehensibility, although the degree of L1 vowel dispersion did not predict L2 proficiency. Conclusions The overall results suggest two main conclusions. First, perceptible L1 foreign accent likely results from L1 disuse rather than L2 interference, thereby L1 pronunciation differs from native norms at a system-wide rather than category-specific level. Second, L2 learning has a positive influence on perceived L1 comprehensibility, rather than individuals with clearer and more comprehensible L1 speech being inherently better L2 learners.

                Background Music, a profound human expression, can have physical implications for its practitioners. Musicians face various physical challenges that can impact their well-being, with craniofacial and temporomandibular pain being prevalent yet understudied. Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) affects up to one-third of the population, though prevalence varies by study. While musculoskeletal issues like carpal tunnel syndrome are well-documented in musicians, craniofacial and temporomandibular pain is less explored. This study aims to determine the differences in TMJD frequency among music students of different instrumental specialties. Methods The sample was composed of students between 12 and 25 years of age from the National University of Music of Peru. A stratified random probability sample was chosen. Data were collected using a structured instrument covering general data, academic information, dental malocclusion, the Fonseca Simplified Anamnestic Index, and the Global Stress Perception Scale. Statistical analysis included Pearson's Chi-square test and a generalized linear model regression. Results The sample included 71.4% males with a median age of 23 years. Class II dental occlusion was most common (51.4%). TMJD prevalence was: 14.3% no TMJD, 60.0% mild TMJD, 22.9% moderate TMJD, and 2.9% severe TMJD. Metal wind (PR=0.04, 95%CI [0.00; 50.04], p=0.002) and woodwind players (PR=0.03, 95%CI [0.00; 0.56], p=0.018) had lower TMJD prevalence compared to plucked string and percussion players. Post-regression analysis indicated significant differences between metal wind and percussion students (p=0.030) and between percussion and woodwind students (p=0.025). These results are supported by the adjusted ratio of proportions analysis, which maintains statistical significance. Conclusion We found significant differences in TMJD prevalence among music students based on their instrumental specialty, with lower rates in metal wind and woodwind players compared to plucked string and percussion players.

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

                Background Pragmatic language assessment in children is performed in line with standard protocols, guidelines, and best practices. The absence of these aspects in the Indian context has resulted in the quest to explore the approaches used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to assess pragmatic language impairments. This survey explored the current practices of SLPs towards the assessment of pragmatic language among preschool children in India. It also aimed to identify the barriers, facilitators and identify the level of knowledge, skill and overall practice of SLPs towards their practices using self-appraisal. Methods A total of 100 SLPs(94 females and 6 males) working with preschool aged children (three-to-six-year-olds) from across different Indian states participated in the survey. Participants were enquired about the aspects of pragmatic language assessed, methods used for assessment, awareness and use of Indian tools, the settings, members, and language used for the assessment. Additionally, they were asked to mention the specific tools used, informal methods used, barriers and facilitators, and self-appraise their knowledge, skill and overall practice. Results Majority of participants assessed multiple aspects of pragmatic language. All used a combination of different assessment methods, with the participants commonly using informal compared to formal approaches. Preschoolers were assessed at multiple settings, along with different communication partners. Lack of awareness on assessment tools developed in India was the major barrier, while the use of informal tasks or activities were the major facilitators influencing pragmatic language assessment to a greater extent. The knowledge and skills for the assessment of pragmatic language obtained poorer scores compared to practices. Conclusions The assessment practices of the SLPs were largely influenced by the unavailability of developed or adapted tools for Indian preschoolers, leading to the need to develop indigenous assessment tools. Certain considerations for further assessment practices have been identified and discussed.

                Occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is a rare genetic disease and copper transport disorder caused by a faulty ATP7A gene with multisystemic presentations, most originally related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue affections. In our case, a male neonate with OHS presented soon after birth with pathognomonic occipital exostosis, cutis laxa at the nape region, and widely opened skull sutures and fontanels. A skeletal survey showed occipital exostosis projecting from the line of insertion of the trapezius muscle and wide fontanels on skull X-ray films with no exostoses or deformities elsewhere. In addition to our case report being the second reported case for the condition detected early in the neonatal period, it also emphasizes the importance of investigating any sign thoroughly, as it may be an early alarming sign of a progressive disease that may affect the patient’s quality of life. In addition, it highlights the value of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of these patients.

                Patients with hepatitis C share a variety of anemia, including bleeding, nutritional deficiencies, and anemia of chronic disease. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is usually reported with interferon-alpha and/or ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We report an unusual case of AIHA occurring in a49-year-old patient with untreated hepatitis C infection who presented with functional anemia syndrome. Monospecific direct antiglobulin test showed the presence of anti-complement (C3d++). Cold agglutinin titer was 1/16 at 4°C. The patient improved following blood transfusion, steroid therapy and direct acting antivirals.

                Background Excessive smartphone use has become a growing public health concern, especially among young people. Previous studies have suggested a possible relationship between excessive smartphone use and bruxism. However, the evidence on this relationship is still limited and inconclusive. This study aimed to determine the relationship between smartphone dependence and addiction and bruxism in “NEET” (not in education, employment or training) young people in two coastal cities in Peru: Piura and Chincha. Methods A cross-sectional, correlational, and exploratory study was conducted. The sample consisted of 195 "NEETs" young people who attended to dental office. Two data collection instruments were used: the Smartphone Dependence and Addiction Scale (EDAS-18) and the self-reported bruxism questionnaire (CBA). The Chi2 Pearson test was used to analyze the association between the variables. Results In Piura, a significant association was found between smartphone dependence or addiction and bruxism (49.3% of young people with smartphone dependence or addiction had bruxism, p-value = 0.003). However, in Chincha this relationship was not significant. In the latter city, bruxism showed a significant association with gender (men had a higher prevalence of bruxism, p-value = 0.034), but not with smartphone dependence or addiction (p-value = 0.171). In Piura, the proportion of bruxism was 3.77 times higher in those with smartphone dependence or addiction in the simple model (p-value = 0.004), and 5.38 times higher in the adjusted model (p-value = 0.001). Conclusion This study highlights the regional variability in the relationship between smartphone use and bruxism among “NEETs” young people. A significant association is evident in Piura but not in Chincha, which underscores the need for context-adapted interventions to address the effects of excessive technology use on oral health.

                Background Heat induced by thermogenesis is an essential therapeutic intervention in medical practice. Moreover, thermogenesis improves the innate immune response. This study focuses on hand-clasping with a raised thumb (HCRT) as a thermogenic source and its effect on heart rate variability (HRV). Methods The study analyzed the ECG, thermal images of the upper body, axillary temperature, and breath exergy of 15 participants. The metabolic effect of thermogenesis is an important factor in type II diabetes mellitus (type II DM). Therefore, the clinical application included recording capillary blood glucose of 12 type-II DM subjects before and after the HCRT intervention. Results The mean axillary temperature slope increased by 11.5 %. The spatial change in temperature gradient (∇2T) at hot and cold spots also slightly increased by 3.42 % and 2.53 %, respectively. HRV improved as the VLFHF ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.05) by 52.62 %. The very low frequency (VLF) component of HRV has a relationship to thermoregulation, which is reflected through a significant increase (p < 0.05) of 41.7 % for the power under sub-VLF at 0.0327-0.04 Hz during HCRT. The spot width (SW), range, and norm of ∇2T reduces insignificantly during HCRT. There was a significant (p < 0.001) increase in the exhaled temperature by 0.5 ° C in both nostrils during 1st phase of HCRT. The standard deviation of exergy in the right nostril showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) of 72.72 % during HCRT. The Clinical tests showed a significant reduction (p < 0.001) of 24.14 % in capillary blood glucose (CBG) after HCRT. Conclusions HCRT aids in thermogenesis with higher exergy and HRV owing to a significant reduction in the VLFHF ratio.

                Background Determine the effects of a multifactorial lifestyle intervention on physical activity (PA), BMI and health-related quality of life (QoL) in obese and overweight adolescents. Methods Nine schools in India were clustered randomly in a 12-month study with students allocated to a multifactorial intervention (MFI), or exercise only (EX) or control (CON) group. Participants were adolescents aged 11-16 years (n=671). In the MFI group, adolescents and their parents received lifestyle education using a validated booklet combined with a PA intervention for school students. The EX group received school-based PA only; the CON group continued regular activities. Primary outcomes were PA levels measured with the PAQ-A, and BMI; the secondary outcome was health-related QoL. A linear regression statistical model was used to analyse time, group effects and interactions, with Bonferroni correction for within-group differences at baseline (T0) and at 12-weeks (T1) (post-intervention), 6-month (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups. Results Significant time and group effects observed for all groups with PA scores (p<0.001), with MFI group having largest increase in PA; with BMI (p<0.001) and MFI showing the least gain in BMI; and HRQOL (p<0.001), with MFI group showing greatest improvement in scores. There were significant increases in PA at T1 and T3 time-points with the EX group, and at T3 time-point only for MFI and CON, with MFI group showing largest increase in HRQOL scores. BMI increased significantly for all groups at T2 (MFI p=0.001, EX p<0.001) and T3 (p<0.001), while HRQOL increased significantly for both MFI and EX at both follow-ups (p<0.001). Conclusions School-based lifestyle MFI was more effective for improving PA, lifestyle behaviours and HRQOL than exercise alone for adolescents, although BMI was not reduced. MFI with PA could be an effective school-based approach for behaviour modification but BMI has limitations for measuring body composition changes.

                The translation of animal-based biomedical research into clinical research is often inadequate. Maximizing translation should be central to animal research on human diseases, guiding researchers in study design and animal model selection. However, practical considerations often drive the choice of animal model, which may not always reflect key patient characteristics, such as sex and age, impacting the disease's course. Despite diseases affecting both sexes, researchers frequently use male mice. To address this imbalance, journals and funding agencies have begun questioning the sex of animals used in studies and issued new guidelines. Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade. By systematically assessing the age and sex of the mice, we aim to initiate a discussion on the appropriate choice of animal model to improve the translatability of research results.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with early diagnosis and risk factor identification crucial for improving outcomes. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measurements have emerged as promising tools in breast cancer diagnostics. However, the influence of hormonal status on these measurements remains unclear. Objective This scoping review aims to synthesize current evidence on how hormonal changes in pre- and post-menopausal women influence ADC values of benign, malignant, and fibroglandular breast tissues. Method Following the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases for relevant studies published between January 2000 and 2021. Inclusion criteria encompassed 1.5 Tesla MRI studies reporting ADC values in female subjects, considering menopausal status. Results Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 612 patients, were analyzed. Findings suggest that menopausal status may influence ADC values, with postmenopausal women generally showing lower ADC values in both normal fibroglandular tissue and breast lesions. The impact of menstrual cycle phases on ADC values was less consistent across studies. Conclusions This review highlights the potential influence of hormonal status on ADC values in breast tissues. While DWI with ADC mapping shows promise as a reliable diagnostic tool across different hormonal states, further research is needed to fully understand and account for hormonal influences on ADC measurements. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, standardization of DWI protocols, and integration of hormonal status information into breast cancer risk assessment models.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Sui's hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

                Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are aquatic sessile metazoans found worldwide in marine and freshwater environments. They are significant in the animal tree of life as one of the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and as filter feeders play crucial ecological roles, particularly in coral reefs, but are susceptible to the effects of climate change. In the face of the current biodiversity crisis, genomic data is crucial for species conservation efforts and predicting their evolutionary potential in response to environmental changes. However, there is a limited availability of culturable sponge species with annotated high-quality genomes to further comprehensive insights into animal evolution, function, and their response to the ongoing global change. Despite the publication of a few high-quality annotated sponge genomes, there remains a gap in resources for culturable sponge species. To address this gap, we provide high quality draft genomes of the two congeneric aquarium species Tethya wilhelma and Tethya minuta, small ball-shaped demosponges that are easily maintained long-term in ex situ culture. As such, they offer promising opportunities as laboratory models to contribute to advancing our understanding of sponge biology and provide valuable resources for studying animal evolution, function, and responses to environmental challenges.

                Purpose: This study aims to survey the demographic status of aesthetic plastic surgeons in an economically developed region and to investigate their continuing training needs in contents, training methods, and barriers in private and government hospitals.   Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire was conducted from January to December, 2022 in Guangdong, China. In-depth interviews were conducted with key informants to gain insights on the current demographic status. Demographic data and training needs assessment were collected and compared with the chi-square test, Fisher’s test, Mann-Whitney U-test using R software. Results: The disparity of surgeons’ demographic data between private and government hospitals was small. Over 60% of practicing aesthetic plastic surgeons transferred from other specialties, and one third of them had less than three years of working experience. Half of surgeons attended training less than three times with an affordable expense of 1000-5000RMB. Almost 80% of them had strong willingness to attend a continuing training program. They prefer to attend further study in a tertiary hospital, with a short topic-focused training course and operation demonstrations. Their favorable training contents were rhinoplasty, eye surgery, and new technologies. Our questionnaire survey revealed the likelihood that the surgeons had a graduate degree in government hospitals outweighed those in private hospitals (P<0.05). Results also showed that the government hospitals focused more on repair and reconstructive surgery and academic research, whereas, private hospitals focused on market needs and were more profit-driven, where the organizational needs had influence on their different training needs for aesthetic plastic surgeons. Conclusion: It would be favorable to take the demographic status of aesthetic plastic surgeons and organizational needs into consideration in designing a continuing training program in plastic surgery.
