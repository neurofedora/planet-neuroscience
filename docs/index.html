              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04571">Dissociating Artificial Intelligence from Artificial Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developments in machine learning and computing power suggest that artificial general intelligence is within reach. This raises the question of artificial consciousness: if a computer were to be functionally equivalent to a human, being able to do all we do, would it experience sights, sounds, and thoughts, as we do when we are conscious? Answering this question in a principled manner can only be done on the basis of a theory of consciousness that is grounded in phenomenology and that states the necessary and sufficient conditions for any system, evolved or engineered, to support subjective experience. Here we employ Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which provides principled tools to determine whether a system is conscious, to what degree, and the content of its experience. We consider pairs of systems constituted of simple Boolean units, one of which -- a basic stored-program computer -- simulates the other with full functional equivalence. By applying the principles of IIT, we demonstrate that (i) two systems can be functionally equivalent without being phenomenally equivalent, and (ii) that this conclusion is not dependent on the simulated system's function. We further demonstrate that, according to IIT, it is possible for a digital computer to simulate our behavior, possibly even by simulating the neurons in our brain, without replicating our experience. This contrasts sharply with computational functionalism, the thesis that performing computations of the right kind is necessary and sufficient for consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04366">Artificial intelligence and the internal processes of creativity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.04366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of generating creative outputs are reshaping our understanding of creativity. This shift presents an opportunity for creativity researchers to reevaluate the key components of the creative process. In particular, the advanced capabilities of AI underscore the importance of studying the internal processes of creativity. This paper explores the neurobiological machinery that underlies these internal processes and describes the experiential component of creativity. It is concluded that although the products of artificial and human creativity can be similar, the internal processes are different. The paper also discusses how AI may negatively affect the internal processes of human creativity, such as the development of skills, the integration of knowledge, and the diversity of ideas.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04847">MTSpark: Enabling Multi-Task Learning with Spiking Neural Networks for Generalist Agents</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, state-of-the-art RL methods excel in single-task settings, but they still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to catastrophic forgetting challenges, where previously learned tasks are forgotten as new tasks are introduced. This multi-task learning capability is significantly important for generalist agents, where adaptation features are highly required (e.g., autonomous robots). On the other hand, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as alternative energy-efficient neural network algorithms due to their sparse spike-based operations. Toward this, we propose MTSpark, a novel methodology to enable multi-task RL using spiking networks. Specifically, MTSpark develops a Deep Spiking Q-Network (DSQN) with active dendrites and dueling structure by leveraging task-specific context signals. Specifically, each neuron computes task-dependent activations that dynamically modulate inputs, forming specialized sub-networks for each task. Moreover, this bioplausible network model also benefits from SNNs, enhancing energy efficiency and making the model suitable for hardware implementation. Experimental results show that, our MTSpark effectively learns multiple tasks with higher performance compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MTSpark successfully achieves high score in three Atari games (i.e., Pong: -5.4, Breakout: 0.6, and Enduro: 371.2), reaching human-level performance (i.e., Pong: -3, Breakout: 31, and Enduro: 368), where state-of-the-art struggle to achieve. In addition, our MTSpark also shows better accuracy in image classification tasks than the state-of-the-art. These results highlight the potential of our MTSpark methodology to develop generalist agents that can learn multiple tasks by leveraging both RL and SNN concepts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04747">Code generation and runtime techniques for enabling data-efficient deep learning training on GPUs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.04747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As deep learning models scale, their training cost has surged significantly. Due to both hardware advancements and limitations in current software stacks, the need for data efficiency has risen. Data efficiency refers to the effective hiding of data access latency and the avoidance of unnecessary data movements. Major challenges arise from the growing disparity between GPU memory bandwidth and computational throughput, imminent GPU memory capacity limitations, and inefficiencies in the PyTorch software stack, including a lack of device-specific PCIe transfer optimizations and high-level domain-specific abstractions. To effectively mitigate these data inefficiencies for deep learning training, this dissertation analyzes data inefficiency in representative deep training tasks, specifically in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). It then proposes novel runtime and code generation techniques to mitigate these challenges and implements these optimizations seamlessly within the PyTorch stack while maintaining strong programmability and interoperability. First, PyTorch-Direct is devised to incorporate the GPU-centric PCIe data transfer paradigm in PyTorch for GNN training. Next, Hector intermediate representation (IR) and its code generator are proposed to introduce domain-specific high-level abstraction and systematically address memory-intensive performance challenges for relational GNNs. Finally, in LLM training, the throughput has been increasingly constrained by GPU memory capacity. To mitigate this, the SSDTrain offloading framework is designed and implemented. Together, these contributions show that code generation and runtime techniques can systematically mitigate the data management bottlenecks in deep learning training, which stem from the data-intensive nature of workloads and the oversimplification inherent in the deep learning training software stack.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05126">Robust Computation with Intrinsic Heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic within-type neuronal heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature of biological systems, with well-documented computational advantages. Recent works in machine learning have incorporated such diversities by optimizing neuronal parameters alongside synaptic connections and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across common benchmarks. However, this performance gain comes at the cost of significantly higher computational costs, imposed by a larger parameter space. Furthermore, it is unclear how the neuronal parameters, constrained by the biophysics of their surroundings, are globally orchestrated to minimize top-down errors. To address these challenges, we postulate that neurons are intrinsically diverse, and investigate the computational capabilities of such heterogeneous neuronal parameters. Our results show that intrinsic heterogeneity, viewed as a fixed quenched disorder, often substantially improves performance across hundreds of temporal tasks. Notably, smaller but heterogeneous networks outperform larger homogeneous networks, despite consuming less data. We elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving this performance boost and illustrate its applicability to both rate and spiking dynamics. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that heterogeneous networks are highly resilient to severe alterations in their recurrent synaptic hyperparameters, and even recurrent connections removal does not compromise performance. The remarkable effectiveness of heterogeneous networks with small sizes and relaxed connectivity is particularly relevant for the neuromorphic community, which faces challenges due to device-to-device variability. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism of robust computation with heterogeneity also benefits neuroscientists and machine learners.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05225">BEExformer: A Fast Inferencing Transformer Architecture via Binarization with Multiple Early Exits</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.05225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements make deployment on devices with constrained resources extremely difficult. Among various efficiency considerations, model binarization and Early Exit (EE) are common effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss due to reduced precision affecting gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, the present early-exit mechanisms are still in the nascent stages of research. To ameliorate these issues, we propose Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning transformer architecture to combine early exit with binarization for textual inference. It improves the binarization process through a differentiable second-order approximation to the impulse function. This enables gradient computation concerning both the sign as well as the magnitude of the weights. In contrast to absolute threshold-based EE, the proposed EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. While binarization results in 18.44 times reduction in model size, early exit reduces the FLOPs during inference by 54.85% and even improves accuracy by 5.98% through resolving the "overthinking" problem inherent in deep networks. Moreover, the proposed BEExformer simplifies training by not requiring knowledge distillation from a full-precision LLM. Extensive evaluation on the GLUE dataset and comparison with the SOTA works showcase its pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.

                arXiv:2405.03728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot optimization involves optimizing a target task that was not seen during training, aiming to provide the optimal solution without or with minimal adjustments to the optimizer. It is crucial to ensure reliable and robust performance in various applications. Current optimizers often struggle with zero-shot optimization and require intricate hyperparameter tuning to adapt to new tasks. To address this, we propose a Pretrained Optimization Model (POM) that leverages knowledge gained from optimizing diverse tasks, offering efficient solutions to zero-shot optimization through direct application or fine-tuning with few-shot samples. Evaluation on the BBOB benchmark and two robot control tasks demonstrates that POM outperforms state-of-the-art black-box optimization methods, especially for high-dimensional tasks. Fine-tuning POM with a small number of samples and budget yields significant performance improvements. Moreover, POM demonstrates robust generalization across diverse task distributions, dimensions, population sizes, and optimization horizons. For code implementation, see https://github.com/ninja-wm/POM/.

                arXiv:2406.06075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) poses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, arising from terrestrial and celestial sources, disrupting observations conducted by radio telescopes. Addressing RFI involves intricate heuristic algorithms, manual examination, and, increasingly, machine learning methods. Given the dynamic and temporal nature of radio astronomy observations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising approach. In this study, we cast RFI detection as a supervised multi-variate time-series segmentation problem. Notably, our investigation explores the encoding of radio astronomy visibility data for SNN inference, considering six encoding schemes: rate, latency, delta-modulation, and three variations of the step-forward algorithm. We train a small twolayer fully connected SNN on simulated data derived from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope and perform extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Results reveal that latency encoding exhibits superior performance, achieving a per-pixel accuracy of 98.8% and an f1-score of 0.761. Remarkably, these metrics approach those of contemporary RFI detection algorithms, notwithstanding the simplicity and compactness of our proposed network architecture. This study underscores the potential of RFI detection as a benchmark problem for SNN researchers, emphasizing the efficacy of SNNs in addressing complex time-series segmentation tasks in radio astronomy.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated capabilities for solving diverse machine learning tasks with ultra-low power/energy consumption. To maximize the performance and efficiency of SNN inference, the Compute-in-Memory (CIM) hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) have been employed. However, SNN architectures are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying CIM hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems using a hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). NeuroNAS employs the following key steps: (1) optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, (2) employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, (3) developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and (4) devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art, NeuroNAS with 8bit weight precision quickly finds SNNs that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency speed-ups, 84% energy savings across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200 datasets; while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once. In this manner, NeuroNAS enables efficient design automation in developing energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems for diverse ML-based applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in retinal neuroscience have fueled various hardware and algorithmic efforts to develop retina-inspired solutions for computer vision tasks. In this work, we focus on a fundamental visual feature within the mammalian retina, Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS). Using DVS data from EV-IMO dataset, we analyze the performance of an algorithmic implementation of OMS circuitry for motion segmentation in presence of ego-motion. This holistic analysis considers the underlying constraints arising from the hardware circuit implementation. We present novel CMOS circuits that implement OMS functionality inside image sensors, while providing run-time re-configurability for key algorithmic parameters. In-sensor technologies for dynamical environment adaptation are crucial for ensuring high system performance. Finally, we verify the functionality and re-configurability of the proposed CMOS circuit designs through Cadence simulations in 180nm technology. In summary, the presented work lays foundation for hardware-algorithm re-engineering of known biological circuits to suit application needs.

Abstract: Event-cameras have emerged as a revolutionary technology with a high temporal resolution that far surpasses standard active pixel cameras. This technology draws biological inspiration from photoreceptors and the initial retinal synapse. This research showcases the potential of additional retinal functionalities to extract visual features. We provide a domain-agnostic and efficient algorithm for ego-motion compensation based on Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS), one of the multiple features computed within the mammalian retina. We develop a method based on experimental neuroscience that translates OMS' biological circuitry to a low-overhead algorithm to suppress camera motion bypassing the need for deep networks and learning. Our system processes event data from dynamic scenes to perform pixel-wise object motion segmentation using a real and synthetic dataset. This paper introduces a bio-inspired computer vision method that dramatically reduces the number of parameters by $\text{10}^\text{3}$ to $\text{10}^\text{6}$ orders of magnitude compared to previous approaches. Our work paves the way for robust, high-speed, and low-bandwidth decision-making for in-sensor computations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21265">Modular Duality in Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.21265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An old idea in optimization theory says that since the gradient is a dual vector it may not be subtracted from the weights without first being mapped to the primal space where the weights reside. We take this idea seriously in this paper and construct such a duality map for general neural networks. Our map, which we call modular dualization, forms a unifying theoretical basis for training algorithms that are a) fast and b) scalable. Modular dualization involves first assigning operator norms to layers based on the semantics of each layer, and then using these layerwise norms to recursively induce a duality map on the weight space of the full neural architecture. We conclude by deriving GPU-friendly algorithms for dualizing Embed, Linear and Conv2D layers -- the latter two methods are based on a rectangular Newton-Schulz iteration (Kovarik, 1970; Bj\"orck & Bowie, 1971). A variant of our methods was used to set speed records for training NanoGPT. Overall, we hope that our theory of modular duality will yield a next generation of fast and scalable optimizers for general neural architectures.

">The neuroreceptors and transporters underlying spontaneous brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the neuromodulators driving brain activity is critical for understanding communication, cognition, and neuropathology. Neuromodulators act through neuroreceptors and transporters and crucially, operate in a coordinated manner. However, in vivo methods in humans that can identify the neuromodulators driving brain activity remain limited. Here, we address this limitation using a neuroreceptor-based framework, enabling the identification of neuroreceptors and transporters underlying spontaneous brain activity. The framework utilizes cortical density maps of 19 neuroreceptors and transporters derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Across four datasets (Ntotal = 314), our framework reconstructs spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity (FC) from BOLD signals measured by functional MRI (fMRI), achieving an average accuracy of RBOLD = 0.58 +/- 0.05 and RFC = 0.62 +/- 0.02. Notably, our analysis reveals that the excitation-inhibition balance is maintained by two distinct modules of neuroreceptors and transporters exhibiting regional density differences across the cortex. The frameworks validity is supported by its ability to recover neuroreceptors and transporter's, 5-HT1a, 5-HT1b, 5-HT2a, and D2, known to bind lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and D2, 5-HT1a, 5-HT2a, and NET mediating the effects of Modafinil. Furthermore, the framework identified mechanistic links between neuroreceptors, transporters, and altered brain activity in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD. Finally, neuroreceptor-based reconstruction outperformed models based on structural connectivity and cortical folding geometry. Together, these findings underscore the potential of this neuroreceptor-based framework to advance our understanding of neuromodulatory mechanisms across diverse brain states and conditions.

">Using FoxP2 to Distinguish Direct and Indirect Basal Ganglia Pathways for Vocal Learning in Songbirds</a></h4>

              
                Vocal learning in songbirds provides a powerful experimental model for motor skill learning. The cortico-basal ganglia pathways that mediate vocal learning in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) are localized in two parallel circuits. These circuits traverse a cortical region (LMAN), a specialized region of the basal ganglia essential for vocal learning (Area X), and a region of dorsomedial thalamus (DLM). Area X, which contains both striatal and pallidal neurons, includes functional analogs of mammalian direct and indirect pathways that may have opposing effects and thereby increase or inhibit thalamic activity respectively. Direct pallidal neurons of Area X send inhibitory projections to DLM, whereas indirect pallidal neurons form intrinsic connections onto DLM-projecting neurons. We used tract-tracing techniques to label direct pallidal Area X[-&gt;]DLM projection neurons and immunohistochemical techniques to label neurons expressing the transcription factor FoxP2 in adult and juvenile male zebra finches. Our results showed that DLM-projecting neurons in Area X did not express FoxP2 in either adults or juveniles. We also observed a population of large neurons that expressed FoxP2 but were not retrogradely-labeled from DLM. A marker of striatal neurons (DARPP-32) did not co-localize with FoxP2 in most of these large neurons, providing evidence that they may form a class of putative indirect pallidal neurons. Our findings offer FoxP2 as a possible marker for indirect pallidal neurons and support the existence of different subpopulations of neurons that likely correspond to direct and indirect pathways within Area X.

">Parallel and converging multisensory cascades in the Drosophila connectome</a></h4>

              
                Connectomes are network maps of synaptic connectivity. A key functional role of any connectome is to constrain inter-neuronal signaling and to sculpt the flow of activity patterns across the nervous system. Connectomes therefore play a central role in the rapid tranmission of information about an organism's environment from sensory neurons to higher-order neurons for action planning and ultimately to effectors. Here, we use an abstract model of activity spread to investigate the connectome's role in shaping sensory cascades. Our model allows us to simulate the signaling pathways from sensors to the rest of brain, mapping the similarity of these pathways between different sensory modalities and identifying convergence zones--neurons that are activated simultaneously by different sensory modalities. Further, we considered two multisensory integration scenarios -- a cooperative case where different sensory modalities interacted to "speed up" (reduce) neurons' activation times and a competitive "winner take all" case, where different sensory streams vied for the same neural territory. Finally, we use a data-driven algorithm to partition neurons into different classes based on their behavior during the cascade simulations. Our work helps underscore the role of "simple" models for enriching connectome data, while offering a data-driven classification of neurons based on their joint connectional/dynamical properties.

                INTRODUCTION: The synergy of structured knowledge and large language models (LLMs) may contribute to identifying drugs for Alzheimer disease (AD) drug repurposing (DR). This paper developed a software pipeline that uses LLMs to translate knowledge stored in natural language (such as in scientific texts) to an applicable DR information structure. METHODS: AD-related entries in Gene Ontology and DrugBank were integrated into a Knowledge Graph database to inform LLM prompts. Based on the biological process impact, the LLM provided a suitability rating for DR, taking into account the inhibitory effect of drugs on AD driving processes.. RESULTS: Drugs with a high potential for DR were identified and manually reviewed, also considering adverse effects. Ripretinib and Pertuzumab (both kinase inhibitors) had the highest DR applicable rating across all iterations. DISCUSSION: We propose retrospective analyses, considering the high-rated drugs and their effect on AD patients as a starting point for further (prospective) research.

                Chimpanzee brain maturation provides an invaluable framework for understanding the evolution of the human brain. We performed ultra-high resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) with histological validation on post mortem brains from captive and wild chimpanzees with a broad age range. We mapped developmental myelination and age-related iron accumulation across regions and layers of the neocortex. Compared to humans, chimpanzees showed more myelination and iron deposition in motor and premotor cortices, while the auditory cortex was more strongly myelinated in humans. Our model suggests that chimpanzees' cortical myelination was largely completed by the age of nine years, while iron accumulation continued throughout the lifespan. The regions with highest adult levels of myelin and iron took the longest to mature, challenging the widespread assumption that highly myelinated regions complete their development first. The reported maps and developmental curves provide a foundation for comparative neuroscience research and understanding of human brain evolution.

">HCN1 channels in GABAergic amygdalar neurons underpin male-biased aggressive behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Aggression behaviors typically vary between sexes, but the molecular mechanisms driving these disparities in neural coding are unclear. We found that aggression selectively activates GABAergic neurons in the posterior substantia innominata (pSI), an extend amygdala region critical for aggressive behaviors in both sexes of mice, with males exhibiting higher neuronal activity during the attack. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we characterized the diverse molecular landscape of pSI neurons, revealing significant differences in ion channels and hormone regulator genes that may underpin sex-specific aggression. Male GABAergic pSI neurons exhibited remarkable hyperexcitability due to increased Ih currents. Strikingly, modulating HCN1 expression not only adjusted this hyperexcitability but also influenced sexual dimorphism in aggression: silencing HCN1 in the GABAergic pSI neurons reduced male aggression, while its overexpression markedly heightened aggression in females. Furthermore, testosterone was shown to intensify aggression by upregulating HCN1 and remodeling pSI circuits. These findings provide detailed sex-specific molecular mechanisms underlying social behaviors.

                Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons are classically linked to Pavlovian reward learning and reinforcement. Intermingled VTA GABA neurons are positioned to regulate dopaminergic and striatal systems, but we lack critical insight into how this population contributes to conditioned motivation in different learning contexts. Recording DA and GABA neurons across multiple conditioning paradigms, we found that GABA neurons not only actively encode appetitive and aversive cues and outcomes separately, but uniquely integrate salient events of both valences to guide reward seeking.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This systematic review of neuropsychological rehabilitation strategies for primary progressive aphasia will consider recent developments in cognitive neuroscience, especially neuroimaging techniques such as EEG and fMRI, to outline how these tools might be integrated into clinical practice to maximize treatment outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature from the last decade was performed following the PRISMA guidelines across multiple databases. A total of 63 studies were included, guided by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a focus on cognitive and language rehabilitation in PPA, interventions guided by neuroimaging, and mechanisms of neuroplasticity. Results: Integration of neuroimaging techniques contributes to the increase in the efficacy of interventions with critical information about the neural mechanisms underlying language deficits in the aphasias. Traditional rehabilitation strategies, technology-assisted interventions, and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques hold considerable promise for language improvement. Neuroimaging was also found to be necessary in subtype-specific differentiation toward tailoring therapeutic intervention. Evidence also shows that directed and sustained interventions using neuroplasticity can have long-term effects in managing the symptoms of PPA. Conclusions: The present review underlines the necessity of including cognitive neuroscience techniques within neuropsychological rehabilitation to enhance therapeutic outcomes in PPA. In addition, neuroimaging modalities such as EEG and fMRI are also of great importance in understanding the underlying neurobiology of language disturbances and guiding tailored interventions. Long-term benefits of these approaches should be evaluated, including their applicability in routine clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized, in addition to the well-recognized motor disturbances, by a complex interplay between cognitive and psychiatric manifestations. We dissect the complex landscape of PD-related psychiatric symptoms, taking into account the impact of functional neurological disorders, somatic delusions, impulse control disorders, and conditions within the bipolar spectrum. The newer entities of somatoform and functional neurological disorders, as well as preexisting bipolar spectrum disorders, are analyzed in detail. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a holistic understanding of PD, wherein the cognitive and psychiatric dimensions are valued alongside motor symptoms. Such an approach aims to facilitate early detection and personalized interventions, and enhance the overall quality of life for individuals suffering from this neurodegenerative disorder.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Serotonin (5-HT) has long been involved in response to stress and its effect may be, in part, mediated by 5-HT1a and 5-HT7 receptor subtypes in different brain structures. Both pre- and post-synaptic activation of 5-HT1a receptor, respectively, in the rat median raphe nucleus (MnRN) and hippocampus, lead to adaptation to acute inescapable stressors such as restraint and forced swim. 5-HT7 receptor (5HT7r), a stimulatory G-protein coupled receptor, has also been investigated as a possible candidate for mediating stress response. In the MnRN, activation of 5-HT7r has antidepressant effects, while in the hippocampus, 5HT7r mRNA expression is increased after exposure to restraint stress, but the functional significance of these receptors remains to be determined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether blockade of hippocampal 5HT7r would prevent and/or attenuate the behavioral effects of stress. Male adult Wistar rats with bilateral cannulas aimed at the dorsal hippocampus were restrained for 2 h and tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) 24 h later. SB 258741 (3 nmoles/0.5 μL/side; selective 5HT7r antagonist) was administered bilateraly into the hippocampus according to the experimental protocol: immediately before or after stress, or 24 h after it (immediately before the test). In a second experiment, rats were exposed to 15 min. of forced swim, and tested 24 h later. Intra-hippocampal treatment was performed as described for the restraint stress protocol. We found that blockade of hippocampal 5-HT7r immediately after, but not before, the exposure to restraint or forced swim attenuated stress-induced behavioral changes. Similar results were obtained when SB was administered before the test in previously stressed rats. Our data suggest that activation of hippocampal 5-HT7r is crucial for the consolidation and retrieval of aversive stimulus-related memories, such as those caused by a stressful experience, probably through mechanisms involving stress-induced changes in 5-HT7r expression.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>During the 1980s and 1990s, much memory research focused on the differential role of the hippocampus in various forms of memory. My work on the distinction between explicit and implicit memory led me to become involved in several early neuroimaging studies that made use of cognitive paradigms to investigate the conditions in which hippocampal activity does and does not occur, and to address the theoretical implications of these findings. Here, I summarize two such projects and some of the personal backstory associated with them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27149?af=R">Inhibition of Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling Prevents Tau Pathology in iPSC Derived Neurons and PS19 Mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Many neurodegenerative disorders share a common pathologic feature involving the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain (tauopathies). This suggests that there may be some shared pathophysiologic mechanism(s). The largest risk factor for the majority of these disorders is aging, suggesting involvement of the aging process in the shared pathophysiology. We test the hypothesis that an increase in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling that occurs during aging contributes to the onset and progression of tauopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were used to investigate the effects of BMP signaling on tau phosphorylation and release and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Wildtype mice were used to examine effects of BMP signaling <i>in vivo</i>. P301S (PS19) mice were examined for the effects of BMP signaling in a model of tauopathy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we show that BMP signaling, mediated by non-canonical p38 signaling, increases tau phosphorylation and release of p-tau in human iPSC-derived AD neurons. Further, there is an interaction between BMP signaling and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) that significantly increases tau phosphorylation and release compared with ApoE3 neurons. Inhibiting BMP signaling reduces the changes in tau in the cultured human neurons, and it limits tau pathology and prevents cognitive decline in PS19 mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests that the age-related increase in BMP signaling may participate in the onset and progression of tau pathology. Thus, therapeutic interventions that reduce BMP signaling in the aging brain could potentially slow or prevent development of diseases involving tau hyperphosphorylation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of perinatal brain injury. Creatine is a dietary supplement that can increase intracellular phosphocreatine to improve the provision of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to meet the increase in metabolic demand of oxygen deprivation. Here, we assessed prophylactic fetal creatine supplementation in reducing acute asphyxia-induced seizures, disordered electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cerebral inflammation and cell death histopathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fetal sheep (118 ± 1 days’ gestational age [dGA]; 0.8 gestation) were implanted with electrodes to continuously record EEG and nuchal electromyogram activity. At 121 dGA, fetuses were randomly assigned to sham control (i.v. saline infusion without umbilical cord occlusion [UCO]; SalCon), continuous i.v. creatine infusion (6 mg/kg/h; CrUCO) or isovolumetric saline (SalUCO) followed by UCO at 128 ± 2 dGA that lasted until the mean arterial blood pressure reached 19 mmHg. Brain tissue was collected for histopathology after 72 hours of recovery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation had no effects on basal systemic or neurological physiology. UCO duration did not differ between CrUCO and SalUCO. After reperfusion, CrUCO fetuses had improved EEG power and frequency recovery and reduced electrographic seizure incidence (SalUCO, 86% vs CrUCO, 29%) and burden. At 72 hours after UCO, cell death in the cerebral cortex and astrogliosis in the periventricular white matter were reduced in CrUCO fetuses compared with SalUCO.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation reduced post-asphyxial seizures and improved EEG recovery. Improvements in functional recovery with creatine were associated with regional reductions in cell death and astrogliosis. Prophylactic creatine treatment has the potential to mitigate functional indices of HIE in the late gestation fetal brain. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

">A neural circuit for context-dependent multimodal signaling in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Many animals, including humans, produce multimodal displays by combining acoustic with visual or vibratory signals. However, the neural circuits that coordinate the production of multiple signals in a context-dependent manner are unknown. Multimodal behaviors could be produced by parallel circuits that independently integrate the external cues that trigger each signal. We find that multimodal signals in Drosophila are driven by a single circuit that integrates external sensory cues with internal motivational state and circuit dynamics. Drosophila males produce air-borne song and substrate-borne vibration during courtship and previous studies have identified neurons that drive courtship and singing, but the contexts and circuits that drive vibrations and coordinate multimodal signaling were not known. We show that males produce song and vibration in distinct, largely non-overlapping contexts and that brain neurons that drive song also drive vibrations with cell-type specific dynamics and via separate pre-motor pathways. This circuit also coordinates multimodal signaling with ongoing behavior, namely locomotion, to drive vibrations only when the male's vibrations can reach the female. A shared circuit facilitates the control of signal dynamics by external cues and motivational state through shared mechanisms like recurrence and mutual inhibition. A proof-of-concept circuit model shows that these motifs are sufficient to explain the behavioral dynamics. Our work shows how simple motifs can be combined in a single neural circuit to select and coordinate multiple behaviors.

">A Reference Tissue Implementation of Simultaneous Multifactor Bayesian Analysis (SiMBA) of PET Time Activity Curve Data</a></h4>

              
                PET analysis is conventionally performed as a two-stage process of quantification followed by analysis. We recently introduced SiMBA (Simultaneous Multifactor Bayesian Analysis), a hierarchical model that performs quantification and analysis for all brain regions of all individuals at once, and in so doing improves both the accuracy of parameter estimation as well as inferential efficiency. However until now, SiMBA has only been implemented for the two-tissue compartment model. We have now extended this general approach to also allow a non-invasive reference tissue implementation that includes both the full reference tissue model and the simplified reference tissue model. In simulated data, SiMBA improves quantitative parameter estimation accuracy, reducing error by, on average, 57% for binding potential (BPND). In considerations of statistical power, our simulation studies indicate that the efficiency of SiMBA modeling approximately corresponds to improvements that would require doubling the sample size if using conventional methods, with no increase in the false positive rate. We applied the model to PET data measured with [11C]AZ10419369, which binds selectively to the serotonin 1B receptor, in datasets collected at three different PET centres (n=139, n=44 and n=39). We show that SiMBA yields replicable inferences by comparing associations between PET parameters and age in the different datasets. Moreover, we show that time activity curve data from different centres can be combined in a single SiMBA model using covariates to control between-centre parameter differences, in order to harmonise data between centres. In summary, we present a novel approach for noninvasive quantification and analysis of PET time activity curve data which improves quantification and inferences, enables effective between-centre data harmonisation, and also yields replicable outcomes. This method has the potential to significantly expand the range of research questions which can be meaningfully tested using conventional sample sizes with PET imaging.

">Spike sorting biases and information loss in a detailed cortical model</a></h4>

              
                Sorting electrical signals (spikes) from extracellular recordings of large groups of connected neurons is essential to understanding brain function. Despite transformative advances in dense extracellular recordings, the activity of most cortical neurons remains undetected. Small simulations with known neuron spike times offer critical ground truth data to improve spike sorting. Yet, current simulations underestimate neuronal heterogeneity and connectivity, which can potentially make spike sorting more challenging. We simulated recordings in a detailed large-scale cortical microcircuit model to link spike sorting accuracy to neuronal heterogeneity, evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art spike sorters and examine how spike sorting impacts the retrieval of information encoded in the cortical circuit. We found that modern spike sorters accurately isolated about 15% of neurons within 50 microns of the electrode shank, which contrasts with previous simulated yields but agrees with experiments. Neurons were unresolved because their spike trains were either missed (undersampling) or, when detected, incomplete or merged with other units' (assignment biases). Neuron isolation quality was influenced by both anatomical and physiological factors (selection bias), improving with increased neuron firing rate, spike spatial extent, for neurons in layer 5, and excitatory neurons. We exposed the network to various stimuli to dissociate the impact of these biases on its stimulus discrimination ability. Surprisingly, undersampling did not affect discrimination capacity, but selection and assignment biases nearly reduced it by half. These findings posit realistic models as a complementary method to evaluate and improve spike sorting and, hence, brain activity representations.

">Not enough pleasure? Influence of hallucination proneness on sensory feedback processing of positive self-voice</a></h4>

              
                Ample research explored changes in sensory feedback processing of the self-voice as well as the control of attention allocation in voice hearers, including both non-clinical voice hearers and voice hearers with a psychotic disorder. While the attentional bias toward negative emotional information in voice hearers with a psychotic disorder due to heightened sensitivity towards threat/danger is well established, it remains unclear how positive emotion captures or controls attention. Manipulating the certainty of sensory feedback to the self-voice, transitioning from fully neutral to entirely positive (100% neutral, 60-40% neutral-pleasure, 50-50% neutral-pleasure, 40-60% neutral-pleasure, 100% pleasure), provides an opportunity to investigate attentional control and sensory feedback processing in positive self-voice as a function of hallucination proneness (HP). Participants with different HP scores self-generated and passively listened to their own voices during EEG recordings. N100 or P200 responses to self-generated and externally-generated self-voices did not differ. Further, HP did not modulate N100/P200 responses. These null findings might result from the minimal perceptual discriminability among the five types of voices varying in pleasure content. This might have led to less variation in certainty regarding the sensory feedback to self-voice, and consequently a lack of differential engagement of attentional resources. The lack of a global N100 suppression effect prompts inquiry into the association of sense of ownership/agency and pleasure.

">Cortical dynamics underlying initiation of rapid steps with contrasting postural demands</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to flexibly initiate rapid visually-guided stepping movements can be measured in the form of express visuomotor responses (EVRs), which are short-latency (~100ms), goal-directed bursts of lower-limb muscle activity. Interestingly, we previously demonstrated that recruitment of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) interacted with the subcortically-generated EVRs in the lower limb, suggesting context-dependent top-down modulation. We investigated the associated cortical dynamics prior to and during rapid step initiation towards a salient visual target in twenty-one young, healthy individuals. We adopted two contrasting postural conditions by manipulating the stepping direction. Anterolateral steps involved low postural demands, whereas anteromedial stepping involved high postural demands. We recorded high-density EEG, surface electromyography from gluteus medius and ground-reaction forces. Independent component analysis and time-frequency statistics revealed significant, yet relatively modest differences between conditions in preparatory cortical dynamics, most evidently in primary motor areas. Following target presentation, we observed stronger theta and alpha power enhancement in the supplementary motor area, and stronger alpha and beta power decrease in primary motor, parietal and occipital clusters during APA recruitment that preceded steps under high postural demands. We found no differences in (pre)frontal areas associated with the observed EVR suppression in the high postural demand condition. Together, our findings point towards greater cortical involvement in step initiation under high postural demands as compared to more reflexive, stimulus-driven steps. This notion may be particularly relevant for populations where postural control is impaired by age or disease, as more cortical resources may need to be allocated during stepping.

">Mice-side bias: Deliberative decision making in a model of rule revision reveals 'myside' confirmation bias-like cognitive processes in mice.</a></h4>

              
                Confirmation or 'myside' bias--over-valuation of novel information which confirms previously internalized cognitive content (prior beliefs, rules of conduct, etc.) and corresponding under-valuation of disconfirming novel information--constitutes a serious obstacle to adaptive revision of our beliefs, especially in ambiguous or complex epistemic environments. Indeed, myside bias has become a particularly pernicious fact of societal cohesion, contributing to the propagation of fake news, to social polarization, and even to the replication crisis in experimental science. By contrast, relatively little is understood about either its neurocognitive underpinnings or its evolution, one reason for this being that the potential presence of myside bias-like tendencies in non-human animals has never been directly tested. Hence, in order to advance research in both of these directions, we designed a novel mouse model of everyday-like rule revision such that the dynamic model environment would be sufficient to call out myside bias-like behaviors providing that mice did indeed possess the particular kind of competing neurocognitive processes necessary for it to manifest. Here, we both validate that model and provide the first behavioral descriptions of myside confirmation bias-like deliberative profiles in a non-human animal. Notably, we observe that this bias does not manifest in a merely unreflective or heuristic/'system 1' manner but rather also emerges through and indeed increases deliberative behaviors, especially in contexts of low representational resolution. Several other parallels with findings from human studies of myside bias are also detailed in the discussion.

">Spermidine alleviates depression via control of the stress response</a></h4>

              
                Depression is a stress-associated disorder, and it represents a major global health issue. Its pathophysiology is complex and remains insufficiently understood, with current medications often showing limited efficacy and undesirable side effects. Here, we identify imbalanced polyamine levels and dysregulated autophagy as key components of the acute stress response in humans, and as hallmarks of chronic stress and depressive disorders. Moreover, conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy increases endogenous plasma concentrations of the polyamine spermidine exclusively in patients who respond to the treatment, suggesting a link between spermidine and successful outcomes. In a clinical trial, involving drug-naive depressed individuals, three weeks of spermidine supplementation increased autophagy and alleviated symptoms of depression. Behavioral and mechanistic findings of spermidine supplementation were validated in various mouse stress and depression models. In summary, spermidine supplementation mitigates polyamine dysregulation and stimulates autophagy under pathological stress conditions, offering a novel and well-tolerated treatment approach for stress-related depressive disorders.

                Olfactory dysfunction is a common outcome of brain injuries, negatively affecting quality of life. The mammalian nervous system has limited capacity for spontaneous olfactory recovery, making it challenging to study olfactory regeneration and recovery in adults. In contrast, zebrafish are an ideal model for such studies due to its extensive and lifelong regenerative abilities. In this work, we describe a model of excitotoxic injury in the olfactory bulb using quinolinic acid (QA) lesions in adult zebrafish. We observed extensive neurodegeneration in both the olfactory bulb and olfactory epithelium, including a reduction of bulbar volume, neuronal death, and impaired olfactory function. Recovery mechanisms involved tissue remodeling, cell proliferation, neurogenesis, leading to full restoration of olfactory function by 21 days. This study provides a model to further investigate the effects of excitotoxicity on olfactory dysfunction, and highlights the remarkable regenerative abilities of zebrafish, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for restoring olfactory function following brain injuries.

">Assessing Behavioral and Neural Correlates of Change Detection in Spatialized Acoustic Scenes</a></h4>

              
                The ability to detect changes in complex auditory scenes is crucial for human survival, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. This study investigates how the presence and location of sound sources impacts active auditory change detection as well as neural correlates of passive change detection. We employed stimuli designed to minimize semantic associations while preserving naturalistic temporal envelopes and broadband spectra, presented in a spatial loudspeaker array. Behavioral change detection experiments tasked participants with detecting new sources added to spatialized and non-spatialized multi-source auditory scenes. In a passive listening experiment, participants were given a visual decoy task while neural data were collected via electroencephalography (EEG) during exposure to unattended spatialized scenes and added sources. Our behavioral experiments (N = 21 and 21) demonstrated that spatializing sounds facilitated change detection compared to non-spatialized presentation, but that performance declined with increasing number of sound sources and higher hearing thresholds at high frequencies, exclusively in spatialized conditions. Slower reaction times were also observed when changes occurred from above or behind the listener, exacerbated by a higher number of sources. EEG experiments (N = 32 and 30), using the same stimuli, showed robust change-evoked responses. However, no significant differences were detected in our analysis as a function of spatial location of the appearing source.

">Exploring the Abeta Plaque Microenvironment in Alzheimer's Disease Mice by Multimodal Lipid-Protein-Histology Imaging on a Benchtop Mass Spectrometer</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposits in the brain are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Plaques consist of complex mixtures of peptides like Abeta1-42, characteristic lipids such as gangliosides, and they are targeted by reactive microglia and astrocytes. In pharmaceutical research and development it is therefore a formidable challenge to contextualize different biomolecular classes and cell types of the Abeta plaque microenvironment in a coherent experimental workflow on a single tissue section and on a benchtop imaging reader. Here, we developed such a workflow that combines lipid MALDI mass spectrometry imaging using a vacuum-stable matrix with histopathology stains and with MALDI HiPLEX-immunohistochemistry of plaques and multiple protein markers on a bench-top imaging mass spectrometer. The three data layers consisting of lipid, protein markers, and histology can be co-registered and evaluated together. Multimodal data analysis suggests extensive co-localization of Abeta plaques with the peptide precursor protein, with a defined subset of lipids and with reactive glia cells on a single brain section of APP/PS1 AD model mice. Plaque-associated lipids like ganglioside GM2 and phosphatidylinositol PI38:4 isoforms were readily identified using the tandem MS-capabilities of the mass spectrometer. Taken together, our data suggests that complex pathology involving multiple lipids, proteins and cell types can be interrogated by this spatial multiomics workflow on an easy-to-use benchtop mass spectrometer.

">Modulation of sensory input to the spinal cord by peripheral afferent fibres. Searching for relays</a></h4>

              
                A long-lasting GABA-dependent increase in the excitability of afferent fibres, and thus modulation of the sensory input to the spinal cord, may be evoked by epidural polarization. However, the direct effects of fibre polarization are short-lasting and the sustained increase in their excitability appears to be secondary to the release of GABA from nearby astrocytes. We have now investigated whether the modulation of spinal sensory input by stimulation of a peripheral nerve, previously attributed to synaptically evoked intraspinal field potentials, is evoked in a similar way. However, as neither its dependence on GABA nor its relays have been investigated, we addressed the question of whether the increase in the excitability of epidurally stimulated afferent fibres following a peripheral nerve stimulation does or does not depend on GABA and whether it might be mediated by astrocytes. The effects of conditioning stimulation of the tibial nerve were evaluated from changes in the excitability of both group I and group II muscle afferents, estimated from action potentials recorded in peripheral nerves and in field potentials recorded in the dorsal horn respectively in acute experiments on deeply anaesthetized rats. The excitability of the afferents was increased by stimulation of group II and/or cutaneous but not group I muscle afferents. The effects were significantly weakened by blocking GABA channels by gabazine, and by astrocyte toxin L-alpha-aminoadipic acid (L-AAA), indicating that the excitability of both group I and group II afferent fibres may be modulated by GABAergic astrocytes, the new role played by astrocytes.

">Comparing Intra- and Inter-individual Correlational Brain Connectivity from Functional and Structural Neuroimaging Data</a></h4>

              
                Inferring brain connectivity from inter-individual correlations has been applied to various neuroimaging modalities, such as glucose metabolic activity measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and brain structures assessed using MRI. The variability that drives these inter-individual correlations is generally attributed to individual differences, potentially influenced by factors like genetics, life experiences, and biological sex. However, it remains unclear whether long-term within-individual effects, such as aging, and state-like effects also contribute to the correlated structures, and how intra-individual correlations are compared to inter-individual correlations. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal data spanning a wide age range, examining regional brain volumes using structural MRI, and regional brain functions using both regional homogeneity (ReHo) of resting-state functional MRI and glucose metabolic activity measured with Fludeoxyglucose (18F) FDG-PET. In a first dataset from a single individual scanned over 15 years, we found that intra-individual correlations in both ReHo and regional volumes resembled resting-state functional connectivity. In a second dataset, involving multiple longitudinal points and participants for FDG-PET and MRI, we replicated these findings, showing that both intra- and inter-individual correlations were strongly associated with resting-state functional connectivity. Correlations in functional measures (i.e., ReHo or FDG-PET) showed greater similarity with resting-state connectivity than structural measures. Moreover, matrices from the same modality showed higher similarity between the two datasets, indicating modality specific contributions. These results suggest that multiple factors may contribute to both inter- and intra-individual correlational measures of connectivity. Understanding or controlling for these factors could enhance the interpretability of the inter-individual connectivity measures.

">The Impact of Instrumental Music on Dual-task Interference in a Simulated Driving Environment</a></h4>

              
                Numerous drivers engage in both listening to music and undertaking secondary tasks while driving. Secondary tasks have been shown to have a negative impact on driving performance. However, the effect of music on driving performance can vary, either improving or impairing it. Nevertheless, the influence of background music on dual-task interference remains uncertain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of instrumental background music on dual-task performance within a simulated driving environment. Twenty-four participants performed a color-discrimination task followed by a driving lane-change task. The results indicated that music enhanced accuracy in the lane-change task without a corresponding increase in reaction time (RT), both in single- and dual-task conditions. Additionally, when the time gap between the two tasks was 600 ms, RT for the lane-change task decreased with high music tempo. However, RT for the lane-change task did not exhibit any changes in response to music tempo when the onset time between the two tasks was short (100 ms), as well as in the single-task condition. Notably, participants' perceived workload did not significantly differ across the various task conditions. These findings emphasize the potential of background music to improve dual-task performance, particularly when considering the temporal gap between tasks.

">Peripheral immune cell response to stimulation stratifies Parkinson's disease progression from prodromal to clinical stages</a></h4>

              
                The motor stage of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) can be preceded for years by a prodromal stage characterized by non-motor symptoms like REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Here, we show that multiple stages of iPD, including the pre-motor prodromal stage, can be stratified according to the inflammatory and immunometabolic responses to stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ex vivo. We identified increased stimulation-dependent secretion of TNF, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 in monocytes from RBD patients and showed diminished proinflammatory cytokine secretion in monocytes and T cells in early and moderate stages of PD. Mechanistically, immune activation revealed deficits in CD8+ T-cell mitochondrial health in moderate PD, and relative mitochondrial health in CD8+ T cells was positively correlated with stimulation-dependent T-cell cytokine secretion across the PD spectrum. Dysregulated immunometabolism may drive peripheral inflammation and PD progression, and ex vivo stimulation-based assays have potential to reveal novel biomarkers for patient stratification and progression with immune endophenotypes.

">Lesions of anterior cingulate cortex disrupt an electrophysiological signature of reward processing in humans</a></h4>

              
                The reward positivity (RewP) is an event-related brain potential (ERP) component associated with feedback and reward processing. Although the component is said to be generated in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), this inference is disputed because of the inverse problem. Recently, by conducting a current source density analysis of intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded from a large cohort of epilepsy patients, we provided direct evidence that the RewP is produced by a circumscribed region in caudal ACC corresponding to Brodmann areas 24c and 32. In the present study we confirm that this brain area is the source of the RewP by examining the effects of damage to frontal cortex on RewP amplitude. We recorded scalp EEG from 68 stroke patients with damage to frontal cortex while they engaged in a trial-and-error guessing task used to elicit a canonical RewP. Application of non-parametric voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to the lesion data revealed that damage to Brodmann areas 24c and 3 attenuated RewP amplitude, whereas damage to other parts of frontal cortex did not affect it. These results provide causal evidence that the caudal ACC generates the RewP and underscore the contribution of this brain region toward motivating extended behaviors.

">The interplay between executive functions and updating predictive representations</a></h4>

              
                Modifying habits, particularly unwanted behaviors, is often challenging. Cognitive research has focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying habit formation and how habits can be rewired. A key mechanism is statistical learning, the continuous, implicit extraction of probabilistic patterns from the environment, which forms the basis of predictive processing. However, the interplay between executive functions (EF) and the rewiring - or updating - of these probabilistic representations remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment consisting of four sessions: 1) Learning Phase - acquisition of probabilistic representations, 2) Rewiring Phase - updating these probabilistic representations, 3) Retrieval Phase - accessing learned representations, and 4) EF assessment, targeting five key aspects: attentional control, inhibition, working memory, flexibility, and verbal fluency. We focused on the relationship between these EF measures and the updating of previously acquired knowledge using an interindividual differences approach. Our results revealed a positive relationship between rewiring and inhibition, suggesting that better inhibitory control may facilitate the adaptive restructuring of probabilistic predictive representations. Conversely, a negative relationship was identified between rewiring and semantic fluency, implying that certain underlying aspects of verbal fluency tasks, such as access to long-term memory representations, may hinder the updating process. We interpret this relationship through the lens of competitive memory network models. Our findings indicate that the rewiring of implicit probabilistic representations is a multifaceted cognitive process requiring both the suppression of proactive interference from prior knowledge through cognitive inhibition and a strong reliance on model-free functioning.

">Sense of control buffers against stress</a></h4>

              
                Stress is one of the most pervasive causes of mental ill-health across the lifespan. Subjective dimensions of stress perception, such as perceived control, are especially potent in shaping stress responses. While the impact of reduced or no control over stress is well understood, much less is known about whether heightened feelings of control buffer against the negative impact of later stress. We designed a novel paradigm with excellent psychometric properties to sensitively capture and induce different states of subjective control. Across two studies with a total of 768 neurotypical adults, we show a robust association between sense of control and stress as well as symptoms of mental ill-health. More importantly, in a subsample of 295 participants we show that compared to a neutral control group, inducing a heightened state of subjective control buffers against the impact of later stress. These findings demonstrate a causal role for a heightened sense of control in mitigating the negative impact of stressful experiences and spell out important directions for future preventative interventions.

">Collapse of Interictal Suppressive Networks Permits Seizure Spread</a></h4>

              
                How do networks in the brain limit seizure activity? In the Interictal Suppression Hypothesis (ISH), we recently postulated that high inward connectivity to seizure onset zones (SOZs) from non-involved zones (NIZs) is a sign of broader network suppression at rest. If broad networks appear to be responsible for interictal SOZ suppression, what changes during seizure initiation, spread, and termination? For patients with drug resistant epilepsy, intracranial monitoring offers a view into the electrographic networks which organize around and in response to the SOZ. In this manuscript, we investigate network dynamics in the peri-ictal periods to assess possible mechanisms of seizure suppression and the consequences of this suppression being overwhelmed. Peri-ictal network dynamics were derived from stereo electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings from 75 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We computed directed connectivity from 5-second windows in the periods between, immediately before, during, and after seizures. After aligning all network connectivity matrices between seizures and patients, we calculated net connectivity changes from the SOZ, propagative zone (PZ), and NIZ. Across all seizure types, we observed two distinct phases as seizures initiated and evolved: a large rapid increase in directed communication towards the SOZ from NIZ followed by a collapse in network connectivity. During this first phase, SOZs could be distinguished from all other regions (One-Way ANOVA, p=8.32x10-19 - 2.22x10-7, lower range to upper range of p-values). In the second phase and post-ictal period, SOZ inward connectivity decreased yet remained distinct (One-Way ANOVA, p= 2.58x10-10-1.66x10-2). Furthermore, NIZs appeared to drive the increase in inward SOZ connectivity while global connectivity between NIZs concordantly decreased. Stratifying by seizure subtype, we found that consciousness-impairing seizures show loss of inward connectivity from the NIZ earlier than conscious sparing seizures (one-way ANOVA, p<0.01 after false discovery correction). Tracking network reorganization against a surrogate for seizure involvement highlighted a possible antagonism between seizure propagation to the NIZ and the NIZ's ability to maintain high connectivity to the SOZ. Finally, we found that inclusion of peri-ictal connectivity improved SOZ classification accuracy from previous models to a combined area under the curve of 93%. Overall, NIZs appear to actively respond to seizure onset and increase inhibitory signaling towards the SOZ, possibly in an attempt to thwart seizure activity. This inhibition appears to be insufficient to prevent seizure onset, and furthermore, loss of normal communication in the rest of the brain between NIZs may contribute to loss of consciousness during larger seizures. Dynamic connectivity patterns uncovered in this work may: i) allow more accurate delineation of surgical targets in focal epilepsy, ii) reveal why inward suppression of SOZs interictally may nonetheless be insufficient to prevent all seizures, and iii) provide insight into mechanisms of loss of consciousness during certain seizures.

">Symbolic and Non-Symbolic numbers differently affect centre identification in a number-line bisection task</a></h4>

              
                Numerical and spatial representations are intertwined as in the Mental Number Line, where smaller numbers are on the left and larger numbers on the right. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated with various experimental approaches, such as the line bisection task. Spatial accuracy appears to be systematically distorted leftward for smaller digits by elaboration of spatial codes during number processing. Other studies have investigated perceptual and visuo-spatial attention bias using the digit line bisection task, suggesting that these effects may be related to a cognitive illusion in which the reference numbers project their values onto the straight line, creating an illusory lateral disparity. On the other hand, both dot arrays (non-symbolic stimuli) and arabic numbers (symbolic stimuli) demonstrate a privileged relation between spatial and numerical elaboration. The bias toward the larger numerosity flanker was attributed to a length illusion. There is, however, no consensus regarding whether physical features and symbolic and non-symbolic numerical representations exert the same influence over spatial ones. In the present study, we carried out a series of 4 Experiments to provide further evidence for a better understanding of the nature of this differential influence. All experiments presented the numbers in both symbolic and non-symbolic formats. In Experiment 1, the numbers "2-8" were presented in a variety of left-right orientations. In Experiment 2, the flankers were identical, "2-2" or "8-8", and symmetrically displaced with respect to the line. In Experiment 3, we employed asymmetrically distributed eight dots, or font sizes in "8-8" numerals, to create a perceptual imbalance. In Experiment 4, we replicated the manipulation used in Experiment 3, but with two dots and "2-2" numerals. The Non-Symbolic format induced stronger leftward biases, particularly when the larger numerosity (Experiment 1) or the denser stimuli near the line (Experiments 3 and 4) were on the left, while no bias emerged when flankers were numerically equivalent and symmetrical (Experiment 2). The left bias may result from a tendency to estimate the influence of stimulus perception associated with participant' scanning direction, similar to the direction of pseudoneglect. Conversely, the Symbolic format induced mostly right bias, possibly due to left-lateralized processing and a tendency to use a common strategy involving scanning from left to right. Altogether our data support the view that abstract numbers and non-symbolic magnitude affect perceptual and attentional biases, yet in distinctive ways.

	<p>In glioma surgery, maximizing the extent of resection while preserving cognitive functions requires an understanding of the unique architecture of the white matter (WM) pathways of the single patient and of their spatial relationship with the tumor. Tractography enables the reconstruction of WM pathways, and bundle segmentation allows the identification of critical connections for functional preservation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a streamline-based approach for bundle segmentation on a clinical dataset as compared to the traditional ROI-based approach. We performed bundle segmentation of the arcuate fasciculus, of its indirect anterior and posterior segments, and of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in the healthy hemisphere of 25 high-grade glioma patients using both ROI- and streamline-based approaches. ROI-based segmentation involved manually delineating ROIs on MR anatomical images in Trackvis (V0.6.2.1). Streamline-based segmentations were performed in Tractome, which integrates clustering algorithms with the visual inspection and manipulation of streamlines. Shape analysis was conducted on each bundle. A paired t-test was performed on the irregularity measurement to compare segmentations achieved with the two approaches. Qualitative differences were evaluated through visual inspection. Streamline-based segmentation consistently yielded significantly lower irregularity scores (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to ROI-based segmentation for all the examined bundles, indicating more compact and accurate bundle reconstructions. Qualitative assessment identified common biases in ROI-based segmentations, such as the inclusion of anatomically implausible streamlines or streamlines with undesired trajectories. Streamline-based bundle segmentation with Tractome provides reliable and more accurate reconstructions compared to the ROI-based approach. By directly manipulating streamlines rather than relying on voxel-based ROI delineations, Tractome allows us to discern and discard implausible or undesired streamlines and to identify the course of WM bundles even when the anatomy is distorted by the lesion. These features make Tractome a robust tool for bundle segmentation in clinical contexts.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The treatment of tics and psychiatric comorbidities is crucial when they affect the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s well-being and relationships. However, the optimal pharmacological treatment (PT) tailored to each patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s phenotype remains unclear. The primary objective of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment received for tics and psychiatric comorbidities in our cohort of children and adult patients with tic disorders. Additionally, a further aim was to quantify the severity of tics, comorbidities and overall severity, and the overall clinical changes observed during the follow-up. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of patients with tic disorders under follow-up at our Tic Functional Unit from January 2022 to March 2024. Two independent neurologists retrospectively applied the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) scales at baseline and at last assessment. Results: A total of 36 individuals were included (63.8% males, median age = 18 years, IQR 19): 94.4% with Tourette syndrome (TS), 2.8% with chronic tic disorder (CTD), and 2.8% with provisional tic disorder (PTD). A total of 86% had at least one psychiatric comorbidity, the most common being obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive symptomatology (OCS) (52%), anxiety (52%), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (35%). At last assessment, 26 patients (72.2%) were on undergoing PT for tics and 3 were receiving additional botulinum toxin. The most used medication for tics were aripiprazole (46.2%) and clonazepam (46.2%), and for psychiatric comorbidities, SSRIs (42.9%), methylphenidate (19%), and benzodiazepines (57.1%). Overall improvement according to the CGI-C scale was mild (CGI-C 3). Children and adolescents showed greater improvement than adults (CGI-C 2 vs. 3; p = 0.005). Aripiprazole and clonazepam produced similar outcomes in reducing CGI-C. Conclusions: We observed a favorable clinical course in patients treated with aripiprazole and clonazepam, which appear to be better than that obtained with other treatments. We consider that clonazepam may be useful as a first-line monotherapy and as an adjuvant for both tics and comorbidities in selected cases.</p>

	<p>To date, no psychotropic medication has been shown to effectively halt progression to psychosis among individuals at Clinical HighRisk of psychosis (CHR), fueling the search for novel therapeutic agents. Recent evidence supports Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) signaling as a potential psychosis biomarker, also indicating a therapeutic role for its supplementation in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Nonetheless, the effect of sustained PEA intake in CHR subjects has not explored so far. We will assess the feasibility of enrolling 20 CHR young adults presenting with attenuated psychotic symptoms (APSs) in a 12-week, open-label, investigator-initiated, proof-of-concept, single-arm trial of ultramicronized-PEA (um-PEA) at a dose of 600 mg/day. Once having completed the 12-week phase, participants will be asked to enter a 24-week extension phase of the study. We will examine um-PEA&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to reduce APSs and psychic distress, um-PEA&amp;amp;rsquo;s safety and tolerability, and the biological basis of um-PEA&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect in terms of modulation of inflammatory response, endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, and microbiome composition. Our trial aims to address an unmet clinical need in CHR subjects, providing an initial solid basis for the development of future studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of PEA supplementation in this group of patients.</p>

	<p>Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects approximately 250,000 to 500,000 individuals annually. Current therapeutic interventions predominantly focus on mitigating the impact of physical and neurological impairments, with limited functional recovery observed in many patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations have been investigated in this context of rehabilitation to identify effective markers for optimizing rehabilitation treatments. Methods: We performed an exploratory cross-sectional study assessing the baseline EEG resting state of 86 participants with SCI as part of the Deficit of Inhibitory as a Marker of Neuroplasticity in Rehabilitation Cohort Study (DEFINE). Results: Our multivariate models demonstrated a positive correlation between frontal delta asymmetry and depression symptoms, while the frontal alpha asymmetry band and anxiety symptoms were negatively correlated. Theta oscillations were negatively associated with motor-evoked potential (MEP), whereas alpha oscillations were positively associated with MEP in all regions of interest and with CPM response as a negative correlation. Based on the potential role of lower-frequency oscillations in exerting a salutogenic compensatory effect, detrimental clinical and neurophysiological markers, such as depression and lower ME, likely induce slow oscillatory rhythms. Alpha oscillations may indicate a more salutogenic state, often associated with various cognitive functions, such as attention and memory processing. Conclusions: These results show an attempt by the CNS to reorganize and restore function despite the disruption caused by SCI. Indeed, this finding also challenges the notion that low-frequency EEG rhythms are associated with cortical lesions. These results may contribute to the development of rehabilitation strategies and potentially improve the clinical outcomes of patients with SCI.</p>

                Background Lumbar radicular discomfort is often induced by mechanical compression of the nerve root and inflammatory reactions. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an efficacious therapy modality, albeit ongoing controversies regarding its effectiveness, and it possesses the advantage of minimal side effects. Therefore, we conducted the current systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of PRP in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Methods We conducted our database searching on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception till August 2024 to look for articles that fulfil our aim. The search strategy was based on three main keywords: “Platelet-rich plasma” AND “Lumbar” AND “Hernia*”. We conducted the pooled analysis of continuous variables using mean difference (MD) and we used pooled odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results The use of PRP was statistically significant associated with reduced visual analogue scale (VAS) compared with no PRP with MD of -0.44 (95%CI:-0.76, -0.11, p=0.008), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) with MD of -5.36 (95%CI: -8.25, -2.48, p=0.0003). However, no significant difference was observed regarding Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) with MD of 2.52 (95%CI:-0.8, 5.84, p=0.14) with non-significant heterogeneity. PRP was also associated with reduced risk of complications with OR of 0.22 (95%CI:0.07, 0.68, p=0.009) and non-significant heterogeneity. Conclusion PRP use in patients with LDH is associated with positive outcomes presented in reduction of pain, and disability (decrease in ODI scale) in addition to being safe with less incidence of complications compared with patients not receiving PRP.

                Background The use of mindfulness in the treatment of anxiety and depression is becoming more and more widespread, but there are few reports that it has fundamentally changed patients’ sense of life. Case Presentation This report showed 9 year’s progress of treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder and Persistent Depressive Disorder in a 41-year-old female patient experiencing a long-term painful married life with a reckless husband and controlling mother-in-law. During the past 25 months, she received 180 sessions of mindfulness training, resulting in complete remission of the anxiety and depression symptoms. After the 30th session she experienced an episode of the catharsis during the mindfulness training and experienced what can be called Mindfulness-To-Meaning, which is characterized by durable eudaimonic well-being in the face of adversity. Conclusions The psychological mechanisms that supported arriving at Mindfulness-To-Meaning are delineated as: Heightened (1) awareness which promoted (2) verbalization of the primary theme of suppression, in which the stress was (3) appraised metacognitively. Then (4) decentering permitted integrating this painful theme into a new adaptive self and world view, which resulted in (5) emotional catharsis, or release. Furthermore (6) positive appraisal of this experience enhanced awareness and led to the experience of (7) Mindfulness-To-Meaning.

                Background Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and lower probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were age 70-80 (OR 3.267, p = 0.029), age >80 (OR 27.043, p < 0.001) and GCS < 15 (OR 8.728, p < 0.001). Ps19 was the best predictor of mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions The significant mortality predictors were age, fall from <2 metres, injury of head or limbs, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies, CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and, ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps, are highlighted.

                The study focused on drug discovery for COVID-19, emphasizing the challenges posed by the pandemic and the importance of understanding the virus’s biology. The research utilized molecular docking and quantum similarity analyses to explore potential ligands for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Docking Results Docking outcomes for various ligands, including Oseltamivir, Prochloraz, Valacyclovir, Baricitinib, Molnupiravir, Penciclovir, Famciclovir, Lamivudine, and Nitazoxanide, were presented. Interactions between ligands and specific residues in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were analyzed. Reactivity Descriptors Global parameters, such as electronic chemical potential, chemical hardness, global softness, and global electrophilicity, were computed for the ligands. For the local reactivity descriptors, the Fukui Functions were used. Fukui functions, representing electrophilic and nucleophilic sites, were calculated for selected ligands (Valacyclovir and Penciclovir). Nucleophilic character assignments for specific molecular regions were discussed, providing insights into potential charge-donating interactions. Results and Discussion Challenges in COVID-19 drug discovery, such as virus mutability, rapid evolution, and resource limitations, were summarized. Progress in vaccine development and the need for ongoing research to address variants and breakthrough cases were emphasized. Overlap Operator Analysis Higher MQSM between Lamivudine and Molnupiravir (0.5742) indicates structural and electronic similarity. Lowest MQSM between Oseltamivir and Prochloraz (0.2233) implies structural dissimilarity. Coulomb Operator Analysis Higher MQSM between Lamivudine and Molnupiravir (0.9178) suggests both structural and electronic similarity. Lowest MQSM between Baricitinib and Famciclovir (0.6001) indicates greater structural diversity. Measurements above 0.5 in Table 3 suggest electronic similarity, emphasizing the electronic aspects in molecular analysis. In this sense, it study employed a multi-faceted approach combining molecular docking, quantum similarity analyses, and chemical reactivity assessments to explore potential drug candidates for COVID-19. The findings provide valuable insights into ligand interactions, reactivity patterns, and the challenges associated with drug discovery in the context of the global pandemic.

                Gender equality in decision-making positions is crucial to achieving the goals of good governance, peace, democracy, and inclusive/sustainable development. The major aim of this research article is to investigate the representation trend of women in higher decision-making positions over the last thirty years, since 1991. The federal three organs of government (law formulating, law enforcing, and law interpreting bodies) were the focus of this research. This research is a mixed type of research that inculcates both qualitative and quantitative data types. Secondary data sources from relevant government institutions were mostly used. The data was analyzed through content analysis of documents and presented via descriptive data presenting techniques. The research findings reveal that although women’s representation in positions of decision-making has advanced considerably in recent years, the empirical data throughout the previous thirty years demonstrated the underrepresentation of women in higher leadership positions within the Ethiopian federal government. Furthermore, Women never held certain higher-level government leadership positions, such as the Prime Minister position, which seems to be forbidden for women. Women made up 23%, 19%, 19%, and 24% of the House of Peoples Representatives (HPR), the House of Federation (HoF), ministerial posts, and judicial bodies, respectively over the last three decades. Women are visibly underrepresented in the executive positions as compared to others. Thus, substantial policy and practical initiatives are needed to remove institutional, social, and economic barriers to boost women’s advanced visibility in senior leadership roles.

                Introduction Rotator cuff (RC) tears are the most common and disabling musculoskeletal ailments among patients with shoulder pain. Although most individuals show improvement in function and pain following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR), a subgroup of patients continue to suffer from persistent shoulder pain following the surgical procedure. Identifying these factors is important in planning preoperative management to improve patient outcomes. Objective This scoping review aims to identify biological factors, psychological factors, and social determinants of health contributing to the development of persistent pain in individuals after the ARCR procedure. Inclusion criteria All prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies reporting the risk factors contributing to persistent pain three months or longer after the ARCR surgery will be considered for this scoping review. Methods Our review will adhere to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology. Four electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus will be searched for studies in the English language. Additional studies can be found by conducting a citation analysis of the included studies. Title and abstract screening will be performed by two independent reviewers following the inclusion criteria, a third reviewer will be consulted about any differences. Next, full-text screening will be conducted, and the remaining search results will be reviewed to extract data, as well as to synthesize findings from all research. An overview of findings will be depicted in tabular format accompanied by a narrative summary of various factors contributing to persistent pain.

                Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure throughout gestation and breastfeeding leads to multiple adverse outcomes in the hepatic system. Under oxidative stress, alterations in the liver are related to the inhibition of induced nitric oxide synthase activity in sinusoidal cells as a consequence of low expression of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-kinase interacting (GIT1). Here, we hypothesized that both glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and GIT1 could be altered by EtOH exposure during the third trimester of human equivalent development. Methods We exposed rats during the third trimester equivalent [postnatal days (PD) 2-8] to moderate levels of maternal EtOH (20%). GPx1 and GIT1 expression was detected by western blotting, and the antioxidant activity of glutathione peroxidase GPx and the concentration of hepatic carbonyl groups (CG were determined by spectrophotometry. Serum biochemistry parameters such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose (gluc), cholesterol (chol), and triglycerides (TG) were also measured. Results We found that ethanol decreased both GIT1 and GPx1 selenoprotein expression, affecting GPx antioxidant activity and increasing protein oxidation. Conclusions These results demonstrate for the first time that the GPx antioxidant system altered by EtOH exposure during the third trimester of development is related to a parallel decrease in GIT1 expression [1].

                Background Dermatophytes are the most common superficial fungal infections worldwide and are treated with prescribed regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, or with weekly doses of fluconazole. Dermatologists are increasingly encountering treatment failures, and experts suggest that standard treatment regimens are not applicable anymore. We planned an open-label study to evaluate the results of fluconazole 150 mg daily for 8 weeks in patients with tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Methods Patients were enrolled from the La’Mer Clinic, Mumbai, India. We included adult subjects with uncomplicated dermatophytosis confirmed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings. Pregnancy, poor renal function, and recent exposure to anti-fungal therapy were exclusion criteria. Patients were reviewed on days 14, 28 and 56. The treating doctor scored the severity of erythema, scaling, and pruritus on a four-point scale: absent, mild, moderate, and severe. Of 107 subjects screened, 100 were finally included in the study. Eleven were lost to follow up and one subject withdrew consent. Results The site of disease was body alone in 29, groin alone in 7, and both body and groin in 64 cases. At 5 weeks, 98%, 100%, and 97% of patients had no scaling, erythema, and pruritus, respectively. Skin scrapings showed 100% mycological cure. In one patient the alanine transaminase level rose from 54.9 to 100.2 U/L, and qualified as a grade 1 adverse event not requiring intervention. No other significant adverse events were noted. Conclusions Our results suggest that fluconazole 150 mg daily for eight weeks effectively treats dermatophytosis. This regimen is safe and well-tolerated even in patients with co-morbidities. Fluconazole is about eight times less expensive than itraconazole or terbinafine and may be the preferred therapy. Registration The trial was registered with Clinical Trials Registry, India (Registration number CTRI/2020/06/026110) on 24 June 2020. FDC Company, India, provided financial support for the study.

                Objective This study aimed to examine the mediating role of meal planning in the relationship between role modeling and snack choice. Methods and Measures The study was correlational and quantitative in nature. The study selected a sample of 403 university students. We collected data through interviews using a questionnaire. We analyzed the data using SPSS 23.0.0.0 (IBM Corp; 1989, 2015) (Build 1607) and AMOS 23.0.0 (IBM Corp; 1983, 2015) (Build 1607) software for correlational and Confirmatory factor tests. We used the bootstrapping technique to test for the mediation effect of meal planning. Results Meal planning had a full mediation effect between role modeling and snack choice. This means that Role modeling had a significant influence on meal planning, meal planning had a significant influence on snack choice, and role modeling had no significant influence on snack choice. Conclusion when young people admire other people’s eating habits it leads them to plan their meals and choose similar snacks to their role models. Future studies should consider studying the effect that role models’ proximity has on snack choices among young people in other contexts.

                Background This study investigates the incidence and predictive factors of Hyperventilation Syndrome (HVS) in patients after COVID 19 pneumonia, addressing the clinical overlap between these conditions. Methods A one-month prospective study was conducted, tracking survivors of COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were evaluated for ongoing clinical status, including HVS and post-traumatic syndrome disorder (PTSD), using clinical questionnaires, mMRC, Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Score, Nijmegen score, and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 questionnaire. Results Our study included 222 patients (median age: 57 years, male predominance 62.6%). Somatic comorbidities, primarily metabolic disorders, were reported in 71.2% of cases. The majority had severe or critical infection forms (78.4%), and 91.9% experienced acute symptoms, with 86.5% having three or more symptom clusters. At one month follow-up, dyspnea (52.9%) and asthenia (21.7%) persisted. Functional limitations (PCFS Grade > 2) were observed in 19.6% of patients. The overall incidence of HVS was 158 per 1000 patients, and PTSD was 445 per 1000 patients. Multivariate logistic regression identified cognitive impairment (acute phase), persistent weight loss (post-COVID-19 phase), PCFS grade > 2, and PTSD as independent factors for developing HVS, with relative risks (RRs) of 3.47 (95%CI [1.48-8.31]; p = 0.004), 11.87 (95%CI [1.25-112.88]; p = 0.031), 3.24 (95%CI [1.34-7.86]; p = 0.009), and 5.98 (95%CI [2.27-15.77]; p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion HVS is prevalent in the post-COVID-19 phase, affecting 15.6 % of survivors. Identified predictive factors suggest the convergence of psychosomatic pathophysiological mechanisms. Further research is crucial for a detailed understanding of these mechanisms in long COVID-19 patients.

                Background Pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, represents 10-15% of intracranial tumors. Although non-cancerous, its size and location can cause significant health issues, including hormonal imbalances and compression of nearby structures like the optic chiasm, leading to conditions such as Cushing’s disease, acromegaly, and visual disturbances. The prevalence ranges from 46 to 95 per 100,000 individuals. This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine versus placebo in patients undergoing transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines included 10 RCTs with 633 patients. English-language RCTs were sourced from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROB2 tool, and statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3. Results Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced heart rate after intubation (MD: -6.61 bpm, 95% CI: -8.98 to -4.24, p < 0.00001) and post-extubation (MD: -6.77 bpm, 95% CI: -8.59 to -4.96, p < 0.00001). Mean arterial pressure decreased after intubation (MD: -10.49 mmHg, 95% CI: -12.73 to -8.26, p < 0.00001) and post-extubation (MD: -12.97 mmHg, 95% CI: -14.37 to -11.57, p < 0.00001). Dexmedetomidine also reduced surgical duration (SMD: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.05, p = 0.01), blood loss (MD: -109.49 mL, 95% CI: -152.60 to -66.38, p < 0.00001), propofol dose (SMD: -1.04, 95% CI: -1.72 to -0.37, p = 0.002), extubation time (SMD: -0.70, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.47, p < 0.00001), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.80, p = 0.007). Conclusions Dexmedetomidine enhances perioperative outcomes in transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas, supporting its use as an effective anesthetic adjunct.

                <p>by Andrea L. Graham, Roland R. Regoes</p>

Immune responses are induced by parasite exposure and can in turn reduce parasite burden. Despite such apparently simple rules of engagement, key drivers of within-host dynamics, including dose-dependence of defense and infection duration, have proven difficult to predict. Here, we model how varied inoculating doses interact with multi-tiered host defenses at a site of inoculation, by confronting barrier, innate, and adaptive tiers with replicating and non-replicating parasites across multiple orders of magnitude of dose. We find that, in general, intermediate parasite doses generate infections of longest duration because they are sufficient in number to breach barrier defenses, but insufficient to strongly induce subsequent tiers of defense. These doses reveal “wormholes” in defense from which parasites might profit: Deviation from the hypothesis of independent action, which postulates that each parasite has an independent probability of establishing infection, may therefore be widespread. Interestingly, our model predicts local maxima of duration at two doses–one for each tier transition. While some empirical evidence is consistent with nonlinear dose-dependencies, testing the predicted dynamics will require finer-scale dose variation than experiments usually incorporate. Our results help explain varied infection establishment and duration among differentially-exposed hosts and elucidate evolutionary pressures that shape both virulence and defense.

Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that can identify and neutralise a wide variety of antigens with high specificity and affinity, and constitute the most successful class of biotherapeutics. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, billions of antibody sequences have been collected in recent years, though their application in the design of better therapeutics has been constrained by the sheer volume and complexity of the data. To address this challenge, we present IgBert and IgT5, the best performing antibody-specific language models developed to date which can consistently handle both paired and unpaired variable region sequences as input. These models are trained comprehensively using the more than two billion unpaired sequences and two million paired sequences of light and heavy chains present in the Observed Antibody Space dataset. We show that our models outperform existing antibody and protein language models on a diverse range of design and regression tasks relevant to antibody engineering. This advancement marks a significant leap forward in leveraging machine learning, large scale data sets and high-performance computing for enhancing antibody design for therapeutic development.

Modeling microbial interactions as sparse and reproducible networks is a major challenge in microbial ecology. Direct interactions between the microbial species of a biome can help to understand the mechanisms through which microbial communities influence the system. Most state-of-the art methods reconstruct networks from abundance data using Gaussian Graphical Models, for which several statistically grounded and computationnally efficient inference approaches are available. However, the multiplicity of existing methods, when applied to the same dataset, generates very different networks. In this article, we present OneNet, a consensus network inference method that combines seven methods based on stability selection. This resampling procedure is used to tune a regularization parameter by computing how often edges are selected in the networks. We modified the stability selection framework to use edge selection frequencies directly and combine them in the inferred network to ensure that only reproducible edges are included in the consensus. We demonstrated on synthetic data that our method generally led to slightly sparser networks while achieving much higher precision than any single method. We further applied the method to gut microbiome data from liver-cirrothic patients and demonstrated that the resulting network exhibited a microbial guild that was meaningful in terms of human health.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) disease, severity and age of onset vary greatly, hindering to objectively measure and predict clinical progression. Thickening of the retinal nerve fiber layer is distinctive of ARSACS patients, as assessed by optical coherence tomography, whereas conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging findings include both supratentorial and infratentorial changes. Because longitudinal imaging studies in ARSACS patients are not available to define these changes as biomarkers of disease progression, we aimed to address this issue in the ARSACS mouse model.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed longitudinal retinal OCT and brain MRI in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> ARSACS mouse model, alongside motor and coordination assessment in the beam walking test. We also investigated visual function and the molecular mechanisms underlying RNFL increased thickness by histology and immunofluorescence.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We demonstrated that RNFL thickening by OCT gradually increases in the early stages of pathology in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model, reflecting the progression of motor impairment, and later reaches a plateau when thinning of the posterior corpus callosum becomes detectable by MRI. Mechanistically, we unveiled that RNFL thickening is associated with aberrant accumulation of non-phosphorylated neurofilament H and glial fibrillary acidic protein. We also uncovered mild signs of myelin pathology coherent with increased latency of visual evoked potentials, and altered retinal activation by photopic electroretinography.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that both RNFL thickening and MRI changes may represent biomarkers of disease progression in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model. Our data gathers knowledge instrumental to clinical studies, holding potential as readout for treatment efficacy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is recognized for its potent antibacterial properties and is commonly used in dentistry to treat carious lesions. This review aims to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of SDF on dentine caries in permanent teeth. The objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature to assess the efficacy of SDF in combating cariogenic flora within dentin lesions. Materials and Methods A systematic electronic search was conducted using Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases to identify relevant studies published between January 2010 and September 2022. The search strategy focused on retrieving in vitro and in vivo studies assessing the antimicrobial effect of SDF on dentinal caries. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies that compared SDF with other antimicrobial agents, such as sodium fluoride varnish, potassium iodide, silver nitrate, chlorhexidine, plasma jet, and deionized water. The Cochrane Collaboration assessment tool was employed to evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. Results Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, consisting of seven in vitro and in situ studies investigating the antimicrobial effect of SDF on dentinal caries, and two in vitro and in vivo studies examining its antibacterial effect on root caries. These studies collectively demonstrated the promising antimicrobial potential of SDF against cariogenic flora present in dentin lesions. However, variations in study design, methodology, and outcome measures were observed across the included studies. Conclusion The review underscores the significant antimicrobial efficacy of SDF in combating cariogenic bacteria within dentin lesions of permanent teeth. Despite the promising findings, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the precise characteristics and mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial action of SDF, particularly concerning nano-silver. Future research, including long-term clinical trials, is warranted to elucidate optimal dosage regimens and therapeutic approaches for the routine application of SDF in managing dental caries.

                This correspondence discusses the recent findings by Straalen et al., highlighting molecular similarities and distinctions between palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) and dyshidrotic palmoplantar eczema (DPE). The study emphasizes shared proinflammatory pathways and T-cell–related gene upregulation while detailing unique features such as neutrophil involvement in PPP and lipid antigen processing in DPE. We elaborate on histopathological differences, especially intraepidermal vesicle formation in PPP linked to IL–1–mediated pathways and the absence of hyaluronan expression, contrasting with Th2 cytokines-driven spongiosis in DPE. By addressing IL-4, hyaluronan synthases, and keratinocyte adhesion molecules, this correspondence aims to deepen understanding of PPP and DPE pathophysiology.

                This study investigates the histidine kinase (HK) gene repertoire of Enterobacter hormaechei strain HCF3, isolated from fresh cow dung in Mogosane Village, Northwest Province, South Africa. Histidine kinases are critical components of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems, enabling bacteria to sense and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. Given the growing concern over antimicrobial resistance (AMR) associated with E. hormaechei, this research elucidates the genetic components that facilitate its environmental adaptability. After isolating the strain, genomic sequencing using Illumina technology, resulting in high-quality sequence data, was conducted. The assembled genome was meticulously annotated and deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under BioProject number PRJNA991313, with additional accession numbers for raw reads (JAUOLV000000000.1) and BioSample (SAMN36292742). Histidine kinase genes were identified based on conserved domains, particularly HisKA and HATPase. This led to compiling a comprehensive HK gene catalogue with locus tags, protein accession numbers, and functional annotations. To validate the HK gene set of E. hormaechei HCF3, we conducted a rigorous comparative analysis with other strains. This revealed that strain HCF1 contains 21 histidine kinase genes, HCF2 has 25, while HCF4 has 19. These findings underscore the diversity and conservation of HK genes across different Enterobacter species, providing a new perspective on their evolutionary significance. The assembled dataset provides valuable insights into the signalling pathways of E. hormaechei, highlighting the potential roles of HKs in environmental sensing, adaptation, and pathogenicity. Furthermore, this research lays the groundwork for future studies on the applications of these genes in agriculture and biotechnology, offering new avenues for understanding and managing E. hormaechei in various ecological contexts.

                Here, we present novel high quality genome assemblies for five invasive tephritid species of agricultural concern: Ceratitis capitata, C. quilicii, C. rosa, Zeugodacus cucurbitae and Bactrocera zonata (read depths between 65 and 78x). Three assemblies (C. capitata, C. quilicii and Z. cucurbitae) were scaffolded with chromosome conformation data and annotated using RNAseq reads. For some species this is the first reference genome available (B. zonata, C. quilicii and C. rosa), for others we have published improved annotated genomes (C. capitata and Z. cucurbitae). Together, the new references provide an important resource to advance research on genetic techniques for population control, develop rapid species identification methods, and explore eco-evolutionary studies.

                Objective This study aimed to evaluate hematologic, biochemical, and gasometric parameters in Wistar rats to better understand brain death parameters and reduce early misdiagnoses. Methods Fifteen adult male Wistar rats (Rattus norvergicus; HanUnib: WH) were randomly distributed into three groups of five animals: the control group (G0) with evaluation performed before brain death, and two groups (G1 and G2) with brain death induced at different times: immediately after induction (G1) and one hour after induction (G2). Venous and arterial blood samples were taken to perform complete blood count, biochemical, and blood gas assays. Samples were taken at specific times based on the group each rat belonged to. Results Statistically significant mean values were observed (P<0,05) for segmented cells (G1>G2 and G0>G2), monocytes (G2>G1 and G0>G1), creatinine (G2>G0), aspartate aminotransferase (G1>G0), potassium (G2>G0), and bicarbonate (G0>G1). Discussion Furthermore, brain death showed a unique response in each organism, complicating its precise determination even more.

They begin to assign distinct network functions to molecularly identified cell types, revealing that parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons are differentially recruited for separate network roles.

                Jacquet et al. shows that microglia use digestive exophagy to engage large Aβ deposits that cannot be phagocytosed, forming acidic extracellular compartments on the aggregates into which lysosomal enzymes are exocytosed. The PI3K-AKT pathway modulates this process. Microglia also exocytose intralysosomal undigested fibrillar Aβ toward extracellular aggregates, potentially contributing to plaque growth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96424">Lineage-specific intersection of endothelin and GDNF signaling in enteric nervous system development</a></h4>

              
                Two major ligand-receptor signaling axes – endothelin Edn3 and its receptor Ednrb, and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptor Ret – are required for migration of enteric nervous system (ENS) progenitors to the hindgut. Mutations in either component cause colonic aganglionosis, also called Hirschsprung disease. Here, we have used Wnt1Cre and Pax2Cre in mice to show that these driver lines label distinct ENS lineages during progenitor migration and in their terminal hindgut fates. Both Cre lines result in Hirschsprung disease when combined with conditional <i>Ednrb</i> or conditional <i>Ret</i> alleles. In vitro explant assays and analysis of lineage-labeled mutant embryos show that GDNF but not Edn3 is a migration cue for cells of both lineages. Instead, Edn3-Ednrb function is required in both for GDNF responsiveness albeit in different ways: by expanding the Ret<sup>+</sup> population in the Pax2Cre lineage, and by supporting Ret function in Wnt1Cre-derived cells. Our results demonstrate that two distinct lineages of progenitors give rise to the ENS, and that these divergently utilize endothelin signaling to support migration to the hindgut.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91642">A cryo-electron tomography study of ciliary rootlet organization</a></h4>

              
                Ciliary rootlets are striated bundles of filaments that connect the base of cilia to internal cellular structures. Rootlets are critical for the sensory and motile functions of cilia. However, the mechanisms underlying these functions remain unknown, in part due to a lack of structural information of rootlet organization. In this study, we obtain 3D reconstructions of membrane-associated and purified rootlets from mouse retina using cryo-electron tomography. We show that flexible protrusions on the rootlet surface, which emanate from the cross-striations, connect to intracellular membranes. In purified rootlets, the striations were classified into amorphous (A)-bands, associated with accumulations on the rootlet surface, and discrete (D)-bands corresponding to punctate lines of density that run through the rootlet. These striations connect a flexible network of longitudinal filaments. Subtomogram averaging suggests the filaments consist of two intertwined coiled coils. The rootlet’s filamentous architecture, with frequent membrane-connecting cross-striations, lends itself well for anchoring large membranes in the cell.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97507">Maternal obesity may disrupt offspring metabolism by inducing oocyte genome hyper-methylation via increased DNMTs</a></h4>

              
                Maternal obesity has deleterious effects on the process of establishing oocyte DNA methylation; yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that maternal obesity disrupted the genomic methylation of oocytes using a high-fat diet (HFD) induced mouse model, at least a part of which was transmitted to the F2 oocytes and livers via females. We further examined the metabolome of serum and found that the serum concentration of melatonin was reduced. Exogenous melatonin treatment significantly reduced the hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes, and the increased expression of DNMT3a and DNMT1 in HFD oocytes was also decreased. These suggest that melatonin may play a key role in the disrupted genomic methylation in the oocytes of obese mice. To address how melatonin regulates the expression of DNMTs, the function of melatonin was inhibited or activated upon oocytes. Results revealed that melatonin may regulate the expression of DNMTs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. These results suggest that maternal obesity induces genomic methylation alterations in oocytes, which can be partly transmitted to F2 in females, and that melatonin is involved in regulating the hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes by increasing the expression of DNMTs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89023">Modulation of RNA processing genes during sleep-dependent memory</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation in <i>Drosophila</i> can be sleep-dependent or sleep-independent, depending on the availability of food. The anterior posterior (ap) alpha′/beta′ (α′/β′) neurons of the mushroom body (MB) are required for sleep-dependent memory consolidation in flies fed after training. These neurons are also involved in the increase of sleep after training, suggesting a coupling of sleep and memory. To better understand the mechanisms underlying sleep and memory consolidation initiation, we analyzed the transcriptome of ap α′/β′ neurons 1 hr after appetitive memory conditioning. A small number of genes, enriched in RNA processing functions, were differentially expressed in flies fed after training relative to trained and starved flies or untrained flies. Knockdown of each of these differentially expressed genes in the ap α′/β′ neurons revealed notable sleep phenotypes for Polr1F and Regnase-1, both of which decrease in expression after conditioning. Knockdown of Polr1F, a regulator of ribosome RNA transcription, in adult flies promotes sleep and increases pre-ribosome RNA expression as well as overall translation, supporting a function for Polr1F downregulation in sleep-dependent memory. Conversely, while constitutive knockdown of Regnase-1, an mRNA decay protein localized to the ribosome, reduces sleep, adult specific knockdown suggests that effects of Regnase-1 on sleep are developmental in nature. We further tested the role of each gene in memory consolidation. Knockdown of Polr1F does not affect memory, which may be expected from its downregulation during memory consolidation. Regnase-1 knockdown in ap α′/β′ neurons impairs all memory, including short-term, implicating Regnase-1 in memory, but leaving open the question of why it is downregulated during sleep-dependent memory. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the expression of RNA processing genes is modulated during sleep-dependent memory and, in the case of Polr1F, this modulation likely contributes to increased sleep.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97255">Reversing protonation of weakly basic drugs greatly enhances intracellular diffusion and decreases lysosomal sequestration</a></h4>

              
                For drugs to be active they have to reach their targets. Within cells this requires crossing the cell membrane, and then free diffusion, distribution, and availability. Here, we explored the in-cell diffusion rates and distribution of a series of small molecular fluorescent drugs, in comparison to proteins, by microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). While all proteins diffused freely, we found a strong correlation between p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> and the intracellular diffusion and distribution of small molecule drugs. Weakly basic, small-molecule drugs displayed lower fractional recovery after photobleaching and 10- to-20-fold slower diffusion rates in cells than in aqueous solutions. As, more than half of pharmaceutical drugs are weakly basic, they, are protonated in the cell cytoplasm. Protonation, facilitates the formation of membrane impermeable ionic form of the weak base small molecules. This results in ion trapping, further reducing diffusion rates of weakly basic small molecule drugs under macromolecular crowding conditions where other nonspecific interactions become more relevant and dominant. Our imaging studies showed that acidic organelles, particularly the lysosome, captured these molecules. Surprisingly, blocking lysosomal import only slightly increased diffusion rates and fractional recovery. Conversely, blocking protonation by <i>N-</i>acetylated analogues, greatly enhanced their diffusion and fractional recovery after FRAP. Based on these results, <i>N</i>-acetylation of small molecule drugs may improve the intracellular availability and distribution of weakly basic, small molecule drugs within cells.

                The slow-intrinsic-pacemaker dopaminergic (DA) neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are implicated in various mood- and emotion-related disorders, such as anxiety, fear, stress and depression. Abnormal activity of projection-specific VTA DA neurons is the key factor in the development of these disorders. Here, we describe the crucial role of the NALCN and TRPC6, non-selective cation channels in mediating the subthreshold inward depolarizing current and driving the firing of action potentials of VTA DA neurons in physiological conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that down-regulation of TRPC6 protein expression in the VTA DA neurons likely contributes to the reduced activity of projection-specific VTA DA neurons in chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) depressive mice. In consistent with these, selective knockdown of TRPC6 channels in the VTA DA neurons conferred mice with depression-like behavior. This current study suggests down-regulation of TRPC6 expression/function is involved in reduced VTA DA neuron firing and chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior of mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96951">Increased inflammatory signature in myeloid cells of non-small cell lung cancer patients with high clonal hematopoiesis burden</a></h4>

              
                Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) allows estimation of clonal dynamics and documentation of somatic mutations in the hematopoietic system. Recent studies utilizing large cohorts of the general population and patients have revealed significant associations of CHIP burden with age and disease status, including in cancer and chronic diseases. An increasing number of cancer patients are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but the association of ICI response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with CHIP burden remains to be determined. We collected blood samples from 100 metastatic NSCLC patients before and after ICI for high-depth sequencing of the CHIP panel and 63 samples for blood single-cell RNA sequencing. Whole exome sequencing was performed in an independent replication cohort of 180 patients. The impact of CHIP status on the immunotherapy response was not significant. However, metastatic lung cancer patients showed higher CHIP prevalence (44/100 for patients vs. 5/42 for controls; p = 0.01). In addition, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients showed increased burden of larger clones compared to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients (8/43 for LUSC vs. 2/50 for LUAD; p = 0.04). Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the matched patients showed significant enrichment of inflammatory pathways mediated by NF-κB in myeloid clusters of the severe CHIP group. Our findings suggest minimal involvement of CHIP mutation and clonal dynamics during immunotherapy but a possible role of CHIP as an indicator of immunologic response in NSCLC patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92519">Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal the differentiation trajectories of periosteal skeletal/stem progenitor cells in bone regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Bone regeneration is mediated by skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) that are mainly recruited from the periosteum after bone injury. The composition of the periosteum and the steps of SSPC activation and differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we generated a single-nucleus atlas of the periosteum at steady state and of the fracture site during the early stages of bone repair (<a href="https://fracture-repair-atlas.cells.ucsc.edu">https://fracture-repair-atlas.cells.ucsc.edu</a>). We identified periosteal SSPCs expressing stemness markers (<i>Pi16</i> and <i>Ly6a</i>/SCA1) and responding to fracture by adopting an injury-induced fibrogenic cell (IIFC) fate, prior to undergoing osteogenesis or chondrogenesis. We identified distinct gene cores associated with IIFCs and their engagement into osteogenesis and chondrogenesis involving Notch, Wnt, and the circadian clock signaling, respectively. Finally, we show that IIFCs are the main source of paracrine signals in the fracture environment, suggesting a crucial paracrine role of this transient IIFC population during fracture healing. Overall, our study provides a complete temporal topography of the early stages of fracture healing and the dynamic response of periosteal SSPCs to injury, redefining our knowledge of bone regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98450">Identification of suitable target/E3 ligase pairs for PROTAC development using a rapamycin-induced proximity assay (RiPA)</a></h4>

              
                The development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which induce the degradation of target proteins by bringing them into proximity with cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases, has revolutionized drug development. While the human genome encodes more than 600 different E3 ligases, current PROTACs use only a handful of them, drastically limiting their full potential. Furthermore, many PROTAC development campaigns fail because the selected E3 ligase candidates are unable to induce degradation of the particular target of interest. As more and more ligands for novel E3 ligases are discovered, the chemical effort to identify the best E3 ligase for a given target is exploding. Therefore, a genetic system to identify degradation-causing E3 ligases and suitable target/E3 ligase pairs is urgently needed. Here, we used the well-established dimerization of the FKBP12 protein and FRB domain by rapamycin to bring the target protein WDR5 into proximity with candidate E3 ligases. Strikingly, this rapamycin-induced proximity assay (RiPA) revealed that VHL, but not Cereblon, is able to induce WDR5 degradation - a finding previously made by PROTACs, demonstrating its predictive power. By optimizing the steric arrangement of all components and fusing the target protein with a minimal luciferase, RiPA can identify the ideal E3 for any target protein of interest in living cells, significantly reducing and focusing the chemical effort in the early stages of PROTAC development.

">The brain selectively allocates energy to functional brain networks under cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Network energy has been conceptualized based on structural balance theory in the physics of complex networks. We utilized this framework to assess the energy of functional brain networks under cognitive control and to understand how energy is allocated across canonical functional networks during various cognitive control tasks. We extracted network energy from functional connectivity patterns of subjects who underwent fMRI scans during cognitive tasks involving working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, in addition to task-free scans. We found that the energy of the whole-brain network increases when exposed to cognitive control tasks compared to the task-free resting state, which serves as a reference point. The brain selectively allocates this elevated energy to canonical functional networks; sensory networks receive more energy to support flexibility for processing sensory stimuli, while cognitive networks relevant to the task, functioning efficiently, require less energy. Furthermore, employing network energy, as a global network measure, improves the performance of predictive modeling, particularly in classifying cognitive control tasks and predicting chronological age. Our results highlight the robustness of this framework and the utility of network energy in understanding brain and cognitive mechanisms, including its promising potential as a biomarker for mental conditions and neurological disorders.

">Seeing speech: neural mechanisms of cued speech perception in prelingually deaf and hearing users</a></h4>

              
                For many deaf people, lip-reading plays a major role in verbal communication. However, lip movements are by nature ambiguous, so that lip reading does not allow for a full understanding of speech. The resulting language access difficulties may have serious consequences on language, cognitive and social development. Cued speech (CS) was developed to eliminate this ambiguity by complementing lip-reading with hand gestures, giving access to the entire phonological content of speech through the visual modality alone. Despite its proven efficiency for improving linguistic and communicative abilities, the mechanisms of CS perception remain largely unknown. The goal of the present study is to delineate the brain regions involved in cued speech perception and identify their role in visual and language-related processes. Three matched groups of participants were scanned during two fMRI experiments: Prelingually deaf users of cued speech, hearing users of cued speech, and naive hearing controls. In Experiment 1, we presented videos of silent CS sentences, isolated lip movements, isolated gestures, plus CS sentences with speech sounds and meaningless CS sentences. In Experiment 2, we presented pictures of faces, bodies, written words, tools, and houses in order to understand the contribution of category-specific visual regions to CS perception. We delineated a number of mostly left-hemisphere brain regions involved in CS perception. We first found that language areas were activated in all groups by both silent CS sentences and isolated lip movements, and by gestures in deaf participants only. Despite overlapping activations when perceiving CS, several findings differentiated experts from novices. As such, CS expertise was associated with a leftward functional lateralization of the lateral occipital cortex, possibly driven by the expert identification of hand gestures. The Visual Word Form Area, which supports the interface between vision and language during reading, did not contribute to CS perception. Moreover, the integration of lip movements and gestures took place in a temporal language-related region in deaf users, and in movement-related regions in hearing users, reflecting their different profile of expertise in CS comprehension and production. Finally, we observed a strong involvement of the Dorsal Attentional Network in hearing users of CS, and identified the neural correlates of the variability in individual proficiency. Cued speech constitutes a novel pathway for accessing core language processes, halfway between speech perception and reading. The current study provides a delineation of the common and specific brain structures supporting those different modalities of language input, paving the way for further research.

">Heterogeneous, temporally consistent, and plastic brain development after preterm birth</a></h4>

              
                The current view of neurodevelopment after preterm birth presents a strong paradox: diverse neurocognitive outcomes suggest heterogeneous neurodevelopment, yet numerous brain imaging studies focusing on average dysmaturation imply largely uniform aberrations across individuals. Here we show both, spatially heterogeneous individual brain abnormality patterns (IBAPs) but with consistent underlying biological mechanisms of injury and plasticity. Using cross-sectional structural magnetic resonance imaging data from preterm neonates and longitudinal data from preterm children and adults in a normative reference framework, we demonstrate that brain development after preterm birth is highly heterogeneous in both severity and patterns of deviations. Individual brain abnormalities were also consistent for their extent and location along the life course, associated with glial cell underpinnings, and plastic for influences of the early social environment. Thus, IBAPs of preterm birth are spatially heterogenous, temporally consistent for extent, spatial location, and cellular underpinnings, and plastic for social-environmental impacts. Our findings extend conventional views of preterm neurodevelopment, revealing a nuanced landscape of individual variation, with consistent commonalities between subjects. This integrated perspective of preterm neurodevelopment implies more targeted theranostic intervention strategies, specifically integrating brain charts and imaging at birth, as well as social interventions during early development.

">Adult visual deprivation engages associative, presynaptic plasticity of thalamic input to cortex</a></h4>

              
                Associative plasticity at thalamocortical synapses is thought to be constrained by age in the mammalian cortex. However, here we show for the first time that prolonged visual deprivation induces robust and reversible plasticity at synapses between first order visual thalamus and cortical layer 4 pyramidal neurons. The plasticity is associative and expressed by changes in presynaptic function, thereby amplifying and relaying the change in efferent drive to the visual cortex.

	<p>Background: Congenital craniovertebral junction anomalies (CCVJAs) encompass a diverse range of conditions characterized by distorted anatomy and significant variation in the pathways of neurovascular structures. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of tailoring posterior fixation for CCVJAs through intraoperative CT-based navigation. Methods: An in-depth retrospective analysis was conducted on eight patients diagnosed with CCVJAs (excluding Arnold&amp;amp;ndash;Chiari malformation). These patients underwent posterior fixation/arthrodesis facilitated by intraoperative CT-based navigation. The analysis included an examination of the fixation strategies, complication rates, length of stay, post-operative complications, and success of arthrodesis. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to contextualize and compare our findings. Results: Patients undergoing CVJ posterior fixation with intraoperative CT-based navigation exhibited a flawless record, devoid of complications related to the damage to neurovascular structures, as well as any instances of screw misposition, pullout, or breakage (0 out of 36 total screws). Furthermore, the entire cohort demonstrated a 100% arthrodesis rate. None of the patients required treatment with an occipital plate. Conclusions: The incorporation of intraoperative CT-based navigation proves to be an invaluable asset in executing CVJ posterior fixation within the context of CCVJAs. This technology facilitates the customization of posterior constructs, a crucial adaptation required to navigate the anatomical challenges posed by these anomalies. The secure placement of screws into the occipital condyles, made possible by navigation, has proven highly effective in achieving CVJ fixation, obviating the need for an occipital plate. This technological leap represents a significant advancement, enhancing the safety, precision, and overall outcomes for patients undergoing this surgical procedure, while concurrently reducing the necessity for more invasive and morbid interventions.</p>

                <p>Goal-directed actions require transforming sensory information into motor plans defined across multiple parameters and reference frames. Substantial evidence supports the encoding of target direction in gaze- and body-centered coordinates within parietal and premotor regions. However, how the brain encodes the equally critical parameter of target distance remains less understood. Here, using Bayesian pattern component modeling of fMRI data during a delayed reach-to-target task, we dissociated the neural encoding of both target direction and the relative distances between target, gaze, and hand at early and late stages of motor planning. This approach revealed independent representations of direction and distance along the human dorsomedial reach pathway. During early planning, most premotor and superior parietal areas encoded a target&rsquo;s distance in single or multiple reference frames and encoded its direction. In contrast, distance encoding was magnified in gaze- and body-centric reference frames during late planning. These results emphasize a flexible and efficient human central nervous system that achieves goals by remapping sensory information related to multiple parameters, such as distance and direction, in the same brain areas.</p>

                Background Surgical procedures on the cervical spine are frequently performed to treat spinal diseases such as degenerative disc degeneration, trauma, tumors, and infections. However, postoperative complications are a cause for concern, and the surgical procedure with the lowest complication risk still unknown. Methods A comprehensive literature search was carried out in different databases from the beginning of the study to January 2024. Observational studies that reported the incidence of postoperative complications following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF), laminoplasty, laminectomy with fusion, and corpectomy were included in the review. Outcomes like reoperation rates, infections, and nerve injuries were analyzed using random-effects models, with ORs (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results 13 studies with 22,874 patients were included. ACDF was associated with higher complication rates versus PCF (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.60) and laminoplasty (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.84 to 4.41). Laminectomy with fusion showed greater pseudarthrosis (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.90) and reoperation rates (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.43) than ACDF. No differences were detected between other procedures. Conclusion Complications risk significantly differs based on surgical strategy and technique, with ACDF potentially having higher rates compared to less invasive methods.

                Fibroblasts, non-hematopoietic cells of mesenchymal origin, are tissue architects which regulate the topography of tissues, dictate tissue resident cell types, and drive fibrotic disease. Fibroblasts regulate the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a 3-dimensional network of macromolecules that comprise the acellular milieu of tissues. Fibroblasts can directly and indirectly regulate immune responses by secreting ECM and ECM-bound molecules to shape tissue structure and influence organ function. In this review, we will highlight recent studies which elucidate the mechanisms by which fibroblast-derived ECM factors (e.g., collagens, fibrillar proteins) regulate ECM architecture and subsequent immune responses, with a focus on macrophages. As examples of fibroblast-derived ECM proteins, we examine Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing 1 (CTHRC1) and Transforming Growth Factor-β-inducible protein (TGFBI), also known as BIGH3. We address the need for investigation into how diverse fibroblast populations coordinate immune responses by modulating ECM, including the fibroblast-ECM-immune axis and the precise molecular mediators and pathways which regulate these processes. Finally, we will outline how novel research identifying key regulators of ECM deposition is critical for therapeutic development for fibrotic diseases and cancer.

                <p>by Michael Forrester, Sammy Petros, Oliver Cattell, Yi Ming Lai, Reuben D. O’Dea, Stamatios Sotiropoulos, Stephen Coombes</p>

The ready availability of brain connectome data has both inspired and facilitated the modelling of whole brain activity using networks of phenomenological neural mass models that can incorporate both interaction strength and tract length between brain regions. Recently, a new class of neural mass model has been developed from an exact mean field reduction of a network of spiking cortical cell models with a biophysically realistic model of the chemical synapse. Moreover, this new population dynamics model can naturally incorporate electrical synapses. Here we demonstrate the ability of this new modelling framework, when combined with data from the Human Connectome Project, to generate patterns of functional connectivity (FC) of the type observed in both magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging. Some limited explanatory power is obtained via an eigenmode description of frequency-specific FC patterns, obtained via a linear stability analysis of the network steady state in the neigbourhood of a Hopf bifurcation. However, direct numerical simulations show that empirical data is more faithfully recapitulated in the nonlinear regime, and exposes a key role of gap junction coupling strength in generating empirically-observed neural activity, and associated FC patterns and their evolution. Thereby, we emphasise the importance of maintaining known links with biological reality when developing multi-scale models of brain dynamics. As a tool for the study of dynamic whole brain models of the type presented here we further provide a suite of C++ codes for the efficient, and user friendly, simulation of neural mass networks with multiple delayed interactions.

                <p>by Gene J. Yu, Federico Ranieri, Vincenzo Di Lazzaro, Marc A. Sommer, Angel V. Peterchev, Warren M. Grill</p>

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS, and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics. The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves. Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). For these activations, the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Finally, there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave. The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation.

                <p>by Hind Zaaraoui, Clarisse Schumer, Xavier Duval, Bruno Hoen, Lulla Opatowski, Jérémie Guedj</p>

Households are a major driver of transmission of acute respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza. Until now antiviral treatments have mostly been used as a curative treatment in symptomatic individuals. During an outbreak, more aggressive strategies involving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP or PEP) could be employed to further reduce the risk of severe disease but also prevent transmission to household contacts. In order to understand the effectiveness of such strategies and the factors that may modulate them, we developed a multi-scale model that follows the infection at both the individual-level (viral dynamics) and the population-level (transmission dynamics) in households. Using a simulation study we explored different antiviral treatment strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on reducing the transmission risk and the virological burden in households for a range of virus characteristics (e.g., secondary attack rate—SAR, or time to peak viral load). We found that when the index case can be identified and treated before symptom onset, both transmission and virological burden are reduced by > 75% for most SAR values and time to peak viral load, with minimal benefit to treat additionally household contacts. While treatment initiated after index symptom onset does not reduce the risk of transmission, it can still reduce the virological burden in the household, a proxy for severe disease and subsequent transmission risk outside the household. In that case optimal strategies involve treatment of both index case and household contacts as PEP, with efficacy > 50% when peak viral load occurs after symptom onset, and 30-50% otherwise. In all the considered cases, antiviral treatment strategies were optimal for SAR ranging 20-60%, and for larger household sizes. This study highlights the opportunity of antiviral drug-based interventions in households during an outbreak to minimize viral transmission and disease burden.

                <p>by Nan Zhang, Linan Zhuang, Marco-Felipe King, Hua Qian, Min Zhu</p>

Norovirus, primarily transmitted via fomite route, poses a significant threat to global public health and the economy. Airports, as critical transportation hubs connecting people from around the world, has high potential risk of norovirus transmission due to large number of public surfaces. A total of 21.3 hours of video episodes were recorded across nine functional areas at the airport, capturing 25,925 touches. A surface transmission model based on a Markov chain was developed. Using the beta-Poisson dose-response model, the infection risk of norovirus and the effectiveness of various interventions in different airports’ areas were quantified. Without any preventive measures, restaurants at airports exhibited the highest risk of norovirus transmission, with an infection probability of 8.8×10<sup>−3</sup>% (95% CI, 1.5×10<sup>−3</sup>% -2.1×10<sup>−2</sup>%). This means approximately 4.6 (95% CI, 0.8–10.9) out of 51,494 passengers who entered the restaurants would be infected by an infected passenger. Comparing with no surface disinfection, disinfecting public surfaces every 2 hours can reduce the risk of norovirus infection per visit to the airport by 83.2%. In contrast, comparing with no hand washing, handwashing every 2 hours can reduce the infection risk per visit to the airport by only 2.0%, making public surface disinfection significantly more effective than handwashing. If the mask-wearing rate increases from 0% to 50%, the infection risk of norovirus would be decreased by 48.0% (95% CI, 43.5–52.3%). Furthermore, using antimicrobial copper/copper-nickel alloy coatings for most public surfaces could reduce the infection risk by 15.9%-99.2%.

To keep ahead of the evolution of resistance to insecticides in mosquitoes, national malaria control programmes must make use of a range of insecticides, both old and new, while monitoring resistance mechanisms. The outdoor-biting malaria vector <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> is of increasing concern for malaria transmission because it is apparently less susceptible to many indoor control interventions, yet knowledge of its mechanisms of resistance remains limited. Furthermore, comparatively little is known in general about resistance to non-pyrethroid insecticides such as pirimiphos-methyl (PM), which are crucial for effective control in the context of globally high resistance to pyrethroids. We performed a genome-wide association study to determine the molecular mechanisms of resistance to the pyrethroid deltamethrin (commonly used in bednets) and PM (widespread use for indoor spraying), in <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> from 2 regions in Tanzania. Genomic regions of positive selection in these populations were largely driven by copy number variants (CNVs) in gene families involved in metabolic resistance. We found evidence of a new gene cluster involved in resistance to PM, identifying a strong selective sweep tied to a CNV in the carboxylesterase genes <i>Coeae2g - Coeae6g</i>. Using complementary data from another malaria vector, <i>An</i>. <i>coluzzii</i>, in Ghana, we show that copy number at this locus is significantly associated with PM resistance. Similarly, for deltamethrin, resistance was strongly associated with a novel CNV allele in the <i>Cyp6aa</i> / <i>Cyp6p</i> cluster (<i>Cyp6aap</i>_Dup33). Against this background of metabolic resistance, resistance caused by mutations in the insecticide target sites was very rare or absent. Mutations in the pyrethroid target site <i>Vgsc</i> were at very low frequency in Tanzania, yet combining these samples with 3 <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> individuals from West Africa revealed a startling evolutionary diversity, with up to 5 independent origins of <i>Vgsc</i>-995 mutations found within just 8 haplotypes. Thus, despite having been first recorded over 10 years ago, <i>Vgsc</i> resistance mutations in Tanzanian <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> have remained at stable low frequencies. Overall, our results provide a new copy number marker for monitoring resistance to PM in malaria mosquitoes, and reveal the complex picture of resistance patterns in <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i>.

                <p>by Kota Ishibashi, Yuichi Shichino, Peixun Han, Kimi Wakabayashi, Mari Mito, Toshifumi Inada, Seisuke Kimura, Shintaro Iwasaki, Yuichiro Mishima</p>

Quality control of translation is crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Obstacles in translation elongation induce ribosome collision, which is monitored by multiple sensor mechanisms in eukaryotes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Znf598 recognizes collided ribosomes, triggering ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to rescue stalled ribosomes and no-go decay (NGD) to degrade stall-prone mRNAs. However, the impact of RQC and NGD on maintaining the translational homeostasis of endogenous mRNAs has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the endogenous substrate mRNAs of NGD during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) of zebrafish development. RNA-Seq analysis of zebrafish <i>znf598</i> mutant embryos revealed that Znf598 down-regulates mRNAs encoding the C2H2-type zinc finger domain (C2H2-ZF) during the MZT. Reporter assays and disome profiling indicated that ribosomes stall and collide while translating tandem C2H2-ZFs, leading to mRNA degradation by Znf598. Our results suggest that NGD maintains the quality of the translatome by mitigating the risk of ribosome collision at the abundantly present C2H2-ZF sequences in the vertebrate genome.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002848">A high-resolution two-step evolution experiment in yeast reveals a shift from pleiotropic to modular adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grant Kinsler, Yuping Li, Gavin Sherlock, Dmitri A. Petrov</p>

Evolution by natural selection is expected to be a slow and gradual process. In particular, the mutations that drive evolution are predicted to be small and modular, incrementally improving a small number of traits. However, adaptive mutations identified early in microbial evolution experiments, cancer, and other systems often provide substantial fitness gains and pleiotropically improve multiple traits at once. We asked whether such pleiotropically adaptive mutations are common throughout adaptation or are instead a rare feature of early steps in evolution that tend to target key signaling pathways. To do so, we conducted barcoded second-step evolution experiments initiated from 5 first-step mutations identified from a prior yeast evolution experiment. We then isolated hundreds of second-step mutations from these evolution experiments, measured their fitness and performance in several growth phases, and conducted whole genome sequencing of the second-step clones. Here, we found that while the vast majority of mutants isolated from the first-step of evolution in this condition show patterns of pleiotropic adaptation—improving both performance in fermentation and respiration growth phases—second-step mutations show a shift towards modular adaptation, mostly improving respiration performance and only rarely improving fermentation performance. We also identified a shift in the molecular basis of adaptation from genes in cellular signaling pathways towards genes involved in respiration and mitochondrial function. Our results suggest that the genes in cellular signaling pathways may be more likely to provide large, adaptively pleiotropic benefits to the organism due to their ability to coherently affect many phenotypes at once. As such, these genes may serve as the source of pleiotropic adaptation in the early stages of evolution, and once these become exhausted, organisms then adapt more gradually, acquiring smaller, more modular mutations.

                <p>by Lily D. Peck, Theo Llewellyn, Bastien Bennetot, Samuel O’Donnell, Reuben W. Nowell, Matthew J. Ryan, Julie Flood, Ricardo C. Rodríguez de la Vega, Jeanne Ropars, Tatiana Giraud, Pietro D. Spanu, Timothy G. Barraclough</p>

Outbreaks of fungal diseases have devastated plants and animals throughout history. Over the past century, the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium xylarioides</i> severely impacted coffee production across sub-Saharan Africa. To improve the disease management of such pathogens, it is crucial to understand their genetic structure and evolutionary potential. We compared the genomes of 13 historic strains spanning 6 decades and multiple disease outbreaks to investigate population structure and host specialisation. We found that <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> comprised at least 4 distinct lineages: 1 host-specific to <i>Coffea arabica</i>, 1 to <i>C</i>. <i>canephora</i> var. robusta, and 2 historic lineages isolated from various <i>Coffea</i> species. The presence/absence of large genomic regions across populations, the higher genetic similarities of these regions between species than expected based on genome-wide divergence and their locations in different loci in genomes across populations showed that horizontal transfers of effector genes from members of the <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> species complex contributed to host specificity. Multiple transfers into <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> populations matched different parts of the <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> mobile pathogenicity chromosome and were enriched in effector genes and transposons. Effector genes in this region and other carbohydrate-active enzymes important in the breakdown of plant cell walls were shown by transcriptomics to be highly expressed during infection of <i>C</i>. <i>arabica</i> by the fungal arabica strains. Widespread sharing of specific transposons between <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> and <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i>, and the correspondence of a putative horizontally transferred regions to a <i>Starship</i> (large mobile element involved in horizontal gene transfers in fungi), reinforce the inference of horizontal transfers and suggest that mobile elements were involved. Our results support the hypothesis that horizontal gene transfers contributed to the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease.

                Failure to reject a null hypothesis may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the absence of an association or inadequate statistical power. Because an estimate (and its variance) can never be exactly zero, traditional statistical tests cannot conclusively demonstrate the absence of an association. Instead, estimates of accuracy should be used to identify settings in which an association and its variability are sufficiently small to be clinically acceptable, directly providing information on safety and efficacy. Post-hoc power calculations should be avoided, as they offer no additional information beyond statistical tests and p-values. Furthermore, post-hoc power calculations can be misleading because of an inability to distinguish between results based on insufficient sample size and results that reflect clinically irrelevant differences. Most multiple testing procedures unrealistically assume that all positive results are false positives. However, in applied settings, results typically represent a mix of true and false positives. This implies that multiplicity corrections do not effectively differentiate between true and false positives. Instead, considering the distributions of p-values and the proportion of significant results can help to identify bodies of evidence unlikely to be driven by false-positive results. In conclusion, rather than attempting to categorize results as true or false, medical research should embrace established statistical methods that focus on estimation accuracy, replication, and consistency.

                Background This paper investigated the connection between transactional leadership styles, contingent rewards, punishments, and employee performance while emphasizing employee engagement’s mediating role. Existing research has predominantly focused on isolated associations between contingent rewards, punishment, and employee performance, leaving gaps in the empirical exploration of these mediating mechanisms. To address this research gap, our study has introduced a conceptual framework to understand the multifaceted connection between contingent rewards, punishment, and their effects on employee performance, with a specific emphasis on the mediating function of employee engagement. Methods We involved 273 full-time non-clinical healthcare professionals employed in NABH-accredited hospitals in Jharkhand, India. A structured survey instrument was employed for data collection from the specific survey participants, with the investigation of the research hypotheses conducted through the application of partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results Preliminary findings suggested that contingent rewards and punishment do not directly influence employee performance. Instead, our study highlighted the critical mediating role of employee engagement, particularly its dimensions of Vigor, absorption, and dedication. Conclusions This research has underscored rewards and punishments as essential tools for influencing employee behaviour, motivation, and performance. Employee engagement, as a multifaceted construct, not only benefits individual employees but also significantly impacts overall organizational performance and success.

                Background The practice of preoperative hair removal has been debated regarding its role in Surgical Site Infection (SSI) prevention. This study aimed to compare the different hair removing modalities and investigate the effect of preoperative hair removal on SSI rates. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Three databases—PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library—were searched for relevant studies comparing preoperative hair removal to no hair removal. Studies eligible for inclusion were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies reporting SSI rates. Odds ratios, mean differences, and p-values were analyzed using a random effect model. Results Seventeen studies involving 5,407 patients were included. No statistically significant difference in SSI rates was found between the hair removal and no removal groups (OR = 1.066, 95% CI 0.646–1.758, p = 0.803). When comparing clipping to no hair removal, there was no significant difference (OR = 0.967, 95% CI 0.642–1.455, p = 0.870). Razor shaving was associated with higher skin damage and slightly increased SSI risk compared to clipping but not statistically significant (OR = 0.749, 95% CI 0.346–1.623, p = 0.464). Depilatory creams, however, were favored over razor shaving (OR = 3.235, 95% CI 1.543–6.785, p = 0.002), as they were linked to less skin damage and easier application. Conclusion Preoperative hair removal does not significantly impact SSI rates. Clipping appears to be a safer alternative to shaving, while depilatory creams show promise as an effective, less damaging option.

                Introduction Given the worldwide prevalence of tooth wear and wear related to dental erosion a baseline understanding of the knowledge of populations related to erosive wear is required to maximize public health campaigns developed to address this condition. This research investigated the awareness of dental erosion, its causes, and protective factors among the general adult population of Trinidad and Tobago. Methods An anonymous de-novo questionnaire, developed using Google Forms and aligned with the CHERRIES framework for web-based surveys, was subjected to face validity to ensure the inclusion of content relevant to erosive tooth wear and clarity of items intended for a general population. The questionnaire was deployed on social media platforms (Facebook) and groups (WhatsApp Community Groups) specific to groups in Trinidad and Tobago for four months. Data was entered into SPSS (Version 29) and analyzed using cross-tabulations and Chi-squared tests. Results Of the 210 respondents, 39.2% had previously been diagnosed with tooth wear, 43.1 % believed they could identify erosive wear and 42.1% believed they could differentiate between predominantly erosive wear and dental caries. Sixty-two point nine percent of respondents identified sensitivity as a symptom of erosive tooth wear. Chi-squared tests on cross-tabulated data showed significant relationships between age and GERD causing erosive wear (p=0.03), heartburn causing erosive wear (p=0.049), eating disorders causing erosive wear (p=0.009), disorders with excessive vomiting causing erosive wear (p=0.005), excessive wine consumption (p=0.004). There were no significant statistical significances for cross-tabulated data on sex and the responses on causative factors. Conclusions Respondents were generally knowledgeable about the various types of foods, beverages, and medical conditions that may cause dental erosion but were unfamiliar with other factors that may influence erosion or protect against dental erosion.

                Background The objective of the research was to analyze e-mails exchanged at Enron, a power company that declared bankruptcy in 2001 following an investigation into unethical operations regarding their financials. Methods Like other researchers, we identify the “most important” employees and detect “communities” using network science methods. In addition, because previous work required that 10 e-mails be sent and received for an e-mail relationship to exist, we analyzed the effect of different “thresholds” on the results. We also performed sentiment analyses on the e-mails to evaluate whether sentiment changed over time. Results We find that the “importance” of a person depends on the centrality measure used; while the communities we detected resembled the formal organizational structure of the company. In addition, we found that centrality results were very dependent on the “threshold” used. Finally, analysis of email sentiment over time = do not give insight into the financial wellbeing of Enron. Conclusion Our results provide insight into how information flowed through Enron, who the key employees were, and e-mail sentiment before and after the crisis.

                Background The extension of hydatid liver cysts into the mediastinum through diaphragmatic hiatus is extremely rare. In this report, we describe a rare case of a hydatid liver cyst with mediastinal extension through Larrey’s hiatus, emphasizing the surgical strategy for successful treatment. In this report, we present the first documented case of a hydatid liver cyst extending into the mediastinum through Larrey’s hiatus. Case presentation We report the case of a 65-year-old male who presented with right-upper-quadrant and left-sided chest pain evolving for two months. Physical examination showed dullnes in the epigastric region. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan, revealed a 13 cm mediastino-abdominal hydatid cyst, centered on the left liver lobe with extension into the mediastinum through the Larray’s diaphragmatic hiatus. The patient underwent surgical management. Both thoracic and visceral surgeons were involved. The surgical management involved both thoracic and visceral surgeons. A Makuuchi incision allowed resection of the hydatid liver cyst. The mediastinal portion of the cyst, resting on the pericardium was aspirated through Larrey’s hiatus, followed by irrigation with a scolicidal solution. The postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion Transmediastinal hydatid liver cysts are rare and should be operated on in close collaboration between visceral and thoracic surgeons to prevent complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1483/v1?src=rss">Comment regarding “Positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR of a nasal swab spot after 30 days of conservation on filter paper at room temperature” [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The diagnostic and therapeutic approaches towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic were a global challenge, and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of virus RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs has become a common tool to confirm the clinical diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. Available evidence suggests, that Whatman™ Flinders Technology Associates™ (FTA) cards are a reliable option for the safe transport and storage of viral RNA pathogens. In 2021 FTA cards were shown to be suitable for the stable preservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA derived from nasopharyngeal swabs even at elevated storage temperatures. Subsequently, another study identified Whatman filter paper to be a cheaper alternative with respect to the stable storage SARS-CoV-2 RNA at room temperature. This correspondence is meant to discuss the performance of both FTA cards and filter paper also scrutinizing performance calculations and respective evaluations.

Mechanistically, the ATAC complex directly ubiquitinates TFE3 through its E3 ligase activity and prompts TFE3’s proteasome-dependent degradation.

                Socha et al. find that visual stimuli in nasal directions trigger an arousal-related pupil response, which impacts the activity of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus boutons measured in the primary visual cortex, affecting measurements of visual tuning. The over-representation of responses preferring nasal directions is not present under anesthesia, suggesting that the effect is linked to changes in arousal levels triggered by visual stimuli, which modulate thalamic visual inputs to the cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97503">Endogenous hydrogen peroxide positively regulates secretion of a gut-derived peptide in neuroendocrine potentiation of the oxidative stress response in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                The gut-brain axis mediates bidirectional signaling between the intestine and the nervous system and is critical for organism-wide homeostasis. Here, we report the identification of a peptidergic endocrine circuit in which bidirectional signaling between neurons and the intestine potentiates the activation of the antioxidant response in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> in the intestine. We identify an FMRF-amide-like peptide, FLP-2, whose release from the intestine is necessary and sufficient to activate the intestinal oxidative stress response by promoting the release of the antioxidant FLP-1 neuropeptide from neurons. FLP-2 secretion from the intestine is positively regulated by endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) produced in the mitochondrial matrix by <i>sod-3</i>/superoxide dismutase, and is negatively regulated by <i>prdx-2</i>/peroxiredoxin, which depletes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in both the mitochondria and cytosol. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promotes FLP-2 secretion through the DAG and calcium-dependent protein kinase C family member <i>pkc-2</i> and by the SNAP25 family member <i>aex-4</i> in the intestine. Together, our data demonstrate a role for intestinal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in promoting inter-tissue antioxidant signaling through regulated neuropeptide-like protein exocytosis in a gut-brain axis to activate the oxidative stress response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97051">Synthesis and biological assessment of chalcone and pyrazoline derivatives as novel inhibitor for ELF3-MED23 interaction</a></h4>

              
                HER2 overexpression significantly contributes to the aggressive nature and recurrent patterns observed in various solid tumors, notably gastric cancers. Trastuzumab, HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody drug, has shown considerable clinical success; however, readily emerging drug resistance emphasizes the pressing need for improved interventions in HER2-overexpressing cancers. To address this, we proposed targeting the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between ELF3 and MED23 as an alternative therapeutic approach to trastuzumab. In this study, we synthesized a total of 26 compounds consisting of 10 chalcones, 7 pyrazoline acetyl, and 9 pyrazoline propionyl derivatives, and evaluated their biological activity as potential ELF3-MED23 PPI inhibitors. Upon systematic analysis, candidate compound <b>10</b> was selected due to its potency in downregulating reporter gene activity of <i>ERBB2</i> promoter confirmed by SEAP activity and its effect on HER2 protein and mRNA levels. Compound <b>10</b> effectively disrupted the binding interface between the ELF3 TAD domain and the 391–582 amino acid region of MED23, resulting in successful inhibition of the ELF3-MED23 PPI. This intervention led to a substantial reduction in HER2 levels and its downstream signals in the HER2-positive gastric cancer cell line. Subsequently, compound <b>10</b> induced significant apoptosis and anti-proliferative effects, demonstrating superior in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity overall. We found that the anticancer activity of compound <b>10</b> was not only restricted to trastuzumab-sensitive cases, but was also valid for trastuzumab-refractory clones. This suggests its potential as a viable therapeutic option for trastuzumab-resistant gastric cancers. In summary, compound <b>10</b> could be a novel alternative therapeutic strategy for HER2-overexpressing cancers, overcoming the limitations of trastuzumab.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92499">PfMORC protein regulates chromatin accessibility and transcriptional repression in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum</a></h4>

              
                The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that <i>Pf</i>MORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments suggests that <i>Pf</i>MORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies indicate that downregulation of <i>Pf</i>MORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that <i>Pf</i>MORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97504">Dynamic tracking of native precursors in adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Hematopoietic dysfunction has been associated with a reduction in the number of active precursors. However, precursor quantification at homeostasis and under diseased conditions is constrained by the scarcity of available methods. To address this issue, we optimized a method for quantifying a wide range of hematopoietic precursors. Assuming the random induction of a stable label in precursors following a binomial distribution, estimates depend on the inverse correlation between precursor numbers and the variance of precursor labeling among independent samples. Experimentally validated to cover the full dynamic range of hematopoietic precursors in mice (1–10<sup>5</sup>), we utilized this approach to demonstrate that thousands of precursors, which emerge after modest expansion during fetal-to-adult transition, contribute to native and perturbed hematopoiesis. We further estimated the number of precursors in a mouse model of Fanconi Anemia, showcasing how repopulation deficits can be classified as autologous (cell proliferation) and non-autologous (lack of precursor). Our results support an accessible and reliable approach for precursor quantification, emphasizing the contemporary perspective that native hematopoiesis is highly polyclonal.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99424">Multisensory integration enhances audiovisual responses in the Mauthner cell</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration (MSI) combines information from multiple sensory modalities to create a coherent perception of the world. In contexts where sensory information is limited or equivocal, it also allows animals to integrate individually ambiguous stimuli into a clearer or more accurate percept and, thus, react with a more adaptive behavioral response. Although responses to multisensory stimuli have been described at the neuronal and behavioral levels, a causal or direct link between these two is still missing. In this study, we studied the integration of audiovisual inputs in the Mauthner cell, a command neuron necessary and sufficient to trigger a stereotypical escape response in fish. We performed intracellular recordings in adult goldfish while presenting a diverse range of stimuli to determine which stimulus properties affect their integration. Our results show that stimulus modality, intensity, temporal structure, and interstimulus delay affect input summation. Mechanistically, we found that the distinct decay dynamics of FFI triggered by auditory and visual stimuli can account for certain aspects of input integration. Altogether, this is a rare example of the characterization of MSI in a cell with clear behavioral relevance, providing both phenomenological and mechanistic insights into how MSI depends on stimulus properties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102702">Parallel mechanisms signal a hierarchy of sequence structure violations in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The brain predicts regularities in sensory inputs at multiple complexity levels, with neuronal mechanisms that remain elusive. Here, we monitored auditory cortex activity during the local-global paradigm, a protocol nesting different regularity levels in sound sequences. We observed that mice encode local predictions based on stimulus occurrence and stimulus transition probabilities, because auditory responses are boosted upon prediction violation. This boosting was due to both short-term adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise mechanism resisting anesthesia. In parallel, and only in wakefulness, VIP interneurons responded to the omission of the locally expected sound repeat at the sequence ending, thus providing a chunking signal potentially useful for establishing global sequence structure. When this global structure was violated, by either shortening the sequence or ending it with a locally expected but globally unexpected sound transition, activity slightly increased in VIP and PV neurons, respectively. Hence, distinct cellular mechanisms predict different regularity levels in sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91522">When abstract becomes concrete, naturalistic encoding of concepts in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Language is acquired and processed in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts, involving the simultaneous processing of connected speech, faces, bodies, objects, etc. How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown. Here, the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts was investigated during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context. First, across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts are shown to encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when these are processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88584">Spinal neural tube formation and tail development in human embryos</a></h4>

              
                Primary and secondary neurulation – processes that form the spinal cord – are incompletely understood in humans, largely due to the challenge of accessing neurulation-stage embryos (3–7 weeks post-conception). Here, we describe findings from 108 human embryos, spanning Carnegie stages (CS) 10–18. Primary neurulation is completed at the posterior neuropore with neural plate bending that is similar, but not identical, to the mouse. Secondary neurulation proceeds from CS13 with formation of a single lumen as in mouse, not coalescence of multiple lumens as in chick. There is no evidence of a ‘transition zone’ from primary to secondary neurulation. Secondary neural tube ‘splitting’ occurs in 60% of proximal human tail regions. A somite is formed every 7 hr in human, compared with 2 hr in mice and a 5 hr ‘segmentation clock’ in human organoids. Termination of axial elongation occurs after down-regulation of <i>WNT3A</i> and <i>FGF8</i> in the CS15 embryonic tailbud, with a ‘burst’ of apoptosis that may remove neuro-mesodermal progenitors. Hence, the main differences between human and mouse/rat spinal neurulation relate to timing. Investigators are now attempting to recapitulate neurulation events in stem cell-derived organoids, and our results provide ‘normative data’ for interpretation of such research findings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100446">A novel monomeric amyloid β-activated signaling pathway regulates brain development via inhibition of microglia</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid β (Aβ) forms aggregates in the Alzheimer’s disease brain and is well known for its pathological roles. Recent studies show that it also regulates neuronal physiology in the healthy brain. Whether Aβ also regulates glial physiology in the normal brain, however, has remained unclear. In this article, we describe the discovery of a novel signaling pathway activated by the monomeric form of Aβ in vitro that plays essential roles in the regulation of microglial activity and the assembly of neocortex during mouse development in vivo. We find that activation of this pathway depends on the function of amyloid precursor and the heterotrimeric G protein regulator Ric8a in microglia and inhibits microglial immune activation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Genetic disruption of this pathway during neocortical development results in microglial dysregulation and excessive matrix proteinase activation, leading to basement membrane degradation, neuronal ectopia, and laminar disruption. These results uncover a previously unknown function of Aβ as a negative regulator of brain microglia and substantially elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Considering the prominence of Aβ and neuroinflammation in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, they also highlight a potentially overlooked role of Aβ monomer depletion in the development of the disease.

                Entorhinal grid cells implement a spatial code with hexagonal periodicity, signaling the position of the animal within an environment. Grid maps of cells belonging to the same module share spacing and orientation, only differing in relative two-dimensional spatial phase, which could result from being part of a two-dimensional attractor guided by path integration. However, this architecture has the drawbacks of being complex to construct and rigid, path integration allowing for no deviations from the hexagonal pattern such as the ones observed under a variety of experimental manipulations. Here, we show that a simpler one-dimensional attractor is enough to align grid cells equally well. Using topological data analysis, we show that the resulting population activity is a sample of a torus, while the ensemble of maps preserves features of the network architecture. The flexibility of this low dimensional attractor allows it to negotiate the geometry of the representation manifold with the feedforward inputs, rather than imposing it. More generally, our results represent a proof of principle against the intuition that the architecture and the representation manifold of an attractor are topological objects of the same dimensionality, with implications to the study of attractor networks across the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93004">A conserved cell-pole determinant organizes proper polar flagellum formation</a></h4>

              
                The coordination of cell cycle progression and flagellar synthesis is a complex process in motile bacteria. In γ-proteobacteria, the localization of the flagellum to the cell pole is mediated by the SRP-type GTPase FlhF. However, the mechanism of action of FlhF, and its relationship with the cell pole landmark protein HubP remain unclear. In this study, we discovered a novel protein called FipA that is required for normal FlhF activity and function in polar flagellar synthesis. We demonstrated that membrane-localized FipA interacts with FlhF and is required for normal flagellar synthesis in <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>, and <i>Shewanella putrefaciens</i>, and it does so independently of the polar localization mediated by HubP. FipA exhibits a dynamic localization pattern and is present at the designated pole before flagellar synthesis begins, suggesting its role in licensing flagellar formation. This discovery provides insight into a new pathway for regulating flagellum synthesis and coordinating cellular organization in bacteria that rely on polar flagellation and FlhF-dependent localization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93493">Distinct T-cell receptor (TCR) gene segment usage and MHC-restriction between foetal and adult thymus</a></h4>

              
                Here, we sequenced rearranged TCRβ and TCRα chain sequences in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> single positive (SP4) and CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (SP8) thymocyte populations from the foetus and young adult mouse. We found that life-stage had a greater impact on TCRβ and TCRα gene segment usage than cell-type. Foetal repertoires showed bias towards 3’TRAV and 5’TRAJ rearrangements in all populations, whereas adult repertoires used more 5’TRAV gene segments, suggesting that progressive TCRα rearrangements occur less frequently in foetal DP cells. When we synchronised young adult DP thymocyte differentiation by hydrocortisone treatment the new recovering DP thymocyte population showed more foetal-like 3’TRAV and 5’TRAJ gene segment usage. In foetus we identified less influence of MHC-restriction on α-chain and β-chain combinatorial VxJ usage and CDR1xCDR2 (V region) usage in SP compared to adult, indicating weaker impact of MHC-restriction on the foetal TCR repertoire. The foetal TCRβ repertoire was less diverse, less evenly distributed, with fewer non-template insertions, and all foetal populations contained more clonotypic expansions than adult. The differences between the foetal and adult thymus TCR repertoires are consistent with the foetal thymus producing αβT-cells with properties and functions that are distinct from adult T-cells: their repertoire is less governed by MHC-restriction, with preference for particular gene segment usage, less diverse with more clonotypic expansions, and more closely encoded by genomic sequence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90254">Minimal twister sister-like self-cleaving ribozymes in the human genome revealed by deep mutational scanning</a></h4>

              
                Despite their importance in a wide range of living organisms, self-cleaving ribozymes in the human genome are few and poorly studied. Here, we performed deep mutational scanning and covariance analysis of two previously proposed self-cleaving ribozymes (LINE-1 and OR4K15). We found that the regions essential for ribozyme activities are made of two short segments, with a total of 35 and 31 nucleotides only. The discovery makes them the simplest known self-cleaving ribozymes. Moreover, the essential regions are circular permutated with two nearly identical catalytic internal loops, supported by two stems of different lengths. These two self-cleaving ribozymes, which are shaped like lanterns, are similar to the catalytic regions of the twister sister ribozymes in terms of sequence and secondary structure. However, the nucleotides at the cleavage site have shown that mutational effects on two twister sister-like (TS-like) ribozymes are different from the twister sister ribozyme. The discovery of TS-like ribozymes reveals a ribozyme class with the simplest and, perhaps, the most primitive structure needed for self-cleavage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100569">β-1,6-Glucan plays a central role in the structure and remodeling of the bilaminate fungal cell wall</a></h4>

              
                The cell wall of human fungal pathogens plays critical roles as an architectural scaffold and as a target and modulator of the host immune response. Although the cell wall of the pathogenic yeast <i>Candida albicans</i> is intensively studied, one of the major fibrillar components in its cell wall, β-1,6-glucan, has been largely neglected. Here, we show that β-1,6-glucan is essential for bilayered cell wall organization, cell wall integrity, and filamentous growth. For the first time, we show that β-1,6-glucan production compensates the defect in mannan elongation in the outer layer of the cell wall. In addition, β-1,6-glucan dynamics are also coordinated by host environmental stimuli and stresses with wall remodeling, where the regulation of β-1,6-glucan structure and chain length is a crucial process. As we point out that β-1,6-glucan is exposed at the yeast surface and modulate immune response, β-1,6-glucan must be considered a key factor in host–pathogen interactions.

	<p>Background and aim: While conventional MS rehabilitation primarily addresses physical and cognitive symptoms, recent advances in VR technology offer immersive environments that facilitate both emotional and cognitive skill development. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of VR-based training on emotional self-efficacy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and examine its association with cognitive function improvement. Additionally, this study aims to explore potential gender differences in these outcomes, hypothesizing that gender may influence the effectiveness of VR-based rehabilitation, which could inform more tailored approaches for emotional and cognitive rehabilitation in MS. Method: The present retrospective study analyzed data from 43 MS patients undergoing cognitive and behavioral rehabilitation at the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi &amp;amp;ldquo;Bonino Pulejo&amp;amp;rdquo; in Italy, comparing a VR intervention group (VR-G) and a control group receiving traditional rehabilitation. Emotional self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety were assessed, alongside cognitive function pre- and post-intervention. Results: Findings indicate that the VR-G showed significant improvements in managing negative emotions, reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms, and enhanced cognitive performance, particularly in verbal learning and working memory. Gender-based analysis revealed a trend suggesting that females in the VR-G may exhibit greater improvements in positive emotional self-efficacy, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation highlighted associations between emotional self-efficacy and cognitive gains, supporting the potential of VR to foster both emotional and cognitive resilience. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VR training may provide a tailored approach for MS rehabilitation, enhancing therapeutic outcomes by integrating emotional and cognitive training in an immersive setting. Further research should investigate long-term effects and neurophysiological correlates of VR training to optimize MS rehabilitation.</p>
