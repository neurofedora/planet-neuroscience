<p>We introduce Continual Learning via Neural Pruning (CLNP), a new method aimed
at lifelong learning in fixed capacity models based on neuronal model
sparsification. In this method, subsequent tasks are trained using the inactive
neurons and filters of the sparsified network and cause zero deterioration to
the performance of previous tasks. In order to deal with the possible
compromise between model sparsity and performance, we formalize and incorporate
the concept of graceful forgetting: the idea that it is preferable to suffer a
small amount of forgetting in a controlled manner if it helps regain network
capacity and prevents uncontrolled loss of performance during the training of
future tasks. CLNP also provides simple continual learning diagnostic tools in
terms of the number of free neurons left for the training of future tasks as
well as the number of neurons that are being reused. In particular, we see in
experiments that CLNP verifies and automatically takes advantage of the fact
that the features of earlier layers are more transferable. We show empirically
that CLNP leads to significantly improved results over current weight
elasticity based methods.

<p>Preventing early progression of epilepsy and so the severity of seizures
requires effective diagnosis. Epileptic transients indicate the ability to
develop seizures but humans easily overlook such brief events in an
electroencephalogram (EEG) what compromises patient treatment. Traditionally,
training of the EEG event detection algorithms has relied on ground truth
labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work,
we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG
signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved
generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of
singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show
the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a
consensus-trained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection.
The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event
variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort
from consensus-oriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the
event and the labeler category.

<p>Despite a rise in the use of "learning by doing" pedagogical methods in
praxis, little is known as to why these methods may improve learning outcomes.
This is surprising given that an increased mechanistic knowledge of learning by
doing-based improvements has the potential to speed up the development of
evidence-based teaching practices. Here we use neuroscience methods and a
gesture-enriched foreign language (L2) vocabulary learning paradigm to
adjudicate between opposing predictions of two neuroscientific learning
theories. We demonstrate that sensory brain regions associated with the
processing of gesture-related stimulus information causally contribute to
performance benefits following gesture-enriched L2 vocabulary learning. Sensory
brain responses benefitted both short- and long-term learning outcomes, as well
as the learning of both concrete and abstract words. These findings suggest
that responses within specialized visual sensory cortices precipitate
sensorimotor-based learning benefits. Such a mechanism could play a role in
comparatively effortless native language learning and may be key for
accelerating L2 proficiency in adults.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44771">The complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex</a></h4>

Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a heterodecameric protein complex critical for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and nucleotide excision DNA repair. The TFIIH core complex is sufficient for its repair functions and harbors the XPB and XPD DNA-dependent ATPase/helicase subunits, which are affected by human disease mutations. Transcription initiation additionally requires the CdK activating kinase subcomplex. Previous structural work has provided only partial insight into the architecture of TFIIH and its interactions within transcription pre-initiation complexes. Here, we present the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex, determined by phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy at 3.7 Å resolution. The structure uncovers the molecular basis of TFIIH assembly, revealing how the recruitment of XPB by p52 depends on a pseudo-symmetric dimer of homologous domains in these two proteins. The structure also suggests a function for p62 in the regulation of XPD, and allows the mapping of previously unresolved human disease mutations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43599">A multicellular way of life for a multipartite virus</a></h4>

A founding paradigm in virology is that the spatial unit of the viral replication cycle is an individual cell. Multipartite viruses have a segmented genome where each segment is encapsidated separately. In this situation the viral genome is not recapitulated in a single virus particle but in the viral population. How multipartite viruses manage to efficiently infect individual cells with all segments, thus with the whole genome information, is a long-standing but perhaps deceptive mystery. By localizing and quantifying the genome segments of a nanovirus in host plant tissues we show that they rarely co-occur within individual cells. We further demonstrate that distinct segments accumulate independently in different cells and that the viral system is functional through complementation across cells. Our observation deviates from the classical conceptual framework in virology and opens an alternative possibility (at least for nanoviruses) where the infection can operate at a level above the individual cell level, defining a viral multicellular way of life.

As part of the <a href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a>, we published a Registered Report (Li et al., 2015), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘The microRNA miR-34a inhibits prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis by directly repressing CD44’ (Liu et al., 2011). Here we report the results. We found the microRNA, miR-34a, was expressed at twice the level in CD44<sup>+</sup> prostate cancer cells purified from xenograft tumors (LAPC4 cells) compared to CD44<sup>-</sup> LAPC4 cells, whereas the original study reported miR-34a was underexpressed in CD44<sup>+</sup> LAPC4 cells (Figure 1B; Liu et al., 2011). When LAPC4 cells engineered to express miR-34a were injected into mice, we did not observe changes in tumor growth or CD44 expression; however, unexpectedly miR-34a expression was lost <i>in vivo</i>. In the original study, LAPC4 cells expressing miR-34a had a statistically significant reduction in tumor regeneration and reduced CD44 expression compared to control (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figures 4A,B and 5C; Liu et al., 2011). Furthermore, when we tested if miR-34a regulated CD44 through binding sites in the 3’UTR we did not find a statistically significant difference, whereas the original study reported miR-34a decreased CD44 expression that was partially abrogated by mutation of the binding sites in the <i>CD44</i> 3’UTR (Figure 4D; Liu et al., 2011). Finally, where possible, we report meta-analyses for each result.

Viruses manipulate host cells to enhance their replication, and the identification of cellular factors targeted by viruses has led to key insights into both viral pathogenesis and cell biology. In this study, we develop an HIV reporter virus (HIV-AFMACS) displaying a streptavidin-binding affinity tag at the surface of infected cells, allowing facile one-step selection with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. We use this system to obtain pure populations of HIV-infected primary human CD4+ T cells for detailed proteomic analysis, and quantitate approximately 9000 proteins across multiple donors on a dynamic background of T cell activation. Amongst 650 HIV-dependent changes (q &lt; 0.05), we describe novel Vif-dependent targets FMR1 and DPH7, and 192 proteins not identified and/or regulated in T cell lines, such as ARID5A and PTPN22. We therefore provide a high-coverage functional proteomic atlas of HIV infection, and a mechanistic account of host factors subverted by the virus in its natural target cell.

Statistical analysis of evolutionary-related protein sequences provides insights about their structure, function, and history. We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), designed to learn complex high-dimensional data and their statistical features, can efficiently model protein families from sequence information. We here apply RBM to twenty protein families, and present detailed results for two short protein domains, Kunitz and WW, one long chaperone protein, Hsp70, and synthetic lattice proteins for benchmarking. The features inferred by the RBM are biologically interpretable: they are related to structure (such as residue-residue tertiary contacts, extended secondary motifs (α-helix and β-sheet) and intrinsically disordered regions), to function (such as activity and ligand specificity), or to phylogenetic identity. In addition, we use RBM to design new protein sequences with putative properties by composing and turning up or down the different modes at will. Our work therefore shows that RBM are a versatile and practical tool to unveil and exploit the genotype-phenotype relationship for protein families.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37689">Bim escapes displacement by BH3-mimetic anti-cancer drugs by double-bolt locking both Bcl-XL and Bcl-2</a></h4>

Tumor initiation, progression and resistance to chemotherapy rely on cancer cells bypassing programmed cell death by apoptosis. We report that unlike other pro-apoptotic proteins, Bim contains two distinct binding sites for the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2. These include the BH3 sequence shared with other pro-apoptotic proteins and an unexpected sequence located near the Bim carboxyl-terminus (residues 181–192). Using automated Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy - Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FLIM-FRET) we show that the two binding interfaces enable Bim to double-bolt lock Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 in complexes resistant to displacement by BH3-mimetic drugs currently in use or being evaluated for cancer therapy. Quantifying in live cells the contributions of individual amino acids revealed that residue L185 previously thought involved in binding Bim to membranes, instead contributes to binding to anti-apoptotic proteins. This double-bolt lock mechanism has profound implications for the utility of BH3-mimetics as drugs. ​

<p>by Shariq N. Iqbal, Lun Yin, Caroline B. Drucker, Qian Kuang, Jean-François Gariépy, Michael L. Platt, John M. Pearson</p>

Understanding the principles by which agents interact with both complex environments and each other is a key goal of decision neuroscience. However, most previous studies have used experimental paradigms in which choices are discrete (and few), play is static, and optimal solutions are known. Yet in natural environments, interactions between agents typically involve continuous action spaces, ongoing dynamics, and no known optimal solution. Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a “penalty shot” task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys’ strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players’ goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players’ strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players. Together, our experimental paradigm and model offer a powerful combination of tools for the study of realistic social dynamics in the laboratory setting.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EQny46_S5o" width="1" />

<p>by Daan H. de Groot, Coco van Boxtel, Robert Planqué, Frank J. Bruggeman, Bas Teusink</p>

Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized—in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints—we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DEY-lhs5fHw" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/6oinXWRforY/article">Myopic control of neural dynamics</a></h4>

<p>by David Hocker, Il Memming Park</p>

Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment “input” to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This “myopic” controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control’s utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic control’s utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6oinXWRforY" width="1" />

<p>by Margaret P. Chapman, Tyler Risom, Anil J. Aswani, Ellen M. Langer, Rosalie C. Sears, Claire J. Tomlin</p>

Drug resistance in breast cancer cell populations has been shown to arise through phenotypic transition of cancer cells to a drug-tolerant state, for example through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transition to a cancer stem cell state. However, many breast tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with numerous epigenetic states in addition to stem-like and mesenchymal phenotypes, and the dynamic behavior of this heterogeneous mixture in response to drug treatment is not well-understood. Recently, we showed that plasticity between differentiation states, as identified with intracellular markers such as cytokeratins, is linked to resistance to specific targeted therapeutics. Understanding the dynamics of differentiation-state transitions in this context could facilitate the development of more effective treatments for cancers that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. In this work, we develop computational models of a drug-treated, phenotypically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line to elucidate the feasibility of differentiation-state transition as a mechanism for therapeutic escape in this tumor subtype. Specifically, we use modeling to predict the changes in differentiation-state transitions that underlie specific therapy-induced changes in differentiation-state marker expression that we recently observed in the HCC1143 cell line. We report several statistically significant therapy-induced changes in transition rates between basal, luminal, mesenchymal, and non-basal/non-luminal/non-mesenchymal differentiation states in HCC1143 cell populations. Moreover, we validate model predictions on cell division and cell death empirically, and we test our models on an independent data set. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in differentiation-state transition rates induced by targeted therapy can provoke distinct differentiation-state aggregations of drug-resistant cells, which may be fundamental to the design of improved therapeutic regimens for cancers with phenotypic heterogeneity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DT3PsYmnYd0" width="1" />

Centrosome amplification (CA) is a common feature of human tumours and a promising target for cancer therapy. However, CA’s pan-cancer prevalence, molecular role in tumourigenesis and therapeutic value in the clinical setting are still largely unexplored. Here, we used a transcriptomic signature (CA20) to characterise the landscape of CA-associated gene expression in 9,721 tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CA20 is upregulated in cancer and associated with distinct clinical and molecular features of breast cancer, consistently with our experimental CA quantification in patient samples. Moreover, we show that CA20 upregulation is positively associated with genomic instability, alteration of specific chromosomal arms and C&gt;T mutations, and we propose novel molecular players associated with CA in cancer. Finally, high CA20 is associated with poor prognosis and, by integrating drug sensitivity with drug perturbation profiles in cell lines, we identify candidate compounds for selectively targeting cancer cells exhibiting transcriptomic evidence for CA.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-C_Yq4jH6sA" width="1" />

<p>by Rodoniki Athanasiadou, Benjamin Neymotin, Nathan Brandt, Wei Wang, Lionel Christiaen, David Gresham, Daniel Tranchina</p>

A fundamental assumption, common to the vast majority of high-throughput transcriptome analyses, is that the expression of most genes is unchanged among samples and that total cellular RNA remains constant. As the number of analyzed experimental systems increases however, different independent studies demonstrate that this assumption is often violated. We present a calibration method using RNA spike-ins that allows for the measurement of absolute cellular abundance of RNA molecules. We apply the method to pooled RNA from cell populations of known sizes. For each transcript, we compute a nominal abundance that can be converted to absolute by dividing by a scale factor determined in separate experiments: the yield coefficient of the transcript relative to that of a reference spike-in measured with the same protocol. The method is derived by maximum likelihood theory in the context is a complete statistical model for sequencing counts contributed by cellular RNA and spike-ins. The counts are based on a sample from a fixed number of cells to which a fixed population of spike-in molecules has been added. We illustrate and evaluate the method with applications to two global expression data sets, one from the model eukaryote <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, proliferating at different growth rates, and differentiating cardiopharyngeal cell lineages in the chordate <i>Ciona robusta</i>. We tested the method in a technical replicate dilution study, and in a <i>k</i>-fold validation study.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQHAuYv6IDY" width="1" />

<p>Disease‐associated proteins are thought to propagate along neuronal processes in neurodegenerative diseases. To detect disease‐associated prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) in the vagus nerve in different forms and molecular subtypes of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), we applied 3 different anti‐PrP antibodies. We screened the vagus nerve in 162 sporadic and 30 genetic CJD cases. Four of 31 VV‐2 type sporadic CJD and 7 of 30 genetic CJD cases showed vagal PrP<sup>Sc</sup> immunodeposits with distinct morphology. Thus, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in CJD affects the vagus nerve analogously to α‐synuclein in Parkinson disease.

<p>During the 1990s, we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large, population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, previous concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. Ninety‐five percent of twins are now deceased. Here, we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Proband‐wise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed ≤50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment. Ann Neurol, 2019</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25440?af=R">Homocysteine and small vessel stroke: A mendelian randomization analysis</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiological studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tHcy (n = 18), folate (n = 3), vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (n = 1), and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (n = 14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n = 16,952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404,630 noncases).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.58; <i>p</i> = 6.7 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by SNPs at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> levels were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34–0.71; <i>p</i> = 1.3 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52–0.94; <i>p</i> = 0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.

<p>This contribution examines two radically different explanations of our
phenomenal intuitions, one reductive and one strongly non-reductive, and
identifies two germane ideas that could benefit many other theories of
consciousness. Firstly, the ability of sophisticated agent architectures with a
purely physical implementation to support certain functional forms of qualia or
proto-qualia appears to entail the possibility of machine consciousness with
qualia, not only for reductive theories but also for the nonreductive ones that
regard consciousness as ubiquitous in Nature. Secondly, analysis of
introspective psychological material seems to hint that, under the threshold of
our ordinary waking awareness, there exist further 'submerged' or 'subliminal'
layers of consciousness which constitute a hidden foundation and support and
another source of our phenomenal intuitions. These 'submerged' layers might
help explain certain puzzling phenomena concerning subliminal perception, such
as the apparently 'unconscious' multisensory integration and learning of
subliminal stimuli.

<p>Automatic epileptic seizure analysis is important because the differentiation
of neural patterns among different patients can be used to classify people with
specific types of epilepsy. This could enable more efficient management of the
disease. Automatic seizure type classification using clinical
electroencephalograms (EEGs) is challenging due to factors such as low signal
to noise ratios, signal artefacts, high variance in the seizure semiology among
individual epileptic patients, and limited clinical data constraints. To
overcome these challenges, in this paper, we present a deep learning based
framework which uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dense
connections and learns highly robust features at different spatial and temporal
resolutions of the EEG data spectrum for accurate cross-patient seizure type
classification. We evaluate our framework for seizure type classification and
seizure detection on the recently released TUH EEG Seizure Corpus, where our
framework achieves overall weighted f 1 scores of up to 0.90 and 0.88, thereby
setting new benchmarks on the dataset.

We report the crystal structure of nuclear import receptor Importin-9 bound to its cargo, the histones H2A-H2B. Importin-9 wraps around the core, globular region of H2A-H2B to form an extensive interface. The nature of this interface coupled with quantitative analysis of deletion mutants of H2A-H2B suggest that the NLS-like sequences in the H2A-H2B tails play a minor role in import. Importin-9•H2A-H2B is reminiscent of interactions between histones and histone chaperones in that it precludes H2A-H2B interactions with DNA and H3-H4 as seen in the nucleosome. Like many histone chaperones, which prevent inappropriate non-nucleosomal interactions, Importin-9 also sequesters H2A-H2B from DNA. Importin-9 appears to act as a storage chaperone for H2A-H2B while escorting it to the nucleus. Surprisingly, RanGTP does not dissociate Importin-9•H2A-H2B but assembles into a RanGTP•Importin-9•H2A-H2B complex. The presence of Ran in the complex, however, modulates Imp9-H2A-H2B interactions to facilitate its dissociation by DNA and assembly into a nucleosome.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42455">A conserved morphogenetic mechanism for epidermal ensheathment of nociceptive sensory neurites</a></h4>

Interactions between epithelial cells and neurons influence a range of sensory modalities including taste, touch, and smell. Vertebrate and invertebrate epidermal cells ensheath peripheral arbors of somatosensory neurons, including nociceptors, yet the developmental origins and functional roles of this ensheathment are largely unknown. Here, we describe an evolutionarily conserved morphogenetic mechanism for epidermal ensheathment of somatosensory neurites. We found that somatosensory neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> and zebrafish induce formation of epidermal sheaths, which wrap neurites of different types of neurons to different extents. Neurites induce formation of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate microdomains at nascent sheaths, followed by a filamentous actin network, and recruitment of junctional proteins that likely form autotypic junctions to seal sheaths. Finally, blocking epidermal sheath formation destabilized dendrite branches and reduced nociceptive sensitivity in <i>Drosophila</i>. Epidermal somatosensory neurite ensheathment is thus a deeply conserved cellular process that contributes to the morphogenesis and function of nociceptive sensory neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41223">Valence-encoding in the lateral habenula arises from the entopeduncular region</a></h4>

Lateral habenula (LHb) neurons are activated by negative motivational stimuli and play key roles in the pathophysiology of depression. Prior reports suggested that rostral entopeduncular nucleus (rEPN) neurons drive these responses in the LHb and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), but these influences remain untested. Using rabies viral tracers, we demonstrate disynaptic projections from the rEPN to RMTg, but not VTA, via the LHb in rats. Using <i>in vivo </i>electrophysiology, we find that rEPN or LHb subpopulations exhibit activation/inhibition patterns after negative/positive motivational stimuli, similar to the RMTg, while temporary inactivation of a region centered on the rEPN decreases LHb basal and burst firing, and reduces valence-related signals in LHb neurons. Additionally, excitotoxic rEPN lesions partly diminish footshock-induced cFos in the LHb and RMTg. Together, our findings indicate an important role of the rEPN, and possibly immediately adjacent hypothalamus, in driving basal activities and valence processing in LHb and RMTg neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41093">Spatiotemporal establishment of dense bacterial colonies growing on hard agar</a></h4>

The physical interactions of growing bacterial cells with each other and with their surroundings significantly affect the structure and dynamics of biofilms. Here a 3D agent-based model is formulated to describe the establishment of simple bacterial colonies expanding by the physical force of their growth. With a single set of parameters, the model captures key dynamical features of colony growth by non-motile, non EPS-producing <i>E. coli</i> cells on hard agar. The model, supported by experiment on colony growth in different types and concentrations of nutrients, suggests that radial colony expansion is not limited by nutrients as commonly believed, but by mechanical forces. Nutrient penetration instead governs vertical colony growth, through thin layers of vertically oriented cells lifting up their ancestors from the bottom. Overall, the model provides a versatile platform to investigate the influences of metabolic and environmental factors on the growth and morphology of bacterial colonies.

Rhythmical brain activity around 5Hz can be observed in the prefrontal cortex under conditions requiring high levels of cognitive control. However, its temporal dynamics are still elusive. A recent research paper (Cooper et al. Neuroimage 2019;189:130–140) provides evidence that the temporal evolution of this frontal-midline theta activity reflects the style of cognitive control being implemented.

At excitatory synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking neuroligins, Nlgn1 rescues impairments in functional and structural LTP and in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission.

Age-related hearing loss is associated with cognitive decline and has been proposed as a risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms that relate hearing loss to cognitive decline remain elusive. Here, we propose that the impairment of the cochlear amplifier mechanism is associated with structural brain changes and cognitive impairment. Ninety-six subjects aged over 65 years old (63 female and 33 male) were evaluated using brain magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and audiological assessments, including distortion product otoacoustic emissions as a measure of the cochlear amplifier function. All the analyses were adjusted by age, gender and education. The group with cochlear amplifier dysfunction showed greater brain atrophy in the cingulate cortex and in the parahippocampus. In addition, the atrophy of the cingulate cortex was associated with cognitive impairment in episodic and working memories and in language and visuoconstructive abilities. We conclude that the neural abnormalities observed in presbycusis subjects with cochlear amplifier dysfunction extend beyond core auditory network and are associated with cognitive decline in multiple domains. These results suggest that a cochlear amplifier dysfunction in presbycusis is an important mechanism relating hearing impairments to brain atrophy in the extended network of effortful hearing.

We propose a novel method to quantify brain growth in 3 arbitrary orthogonal directions of the brain or its sub-regions through linear registration. This is achieved by introducing a 9 degrees of freedom (dof) transformation called anisotropic similarity which is an affine transformation with constrained scaling directions along arbitrarily chosen orthogonal vectors. This gives the opportunity to extract scaling factors describing brain growth along those directions by registering a database of subjects onto a common reference. This information about directional growth brings insights that are not usually available in longitudinal volumetry analysis. The interest of this method is illustrated by studying the anisotropic regional and global brain development of 308 healthy subjects betwen 0 and 19 years old. A gender comparison of those scaling factors is also performed for 4 classes of age. We demonstrate through these applications the stability of the method to the chosen reference and its ability to highlight growth differences accros regions and gender.

The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is an important source of neuromodulators in the brain and has been implicated in a wide variety of behavioral and neurological disorders. Although mostly studied as a source of serotonin, the DRN is comprised of multiple cell types that are subdivided into distinct anatomical subregions. However, the complex and incompletely characterized cellular organization of the DRN has impeded efforts to investigate the distinct circuit and behavioral functions of its subdomains. Here we used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing with in situ hybridization and viral tracing to develop a map of transcriptional and spatial profiles of cells in and around the mouse DRN. Our studies reveal the molecular and spatial organization of multiple neuron subtypes that are the cellular bases of functionally and anatomically distinct serotonergic subsystems, and provide a resource for the design of strategies for further dissection of these subsystems and their diverse functions.

Aim: Prior structural MRI studies demonstrated atypical gray matter characteristics in siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, they did not clarify which aspect of gray matter presents the endophenotype. Further, because they did not enroll siblings of TD people, they underestimated the difference between individuals with ASD and their unaffected siblings. The current study aimed to solve these questions. Methods: We recruited 30 pairs of adult male siblings (15 of them have an ASD endophenotype, other 15 pairs not) and focused on four gray matter parameters: cortical volume and three surface-based parameters (cortical thickness, fractal dimension, and sulcal depth [SD]). First, we sought to identify a pattern of an ASD endophenotype, comparing the four parameters. Then, we compared individuals with ASD and their unaffected siblings in the cortical parameters to identify neural correlates for the clinical diagnosis accounting for the difference between TD siblings. Results: A sparse logistic regression with a leave-one-pair-out cross-validation showed the highest accuracy for the identification of an ASD endophenotype (73.3%) with the SD compared with the other three parameters. A bootstrapping analysis accounting for the difference in the SD between TD siblings showed a significantly large difference between individuals with ASD and their unaffected siblings in six out of 68 regions-of-interest accounting for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that an ASD endophenotype emerges in SD and that neural correlates for the clinical diagnosis can be dissociated from the endophenotype when we accounted for the difference between TD siblings.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/573436v1?rss=1">Neural basis of approximate number system develops independent of visual experience</a></h4>

Thinking about numerical quantities is an integral part of daily human life that is supported by the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The IPS is recruited during mathematical calculation and neuronal populations within the IPS code for the quantity of items in a set. Is the developmental basis of IPS number representations rooted in visual experience? We asked if the IPS possesses population codes for auditory quantities in sighted individuals and, critically, whether it does in the absence of any visual experience in congenitally blind individuals. We found that sequences of 4, 8, 16 and 32 tones each elicited unique patterns of fMRI activity in the IPS of both sighted and congenitally blind individuals, such that the quantity a participant heard on a given trial could be reliably predicted based on the pattern of observed IPS activity. This finding suggests that the IPS number system is resilient to dramatic changes in sensory experience.

Multiple-channel count neural recordings of brain activity are a powerful technique that is increasingly uncovering new aspects of neural communication, computation, and prosthetic interfaces. However, while silicon CMOS devices continue to scale rapidly in number and power in planar geometries, this scaling has not been followed for large-scale mapping along three dimensions. Here, we present a new strategy to interface CMOS-based devices with a three-dimensional microwire array, providing the link between rapidly-developing electronics, and high density neural interfaces. The system consists of a bundle of insulated and spaced microwires perpendicularly mated to a commercial large-scale CMOS microelectrode array, such as a camera chip. The modular nature of the design enables a variety of microwire types and sizes to be integrated with different types of silicon-based arrays, allowing channel counts to be scaled from a few dozen to thousands of electrodes using the same fundamental platform. This system has excellent recording performance, demonstrated via single unit and local-field potential recordings in isolated retina, and in the motor cortex and striatum of awake moving mice. This concept links the rapid progress and power of commercial multiplexing, digitisation and data acquisition hardware together with a three-dimensional neural interface.

Neurodevelopmental disorders are a major public health concern but remain poorly understood in biological terms. In particular, although we know that genetically-distinct neurodevelopmental disorders induce distinct changes in regional brain anatomy, we do not understand how such specificity arises. Here, by leveraging diverse neurodevelopmental disorders of known genetic origin, we show that this specificity can be explained by cell-type dependent gradients of gene expression that are evident in the healthy brain. We first used in vivo structural neuroimaging to map altered cortical organization in neurodevelopmental disorders arising due to 6 different genomic copy number variation (CNV) disorders, including both duplications (chromosomes X, Y and 21) and deletions (X-chromosome, 22q11.2, 11p13). Comparisons with publicly-available postmortem gene expression maps from healthy adults revealed that the spatial pattern of anatomical change in each disorder was preferentially associated with the spatial expression profile for genes within the causal CNV region. Next, by gathering a comprehensive set of single-cell gene expression signatures, and using normative postmortem data to map expression gradients for each canonical cell class in the brain, we identified specific cell-classes that expressed CNV genes and closely tracked the spatial pattern of cortical disruption in each disorder (e.g. NCAM2-expressing oligodendrocyte precursors in Down syndrome, MAPK1-expressing inhibitory neurons in del22q11, PTCHD1-expressing astrocytes in X-chromosome aneuploidies). Finally, we used two orthogonal approaches to validate our imaging-transcriptomic associations against direct measures of altered gene expression in tissue from CNV carriers. First, we demonstrated that CNV genes with differential dosage sensitivity in patients show patterns of brain expression that were differentially correlated with cortical disruption. Second, we established that CNV patients with more severely disrupted gene expression in blood-derived tissue show more extreme cortical disruption in brain MRI. Thus, cell-type dependent gradients of gene expression that are intrinsic to the human brain can be used to infer disease-specific drivers of regional brain vulnerability without reference to any postmortem brain tissue in patients. Furthermore, this "transcriptional vulnerability model" for prediction of regional neuroanatomical disruption makes it possible to estimate the severity of altered brain organization in a given patient from the severity of altered gene expression in their blood.

Male and female animals display innate sex-specific mating behaviors. Among vertebrates, teleosts are unique in that altering the adult sex steroid milieu can reverse sex-typical mating behaviors, suggesting sexual lability of their brains. In the teleost medaka, neuropeptide B (NPB) is expressed female-specifically in the brain nuclei implicated in mating behavior. Here, we demonstrate that NPB is a direct mediator of estrogen action on female mating behavior, acting in a female-specific but reversible manner. Analysis of regulatory mechanisms revealed that the female-specific expression of NPB is dependent on direct transcriptional activation by estrogen via an estrogen-responsive element and is reversed in response to changes in the adult sex steroid milieu. Behavioral studies of NPB knockouts revealed that female-specific NBP mediates female receptivity to male courtship. The female-specific NPB signaling identified herein is presumably a critical element of the neural circuitry underlying sexual dimorphism and lability of mating behaviors in teleosts.

Modulation of sensory perception by homeostatic feedback from physiological states is central to innate purposive behaviours. Olfaction is an important predictive modality for feeding-related behaviours and its modulation has been associated with hunger-satiety states. However, the mechanisms mapping internal states to chemosensory processing in order to modify behaviour are poorly understood. In the zebrafish olfactory epithelium, a subset of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and the terminal nerve projections express neuropeptide Y (NPY). We find that NPY signalling in the peripheral olfactory system of zebrafish is correlated with its nutritional state and is both necessary and sufficient for the olfactory perception of food related odorants. NPY activity dynamically modulates the microvillar OSN activation thresholds and acts cooperatively with amino acid signalling resulting in a switch-like increase in OSN sensitivity in starved animals. We suggest that cooperative activation of phospholipase C by convergent signalling from NPY and amino acid receptors is central to this heightened sensitivity. This study provides ethologically relevant, physiological evidence for NPY signalling in peripheral modulation of OSN sensitivity to food-associated amino acid cues. We demonstrate sensory gating directly at the level of OSNs and identify a novel mechanistic framework for tuning olfactory sensitivity to prevailing energy states.

Neural information flow is inherently directional. To date, investigation of directional communication in the human structural connectome has been precluded by the inability of non-invasive neuroimaging methods to resolve axonal directionality. Here, we demonstrate that decentralized measures of network communication, applied to the undirected topology and geometry of brain networks, can predict putative directions of large-scale neural signalling. We propose the concept of send-receive communication asymmetry to characterize cortical regions as senders, receivers or neutral, based on differences between their incoming and outgoing communication efficiencies. Our results reveal a send-receive cortical hierarchy that recapitulates established organizational gradients differentiating sensory-motor and multimodal areas. We find that send-receive asymmetries are significantly associated with the directionality of effective connectivity derived from spectral dynamic causal modeling. Finally, using fruit fly, mouse and macaque connectomes, we provide further evidence suggesting that directionality of neural signalling is significantly encoded in the undirected architecture of nervous systems.

Nanoscale distribution of proteins and their relative positioning within a defined subcellular region are key to their physiological functions. Thanks to the super-resolution imaging methods, especially the single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), mapping the three-dimensional distribution of multiple proteins has been easier and more efficient than ever. In spite of the many tools available for efficient localization detection and image rendering, it has been a challenge to quantitatively analyze the 3D distribution and relative positioning of proteins in these SMLM data. Here, using the heterogeneously distributed synaptic proteins as examples, we describe in detail a series of analytical methods including detection of nanoscale density clusters, quantification of the trans-synaptic alignment between these protein densities, and automatic enface projection and averaging. These analyses were performed within customized Matlab routines and we make the full scripts available. The concepts behind these analytical methods and the scripts can be adapted for quantitative analysis of spatial organization of other macromolecular complexes.

In Sullivan et al. (2015), mouse-tracking was used in a food choice paradigm to test two related hypotheses: 1) that there are differences in the relative speed with which the decision-making circuitry computes and weights the value of attributes like health and taste; and, 2) that individual differences in these relative speeds are associated with individual differences in the ability to make healthy dietary choices. Regression analysis of the mouse-tracking paths found that health became significantly predictive of the mouse's angle of movement ~195 ms later than taste, on average. Moreover, individual dietary self-control varied with estimates of the individual differences in the relative speed with which taste (tTaste) and health (tHealth) entered the decision-making process. Similar results have been found in other studies, including Lim et al. (2018) and the new data presented in Zhang et al. (2018). However, Zhang et al. (2018) argue that the conclusions of the previous work are flawed due to problems with the methods used in the previous literature. Here, we respond to each of their points. Among other results, we find that the central analysis technique used by Zhang et al. (2018) eliminates the difference in tTaste and tHealth even when it is built into a simulated dataset.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/572818v1?rss=1">Intracranial functional haemodynamic relationships in patients with cerebral small vessel disease</a></h4>

Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a major cause of stroke and dementia. The underlying cerebrovascular dysfunction is poorly understood. We investigated cerebrovascular reactivity, blood flow, vascular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsatility, and their independent relationship to SVD features, in patients with minor ischaemic stroke and MRI evidence of SVD. Methods: We recruited patients with minor ischaemic stroke and assessed CVR using Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI during a hypercapnic challenge, cerebral blood flow, vascular and CSF pulsatility using phase contrast MRI, and structural MR brain imaging to quantify white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and perivascular spaces (PVS). We quantified CVR in seven white matter and six subcortical grey matter regions, measured blood flow in carotid and vertebral arteries, intracranial venous sinuses, internal jugular veins and CSF flow at the aqueduct and foramen magnum. We used multiple regression to identify SVD features, blood flow and pulsatility parameters associated with CVR, controlling for patient characteristics. Results: In 53 of 60 patients with complete data (age 68.0+/-8.8, 74% male, 75% hypertensive), CVR in grey and white matter decreased with increasing blood pressure (BP, respectively -0.001%/mmHg, p=0.01 and -0.006%/mmHg, p=0.01, per mmHg increase in BP). After controlling for age, gender and systolic BP, white matter CVR decreased with increasing WMH volume (-0.01%/mmHg per log10 increase in WMH volume, p=0.02) and basal ganglia PVS (-0.01%/mmHg per point increase in PVS score, p=0.02). White matter CVR decreased with increasing venous pulsatility (superior sagittal sinus -0.03%/mmHg, p=0.02, per unit increase in pulsatility index) but not with cerebral blood flow (p=0.58). Lower foramen magnum CSF stroke volume was associated with worse white matter CVR (0.04%/mmHg per ml increase in stroke volume, p=0.04) and increased basal ganglia PVS. Conclusions: Contemporaneous assessment of CVR, intracranial vascular and CSF pulsatility demonstrates important interrelationships of these vascular functions in humans. Decreased CVR, increased venous pulsatility and reduced foramen magnum CSF stroke volume suggests that dynamic vascular dysfunctions underpin PVS dysfunction and WMH development. Improved understanding of microvascular dysfunction and CSF dynamics offers new intervention targets to reduce SVD lesion development and their impact on cognitive dysfunction and stroke.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/572792v1?rss=1">Motor context coordinates visually guided walking in Drosophila</a></h4>

Course control is critical for the acquisition of spatial information during exploration and navigation, and it is thought to rely on neural circuits that process locomotive-related multimodal signals. However, which circuits underlie this control, and how multimodal information contributes to the control system are questions poorly understood. We used Virtual Reality to examine the role of self-generated visual signals (visual feedback) on the control of exploratory walking in flies. Exploratory flies display two distinct motor contexts, characterized by low speed and fast rotations, or by high speed and slow rotations, respectively. Flies use visual feedback to control body rotations, but in a motor-context specific manner, primarily when walking at high speed. Different populations of visual motion-sensitive cells estimate body rotations via congruent, multimodal inputs, and drive compensatory rotations. However, their effective contribution to course control is dynamically tuned by a speed-related signal. Our data identifies visual networks with a multimodal circuit mechanism for adaptive course control and suggests models for how visual feedback is combined with internal signals to guide exploratory course control.

The lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus (LCIC) is parcellated into two neurochemical compartments: one that comprises periodic neurochemical modules rich in GABAergic and cholinergic terminals and an extramodular matrix rich in calretinin neurons. We recently found that projections from auditory structures (auditory cortex and central nucleus of the IC) target the extramodular matrix, while somatosensory structures (somatosensory cortex and dorsal column nuclei) target the modules. What is peculiar about this finding of segregated inputs is that previous work has found that many LCIC neurons respond to both auditory and somatosensory stimuli. To investigate how these pathways interact, here we use laser photostimulation of caged glutamate to interrogate local LCIC circuits in brain slices from mouse. We found that most cell types in the LCIC receive inputs only from their home domain, but that GABAergic neurons in the modules serve as a bridge between modules and extramodular space. Further, we found that residence in- or out- of a module strongly predicted the output connectivity of that cell. These data suggest that distinct processing streams are seen in the LCIC and that GABAergic cells in modules serve to link these streams.

The role of the lymphatic system in brain function and/or dysfunction has long been an enigma. However, recent reports that meningeal lymphatic vessels exist within the mouse and human brain, as well as evidence that mouse meningeal lymphatic vessels play a role in clearing the toxic amyloid-beta peptide connected with Alzheimer disease (AD), may herald novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. Here, we explore new evidence connecting the lymphatic system of the brain with AD. In particular, we focus on new findings showing that meningeal lymphatic vessels play a role in drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and egress of immune cells from the brain, and that disrupting this vessel system may lead to accumulation of amyloid - beta peptide and cognitive dysfunction. We also discuss the hypothesis that apolipoprotein E isoform e4 (APO E4)-the leading genetic risk for developing AD- is involved in meningeal lymphatic vessel function. By reanalyzing previously published RNA-Seq data, we show that APO E4 knock-in microglia cells express lower levels of genes representing lymphatic markers (a phenomenon we call attenuated lymphaticness) and of genes in which functional missense mutations are linked to lymphedema. Accordingly, we propose the hypothesis that APO E4 is involved in the shrinkage of lymphatic vessels. This notion could lead, if verified by additional anatomic and mechanistic data, to the concept that APO E4-related AD (such as in late onset AD or trisomy 21-related AD) is related to lymphosclerosis coupled with lymphedema.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/534115v1?rss=1">Immediate and deferred epigenomic signature of neuronal activation</a></h4>

Activity-driven transcription plays an important role in many brain processes, including those underlying memory and epilepsy. Here, we combine the genetic tagging of neuronal nuclei and ribosomes with various sequencing-based techniques to investigate the transcriptional and chromatin changes occurring at hippocampal excitatory neurons upon synchronous activation during status epilepticus and sparse activation during novel context exploration. The transcriptional burst, which affects both nucleus-resident non-coding RNAs and numerous protein-coding genes involved in neuroplasticity, is associated with a dramatic increase in chromatin accessibility of activity-regulated genes and enhancers, de novo binding of activity-regulated transcription factors, augmented promoter-enhancer interactions, and the formation of gene loops that bring together the TSS and TTS of strongly induced genes to sustain the fast re-loading of RNAPII complexes. Remarkably, some chromatin occupancy changes and interactions remain long after neuronal activation and may underlie the changes in neuronal responsiveness and circuit connectivity observed in these neuroplasticity paradigms.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCAs) affect up to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, leading to incoordination, tremor, and falls. Loss of Purkinje cells, nearly universal across DCAs, dysregulates the dentatothalamocortical network. To address the paucity of treatment strategies, we developed an electrical stimulation‐based therapy for DCAs targeting the dorsal dentate nucleus.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We tested this therapeutic strategy in the Wistar Furth <i>shaker</i> rat model of Purkinje cell loss resulting in tremor and ataxia. We implanted <i>shaker</i> rats with stimulating electrodes targeted to the dorsal dentate nucleus and tested a spectrum of frequencies ranging from 4 to 180 Hz.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stimulation at 30 Hz most effectively reduced motor symptoms. Stimulation frequencies over 100 Hz, commonly used for Parkinsonism and essential tremor, worsened incoordination, while frequencies within the tremor physiologic range may worsen tremor.</p>


<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>Low‐frequency deep cerebellar stimulation may provide a novel strategy for treating motor symptoms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To measure <i>postmortem</i> burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP‐43 (FTLD‐TDP) or tau (FTLD‐Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology, and identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD‐TDP=13, FTLD‐Tau=14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of <i>postmortem</i> pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to eight cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to <i>antemortem</i> structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>Postmortem</i> cortical pathology was left‐lateralized in both FTLD‐TDP (beta=‐0.15,SE=0.05,p=0.007) and FTLD‐Tau (beta=‐0.09,SE=0.04,p=0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta=‐8.18,SE=3.22,p=0.015). Among five core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD‐TDP, which was greater than in FTLD‐Tau (F=47.07,df=1,17,p&lt;0.001), and in left mid‐frontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD‐Tau, which was greater than in FTLD‐TDP (F=19.34,df=1,16,p&lt;0.001). <i>Postmortem</i> pathology was inversely associated with <i>antemortem</i> MRI cortical thickness (beta=‐0.04,SE=0.01,p=0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single‐word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t=‐3.72,df=10.72,p=0.004), while nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t=‐3.62,df=12.00,p=0.004) among the five core pathology regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In PPA, FTLD‐TDP and FTLD‐Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left‐lateralized <i>postmortem</i> pathology that relate to <i>antemortem</i> structural imaging and distinct language deficits. While other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve <i>antemortem</i> diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rates of worsening and evolution to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) may be substantially lower in actively treated patients compared to natural history studies from the pre‐treatment era. Nonetheless, in our recently reported prospective cohort more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated significant new disability by the 10<sup>th</sup> year of follow‐up. Notably, “no evidence of disease activity” at 2‐years did not predict long‐term stability. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to long‐term disability accumulation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Disability progression was defined as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0 or 0.5 (or greater) from baseline EDSS = 0; 1.0‐5.0; and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 (± 1 year) and sustained to year 10 (± 1 year). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex, age, disease duration, and <i>HLA‐DRB1*15:01</i> as covariates.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over one‐year intervals (<i>p</i> = 0.012) but not with confirmed disability progression (<i>p</i> = 0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with disability progression compared to those who remained stable (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Long term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is independent of relapse activity, and is associated with accelerated brain atrophy. We propose the term <i>silent progression</i> to describe the insidious disability that accrues in many patients who satisfy traditional criteria for relapsing remitting MS.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the optimal thresholds for inter‐eye differences in retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thicknesses for identifying unilateral optic nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis.</p>


<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Current international diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis do not include the optic nerve as a lesion site despite frequent involvement. Optical coherence tomography detects retinal thinning associated with optic nerve lesions.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multi‐center international study at 11 sites, optical coherence tomography was measured for patients and healthy controls as part of the International Multiple Sclerosis Visual System Consortium. High‐ and low‐contrast acuity were also collected in a subset of participants. Presence of an optic nerve lesion for this study was defined as history of acute unilateral optic neuritis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among patients (n=1,530), receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an optimal peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer inter‐eye difference threshold of 5 microns and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer threshold of 4 microns for identifying unilateral optic neuritis (n=477). Greater inter‐eye differences in acuities were associated with greater inter‐eye retinal layer thickness differences (<i>p</i>≤0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inter‐eye differences of 5 microns for retinal nerve fiber layer and 4 microns for macular ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer are robust thresholds for identifying unilateral optic nerve lesions. These thresholds may be useful to establish the presence of asymptomatic and symptomatic optic nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis and could be useful in a new version of the diagnostic criteria. Our findings lend further validation for utilizing the visual system in a multiple sclerosis clinical trial setting.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/573006v1?rss=1">Analytic Model of fMRI BOLD Signals for Separable Metrics of Neural and Metabolic Activity</a></h4>

The applications of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) are broad covering diagnostic and clinical extents of brain function, which involves the analysis of BOLD (blood oxygen level-dependent) contrast signals. The BOLD signals are sourced from both neural and metabolic functions, and thus to enable a detailed examination of fMRI studies, methods are sought to separate the neural and metabolic functions, such that the neural component, which is often the metric of interest, can be independently examined, especially in relation to neural connectivity. In this work, a modeling approach is developed that separates the neural and metabolic functions from the overall BOLD signal. The newly developed model is initially developed within a linear framework and demonstrates excellent comparison in data fit at 97.4% to the three Gamma function, which has been widely used to characterize fMRI BOLD experimental data. The neural component of the model formulation is comprised of a proper transfer function of two poles and two zeros, and characterizes the salient features of the BOLD signal, including the initial dip, peak, undershoot, and stabilization period. The linear model is extended to characterize nonlinear fMRI BOLD signal responses through the integration of saturation functions to both the leading and trailing edges of the signal. The nonlinear model representation not only explains the muted response in amplitude and oscillations, but also explains nuanced oscillations during the hold and settling phases of fMRI BOLD responses as exemplified in comparison to published data of sensorimotor responses. Further, the newly developed decomposition is derived within a framework for modeling neurovascular coupling environments, and thus lends credibility to the modeling framework. In developing the decomposition of the neural and metabolic transfer functions, it is a conclusion that the BOLD signal correlates very well with the fast dynamics associated with neural response to external stimuli.

The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) is a forebrain region highly sensitive to stress that expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neuropeptide at high levels and regulates negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety. However, how chronic stress modulates CRH signaling and neuronal activity in BNST remains unknown. We subjected C57BL6/J mice to a 6-week chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) paradigm and investigated the effects on behavior, BNST cellular neurophysiology, and BNST CRH signaling. We also utilized pharmacological infusions and optogenetics to decipher and mimic the effects of CVMS on BNST cellular neurophysiology and behavior. CVMS elevated plasma corticosterone levels, induced negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety, diminished M-currents (voltage-gated K+ currents that stabilize membrane potential and regulate neuronal excitability), and increased mEPSC amplitude in ovBNST. Additionally, the number of c-fos+, CRH+, and CRH activator pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)+ cells were increased while CRH inhibitor striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP)+ cells were decreased in ovBNST. These expression data were confirmed with qPCR. CVMS also activated PKA in BNST and the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of CVMS were reversed by ovBNST infusion of the PKA-selective antagonist H89. Moreover, optogenetic activation of ovBNST directly induced negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety, mimicking the effects of CVMS. CVMS mediates effects on negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety by activating CRH signaling components and cellular excitability in ovBNST. Our findings decipher an important CRH-associated stress molecular signature in BNST and advance our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying stress-induced disorders.

Multi-scale computational modeling is a major branch of computational biology as evidenced by the US federal interagency Multi-Scale Modeling Consortium and major international projects. It invariably involves specific and detailed sequences of data analysis and simulation, often with multiple tools and datasets, and the community recognizes improved modularity, reuse, reproducibility, portability and scalability as critical unmet needs in this area. Scientific workflows are a well-recognized strategy for addressing these needs in scientific computing. While there are good examples if the use of scientific workflows in bioinformatics, medical informatics, biomedical imaging and data analysis, there are fewer examples in multi-scale computational modeling in general and cardiac electrophysiology in particular. Cardiac electrophysiology simulation is a mature area of multi-scale computational biology that serves as an excellent use case for developing and testing new scientific workflows. In this article, we develop, describe and test a computational workflow that serves as a proof of concept of a platform for the robust integration and implementation of a reusable and reproducible multi-scale cardiac cell and tissue model that is expandable, modular and portable. The workflow described leverages Python and Kepler-Python actor for plotting and pre/post-processing. During all stages of the workflow design, we rely on freely available open-source tools, to make our workflow freely usable by scientists.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iVBpJTia4EY" width="1" />

The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to produce desired compounds on an industrial scale in a cost effective manner. To address challenges in metabolic engineering, computational strain optimization algorithms based on genome-scale metabolic models have increasingly been used to aid in overproducing products of interest. However, most of these strain optimization algorithms utilize a metabolic network alone, with few approaches providing strategies that also include transcriptional regulation. Moreover previous integrated approaches generally require a pre-existing regulatory network. In this study, we developed a novel strain design algorithm, named OptRAM (Optimization of Regulatory And Metabolic Networks), which can identify combinatorial optimization strategies including overexpression, knockdown or knockout of both metabolic genes and transcription factors. OptRAM is based on our previous IDREAM integrated network framework, which makes it able to deduce a regulatory network from data. OptRAM uses simulated annealing with a novel objective function, which can ensure a favorable coupling between desired chemical and cell growth. The other advance we propose is a systematic evaluation metric of multiple solutions, by considering the essential genes, flux variation, and engineering manipulation cost. We applied OptRAM to generate strain designs for succinate, 2,3-butanediol, and ethanol overproduction in yeast, which predicted high minimum predicted target production rate compared with other methods and previous literature values. Moreover, most of the genes and TFs proposed to be altered by OptRAM in these scenarios have been validated by modification of the exact genes or the target genes regulated by the TFs, for overproduction of these desired compounds by <i>in vivo</i> experiments cataloged in the LASER database. Particularly, we successfully validated the predicted strain optimization strategy for ethanol production by fermentation experiment. In conclusion, OptRAM can provide a useful approach that leverages an integrated transcriptional regulatory network and metabolic network to guide metabolic engineering applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qYemLAl00uo" width="1" />

<p>by Andrea Avena-Koenigsberger, Xiaoran Yan, Artemy Kolchinsky, Martijn van den Heuvel, Patric Hagmann, Olaf Sporns</p>

Communication of signals among nodes in a complex network poses fundamental problems of efficiency and cost. Routing of messages along shortest paths requires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion, which operates according to local topological features, is informationally “cheap” but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network communication that combines local and global information about the network topology to generate biased random walks on the network. The model generates a continuous spectrum of dynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion) communication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two cohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying the global information bias on the network’s communication cost. We identify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path communication process with a relatively small global information bias on the system’s dynamics. Moreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes varies as a function of the global information bias driving the system’s dynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject differences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework departs from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, unifying both models under a single family of dynamical processes that differ by the extent to which global information about the network topology influences the routing patterns of neural signals traversing the network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ow07hxgdlFY" width="1" />

Management of vector population is a commonly used method for mitigating transmission of mosquito-borne infections, but quantitative information on its practical public health impact is scarce. We study the effectiveness of Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) insecticide spraying in public spaces for preventing secondary dengue virus (DENV) cases in Porto Alegre, a non-endemic metropolitan area in Brazil. We developed a stochastic transmission model based on detailed entomological, epidemiological and population data, accounting for the geographical distribution of mosquitoes and humans in the study area and spatial transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated against the distribution of DENV cluster sizes previously estimated from the same geographical setting. We estimated a ULV-induced mortality of 40% for mosquitoes and found that the implemented control protocol avoided about 24% of symptomatic cases occurred in the area throughout the 2015–2016 epidemic season. Increasing the radius of treatment or the mortality of mosquitoes by treating gardens and/or indoor premises would greatly improve the result of control, but trade-offs with respect to increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed. We found a moderate effectiveness for ULV-spraying in public areas, mainly due to the limited ability of this strategy in effectively controlling the vector population. These results can be used to support the design of control strategies in low-incidence, non-endemic settings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CKNKwFuw4ko" width="1" />

<p>by Lilith K. Whittles, Peter J. White, Xavier Didelot</p>

Human networks of sexual contacts are dynamic by nature, with partnerships forming and breaking continuously over time. Sexual behaviours are also highly heterogeneous, so that the number of partners reported by individuals over a given period of time is typically distributed as a power-law. Both the dynamism and heterogeneity of sexual partnerships are likely to have an effect in the patterns of spread of sexually transmitted diseases. To represent these two fundamental properties of sexual networks, we developed a stochastic process of dynamic partnership formation and dissolution, which results in power-law numbers of partners over time. Model parameters can be set to produce realistic conditions in terms of the exponent of the power-law distribution, of the number of individuals without relationships and of the average duration of relationships. Using an outbreak of antibiotic resistant gonorrhoea amongst men have sex with men as a case study, we show that our realistic dynamic network exhibits different properties compared to the frequently used static networks or homogeneous mixing models. We also consider an approximation to our dynamic network model in terms of a much simpler branching process. We estimate the parameters of the generation time distribution and offspring distribution which can be used for example in the context of outbreak reconstruction based on genomic data. Finally, we investigate the impact of a range of interventions against gonorrhoea, including increased condom use, more frequent screening and immunisation, concluding that the latter shows great promise to reduce the burden of gonorrhoea, even if the vaccine was only partially effective or applied to only a random subset of the population.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GeqSrTgTJqU" width="1" />

<p>by Agustin Lage-Castellanos, Giancarlo Valente, Elia Formisano, Federico De Martino</p>

Computational neuroimaging methods aim to predict brain responses (measured e.g. with functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) on the basis of stimulus features obtained through computational models. The accuracy of such prediction is used as an indicator of how well the model describes the computations underlying the brain function that is being considered. However, the prediction accuracy is bounded by the proportion of the variance of the brain response which is related to the measurement noise and not to the stimuli (or cognitive functions). This bound to the performance of a computational model has been referred to as the noise ceiling. In previous fMRI applications two methods have been proposed to estimate the noise ceiling based on either a split-half procedure or Monte Carlo simulations. These methods make different assumptions over the nature of the effects underlying the data, and, importantly, their relation has not been clarified yet. Here, we derive an analytical form for the noise ceiling that does not require computationally expensive simulations or a splitting procedure that reduce the amount of data. The validity of this analytical definition is proved in simulations, we show that the analytical solution results in the same estimate of the noise ceiling as the Monte Carlo method. Considering different simulated noise structure, we evaluate different estimators of the variance of the responses and their impact on the estimation of the noise ceiling. We furthermore evaluate the effect the interplay between regularization (often used to estimate model fits to the data when the number of computational features in the model is large) and model complexity on the performance with respect to the noise ceiling. Our results indicate that when considering the variance of the responses across runs, the computing the noise ceiling analytically results in similar estimates as the split half estimator and approaches the true noise ceiling under a variety of simulated noise scenarios. Finally, the methods are tested on real fMRI data acquired at 7 Tesla.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EvcjzeEKdD4" width="1" />

Model simulations indicate that the response of growing cell populations on mechanical stress follows the same functional relationship and is predictable over different cell lines and growth conditions despite the response curves look largely different. We develop a hybrid model strategy in which cells are represented by coarse-grained individual units calibrated with a high resolution cell model and parameterized measurable biophysical and cell-biological parameters. Cell cycle progression in our model is controlled by volumetric strain, the latter being derived from a bio-mechanical relation between applied pressure and cell compressibility. After parameter calibration from experiments with mouse colon carcinoma cells growing against the resistance of an elastic alginate capsule, the model adequately predicts the growth curve in i) soft and rigid capsules, ii) in different experimental conditions where the mechanical stress is generated by osmosis via a high molecular weight dextran solution, and iii) for other cell types with different growth kinetics. Our model simulation results suggest that the growth response of cell population upon externally applied mechanical stress is the same, as it can be quantitatively predicted using the same growth progression function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IDBZAvqfb9o" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ocIV_rplJgY/article">How adaptive plasticity evolves when selected against</a></h4>

<p>by Alfredo Rago, Kostas Kouvaris, Tobias Uller, Richard Watson</p>

Adaptive plasticity allows organisms to cope with environmental change, thereby increasing the population’s long-term fitness. However, individual selection can only compare the fitness of individuals within each generation: if the environment changes more slowly than the generation time (i.e., a coarse-grained environment) a population will not experience selection for plasticity even if it is adaptive in the long-term. How does adaptive plasticity then evolve? One explanation is that, if competing alleles conferring different degrees of plasticity persist across multiple environments, natural selection between genetic lineages could select for adaptive plasticity (lineage selection). We show that adaptive plasticity can evolve even in the absence of such lineage selection. Instead, we propose that adaptive plasticity in coarse-grained environments evolves as a by-product of inefficient short-term natural selection: populations that rapidly evolve their phenotypes in response to selective pressures follow short-term optima, with the result that they have reduced long-term fitness across environments. Conversely, populations that accumulate limited genetic change within each environment evolve long-term adaptive plasticity even when plasticity incurs short-term costs. These results remain qualitatively similar regardless of whether we decrease the efficiency of natural selection by increasing the rate of environmental change or decreasing mutation rate, demonstrating that both factors act via the same mechanism. We demonstrate how this mechanism can be understood through the concept of learning rate. Our work shows how plastic responses that are costly in the short term, yet adaptive in the long term, can evolve as a by-product of inefficient short-term selection, without selection for plasticity at either the individual or lineage level.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ocIV_rplJgY" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<i>Bdnf</i>) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of <i>Bdnf</i> regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient <i>in vivo</i>, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R">Functional deficiency in endogenous interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist in patients with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We recently reported successful treatment of a child with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), a subtype of new onset refractory status epilepticus, with the recombinant interleukin‐1 (IL1) receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous IL1RA production or function is deficient in FIRES patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Levels of IL1β and IL1RA were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The inhibitory activity of endogenous IL1RA was assessed using a cell‐based reporter assay. <i>IL1RN</i> gene variants were identified by sequencing. Expression levels for the secreted and intracellular isoforms of IL1RA were measured in patient and control cells by real‐time polymerase chain reaction.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of endogenous IL1RA and IL1β were elevated in the serum and CSF of patients with FIRES (n = 7) relative to healthy controls (n = 10). Serum from FIRES patients drove IL1R signaling activity and potentiated IL1R signaling in response to exogenous IL1β in a cell‐based reporter assay. Functional assessment of endogenous IL1RA activity in 3 FIRES patients revealed attenuated inhibition of IL1R signaling. Sequencing of <i>IL1RN</i> in our index patient revealed multiple variants. This was accompanied by reduced expression of intracellular but not secreted isoforms of IL1RA in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that FIRES is associated with reduced expression of intracellular IL1RA isoforms and a functional deficiency in IL1RA inhibitory activity. These observations may provide insight into disease pathogenesis for FIRES and other inflammatory seizure disorders and may provide a valuable biomarker for therapeutic decision‐making.

<p>As put forward by neuroscientists, the mechanisms of consciousness can be
elucidated by revealing correlations between neural dynamics and specific
conscious percepts. Recently, I have elaborated on the mathematical formulation
for a system of processes that are mutually connected to be isomorphic to a
conscious percept of a point in space. Importantly, in such a system, any
process can be derived through all other processes that form its complement, or
interpretation. To generate such a solution, I am proposing a dynamical system
of oscillators coupled in a manner to preserve the properties of a percept.
Specifically, I crafted a dynamical system that retains the mutual
relationships among processes, forming an operational map isomorphic to a
distance matrix that mimics a percept of space-like properties. The study and
results pave a novel way to analyze the dynamics of neural-like (oscillatory)
processes with a purpose of extracting the information relevant to specific
conscious percepts, which will facilitate the search for neural correlates of
consciousness.

<p>The olfactory system uses the responses of a small number of broadly
sensitive receptors to combinatorially encode a vast number of odors. Here, we
propose a method for decoding such a distributed representation. Our main idea
is that a receptor that does not respond to an odor carries more information
than a receptor that does, because a typical receptor binds to many odorants.
So a response below threshold signals the absence of all such odorants. As a
result, it is easier to identify what the odor is not, rather than what the
odor is. We demonstrate that, for biologically realistic numbers of receptors,
response functions, and odor mixture complexity, this remarkably simple method
of elimination turns an underdetermined decoding problem into an overdetermined
one, allowing accurate determination of the odorants in a mixture and their
concentrations. We give a simple neural network realization of our algorithm
which resembles the known circuit architecture of the piriform cortex.

Surface-attached bacterial communities called biofilms display a diversity of morphologies. Although structural and regulatory components required for biofilm formation are known, it is not understood how these essential constituents promote biofilm surface morphology. Here, using <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> as our model system, we combine mechanical measurements, theory and simulation, quantitative image analyses, surface energy characterizations, and mutagenesis to show that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie the morphogenesis program of growing biofilms. We also identify interfacial energy as a key driving force for mechanomorphogenesis because it dictates the generation/annihilation of new/existing interfaces. Finally, we discover feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion, which shapes the overall biofilm contour. The morphogenesis principles we discover in bacterial biofilms, relying on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies, should be generally applicable to morphogenesis processes in tissues in higher organisms.

<p>by Ramu Anandakrishnan, Robin T. Varghese, Nicholas A. Kinney, Harold R. Garner</p>

Individual instances of cancer are primarily a result of a combination of a small number of genetic mutations (hits). Knowing the number of such mutations is a prerequisite for identifying specific combinations of carcinogenic mutations and understanding the etiology of cancer. We present a mathematical model for estimating the number of hits based on the distribution of somatic mutations. The model is fundamentally different from previous approaches, which are based on cancer incidence by age. Our somatic mutation based model is likely to be more robust than age-based models since it does not require knowing or accounting for the highly variable mutation rate, which can vary by over three orders of magnitude. In fact, we find that the number of somatic mutations at diagnosis is weakly correlated with age at cancer diagnosis, most likely due to the extreme variability in mutation rates between individuals. Comparing the distribution of somatic mutations predicted by our model to the actual distribution from 6904 tumor samples we estimate the number of hits required for carcinogenesis for 17 cancer types. We find that different cancer types exhibit distinct somatic mutational profiles corresponding to different numbers of hits. Why might different cancer types require different numbers of hits for carcinogenesis? The answer may provide insight into the unique etiology of different cancer types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lXznQOD3I34" width="1" />

<p>by Solveig Engebretsen, Kenth Engø-Monsen, Arnoldo Frigessi, Birgitte Freiesleben de Blasio</p>

The world is continuously urbanising, resulting in clusters of densely populated urban areas and more sparsely populated rural areas. We propose a method for generating spatial fields with controllable levels of clustering of the population. We build a synthetic country, and use this method to generate versions of the country with different clustering levels. Combined with a metapopulation model for infectious disease spread, this allows us to in silico explore how urbanisation affects infectious disease spread. In a baseline scenario with no interventions, the underlying population clustering seems to have little effect on the final size and timing of the epidemic. Under within-country restrictions on non-commuting travel, the final size decreases with increased population clustering. The effect of travel restrictions on reducing the final size is larger with higher clustering. The reduction is larger in the more rural areas. Within-country travel restrictions delay the epidemic, and the delay is largest for lower clustering levels. We implemented three different vaccination strategies—uniform vaccination (in space), preferentially vaccinating urban locations and preferentially vaccinating rural locations. The urban and uniform vaccination strategies were most effective in reducing the final size, while the rural vaccination strategy was clearly inferior. Visual inspection of some European countries shows that many countries already have high population clustering. In the future, they will likely become even more clustered. Hence, according to our model, within-country travel restrictions are likely to be less and less effective in delaying epidemics, while they will be more effective in decreasing final sizes. In addition, to minimise final sizes, it is important not to neglect urban locations when distributing vaccines. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the effect of urbanisation on infectious disease spread and in particular, to examine effectiveness of prevention measures as a function of urbanisation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uODzDXo-hSs" width="1" />

<p>by Yujie Ye, Xin Kang, Jordan Bailey, Chunhe Li, Tian Hong</p>

Multistep cell fate transitions with stepwise changes of transcriptional profiles are common to many developmental, regenerative and pathological processes. The multiple intermediate cell lineage states can serve as differentiation checkpoints or branching points for channeling cells to more than one lineages. However, mechanisms underlying these transitions remain elusive. Here, we explored gene regulatory circuits that can generate multiple intermediate cellular states with stepwise modulations of transcription factors. With unbiased searching in the network topology space, we found a motif family containing a large set of networks can give rise to four attractors with the stepwise regulations of transcription factors, which limit the reversibility of three consecutive steps of the lineage transition. We found that there is an enrichment of these motifs in a transcriptional network controlling the early T cell development, and a mathematical model based on this network recapitulates multistep transitions in the early T cell lineage commitment. By calculating the energy landscape and minimum action paths for the T cell model, we quantified the stochastic dynamics of the critical factors in response to the differentiation signal with fluctuations. These results are in good agreement with experimental observations and they suggest the stable characteristics of the intermediate states in the T cell differentiation. These dynamical features may help to direct the cells to correct lineages during development. Our findings provide general design principles for multistep cell linage transitions and new insights into the early T cell development. The network motifs containing a large family of topologies can be useful for analyzing diverse biological systems with multistep transitions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z8cA0oCWaps" width="1" />

The unique capability of acetogens to ferment a broad range of substrates renders them ideal candidates for the biotechnological production of commodity chemicals. In particular the ability to grow with H<sub>2</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> or syngas (a mixture of H<sub>2</sub>/CO/CO<sub>2</sub>) makes these microorganisms ideal chassis for sustainable bioproduction. However, advanced design strategies for acetogens are currently hampered by incomplete knowledge about their physiology and our inability to accurately predict phenotypes. Here we describe the reconstruction of a novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) to gain new insights into the biology of the model acetogen <i>Clostridium ljungdahlii</i>. The model represents the first ME-model of a Gram-positive bacterium and captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways as well as pathways to synthesis RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions, thus significantly broadens the scope and predictability. Use of the model revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in acetogens and accurately predicted secretion of multiple fermentation products. Predicting overflow metabolism is of particular interest since it enables new design strategies, e.g. the formation of glycerol, a novel product for <i>C</i>. <i>ljungdahlii</i>, thus broadening the metabolic capability for this model microbe. Furthermore, prediction and experimental validation of changing secretion rates based on different metal availability opens the window into fermentation optimization and provides new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FiJEGomjq_Q" width="1" />

<p>by Enrico Riccardi, Eva C. van Mastbergen, William Wiley Navarre, Jocelyne Vreede</p>

Bacteria contain several nucleoid-associated proteins that organize their genomic DNA into the nucleoid by bending, wrapping or bridging DNA. The Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring protein H-NS found in many Gram-negative bacteria is a DNA bridging protein and can structure DNA by binding to two separate DNA duplexes or to adjacent sites on the same duplex, depending on external conditions. Several nucleotide sequences have been identified to which H-NS binds with high affinity, indicating H-NS prefers AT-rich DNA. To date, highly detailed structural information of the H-NS DNA complex remains elusive. Molecular simulation can complement experiments by modelling structures and their time evolution in atomistic detail. In this paper we report an exploration of the different binding modes of H-NS to a high affinity nucleotide sequence and an estimate of the associated rate constant. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we identified three types of binding for H-NS to AT-rich DNA. To further sample the transitions between these binding modes, we performed Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling, providing predictions of the mechanism and rate constant of H-NS binding to DNA. H-NS interacts with the DNA through a conserved QGR motif, aided by a conserved arginine at position 93. The QGR motif interacts first with phosphate groups, followed by the formation of hydrogen bonds between acceptors in the DNA minor groove and the sidechains of either Q112 or R114. After R114 inserts into the minor groove, the rest of the QGR motif follows. Full insertion of the QGR motif in the minor groove is stable over several tens of nanoseconds, and involves hydrogen bonds between the bases and both backbone and sidechains of the QGR motif. The rate constant for the process of H-NS binding to AT-rich DNA resulting in full insertion of the QGR motif is in the order of 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, which is rate limiting compared to the non-specific association of H-NS to the DNA backbone at a rate of 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Keb-wJEJOyo" width="1" />

<p>by Maxim Shapovalov, Slobodan Vucetic, Roland L. Dunbrack Jr.</p>

Protein loops connect regular secondary structures and contain 4-residue beta turns which represent 63% of the residues in loops. The commonly used classification of beta turns (Type I, I’, II, II’, VIa1, VIa2, VIb, and VIII) was developed in the 1970s and 1980s from analysis of a small number of proteins of average resolution, and represents only two thirds of beta turns observed in proteins (with a generic class Type IV representing the rest). We present a new clustering of beta-turn conformations from a set of 13,030 turns from 1074 ultra-high resolution protein structures (≤1.2 Å). Our clustering is derived from applying the DBSCAN and <i>k</i>-medoids algorithms to this data set with a metric commonly used in directional statistics applied to the set of dihedral angles from the second and third residues of each turn. We define 18 turn types compared to the 8 classical turn types in common use. We propose a new 2-letter nomenclature for all 18 beta-turn types using Ramachandran region names for the two central residues (e.g., ‘A’ and ‘D’ for alpha regions on the left side of the Ramachandran map and ‘a’ and ‘d’ for equivalent regions on the right-hand side; classical Type I turns are ‘AD’ turns and Type I’ turns are ‘ad’). We identify 11 new types of beta turn, 5 of which are sub-types of classical beta-turn types. Up-to-date statistics, probability densities of conformations, and sequence profiles of beta turns in loops were collected and analyzed. A library of turn types, <i>BetaTurnLib18</i>, and cross-platform software, <i>BetaTurnTool18</i>, which identifies turns in an input protein structure, are freely available and redistributable from dunbrack.fccc.edu/betaturn and github.com/sh-maxim/BetaTurn18. Given the ubiquitous nature of beta turns, this comprehensive study updates understanding of beta turns and should also provide useful tools for protein structure determination, refinement, and prediction programs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2NBgqCJBoMk" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense <i>SCN1A</i> variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well‐defined genotype–phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than typical <i>SCN1A</i> Dravet syndrome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive action potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neurons. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>From a biophysical perspective, the T226M mutation produces gain of function. Somewhat paradoxically, our data suggest that this gain of function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This “functional dominant negative” interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence corroborates the role of the “central vein sign” in the radiological diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we report human MRI‐pathological data that inflammation‐dependent intracerebral remodeling of the vessel wall is directly associated with the prominence of intralesional veins on susceptibility‐based MRI. In adult marmosets with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), vessel‐wall fibrosis was detected early in the demyelinating process, even in lesions less than two weeks old, though fibrosis was more evident after 6 weeks. Vascular remodeling consisted of both luminal enlargement and eccentric thickening of the perivascular space (fibrillar collagen type I deposition) and affected almost exclusively white matter, but not subpial cortical, lesions. The long‐term effect of vessel remodeling in MS lesions is currently unknown, but it might potentially affect tissue repair.</p>

Abstract<p>The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is a putative integrative region that contributes to body fluid balance. Activation of the MnPO can influence thirst but it is not clear how these responses are linked to body fluid homeostasis. We used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to determine the role of the MnPO in drinking behavior and vasopressin release in response to peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) or 3% hypertonic saline in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stereotaxically injected with an inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-hM4D(G<sub>i</sub>)-mCherry) or control (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-mCherry) virus in the MnPO. After 2 weeks’ recovery, a subset of rats were used for extracellular recordings to verify functional effects of ANG II or hyperosmotic challenges in MnPO slice preparations. Remaining rats were used in drinking behavior studies. Each rat was administered either 10mg/kg of exogenous clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to inhibit DREADD-expressing cells or vehicle ip followed by a test treatment with either 2mg/kg ANG II or 3% hypertonic saline (1mL/100g bw) sc, twice per week for two separate treatment weeks. CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment significantly attenuated drinking responses compared to vehicle treatments and controls. Brain tissue processed for cFos immunohistochemistry showed decreased expression with CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment in the MnPO and downstream nuclei compared to controls. CNO-mediated inhibition significantly attenuated treatment-induced increases in plasma vasopressin compared to controls. The results indicate inhibition of CaMKIIa-expressing MnPO neurons significantly reduces drinking and vasopressin release in response to ANG II or hyperosmotic challenge.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The MnPO is an important regulatory center that influences thirst, cardiovascular and neuroendocrine function. Activation of different MnPO neuronal populations can inhibit or stimulate water intake. However, the role of the MnPO and its pathway-specific projections during ANG II and hyperosmotic challenges still have not yet been fully elucidated. These studies directly address this by using DREADDs to acutely and selectively inhibit pathway-specific MnPO neurons, and uses techniques that measure changes at the protein, neuronal, and overall physiological and behavioral level. More importantly, we have been able to demonstrate that physiological challenges related to extracellular (ANG II) or cellular (hypertonic saline) dehydration activate MnPO neurons that may project to different parts of the hypothalamus.</p>

Abstract<p>Fibroblast growth factor receptor and α-Klotho transduce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) signaling in renal tubules to maintain systemic phosphate/Vitamin D homeostasis. Mice deficient for either the ligand, FGF-23, or the co-receptor, Klotho, are phenocopies with both showing rapid and premature development of multiple aging-like abnormalities. Such similarity in phenotype, suggests that FGF-23 and Klotho have co-dependent systemic functions. Recent reports revealed inverse central nervous system effects of Klotho deficiency or Klotho overexpression on hippocampal synaptic, neurogenic, and cognitive functions. However, it is unknown whether FGF-23 deficiency effects function of the hippocampus. We report that, similar to Klotho-deficient mice, FGF-23-deficient mice develop dose-dependent, hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment. However, FGF-23-deficient brains had no gross structural or developmental defects, no change in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and only minor impairment to postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. Together these data provide evidence that FGF-23 deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognition but otherwise results in a brain phenotype that is distinct from the KL-deficient mouse.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Although FGF-23 is reportedly expressed by the brain, it has no known brain function. In the periphery, kidney transduction of FGF-23 signaling is required for proper phosphate, calcium and Vitamin D homeostasis. Recent reports show that Klotho, the obligate FGF-23 co-receptor, is required for multiple hippocampal activities. If Klotho-deficient brain effects are the result of disrupted FGF-23 signaling, similar phenotypes may occur under conditions of FGF-23 deficiency. Herein, studies were undertaken to determine whether FGF-23-deficient mice show impairment of the same hippocampal functions, as a first step toward investigating whether FGF-23 is the mechanism by which Klotho effects brain function. Our data show that FGF-23 is only required for normal hippocampal-dependent cognition suggesting that FGF-23 may effect the brain uniquely.</p>

Abstract<p>In the epileptic brain, phase amplitude cross frequency coupling (CFC) features have been used to objectively classify seizure-related states, and the inter-seizure state has been demonstrated as being random, in contrast to the seizure state being predictable; however, the excitatory and inhibitory networks underlying their dynamics remain unclear. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to classify the dynamics of seizure sub-states labeling seizure-like event (SLE) onset and termination intervals using CFC features and to obtain their underlying excitatory/inhibitory cellular correlates. SLEs were induced in mouse neocortical brain slices using a low-magnesium perfusate, and were recorded in layer II/III using simultaneous local field potential and whole cell voltage clamp electrodes. Classification of onset and termination of SLE transitions was investigated using CFC features in conjunction with an unsupervised 2-state hidden Markov model (HMM). Gamma distributions of their durations indicated that both are predictable. Furthermore, omitting 4Hz from the HMM classifier switched both SLE sub-states from statistically deterministic to random without changing the dynamics of the SLE state. These results were generalized to 4-AP induced SLEs and human seizure traces. Only during these sub-states, both excitatory and inhibitory currents coupled with the field. Where excitatory currents phase locked to a broad range of frequencies between 1 and 12Hz, inhibitory currents dominantly phase locked at 4Hz. We conclude that inhibition underlies the predictability of neocortical CFC-defined SLE transition sub-states.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> To date, the underlying excitatory and inhibitory bases of objectively identified seizure sub-states have not been determined. Here we identify these sub-states using phase amplitude cross frequency coupling features. This is tested in both human and rodent seizure models. Then, using simultaneous field and whole cell recordings in a mouse model, we investigate the potential for explaining seizure sub-state dynamics from interactions of the excitatory and inhibitory currents with local field network activity. We found that the frequency ranges at which these currents are coherent with field oscillations have a dramatic effect on the predictability of seizure state sub-states. Such information is critical for identifying the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of epileptic seizures.</p>

Abstract<p>Hilar mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) shape the firing and function of the hippocampal circuit. However, the neural circuitry providing afferent input to mossy cells is incompletely understood, and little is known about the development of these inputs. Thus, we used whole-cell recording and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to characterize the developmental trajectory of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to mossy cells in the mouse hippocampus. Hilar mossy cells were targeted by visualizing non-red fluorescent cells in the dentate hilus of GAD2-Cre; Ai9 mice, which expressed tdTomato in GAD+ neurons, and were confirmed by post hoc morphological characterization. Our results show that at postnatal days 6-7 (P6-7), mossy cells received more excitatory input from neurons in the proximal CA3 versus those in the DG. In contrast, at P13-14 and P21-28, the largest source of excitatory input originated in DG cells, while the strength of CA3 and hilar inputs declined. A developmental trend was also evident for inhibitory inputs. Overall inhibitory input at P6-7 was weak, while inhibitory inputs from the DG cell layer and the hilus predominated at P13-14 and P21-28. The strength of local DG excitation and inhibition to mossy cells peaked at P13-14 and decreased slightly in older P21-28 mice. Together, these data provide new detailed information on the development of local synaptic connectivity of mossy cells, and suggests mechanisms through which developmental changes in local circuit inputs to hilar mossy cells shape their physiology and vulnerability to injury during postnatal periods.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Mossy cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) have been implicated in hippocampal circuits regulating pattern separation, an important function attributed to the DG. However, physiological inputs regulating mossy cell activity are incompletely understood. Here, we show that sources of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs arise developmentally. Our results suggest that excitatory inputs from the DG and local inhibitory inputs are well-positioned to powerfully sculpt receptive fields in mature mossy cells.</p>

Abstract<p>Currently, there are no effective treatments for glioma or for neurodegenerative diseases due, in part, to our limited understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular heterogeneity of these diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. In a previous study, five molecularly distinct astrocyte subpopulations from three different brain regions were identified. To further delineate the underlying diversity of these populations, we obtained mouse brain region-specific gene signatures for both protein-coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and found that these astrocyte subpopulations are endowed with unique molecular signatures across diverse brain regions. Additional gene set and single-sample enrichment analyses revealed that gene signatures of different subpopulations are differentially correlated with glioma tumors that harbor distinct genomic alterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that links transcriptional profiles of astrocyte subpopulations with glioma genomic mutations. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that subpopulations of astrocytes in select brain regions are associated with specific neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, the present study provides a new perspective for understanding the pathophysiology of glioma and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the potential contributions of diverse astrocyte populations to normal, malignant, and degenerative brain functions.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in disease pathogenesis by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. The present study identifies new layers of astrocyte diversity and new correlations between distinct astrocyte subpopulations and disease states.

Abstract<p>Creating three-dimensional (3D) representations of the world from two-dimensional retinal images is fundamental to visually guided behaviors including reaching and grasping. A critical component of this process is determining the 3D orientation of objects. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) of the macaque monkey represent 3D planar surface orientation (i.e., slant and tilt). Here we compare the responses of neurons in areas V3A (which is implicated in 3D visual processing and which precedes CIP in the visual hierarchy) and CIP to 3D oriented planar surfaces. We then examine whether activity in these areas correlates with perception during a fine slant discrimination task in which monkeys report if the top of a surface is slanted towards or away from them. Although we find that V3A and CIP neurons show similar sensitivity to planar surface orientation, significant choice-related activity during the slant discrimination task is rare in V3A but prominent in CIP. These results implicate both V3A and CIP in the representation of 3D surface orientation, and suggest a functional dissociation between the areas based on slant-related choice signals.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Surface orientation perception is fundamental to visually guided behaviors such as reaching, grasping, and navigation. Previous studies implicate the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) in the representation of 3D surface orientation. Here we show that responses to 3D oriented planar surfaces are similar in CIP and V3A, which precedes CIP in the cortical hierarchy. However, we also find a qualitative distinction between the two areas: only CIP neurons show robust choice-related activity during a fine visual orientation discrimination task.</p>

Abstract<p>The caudate-putamen is a striatal brain region essential for sensorimotor behaviors, habit learning, and other cognitive and premotor functions. The output and predominant neuron of the caudate-putamen is the medium spiny neuron (MSN). MSNs present discrete cellular subtypes that show differences in neurochemistry, dopamine receptor expression, efferent targets, gene expression, functional roles, and most importantly for this study, electrophysiological properties. MSN subtypes include the striatonigral and the striatopallidal groups. Most studies identify the striatopallidal MSN subtype as being more excitable than the striatonigral MSN subtype. However, there is some divergence between studies regarding the exact differences in electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, MSN subtype electrophysiological properties have not been reported disaggregated by biological sex. We addressed these questions using prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice, an important transgenic line that has not yet received extensive electrophysiological analysis. We made acute caudate-putamen brain slices and assessed a robust battery of 16 relevant electrophysiological properties using whole-cell patch clamp recording, including intrinsic membrane, action potential, and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) properties. We found that: (1) MSN subtypes exhibited multiple differential electrophysiological properties in both sexes, including rheobase, action potential threshold and width, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and mEPSC amplitude; (2) select electrophysiological properties showed interactions between MSN subtype and sex. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of mouse caudate-putamen MSN subtype electrophysiological properties across females and males, both confirming and extending previous studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The findings presented here provide the most comprehensive evaluation of the electrophysiological properties of caudate-putamen medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes ever performed in a single study, both in terms of electrophysiological metrics and animal sex. These data selectively confirm, diverge from, and extend the findings of previous studies, providing a firm foundation upon which to pursue future studies of caudate-putamen MSNs.</p>

<p>Application of deep convolutional spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
artificial intelligence (AI) tasks has recently gained a lot of interest since
SNNs are hardware-friendly and energy-efficient. Unlike the non-spiking
counterparts, most of the existing SNN simulation frameworks are not
practically efficient enough for large-scale AI tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpykeTorch, an open-source high-speed simulation framework based on
PyTorch. This framework simulates convolutional SNNs with at most one spike per
neuron and the rank-order encoding scheme. In terms of learning rules, both
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) are
implemented, but other rules could be implemented easily. Apart from the
aforementioned properties, SpykeTorch is highly generic and capable of
reproducing the results of various studies. Computations in the proposed
framework are tensor-based and totally done by PyTorch functions, which in turn
brings the ability of just-in-time optimization for running on CPUs, GPUs, or
Multi-GPU platforms.

<p>The shape and connectivity of a neuron determine its function. Modern imaging
methods have proven successful at extracting such information. However, in
order to analyze this type of data, neuronal morphology needs to be encoded in
a graph-theoretic method. This encoding enables the use of high throughput
informatic methods to extract and infer brain function. The application of
graph-theoretic methods to neuronal morphological representation comes with
certain difficulties. Here we report a novel, effective method to accomplish
this task.
</p>
<p>The morphology of a neuron, which consists of its overall size, global shape,
local branch patterns, and cell-specific biophysical properties, can vary
significantly with the cell's identity, location, as well as developmental and
physiological state. Various algorithms have been developed to customize shape
based statistical and graph related features for quantitative analysis of
neuromorphology, followed by the classification of neuron cell types using the
features. Unlike the classical feature extraction based methods from imaged or
3D reconstructed neurons, we propose a model based on the rooted path
decomposition from the soma to the dendrites of a neuron and extract
morphological features on each path. We hypothesize that measuring the distance
between two neurons can be realized by minimizing the cost of continuously
morphing the set of all rooted paths of one neuron to another. To validate this
claim, we first establish the correspondence of paths between two neurons using
a modified Munkres algorithm. Next, an elastic deformation framework that
employs the square root velocity function is established to perform the
continuous morphing, which, in addition, provides an effective visualization
tool. We experimentally show the efficacy of NeuroPath2Path, NeuroP2P, over the
state of the art.

<p>The time dependent behavior of the Kuramoto model, describing
synchronization, has been studied numerically on small-world graphs. We
determined the desynchronziation behavior, by solving this model via the 4th
order Runge-Kutta algorithm on a large, weighted human connectome network and
compared the results with those of a two-dimensional lattice, with additional
random, long-range links. In the latter case a mean-field critical transition
is expected and here we provide numerial results for the
synchonization/desynchonization duration distributions. We find power-law
tails, characterized by a critical exponent $\tau_d \simeq 1.6(1)$. In case of
the connectome we assumed a homeostatic state, by the application of normalized
incoming weights. Since this graph has a topological dimension $d &lt; 4$ a real
synchronization phase transition is not possible in the thermodynamic limit,
still we could locate a transition between partially synchronized and
desynchronized states. At this crossover point we observe power-law--tailed
desynchronization durations, with $\tau_t \simeq 1.2(1)$, away from
experimental values for the brain. Additionally, we changed the signs of
outgoing weights of 20\% of randomly selected nodes, to mimic a model with
inhibitory interactions. In this case the at the crossover point we found
$\tau_t \simeq 1.9(2)$, which is in the range of human brain experiments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45013">Ventrolateral periaqueductal gray neurons prioritize threat probability over fear output</a></h4>

Faced with potential harm, individuals must estimate the probability of threat and initiate an appropriate fear response. In the prevailing view, threat probability estimates are relayed to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), to organize fear output. A straightforward prediction is that vlPAG single-unit activity reflects fear output, invariant of threat probability. We recorded vlPAG single-unit activity in male, Long Evans rats undergoing fear discrimination. Three 10-s auditory cues predicted unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p = 1.00), uncertainty (p = 0.375) and safety (p = 0.00). Fear output was measured by suppression of reward seeking over the entire cue and in one-second cue intervals. Cued fear non-linearly scaled to threat probability and cue-responsive vlPAG single-units scaled their firing on one of two timescales: at onset or ramping toward shock delivery. VlPAG onset activity reflected threat probability, invariant of fear output, while ramping activity reflected both signals with threat probability prioritized.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43002">Proteotoxicity from aberrant ribosome biogenesis compromises cell fitness</a></h4>

To achieve maximal growth, cells must manage a massive economy of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and RNAs (rRNAs) to produce thousands of ribosomes every minute. Although ribosomes are essential in all cells, natural disruptions to ribosome biogenesis lead to heterogeneous phenotypes. Here, we model these perturbations in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>and show that challenges to ribosome biogenesis result in acute loss of proteostasis. Imbalances in the synthesis of r-proteins and rRNAs lead to the rapid aggregation of newly synthesized orphan r-proteins and compromise essential cellular processes, which cells alleviate by activating proteostasis genes. Exogenously bolstering the proteostasis network increases cellular fitness in the face of challenges to ribosome assembly, demonstrating the direct contribution of orphan r-proteins to cellular phenotypes. We propose that ribosome assembly is a key vulnerability of proteostasis maintenance in proliferating cells that may be compromised by diverse genetic, environmental, and xenobiotic perturbations that generate orphan r-proteins.

Humans can learn abstract concepts that describe invariances over relational patterns in data. One such concept, known as magnitude, allows stimuli to be compactly represented on a single dimension (i.e. on a mental line). Here, we measured representations of magnitude in humans by recording neural signals whilst they viewed symbolic numbers. During a subsequent reward-guided learning task, the neural patterns elicited by novel complex visual images reflected their payout probability in a way that suggested they were encoded onto the same mental number line, with 'bad' bandits sharing neural representation with 'small' numbers and 'good' bandits with 'large' numbers. Using neural network simulations, we provide a mechanistic model that explains our findings and shows how structural alignment can promote transfer learning. Our findings suggest that in humans, learning about reward probability is accompanied by structural alignment of value representations with neural codes for the abstract concept of magnitude.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41861">Neural dynamics of visual ambiguity resolution by perceptual prior</a></h4>

Past experiences have enormous power in shaping our daily perception. Currently, dynamical neural mechanisms underlying this process remain mysterious. Exploiting a dramatic visual phenomenon, where a single experience of viewing a clear image allows instant recognition of a related degraded image, we investigated this question using MEG and 7 Tesla fMRI in humans. We observed that following the acquisition of perceptual priors, different degraded images are represented much more distinctly in neural dynamics starting from ~500 ms after stimulus onset. Content-specific neural activity related to stimulus-feature processing dominated within 300 ms after stimulus onset, while content-specific neural activity related to recognition processing dominated from 500 ms onward. Model-driven MEG-fMRI data fusion revealed the spatiotemporal evolution of neural activities involved in stimulus, attentional, and recognition processing. Together, these findings shed light on how experience shapes perceptual processing across space and time in the brain.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39777">Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal calcium activity across the sleep-wake cycle</a></h4>

Calcium is a critical second messenger in neurons that contributes to learning and memory, but how the coordination of action potentials of neuronal ensembles with the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) is reflected in dynamic calcium activity remains unclear. Here, we recorded hippocampal calcium activity with endoscopic imaging of the genetically encoded fluorophore GCaMP6 with concomitant LFP in freely behaving mice. Dynamic calcium activity was greater in exploratory behavior and REM sleep than in quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep, behavioral states that differ with respect to theta and septal cholinergic activity, and modulated at sharp wave ripples (SWRs). Chemogenetic activation of septal cholinergic neurons expressing the excitatory hM3Dq DREADD increased calcium activity and reduced SWRs. Furthermore, inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) reduced calcium activity while increasing SWRs. These results demonstrate that hippocampal dynamic calcium activity depends on behavioral and theta state as well as endogenous mAChR activation.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>There is growing evidence that psychosis is characterized by brain network abnormalities. Analyzing morphological abnormalities with T1-weighted structural MRI may be limited in discovering the extent of deviations in cortical associations. We assess whether structural associations of either cortical white–gray contrast (WGC) or cortical thickness (CT) allow for a better understanding of brain structural relationships in first episode of psychosis (FEP) patients. Principal component and structural covariance analyses were applied to WGC and CT derived from T1-weighted MRI for 116 patients and 88 controls, to explore sets of brain regions that showed group differences, and associations with symptom severity and cognitive ability in patients. We focused on 2 principal components: one encompassed primary somatomotor regions, which showed trend-like group differences in WGC, and the second included heteromodal cortices. Patients’ component scores were related to general psychopathology for WGC, but not CT. Structural covariance analyses with WGC revealed group differences in pairwise correlations across widespread brain regions, mirroring areas derived from PCA. More group differences were uncovered with WGC compared with CT. WGC holds potential as a proxy measure of myelin from commonly acquired T1-weighted MRI and may be sensitive in detecting systems-level aberrations in early psychosis, and relationships with clinical/cognitive profiles.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>How pain emerges in the human brain remains an unresolved question. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that several brain areas subserve pain perception because their activation correlates with perceived pain intensity. However, painful stimuli are often intense and highly salient; therefore, using both intensity- and saliency-matched control stimuli is crucial to isolate pain-selective brain responses. Here, we used these intensity/saliency-matched painful and non-painful stimuli to test whether pain-selective information can be isolated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging responses elicited by painful stimuli. Using two independent datasets, multivariate pattern analysis was able to isolate features distinguishing the responses triggered by (1) intensity/saliency-matched painful versus non-painful stimuli, and (2) high versus low-intensity/saliency stimuli regardless of whether they elicit pain. This indicates that neural activity in the so-called “pain matrix” is functionally heterogeneous, and part of it carries information related to both painfulness and intensity/saliency. The response features distinguishing these aspects are spatially distributed and cannot be ascribed to specific brain structures.</span>

TDP-43 aggregation is the major hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and FTD. Gasset-Rosa et al. demonstrate that transient stress induces long-lasting cytoplasmic TDP-43 de-mixing independent of stress granules, driving nuclear import defects, nuclear TDP-43 clearance, and cell death.

Sakellaridi, Christopoulos, et al. studied the learning mechanism in human AIP using brain-machine interface paradigms. They found that changes in neural activity during learning reflect cognitive re-adaptation mechanisms. When cognitive strategies were not adequate for compensation, AIP failed to learn.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25434?af=R">Blood pressure variability and hemorrhagic transformation in patients with successful recanalization after endovascular recanalization therapy: A retrospective observational study</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although blood pressure (BP) variability has been regarded as a risk factor for hemorrhagic transformation (HTF) after intravenous thrombolysis, its effect on HTF after endovascular recanalization therapy (ERT) remains to be elucidated. We aimed to study the relationship between BP variability and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after successful recanalization with ERT.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 211 patients with acute ischemic stroke and successful recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b or 3) after ERT were included between January 2013 and May 2017. The BP data following ERT was obtained over the first 24 hours using parameters including mean, maximum, minimum, difference between maximum and minimum, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, successive variations, and time rate (TR) of BP variation for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP. sICH was defined as parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 with neurological deterioration of 4 points of more on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the included patients, 20 (9.5%) developed sICH after successful ERT. The parameters linked with BP fluctuation over time were significantly related to sICH. After adjusting for confounders, the TR of SBP (per 0.1 mmHg/min increase) variation was independently associated with sICH (odds ratio = 1.71, 95% confidence interval = 1.013–2.886).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Time‐related BP variability in the first 24 hours following successful ERT was more correlated with sICH than other absolute BP levels. This suggests that maintaining a stable BP may be an important factor in preventing sICH after successful ERT. Ann Neurol 2019</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anti‐N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate‐receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis related to autoantibody‐mediated synaptic dysfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid‐derived human monoclonal NR1 autoantibodies showed low numbers of somatic hypermutations or were unmutated. These unexpected germline‐configured antibodies showed weaker binding to the NMDAR than matured antibodies from the same patient. In primary hippocampal neurons, germline NR1 autoantibodies strongly and specifically reduced total and synaptic NMDAR currents in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner. The findings suggest that functional NMDAR antibodies are part of the human naïve B cell repertoire. Given their effects on synaptic function, they might contribute to a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (PAI‐1) is the key endogenous inhibitor of fibrinolysis, and enhances clot formation after injury. In traumatic brain injury, dysregulation of fibrinolysis may lead to sustained microthrombosis and accelerated lesion expansion. In the present study, we hypothesized that PAI‐1 mediates posttraumatic malfunction of coagulation, with inhibition or genetic depletion of PAI‐1 attenuating clot formation and lesion expansion after brain trauma.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated PAI‐1 as a possible new target in a mouse controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We performed the pharmacological inhibition of PAI‐1 with PAI‐039 and stimulation by tranexamic acid, and we confirmed our results in PAI‐1‐deficient animals.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PAI‐1 mRNA was time‐dependently upregulated, with a 305‐fold peak 12h after CCI, which effectively counteracted the 2 to 3‐fold increase in cerebral tissue‐type/urokinase plasminogen activator (tPA/uPA) expression. PAI‐039 reduced brain lesion volume by 26% at 24h, and 43% at 5d, after insult. This treatment also attenuated neuronal apoptosis and improved neurofunctional outcome. Moreover, intravital microscopy demonstrated reduced posttraumatic thrombus formation in the pericontusional cortical microvasculature. In PAI‐1‐deficient mice, the therapeutic effect of PAI‐039 was absent. These mice also displayed 13% reduced brain damage compared with wild‐type. In contrast, inhibition of fibrinolysis with tranexamic acid increased lesion volume by 25% compared with vehicle.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identifies impaired fibrinolysis as a critical process in posttraumatic secondary brain damage and suggests that PAI‐1 may be a central endogenous inhibitor of the fibrinolytic pathway, promoting a pro‐coagulatory state and clot formation in the cerebral microvasculature.</p>

<p>Focal traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces astrogliosis, a process essential to protecting uninjured brain areas from secondary damage. However, astrogliosis can cause loss of astrocyte homeostatic functions and possibly contributes to comorbidities such as posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). Scar-forming astrocytes seal focal injuries off from healthy brain tissue. It is these glial scars that are associated with epilepsy originating in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, the vast majority of human TBIs also present with diffuse brain injury caused by acceleration-deceleration forces leading to tissue shearing. The resulting diffuse tissue damage may be intrinsically different from focal lesions that would trigger glial scar formation. Here, we used mice of both sexes in a model of repetitive mild/concussive closed-head TBI, which only induced diffuse injury, to test the hypothesis that astrocytes respond uniquely to diffuse TBI and that diffuse TBI is sufficient to cause PTE. Astrocytes did not form scars and classic astrogliosis characterized by upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein was limited. Surprisingly, an unrelated population of atypical reactive astrocytes was characterized by the lack of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, rapid and sustained downregulation of homeostatic proteins and impaired astrocyte coupling. After a latency period, a subset of mice developed spontaneous recurrent seizures reminiscent of PTE in human TBI patients. Seizing mice had larger areas of atypical astrocytes compared with nonseizing mice, suggesting that these atypical astrocytes might contribute to epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of acquired epilepsies. Reactive astrocytes have long been associated with seizures and epilepsy in patients, particularly after focal/lesional brain injury. However, most TBIs also include nonfocal, diffuse injuries. Here, we showed that repetitive diffuse TBI is sufficient for the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in a subset of mice. We identified an atypical response of astrocytes induced by diffuse TBI characterized by the rapid loss of homeostatic proteins and lack of astrocyte coupling while reactive astrocyte markers or glial scar formation was absent. Areas with atypical astrocytes were larger in animals that later developed seizures suggesting that this response may be one root cause of epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial energy production is essential for normal brain function. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases brain energy demands, results in the activation of mitochondrial respiration, associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. This chain of events triggers neuronal apoptosis via oxidation of a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL). One pathway through which cells can avoid apoptosis is via elimination of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy. Previously, we showed that externalization of CL to the mitochondrial surface acts as an elimination signal in cells. Whether CL-mediated mitophagy occurs <i>in vivo</i> or its significance in the disease processes are not known. In this study, we showed that TBI leads to increased mitophagy in the human brain, which was also detected using TBI models in male rats. Knockdown of CL synthase, responsible for <i>de novo</i> synthesis of CL, or phospholipid scramblase-3, responsible for CL translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane, significantly decreased TBI-induced mitophagy. Inhibition of mitochondrial clearance by 3-methyladenine, mdivi-1, or phospholipid scramblase-3 knockdown after TBI led to a worse outcome, suggesting that mitophagy is beneficial. Together, our findings indicate that TBI-induced mitophagy is an endogenous neuroprotective process that is directed by CL, which marks damaged mitochondria for elimination, thereby limiting neuronal death and behavioral deficits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases energy demands leading to activation of mitochondrial respiration associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and resultant damage to mitochondria. We demonstrate that the complete elimination of irreparably damaged organelles via mitophagy is activated as an early response to TBI. This response includes translocation of mitochondria phospholipid cardiolipin from the inner membrane to the outer membrane where externalized cardiolipin mediates targeted protein light chain 3-mediated autophagy of damaged mitochondria. Our data on targeting phospholipid scramblase and cardiolipin synthase in genetically manipulated cells and animals strongly support the essential role of cardiolipin externalization mechanisms in the endogenous reparative plasticity of injured brain cells. Furthermore, successful execution and completion of mitophagy is beneficial in the context of preservation of cognitive functions after TBI.</p>

<p>The intracellular tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (PTK2B) is related to focal adhesion kinase and localizes to postsynaptic sites in brain. Pyk2 genetic variation contributes to late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We recently observed that Pyk2 is required for synapse loss and for learning deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Here, we explore the cellular and biochemical basis for the action of Pyk2 tyrosine kinase in amyloid-β oligomer (Aβo)-induced dendritic spine loss. Overexpression of Pyk2 reduces dendritic spine density of hippocampal neurons by a kinase-dependent mechanism. Biochemical isolation of Pyk2-interacting proteins from brain identifies Graf1c, a RhoA GTPase-activating protein inhibited by Pyk2. Aβo-induced reductions in dendritic spine motility and chronic spine loss require both Pyk2 kinase and RhoA activation. Thus, Pyk2 functions at postsynaptic sites to modulate F-actin control by RhoA and regulate synapse maintenance of relevance to AD risk.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Genetic variation at the Pyk2 locus is a risk for Alzheimer's disease. We have observed that Pyk2 is required for AD transgenic synapse loss and memory dysfunction. However, the cellular and biochemical basis for Pyk2 function related to AD is not defined. Here, we show that brain Pyk2 interacts with the RhoGAP protein Graf1 to alter dendritic spine stability via RhoA GTPase. Amyloid-β oligomer-induced dendritic spine loss requires the Pyk2/Graf1 pathway.</p>

<p>Emerging studies are providing compelling evidence that the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder with frequent midlife onset, encompasses developmental components. Moreover, our previous studies using a hypomorphic model targeting huntingtin during the neurodevelopmental period indicated that loss-of-function mechanisms account for this pathogenic developmental component (Arteaga-Bracho et al., 2016). In the present study, we specifically ascertained the roles of subpallial lineage species in eliciting the previously observed HD-like phenotypes. Accordingly, we used the Cre-loxP system to conditionally ablate the murine huntingtin gene (Htt<sup>flx</sup>) in cells expressing the subpallial patterning markers Gsx2 (Gsx2-Cre) or Nkx2.1 (Nkx2.1-Cre) in Htt<sup>flx</sup> mice of both sexes. These genetic manipulations elicited anxiety-like behaviors, hyperkinetic locomotion, age-dependent motor deficits, and weight loss in both Htt<sup>flx</sup>;Gsx2-Cre and Htt<sup>flx</sup>;Nkx2.1-Cre mice. In addition, these strains displayed unique but complementary spatial patterns of basal ganglia degeneration that are strikingly reminiscent of those seen in human cases of HD. Furthermore, we observed early deficits of somatostatin-positive and Reelin-positive interneurons in both Htt subpallial null strains, as well as early increases of cholinergic interneurons, Foxp2<sup>+</sup> arkypallidal neurons, and incipient deficits with age-dependent loss of parvalbumin-positive neurons in Htt<sup>flx</sup>;Nkx2.1-Cre mice. Overall, our findings indicate that selective loss-of-huntingtin function in subpallial lineages differentially disrupts the number, complement, and survival of forebrain interneurons and globus pallidus GABAergic neurons, thereby leading to the development of key neurological hallmarks of HD during adult life. Our findings have important implications for the establishment and deployment of neural circuitries and the integrity of network reserve in health and disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive degenerative disorder caused by aberrant trinucleotide expansion in the <i>huntingtin</i> gene. Mechanistically, this mutation involves both loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms affecting a broad array of cellular and molecular processes. Although huntingtin is widely expressed during adult life, the mutant protein only causes the demise of selective neuronal subtypes. The mechanisms accounting for this differential vulnerability remain elusive. In this study, we have demonstrated that loss-of-huntingtin function in subpallial lineages not only differentially disrupts distinct interneuron species early in life, but also leads to a pattern of neurological deficits that are reminiscent of HD. This work suggests that early disruption of selective neuronal subtypes may account for the profiles of enhanced regional cellular vulnerability to death in HD.</p>

<p>Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) causes retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and death and is a major risk factor for glaucoma. We used a bead injection technique to increase IOP in mice of both genders by an average of ~3 mmHg for 2 weeks. This level of IOP elevation was lower than that achieved in other studies, which allowed for the study of subtle IOP effects. We used multielectrode array recordings to determine the cellular responses of RGCs exposed to this mild degree of IOP elevation. We found that RGC photopic receptive field (RF) center size and whole-field RGC firing rates were unaffected by IOP elevation. In contrast, we found that the temporal properties of RGC photopic responses in the RF center were accelerated, particularly in ON sustained cells. We also detected a loss of antagonistic surround in several RGC subtypes. Finally, spontaneous firing rate, interspike interval variance, and contrast sensitivity were altered according to the magnitude of IOP exposure and also displayed an IOP-dependent effect. Together, these results suggest that individual RGC physiologic parameters have unique IOP-related functional thresholds that exist concurrently and change following IOP elevation according to specific patterns. Furthermore, even subtle IOP elevation can impart profound changes in RGC function, which in some cases may occur in an IOP-dependent manner. This system of overlapping functional thresholds likely underlies the complex effects of elevated IOP on the retina.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the obligate output neurons of the retina and are injured by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in diseases such as glaucoma. In this study, a subtle elevation of IOP in mice for 2 weeks revealed distinct IOP-related functional thresholds for specific RGC physiologic parameters and sometimes showed an IOP-dependent effect. These data suggest that overlapping IOP-related thresholds and response profiles exist simultaneously in RGCs and throughout the retina. These overlapping thresholds likely explain the range of RGC responses that occur following IOP elevation and highlight the wide capacity of neurons to respond in a diseased state.</p>

<p>Current understanding of the origin of occipital headache falls short of distinguishing between cause and effect.

Hypothesizing that occipital headache may involve activation of meningeal nociceptors that innervate the posterior 1/3 of the dura, we sought to map the origin and course of meningeal nociceptors that innervate the posterior dura overlying the cerebellum. Using AAV-GFP tracing and single-unit recording techniques in male rats, we found that neurons in C2–C3 DRGs innervate the dura of the posterior fossa; that nearly half originate in DRG neurons containing CGRP and TRPV1; that nerve bundles traverse suboccipital muscles before entering the cranium through bony canals and large foramens; that central neurons receiving nociceptive information from the posterior dura are located in C2–C4 spinal cord and that their cutaneous and muscle receptive fields are found around the ears, occipital skin and neck muscles; and that administration of inflammatory mediators to their dural receptive field, sensitize their responses to stimulation of the posterior dura, peri-occipital skin and neck muscles. These findings lend rationale for the common practice of attempting to alleviate migraine headaches by targeting the greater and lesser occipital nerves with anesthetics. The findings also raise the possibility that such procedures may be more beneficial for alleviating occipital than non-occipital headaches and that occipital migraines may be associated more closely with cerebellar abnormalities than in non-occipital migraines.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Occipital headaches are common in both migraine and non-migraine headaches. Historically, two distinct scenarios have been proposed for such headaches; the first suggests that the headaches are caused by spasm or tension of scalp, shoulders, and neck muscles inserted in the occipital region, whereas the second suggests that these headaches are initiated by activation of meningeal nociceptors. The current study shows that the posterior dura overlying the cerebellum is innervated by cervicovascular neurons in C2 DRG whose axons reach the posterior dura through multiple intracranial and extracranial pathways, and sensitization of central cervicovascular neurons from the posterior dura can result in hyper-responsiveness to stimulation of neck muscles. The findings suggest that the origin of occipital and frontal migraine may differ.</p>

<p>Cognitive control often requires suppression of prepotent stimulus-driven responses in favor of less potent alternatives. Suppression of prepotent saccades has been shown to require proactive inhibition in the frontoparietal saccade network. Electrophysiological evidence in macaque monkeys has revealed neural correlates of such inhibition in this network; however, the interlaminar instantiation of inhibitory processes remains poorly understood because these areas lie deep within sulci in macaques, rendering them inaccessible to laminar recordings. Here, we addressed this gap by exploiting the mostly lissencephalic cortex of the common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). We inserted linear electrode arrays into areas 8Ad—the putative marmoset frontal eye field—and the lateral intraparietal area of two male marmosets and recorded neural activity during performance of a task comprised of alternating blocks of trials requiring a saccade either toward a large, high-luminance stimulus or the inhibition of this prepotent response in favor of a saccade toward a small, low-luminance stimulus. We observed prominent task-dependent activity in both alpha/gamma bands of the LFP and discharge rates of single neurons in area 8Ad during a prestimulus task epoch in which the animals had been instructed which of these two tasks to perform but before peripheral stimulus onset. These data are consistent with a model in which rhythmic alpha-band activity in deeper layers inhibits spiking in upper layers to support proactive inhibitory saccade control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Failures to inhibit automatic saccadic responses are a hallmark of many neuropsychiatric disorders, but how this process is implemented across the cortical layers in the frontoparietal saccade network remains unknown because many of the areas are inaccessible to laminar recordings in macaques. Here, we investigated laminar neural activity in marmoset monkeys, which have a smooth cortex. Monkeys were required either to generate or inhibit a prepotent saccade response. In area 8Ad, the putative frontal eye field in marmosets, rhythmic alpha-band activity (9–14 Hz) was higher in deeper layers and spiking activity was lower in upper layers when the animals were instructed to suppress a saccade toward a peripheral stimulus. Reduced alpha power during task preparation may be the underlying common neural basis of a saccade suppression deficit.</p>

<p>Rats trained to perform a version of the rat gambling task (rGT) in which salient audiovisual cues accompany reward delivery, similar to commercial gambling products, show greater preference for risky options. Given previous demonstrations that probabilistic reinforcement schedules can enhance psychostimulant-induced increases in accumbal DA and locomotor activity, we theorized that performing this cued task could perpetuate a proaddiction phenotype. Significantly more rats developed a preference for the risky options in the cued versus uncued rGT at baseline, and this bias was further exacerbated by cocaine self-administration, whereas the choice pattern of optimal decision-makers was unaffected. The addition of reward-paired cues therefore increased the proportion of rats exhibiting a maladaptive cognitive response to cocaine self-administration. Risky choice was not associated with responding for conditioned reinforcement or a marker of goal/sign-tracking, suggesting that reward-concurrent cues precipitate maladaptive choice via a unique mechanism unrelated to simple approach toward, or responding for, conditioned stimuli. Although "protected" from any resulting decision-making impairment, optimal decision-makers trained on the cued rGT nevertheless self-administered more cocaine than those trained on the uncued task. Collectively, these data suggest that repeated engagement with heavily cued probabilistic reward schedules can drive addiction vulnerability through multiple behavioral mechanisms. Rats trained on the cued rGT also exhibited blunted locomotor sensitization and lower basal accumbal DA levels, yet greater cocaine-induced increases in accumbal DA efflux. Gambling in the presence of salient cues may therefore result in an adaptive downregulation of the mesolimbic DA system, rendering individuals more sensitive to the deleterious effects of taking cocaine.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Impaired cost/benefit decision making, exemplified by preference for the risky, disadvantageous options on the Iowa Gambling Task, is associated with greater risk of relapse and treatment failure in substance use disorder. Understanding factors that enhance preference for risk may help elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying maladaptive decision making in addiction, thereby improving treatment outcomes. Problem gambling is also highly comorbid with substance use disorder, and many commercial gambling products incorporate salient win-paired cues. Here we show that adding reward-concurrent cues to a rat analog of the IGT precipitates a hypodopaminergic state, characterized by blunted accumbal DA efflux and attenuated locomotor sensitization, which may contribute to the enhanced responsivity to uncertain rewards or the reinforcing effects of cocaine we observed.</p>

<p>Object recognition memory (ORM) confers the ability to discriminate the familiarity of previously encountered items. Reconsolidation is the process by which reactivated memories become labile and susceptible to modifications. The hippocampus is specifically engaged in reconsolidation to integrate new information into the original ORM through a mechanism involving activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and induction of LTP. It is known that BDNF can control LTP maintenance through protein kinase M (PKM), an atypical protein kinase C isoform that is thought to sustain memory storage by modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. However, the potential involvement of PKM in ORM reconsolidation has never been studied. Using a novel ORM task combined with pharmacological, biochemical, and electrophysiological tools, we found that hippocampal PKM is essential to update ORM through reconsolidation, but not to maintain the inactive recognition memory trace stored over time, in adult male Wistar rats. Our results also indicate that hippocampal PKM acts downstream of BDNF and controls AMPAR synaptic insertion to elicit reconsolidation and suggest that blocking PKM activity during this process deletes active ORM.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Object recognition memory (ORM) is essential to remember facts and events. Reconsolidation integrates new information into ORM through changes in hippocampal plasticity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. In turn, BDNF enhances synaptic efficacy through protein kinase M (PKM), which might preserve memory. Here, we present evidence that hippocampal PKM acts downstream of BDNF to regulate AMPAR recycling during ORM reconsolidation and show that this kinase is essential to update the reactivated recognition memory trace, but not to consolidate or maintain an inactive ORM. We also demonstrate that the amnesia provoked by disrupting ORM reconsolidation through PKM inhibition is due to memory erasure and not to retrieval failure.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/10/1817?rss=1">Grey Matter Volume Differences Associated with Extremely Low Levels of Cannabis Use in Adolescence</a></h4>

<p>Rates of cannabis use among adolescents are high, and are increasing concurrent with changes in the legal status of marijuana and societal attitudes regarding its use. Recreational cannabis use is understudied, especially in the adolescent period when neural maturation may make users particularly vulnerable to the effects of -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain structure. In the current study, we used voxel-based morphometry to compare gray matter volume (GMV) in forty-six 14-year-old human adolescents (males and females) with just one or two instances of cannabis use and carefully matched THC-naive controls. We identified extensive regions in the bilateral medial temporal lobes as well as the bilateral posterior cingulate, lingual gyri, and cerebellum that showed greater GMV in the cannabis users. Analysis of longitudinal data confirmed that GMV differences were unlikely to precede cannabis use. GMV in the temporal regions was associated with contemporaneous performance on the Perceptual Reasoning Index and with future generalized anxiety symptoms in the cannabis users. The distribution of GMV effects mapped onto biomarkers of the endogenous cannabinoid system providing insight into possible mechanisms for these effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Almost 35% of American 10th graders have reported using cannabis and existing research suggests that initiation of cannabis use in adolescence is associated with long-term neurocognitive effects. We understand very little about the earliest effects of cannabis use, however, because most research is conducted in adults with a heavy pattern of lifetime use. This study presents evidence suggesting structural brain and cognitive effects of just one or two instances of cannabis use in adolescence. Converging evidence suggests a role for the endocannabinoid system in these effects. This research is particularly timely as the legal status of cannabis is changing in many jurisdictions and the perceived risk by youth associated with smoking cannabis has declined in recent years.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/10/1805?rss=1">Amplification and Suppression of Traveling Waves along the Mouse Organ of Corti: Evidence for Spatial Variation in the Longitudinal Coupling of Outer Hair Cell-Generated Forces</a></h4>

<p>Mammalian hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity depend on a mechanical amplification process mediated by outer hair cells (OHCs). OHCs are situated within the organ of Corti atop the basilar membrane (BM), which supports sound-evoked traveling waves. It is well established that OHCs generate force to selectively amplify BM traveling waves where they peak, and that amplification accumulates from one location to the next over this narrow cochlear region. However, recent measurements demonstrate that traveling waves along the apical surface of the organ of Corti, the reticular lamina (RL), are amplified over a much broader region. Whether OHC forces accumulate along the length of the RL traveling wave to provide a form of "global" cochlear amplification is unclear. Here we examined the spatial accumulation of RL amplification. In mice of either sex, we used tones to suppress amplification from different cochlear regions and examined the effect on RL vibrations near and far from the traveling-wave peak. We found that although OHC forces amplify the entire RL traveling wave, amplification only accumulates near the peak, over the same region where BM motion is amplified. This contradicts the notion that RL motion is involved in a global amplification mechanism and reveals that the mechanical properties of the BM and organ of Corti tune how OHC forces accumulate spatially. Restricting the spatial buildup of amplification enhances frequency selectivity by sharpening the peaks of cochlear traveling waves and constrains the number of OHCs responsible for mechanical sensitivity at each location.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Outer hair cells generate force to amplify traveling waves within the mammalian cochlea. This force generation is critical to the ability to detect and discriminate sounds. Nevertheless, how these forces couple to the motions of the surrounding structures and integrate along the cochlear length remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that outer hair cell-generated forces amplify traveling-wave motion on the organ of Corti throughout the wave's extent, but that these forces only accumulate longitudinally over a region near the wave's peak. The longitudinal coupling of outer hair cell-generated forces is therefore spatially tuned, likely by the mechanical properties of the basilar membrane and organ of Corti. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanical processes that underlie sensitive hearing.</p>

<p>Processing incentive and drive is essential for control of goal-directed behavior. The limbic part of the basal ganglia has been emphasized in these processes, yet the exact neuronal mechanism has remained elusive. In this study, we examined the neuronal activity of the ventral pallidum (VP) and its upstream area, the rostromedial caudate (rmCD), while two male macaque monkeys performed an instrumental lever release task in which a visual cue indicated the forthcoming reward size. We found that the activity of some neurons in VP and rmCD reflected the expected reward size transiently following the cue. Reward size coding appeared earlier and stronger in VP than in rmCD. We also found that the activity in these areas was modulated by the satiation level of monkeys, which also occurred more frequently in VP than in rmCD. The information regarding reward size and satiation level was independently signaled in the neuronal populations of these areas. The data thus highlighted the neuronal coding of key variables for goal-directed behavior in VP. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation of VP induced more severe deficit of goal-directed behavior than inactivation of rmCD, which was indicated by abnormal error repetition and diminished satiation effect on the performance. These results suggest that VP encodes incentive value and internal drive and plays a pivotal role in the control of motivation to promote goal-directed behavior.</p>

<p>We previously found that low-frequency stimulation of direct temperoammonic (TA) inputs to hippocampal area CA1 depotentiates previously established long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral (SC) pathway through complex signaling involving dopamine, endocannabinoids, neuregulin-1, GABA, and adenosine, with adenosine being the most distal modulator identified to date. In the present studies, we examined mechanisms contributing to the effects of adenosine in hippocampal slices from male albino rats. We found that extracellular conversion of ATP to adenosine via an ectonucleotidase contributes significantly to TA-mediated SC depotentiation and the depotentiation resulting from block of adenosine transport. Adenosine-mediated SC depotentiation does not involve activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase, serine phosphatases, or nitric oxide synthase, unlike homosynaptic SC depotentiation. Rather, adenosine-induced depotentiation is inhibited by specific antagonists of p38 MAPK, but not by a structural analog that does not inhibit p38. Additionally, using antagonists with relative selectivity for p38 subtypes, it appears that TA-induced SC depotentiation most likely involves p38 MAPK β. These findings have implications for understanding the role of adenosine and other extrahippocampal and intrahippocampal modulators in regulating SC synaptic function and the contributions of these modulators to the cognitive dysfunction associated with neuropsychiatric illnesses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Low-frequency stimulation of temperoammonic (TA) inputs to stratum lacunosum moleculare of hippocampal area CA1 heterosynaptically depotentiates long-term potentiation of Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses. TA-induced SC depotentiation involves complex signaling including dopamine, endocannabinoids, GABA, and adenosine, with adenosine serving as the most downstream messenger in the cascade identified to date. The present results indicate that TA-induced depotentiation requires intact inputs from entorhinal cortex and that adenosine ultimately drives depotentiation via activation of p38 MAPK. These studies have implications for understanding the cognitive dysfunction of psychiatric illnesses and certain abused drugs.</p>

<p>Neuronal networks within the spinal cord, collectively known as the central pattern generator (CPG), coordinate rhythmic movements underlying locomotion. The transcription factor doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 3 (DMRT3) is involved in the differentiation of the dorsal interneuron 6 class of spinal cord interneurons. In horses, a non-sense mutation in the <i>Dmrt3</i> gene has major effects on gaiting ability, whereas mice lacking the <i>Dmrt3</i> gene display impaired locomotor activity. Although the <i>Dmrt3</i> gene is necessary for normal spinal network formation and function in mice, a direct role for <i>Dmrt3</i>-derived neurons in locomotor-related activities has not been demonstrated. Here we present the characteristics of the <i>Dmrt3</i>-derived spinal cord interneurons. Using transgenic mice of both sexes, we characterized interneurons labeled by their expression of Cre driven by the endogenous <i>Dmrt3</i> promoter. We used molecular, retrograde tracing and electrophysiological techniques to examine the anatomical, morphological, and electrical properties of the Dmrt3-Cre neurons. We demonstrate that inhibitory Dmrt3-Cre neurons receive extensive synaptic inputs, innervate surrounding CPG neurons, intrinsically regulate CPG neuron's electrical activity, and are rhythmically active during fictive locomotion, bursting at frequencies independent to the ventral root output. The present study provides novel insights on the character of spinal <i>Dmrt3</i>-derived neurons, data demonstrating that these neurons participate in locomotor coordination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this work, we provide evidence for a role of the Dmrt3 interneurons in spinal cord locomotor circuits as well as molecular and functional insights on the cellular and microcircuit level of the Dmrt3-expressing neurons in the spinal cord. Dmrt3 neurons provide the first example of an interneuron population displaying different oscillation frequencies. This study presents novel findings on an under-reported population of spinal cord neurons, which will aid in deciphering the locomotor network and will facilitate the design and development of therapeutics for spinal cord injury and motor disorders.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 isoform is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). While APOE is predominantly expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system, neuronal expression of APOE is of increasing interest in age‐related cognitive impairment, neurological injury, and neurodegeneration. Here we show that endogenous expression of E4 in stem‐cell derived neurons predisposes them to injury and promotes the release of phosphorylated tau.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Induced pluripotent stem cells from two unrelated Alzheimer's disease patients carrying the E4 allele were corrected to the E3/E3 genotype with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and differentiated into pure cultures of forebrain excitatory neurons without contamination from other cells types.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to unedited E4 neurons, E3 neurons were less susceptible to ionomycin‐induced cytotoxicity. Biochemically, E4 cells exhibited increased tau phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphoactivation. Moreover, E4 neurons released increased amounts of phosphorylated tau extracellularly in an isoform dependent manner by a heparin sulfate proteoglycan‐dependent mechanism.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that endogenous expression of E4 by stem‐cell derived forebrain excitatory neurons predisposes neurons to calcium dysregulation, and ultimately, cell death. This change is associated with increased cellular tau phosphorylation and markedly enhanced release of phosphorylated tau. Importantly, these effects are independent of glial APOE. These findings suggest that E4 accelerates spreading of tau pathology and neuron death in part by neuron‐specific, glia‐independent mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether hemodynamic features of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS) might correlate with the risk of stroke relapse, using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort study, we recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke attributed to 50‐99% ICAS confirmed in CT angiography (CTA). With CTA‐based CFD models, translesional pressure ratio (PR =<span>
   <i>Pressure</i>
   <sub>
      <i>post</i> − <i>stenotic</i>
   </sub>/<i>Pressure</i>
   <sub>
      <i>pre</i> − <i>stenotic</i>
   </sub>
</span>) and translesional wall shear stress ratio (WSSR =<span>
   <i>WSS</i>
   <sub>
      <i>stenotic</i> − <i>throat</i>
   </sub>/<i>WSS</i>
   <sub>
      <i>pre</i> − <i>stenotic</i>
   </sub>
</span>) were obtained in each sICAS lesion. Translesional PR ≤ median was defined as low PR and WSSR ≥ 4<sup>th</sup> quartile as high WSSR. All patients received standard medical treatment. The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke in the same territory (SIT) within 1 year.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, 245 patients (median age 61 years; 63.7% males) were analyzed. Median translesional PR was 0.94 (interquartile range, IQR 0.87‐0.97); median translesional WSSR was 13.3 (IQR 7.0‐26.7). SIT occurred in 20 (8.2%) patients, mostly with multiple infarcts in the borderzone and/or cortical regions. In multivariate Cox regression, low PR (adjusted hazard ratio, HR=3.16; p=0.026) and high WSSR (adjusted HR=3.05; p=0.014) were independently associated with SIT. Patients with both low PR and high WSSR had significantly higher risk of SIT than those with normal PR and WSSR (risks 17.5% versus 3.0%; adjusted HR=7.52; p=0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work represents a step forward in utilizing computational flow simulation techniques in studying intracranial atherosclerotic disease. It reveals a hemodynamic pattern of sICAS that is more prone to stroke relapse, and supports hypoperfusion and artery‐to‐artery embolism as common mechanisms for ischemic strokes in such patients.</p>

<p>Although Shannon mutual information has been widely used, its effective
calculation is often difficult for many practical problems, including those in
neural population coding. Asymptotic formulas based on Fisher information
sometimes provide accurate approximations to the mutual information but this
approach is restricted to continuous variables because the calculation of
Fisher information requires derivatives with respect to the encoded variables.
In this paper, we consider information-theoretic bounds and approximations of
the mutual information based on Kullback--Leibler divergence and R\'{e}nyi
divergence. We propose several information metrics to approximate Shannon
mutual information in the context of neural population coding. While our
asymptotic formulas all work for discrete variables, one of them has consistent
performance and high accuracy regardless of whether the encoded variables are
discrete or continuous. We performed numerical simulations and confirmed that
our approximation formulas were highly accurate for approximating the mutual
information between the stimuli and the responses of a large neural population.
These approximation formulas may potentially bring convenience to the
applications of information theory to many practical and theoretical problems.

<p>Neural network models can now recognise images, understand text, translate
languages, and play many human games at human or superhuman levels. These
systems are highly abstracted, but are inspired by biological brains and use
only biologically plausible computations. In the coming years, neural networks
are likely to become less reliant on learning from massive labelled datasets,
and more robust and generalisable in their task performance. From their
successes and failures, we can learn about the computational requirements of
the different tasks at which brains excel. Deep learning also provides the
tools for testing cognitive theories. In order to test a theory, we need to
realise the proposed information-processing system at scale, so as to be able
to assess its feasibility and emergent behaviours. Deep learning allows us to
scale up from principles and circuit models to end-to-end trainable models
capable of performing complex tasks. There are many levels at which cognitive
neuroscientists can use deep learning in their work, from inspiring theories to
serving as full computational models. Ongoing advances in deep learning bring
us closer to understanding how cognition and perception may be implemented in
the brain -- the grand challenge at the core of cognitive neuroscience.

Targeted DamID (TaDa) is proving invaluable in identifying the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin-associated proteins <em>in vivo</em>, without fixation, cell isolation, or immunoprecipitation. The simplicity and efficiency of the technique have led to an ever-expanding TaDa toolbox. These tools enable profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as the identification of the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin complexes, transcription factors and RNAs.

The occurrence of wake-like electroencephalography (EEG) traces during rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) has intrigued scientists for decades. A recent study by Bergel et al. (Nat. Commun. 2018;9;5364) imaged brain-wide hemodynamics in rats during wakefulness and sleep. The findings suggest that brain energy expenditure is highest during REM because of heightened theta and gamma activity.

To survive, animals must maximize the minimum—take care of the least satisfied among their basic needs. In this issue of Neuron, a study by Juechems et al. (2019) illustrates that this core principle might shape the way medial prefrontal regions of the human brain drive and valuate sequential choices between different types of reward.

Abstract
<p>While the primary role of vesicular transporters is to load neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs), accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins also contribute to additional aspects of synaptic function, including vesicle release. In this study, we extend the role of the VAChT to include regulating the transmitter content of SVs. We report that manipulation of a C-terminal poly-glutamine (polyQ) region in the <i>Drosophila</i> VAChT is sufficient to influence transmitter content, and release frequency, of cholinergic vesicles from the terminals of premotor interneurons. Specifically, we find that reduction of the polyQ region, by one glutamine residue (<i>13Q</i> to <i>12Q</i>), results in a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of spontaneous cholinergic miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) recorded in the aCC and RP2 motoneurons. Moreover, this truncation also results in evoked synaptic currents that show increased duration: consistent with increased ACh release. By contrast, extension of the polyQ region by one glutamine (<i>13Q</i> to <i>14Q</i>) is sufficient to reduce mEPSC amplitude and frequency and, moreover, prevents evoked SV release. Finally, a complete deletion of the polyQ region (13Q to 0Q) has no obvious effects to mEPSCs, but again evoked synaptic currents show increased duration. The mechanisms that ensure SVs are filled to physiologically-appropriate levels remain unknown. Our study identifies the polyQ region of the insect VAChT to be required for correct vesicle transmitter loading and, thus, provides opportunity to increase understanding of this critical aspect of neurotransmission.</p>

Abstract
<p>Hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common seizures during childhood, and prolonged complex FSs can result in the development of epilepsy. Currently, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used as medications for FSs with the aim of enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity. However, it is still up for debate whether these enhancers of GABAergic neurotransmission could depolarize immature neurons with relatively higher levels of the intracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> in the developing brain during FSs. Here, we performed simultaneous video-local field potential monitoring to determine whether benzodiazepines and barbiturates affect the phenotypes of FSs in postnatal day (P)11 and P14 mice. We found that low-dose administration of diazepam decreased the incidence of clonic seizures at P11. We also found that high-dose administration of diazepam and pentobarbital exacerbated the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the induction phase of experimental FSs at P11 but not at P14. We further found that the deteriorated phenotypes at P11 were suppressed when Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>–</sup> cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), which mediates Cl<sup>–</sup> influx, was blocked by treatment with the diuretic bumetanide. Though our findings do not exclude the involvement of sedation effect of high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators in worsening experimental FSs at P11, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling could aggravate seizure activity in the early phase of FSs.</p>

Abstract
<p>Methylphenidate (MPH), commonly known as Ritalin, is the most widely prescribed drug worldwide to treat patients with attention deficit disorders. Although MPH is thought to modulate catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain, it remains unclear how these neurochemical effects influence neuronal activity and lead to attentional enhancements. Studies in rodents overwhelmingly point to the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a main site of action of MPH. To understand the mechanism of action of MPH in a primate brain, we recorded the responses of neuronal populations using chronic multielectrode arrays implanted in the caudal LPFC of two macaque monkeys while the animals performed an attention task (<i>N</i> = 2811 neuronal recordings). Over different recording sessions (<i>N</i> = 55), we orally administered either various doses of MPH or a placebo to the animals. Behavioral analyses revealed positive effects of MPH on task performance at specific doses. However, analyses of individual neurons activity, noise correlations, and neuronal ensemble activity using machine learning algorithms revealed no effects of MPH. Our results suggest that the positive behavioral effects of MPH observed in primates (including humans) may not be mediated by changes in the activity of caudal LPFC neurons. MPH may enhance cognitive performance by modulating neuronal activity in other regions of the attentional network in the primate brain.</p>

Abstract
<p>Processing of memory is supported by coordinated activity in a network of sensory, association, and motor brain regions. It remains a major challenge to determine where memory is encoded for later retrieval. Here, we used direct intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients performing free recall tasks to determine the temporal pattern and anatomical distribution of verbal memory encoding across the entire human cortex. High  frequency activity (65–115 Hz) showed consistent power responses during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words on a subset of electrodes localized in 16 distinct cortical areas activated in the tasks. More of the high  power during word encoding, and less power before and after the word presentation, was characteristic of successful recall and observed across multiple brain regions. Latencies of the induced power changes and this subsequent memory effect (SME) between the recalled and forgotten words followed an anatomical sequence from visual to prefrontal cortical areas. Finally, the magnitude of the memory effect was unexpectedly found to be the largest in selected brain regions both at the top and at the bottom of the processing stream. These included the language processing areas of the prefrontal cortex and the early visual areas at the junction of the occipital and temporal lobes. Our results provide evidence for distributed encoding of verbal memory organized along a hierarchical posterior-to-anterior processing stream.</p>

Abstract<p>Language difficulties have been reported in children and adolescents who were born very preterm (&lt; 32 weeks’ gestation) and associated with an atypical lateralisation of language processing, i.e. increased right-hemispheric engagement. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and spherical deconvolution tractography to study the hemodynamic responses associated with verbal fluency processing (easy and hard letter trials) and verbal fluency-related white matter fibre tracts in 64 very preterm born adults and 36 adult controls (mean age: 30 years). Tractography of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and frontal aslant tract (FAT) was performed. Tracts were quantified in terms of mean volume, hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy, and lateralisation, assessed using a laterality index to indicate hemispheric dominance. During verbal fluency fMRI, very preterm participants displayed decreased hemodynamic response suppression in both the <i>Easy &gt; Rest</i> and <i>Hard &gt; Rest</i> conditions, compared to controls, in superior temporal gyrus, insula, thalamus and sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere. At the whole-group level, decreased hemodynamic response suppression in the right sensorimotor cortex was associated with worse on-line performance on the hard letter trials. Increased left-laterality in the AF was present alongside increased right hemispheric hemodynamic response suppression in controls. When only right-handed participants were considered, decreased hemodynamic response suppression in the right superior temporal gyrus during hard letter trials was related to weaker left and right FAT white matter integrity in the preterm group only. These results show that verbal fluency is affected by altered functional lateralisation in adults who were born very preterm.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This is the first study to use both functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neuro-anatomy of verbal fluency in very preterm born adults. Less suppression of brain activation was observed in very preterm adults compared to controls in several brain regions during completion of both easy and hard verbal fluency trials. Furthermore, across all subjects, decreased brain activity suppression in the right sensorimotor cortex was associated with worse on-line performance on the hard letter trials. Increased left-laterality in the arcuate fasciculus, a language-related white matter tract, was present alongside increased right hemispheric brain activity suppression in controls. These findings suggest that alterations in the typical development of left-lateralisation in very preterm individuals are still present in adulthood.</p>

Abstract<p>We tend to re-live emotional experiences more richly in memory than more mundane experiences. According to one recent neurocognitive model of emotional memory, negative events may be encoded with a larger amount of sensory information than neutral and positive events. As a result, there may be more perceptual information available to reconstruct these events at retrieval, leading to memory reinstatement patterns that correspond with greater memory vividness and sense of recollection for negative events. In this commentary, we offer an alternative perspective on how emotion may influence such sensory cortex reinstatement that focuses on engagement of the noradrenergic (NE) and dopaminergic (DA) systems rather than valence. Specifically, we propose that arousal-related LC-NE system activation promotes the prioritization of the most salient features of an emotional experience in memory. Thus, a select few details may drive lower-level sensory cortical activity and a stronger sense of recollection for arousing events. By contrast, states of high behavioral activation, including novelty-seeking and exploration, may recruit the DA system to broaden the scope of cognitive processing and integrate multiple event aspects in memory. These more integrated memory representations may be reflected in higher-order cortical reinstatement at retrieval. Thus, the balance between activation in these neuromodulatory systems at encoding, rather than the valence of the event, may ultimately determine the quality of emotional memory recollection and neural reinstatement.</p><p><b>Significance Section</b> We tend to re-live emotional events more richly in memory than mundane experiences.

We studied the narrative recollections of memory-impaired patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage who took a 25-min guided walk during which 11 planned events occurred. The recollections of the patients, recorded directly after the walk, were compared with the recollections of controls tested directly after the walk (C1), after...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/ZeVozeJhIho" width="1" />

<p>This study analyzed serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) in 2 European cohorts of 312 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to investigate whether NfL are biomarkers of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) during natalizumab treatment. The cohort comprised 25 PML, 136 natalizumab‐treated, and 151 untreated MS patients. Patients subsequently developing PML had similar NfL to other natalizumab‐treated MS patients. At PML onset, NfL were 10‐fold higher than in the pre‐PML condition and in natalizumab‐treated or untreated MS patients, and NfL continued to increase until onset of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The results suggest that in natalizumab‐treated patients, NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML. Ann Neurol, 2019</p>

<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to examine the
association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and complex traits,
where both the sample size n and the number of SNPs p can be very large.
Recently, cross-trait polygenic risk score (PRS) method has gained extremely
popular for assessing genetic correlation of complex traits based on GWAS
summary statistics (e.g., SNP effect size). However, empirical evidence has
shown a common bias phenomenon that even highly significant cross-trait PRS can
only account for a very small amount of genetic variance (R^2 often &lt;1%). The
aim of this paper is to develop a novel and powerful method to address the bias
phenomenon of cross-trait PRS. We theoretically show that the estimated genetic
correlation is asymptotically biased towards zero when complex traits are
highly polygenic/omnigenic. When all p SNPs are used to construct PRS, we show
that the asymptotic bias of PRS estimator is independent of the unknown number
of causal SNPs m. We propose a consistent PRS estimator to correct such
asymptotic bias. We also develop a novel estimator of genetic correlation which
is solely based on two sets of GWAS summary statistics. In addition, we
investigate whether or not SNP screening by GWAS p-values can lead to improved
estimation and show the effect of overlapping samples among GWAS. Our results
may help demystify and tackle the puzzling "missing genetic overlap" phenomenon
of cross-trait PRS for dissecting the genetic similarity of closely related
heritable traits. We illustrate the finite sample performance of our
bias-corrected PRS estimator by using both numerical experiments and the UK
Biobank data, in which we assess the genetic correlation between brain white
matter tracts and neuropsychiatric disorders.

<p>Evolution has produced a multi-scale mosaic of interacting adaptive units.
Innovations arise when perturbations push parts of the system away from stable
equilibria into new regimes where previously well-adapted solutions no longer
work. Here we explore the hypothesis that multi-agent systems sometimes display
intrinsic dynamics arising from competition and cooperation that provide a
naturally emergent curriculum, which we term an autocurriculum. The solution of
one social task often begets new social tasks, continually generating novel
challenges, and thereby promoting innovation. Under certain conditions these
challenges may become increasingly complex over time, demanding that agents
accumulate ever more innovations.

Abstract<p>Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity is fundamental for working memory (WM), attention, and behavioral inhibition; however, a comprehensive understanding of the neural computations underlying these processes is still forthcoming. Towards this goal, neural recordings were obtained from the mPFC of awake, behaving rats performing an odor span task of WM capacity. Neural populations were observed to encode distinct task epochs and the transitions between epochs were accompanied by abrupt shifts in neural activity patterns. Putative pyramidal neuron activity increased earlier in the delay for sessions where rats achieved higher spans. Furthermore, increased putative interneuron activity was only observed at the termination of the delay thus indicating that local processing in inhibitory networks was a unique feature to initiate foraging. During foraging, changes in neural activity patterns associated with the approach to a novel odor, but not familiar odors, were robust. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct mPFC activity states underlie the delay, foraging, and reward epochs of the odor span task. Transitions between these states enable successful performance in dynamic environments placing strong demands on the substrates of working memory.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Working memory capacity is altered in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. In the present manuscript, we describe activity states of neurons in medial prefrontal cortex as well-trained rats perform the odor span task, which has been nominated as a task suitable for studying working memory capacity in rodents. Our results demonstrate dynamic and flexible activity patters during different epochs of the task (i.e., the delay period, foraging, reward collection, and after making errors). Our results bolster contemporary theories of the medial prefrontal cortex exhibiting metastable dynamics in complex environments. Disruptions in these dynamics may underlie some cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, including reduced working memory capacity.</p>

Abstract<p>Hippocampal place cells are known to have a key role in encoding spatial information. Aversive stimuli, such as predator odor, evoke place field remapping and a change in preferred firing locations. However, it remains unclear how place cells use positive or negative experiences to remap. We investigated whether CA1 place cells, recorded from behaving rats, remap randomly or whether their reconfiguration depends on the perceived location of the aversive stimulus. Exposure to trimethylthiazoline (TMT, an innately aversive odor), increased the amplitude of hippocampal beta oscillations in the two arms of the maze in which TMT exposure occurred. We found that a population of place cells with fields located outside the TMT arms increased their activity (extrafield spiking) in the TMT arms during the aversive episodes. Moreover, in the subsequent post-TMT recording, these cells exhibited a significant shift in their center of mass towards the TMT arms. The induction of extrafield plasticity was mediated by the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Photostimulation of the BLA triggered aversive behavior, synchronized hippocampal local field oscillations and increased the extrafield spiking of the hippocampal place cells for the first 100 ms after light delivery. Optogenetic BLA activation triggered an increase in extrafield spiking activity that was correlated with the degree of place field plasticity. Furthermore, BLA-mediated increase of the extrafield activity predicts the degree of subsequent field plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that that the remapping of hippocampal place cells during aversive episodes is not random but it depends on the location of the aversive stimulus.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Here, we successfully decoded the pattern of place field reconfiguration to an aversive experience after exposure to an innately aversive odor. For the first time, we reveal that the degree of place field plasticity closely correlates with the extrafield spiking rate during aversive episodes. Using a spatial optogenetic technique in behaving rats, we show that the link between aversive behavior and place field reconfiguration is mediated by the spatially confined activation of the basolateral amygdala. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus not only maps the spatial environment but also stores the affective value of experienced events.</p>

Abstract<p>During Pavlovian conditioning, if a cue (e.g., lever extension) predicts reward delivery in a different location (e.g., a food magazine), some individuals will come to approach and interact with the cue – a behavior known as sign tracking (ST) – and others will approach the site of reward, a behavior known as goal tracking (GT). In rats, the acquisition of ST vs. GT behavior is associated with distinct profiles of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but it is unknown whether it is associated with different patterns of accumbens neural activity. Therefore, we recorded from individual neurons in the NAc core during the acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of ST and GT behavior. Even though NAc dopamine is specifically important for the acquisition and expression of ST, we found that cue-evoked excitatory responses encode the vigor of both ST and GT behavior. In contrast, among sign trackers only, there was a prominent decrease in reward-related activity over the course of training, which may reflect the decreasing reward prediction error encoded by phasic dopamine. Finally, both behavior and cue-evoked activity were relatively resistant to extinction in sign trackers, as compared with goal trackers, although a subset of neurons in both groups retained their cue-evoked responses. Overall, the results point to the convergence of multiple forms of reward learning in the NAc.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> An individual’s tendency to interact with a cue that predicts reward – known as sign tracking – has been linked with impulsivity and addiction-related behaviors. Here, we show that, during learning, sign tracker rats – as compared with goal tracker rats, who preferentially interact with the site of reward – display different profiles of neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The evolution of NAc activity is uniquely linked to the acquisition of sign tracking, but not goal tracking; however, after learning, NAc activity reflects the vigor of both behaviors. These findings imply that sign tracking and goal tracking result from different learning processes and engage distinct neural circuits that partially overlap in the NAc.</p>

Abstract<p>Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency leads to obesity and metabolic deficiencies, largely due to the loss of melanocortin peptides. However, POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) are comprised of glutamatergic and GABAergic subpopulations. The developmental program, relative proportion and function of these two subpopulations are unresolved. To test whether glutamatergic POMC neurons serve a distinct role in maintaining energy homeostasis, we activated <i>Pomc</i> expression Cre-dependently in <i>Vglut2</i>-expressing neurons of mice with conditionally silenced <i>Pomc</i> alleles. The <i>Vglut2</i>-<i>Pomc</i> Restored mice had normal ARC <i>Pomc</i> mRNA levels, POMC immunoreactivity, as well as body weight and body composition at age 12 weeks. Unexpectedly, the cumulative total of <i>Vglut2<sup>+</sup></i> glutamatergic- and <i>Gad67<sup>+</sup> GABAergic</i>-<i>Pomc</i> neurons detected by in situ hybridization exceeded 100% in both <i>Vglut2</i>- <i>Pomc</i> Restored and Control mice, indicating that a subpopulation of <i>Pomc</i> neurons must express both neuronal markers. Consistent with this hypothesis, triple in situ hybridization of C57BL/6J hypothalami revealed that 35% of ARC <i>Pomc</i> neurons were selectively <i>Gad67</i><sup>+</sup>, 21% were selectively <i>Vglut2</i><sup>+</sup>, and 38% expressed both <i>Gad67</i> and <i>Vglut2</i>. The single <i>Gad67</i><sup>+</sup> and <i>Vglut2</i><sup>+</sup><i>Pomc</i> neurons were most prevalent in the rostral ARC, while the <i>Vglut2/Gad67</i><sup>+</sup> dual-phenotype cells predominated in the caudal ARC. A lineage trace using Ai9-tdTomato reporter mice to label fluorescently all <i>Vglut2</i>-expressing neurons showed equal numbers of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> and tdTomato<sup>-</sup> POMC immunoreactive neurons. Together, these data suggest that POMC neurons exhibit developmental plasticity in their expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, enabling re-establishment of normal energy homeostasis in the <i>Vglut2</i>-<i>Pomc</i> Restored mice.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Melanocortin peptides secreted from hypothalamic POMC neurons are anorexigenic and play a critical role in preventing obesity. However, POMC neurons are heterogeneous in their synaptic release of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. We used a conditional gene expression approach to test the hypothesis that these two subsets of POMC neurons influence distinct neural circuits controlling energy homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we found that <i>Vglut2</i>-IRES-Cre dependent <i>Pomc</i> restoration on a hypothalamic <i>Pomc</i> null background was sufficient to prevent obesity. A series of double- and triple-label in situ hybridization experiments showed that 38% of POMC neurons express both <i>Slc17a6</i> and <i>Gad67</i>, markers of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively. Together, these data suggest a previously unreported developmental plasticity in the neurotransmitter phenotype of POMC neurons.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>As communication signal properties change, through genetic drift or selective pressure, the sensory systems that receive these signals must also adapt to maintain sensitivity and adaptability in an array of contexts. Shedding light on this process helps us understand how sensory codes are tailored to specific tasks. In a species of weakly electric fish, <i>Apteronotus albifrons</i>, we examined the unique neurophysiological properties that support the encoding of electrosensory communication signals that the animal encounters in social exchanges. We compare our findings to known coding properties of the closely related species, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>, to establish how these animals differ in their ability to encode their distinctive communication signals. While there are many similarities between these two species, we found notable differences leading to relatively poor coding of the details of chirp structure occurring on high-frequency background beats. As a result, small differences in chirp properties are poorly resolved by the nervous system. We performed behavioral tests to relate <i>A. albifrons</i> chirp coding strategies to its use of chirps during social encounters. Our results suggest that <i>A. albifrons</i> do not exchange frequent chirps in non-breeding condition, particularly when the beat frequency is high. These findings parallel the mediocre chirp coding accuracy in that they both point to a reduced reliance on frequent and rich exchange of information through chirps during these social interactions. Therefore, our study suggests that neural coding strategies in the central nervous system vary across species in a way that parallels the behavioral use of the sensory signals.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE:</b> Sender-receiver matching is a phenomenon commonly observed in the peripheral nervous system. It enables communication production and reception to evolve together so that conspecifics remain sensitive to important signals. In this manuscript we examine this phenomenon in the central nervous system weakly electric fish <i>A. albifrons</i> and compare its processing of communication signals to a closely related species (<i>A. leptorhynchus)</i>. Although some differences across the two species can help tailor the system for processing species-specific signals, our data indicate that encoding of communication signals in <i>A. albifrons</i> is not as efficient as in <i>A. leptorhynchus</i> for certain categories of signals. Our data support the idea that the extent of sender-receiver matching can vary as a function of behavioral needs.</p>

Abstract<p>Multisensory effects are found when the input from single senses combines and this has been well-researched in the brain. Presently, we examined in humans the potential impact of visuo-proprioceptive interactions at the peripheral level, using microneurography, and compared it with a similar behavioral task. We used a paradigm where participants had either proprioceptive information only (no vision) or combined visual and proprioceptive signals (vision). We moved the foot to measure changes in the sensitivity of single muscle afferents, which can be altered by the descending fusimotor drive. Visual information interacted with proprioceptive information, where we found that for the same passive movement, the response of muscle afferents increased when the proprioceptive channel was the only source of information, as compared with when visual cues were added, regardless of the attentional level. Behaviorally, when participants looked at their foot moving, they more accurately judged differences between movement amplitudes, than in the absence of visual cues. These results impact our understanding of multisensory interactions throughout the nervous system, where the information from different senses can modify the sensitivity of peripheral receptors. This has clinical implications, where future strategies may modulate such visual signals during sensorimotor rehabilitation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> It is well known that multisensory processes occur in the brain, yet we know little about the consequences of multisensory interactions at the spinal level. We recorded from single muscle afferents, while participants either saw or did not see their foot moving. We show that adding visual information reduces muscle afferent firing, probably via descending commands by fusimotor efference. These results impact sensorimotor rehabilitation, where clinical strategies using exercises without visual feedback may promote proprioceptive training.</p>

<p>13 Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), also known as doublecortex syndrome,
is a 14 malformation of cortical development resulting from mutations in the
doublecortin gene 15 (DCX). It is characterized by a lack of migration of
cortical neurons that accumulate in the 16 white matter forming a heterotopic
band. Patients with SBH may present mild to moderate 17 intellectual disability
as well as epilepsy. The SBH condition can be modeled in rats by in 18 utero
knockdown (KD) of Dcx. The affected cells form an SBH reminiscent of that
observed in 19 human patients and the animals develop a chronic epileptic
condition in adulthood. Here, 20 we investigated if the presence of an SBH is
sufficient to induce cognitive impairment in 21

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>During early development, signaling centers, such as the cortical hem and the preoptic area (POA), are critical for telencephalic patterning. However, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of signal centers are poorly understood. Here, we report that the transcription factor <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span> is required to confine the POA, a resource of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonic Hedgehog</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Shh)</span> that is pivotal for ventral telencephalic development. Cell-specific deletion of <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span> achieved by crossing <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span><sup><span style="font-style: italic;">fl/fl</span></sup> with <span style="font-style: italic;">Dbx1-cre</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Nestin-CreER</span> combined with tamoxifen induction results in a dramatic expansion of the POA accompanied by the significantly increased activity of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Shh</span> signaling pathway. Ventral pattern formation was severely impaired. Moreover, we demonstrated that <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span> directly represses <span style="font-style: italic;">Dbx1</span> to restrict the POA. Furthermore, we found that the ventral pallium was expanded, which might also contribute to the observed patterning defects. These findings will improve our understanding of the maintenance of signal centers and help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ventral telencephalic patterning.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Chronic stress has been observed to increase the risk of developing depression and induce neuronal alterations of synaptic plasticity, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that the ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein HuR was up-regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice following chronic stress. In adult mice, AAV-Cre-mediated knockout of HuR in the mPFC prevented anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. HuR was also required for the stress-induced dendritic spine loss and synaptic transmission deficits. Moreover, <span style="font-style: italic;">HuR</span><sup><span style="font-style: italic;">flox/flox</span></sup>;<span style="font-style: italic;">Nex-Cre</span> mice, which induce HuR loss of function from embryonic development, exhibited enhanced synaptic functions. Notably, we ascertained RhoA signaling to be regulated by HuR and involved in the modulation of structural synaptic plasticity in response to chronic stress. Our results demonstrate HuR is a critical modulator for the regulation of stress-induced synaptic plasticity alterations and depression, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuropsychiatric disorders share susceptibility genes, suggesting a common origin. One such gene is <span style="font-style: italic;">CNTNAP2</span> encoding contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), which harbours mutations associated to autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Antibodies targeting CASPR2 have also been recently described in patients with several neurological disorders, such as neuromyotonia, Morvan’s syndrome, and limbic encephalitis. Despite the clear implication of <span style="font-style: italic;">CNTNAP2</span> and CASPR2 in neuropsychiatric disorders, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with alterations in CASPR2 function are unknown. Here, we show that Caspr2 is expressed in excitatory synapses in the cortex, and that silencing its expression <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> decreases the synaptic expression of α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methylisoxazole‐4‐propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Furthermore, Caspr2 loss of function blocks synaptic scaling <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span> and experience-dependent homoeostatic synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. Patient CASPR2 antibodies decrease the dendritic levels of Caspr2 and synaptic AMPA receptor trafficking, and perturb excitatory transmission in the visual cortex. These results suggest that mutations in <span style="font-style: italic;">CNTNAP2</span> may contribute to alterations in AMPA receptor function and homoeostatic plasticity, and indicate that antibodies from anti-CASPR2 encephalitis patients affect cortical excitatory transmission.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The somatosensory system has a hierarchical organization. Information processing increases in complexity from the contralateral primary sensory cortex to bilateral association cortices and this is represented by a sequence of somatosensory-evoked potentials recorded with scalp electroencephalographies. The mammalian somatosensory system matures over the early postnatal period in a rostro-caudal progression, but little is known about the development of hierarchical information processing in the human infant brain. To investigate the normal human development of the somatosensory hierarchy, we recorded potentials evoked by mechanical stimulation of hands and feet in 34 infants between 34 and 42 weeks corrected gestational age, with median postnatal age of 3 days. We show that the shortest latency potential was evoked for both hands and feet at all ages with a contralateral somatotopic source in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). However, the longer latency responses, localized in SI and beyond, matured with age. They gradually emerged for the foot and, although always present for the hand, showed a shift from purely contralateral to bilateral hemispheric activation. These results demonstrate the rostro-caudal development of human somatosensory hierarchy and suggest that the development of its higher tiers is complete only just before the time of normal birth.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the present combined DTI/fMRI study we investigated adaptive plasticity of neural networks involved in controlling spatial and nonspatial auditory working memory in the early blind (EB). In both EB and sighted controls (SC), fractional anisotropy (FA) within the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus correlated positively with accuracy in a one-back sound localization but not sound identification task. The neural tracts passing through the cluster of significant correlation connected auditory and “visual” areas in the right hemisphere. Activity in these areas during both sound localization and identification correlated with FA within the anterior corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radiation, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. In EB, FA in these structures correlated positively with activity in both auditory and “visual” areas, whereas FA in SC correlated positively with activity in auditory and negatively with activity in visual areas. The results indicate that frontal white matter conveys cross-modal suppression of occipital areas in SC, while it mediates coactivation of auditory and reorganized “visual” cortex in EB.</span>

Sharma et al. report context-specific ARNT2 transcription factor complexes that restrict activity-dependent transcription, and subsequent recruitment of somatic inhibition, to periods of increased membrane depolarization in pyramidal neurons. These mechanisms ensure that somatic inhibition scales appropriately with circuit activity.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
<i>LRRK2</i> mutations, the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease (PD), display incomplete penetrance, indicating the importance of other genetic and environmental influences on disease pathogenesis in <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers. The present study investigates whether urate, an antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, and inverse risk factor for idiopathic PD, is one such candidate biomarker of PD risk modulation in pathogenic <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Banked plasma samples or urate levels were obtained for 3 cohorts of age‐ and sex‐matched subjects with and without a known <i>LRRK2</i> mutation in PD and unaffected controls to conduct a pilot study of 192 subjects from the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium (LCC) and 2 validation studies of 380 additional subjects from the LCC and 922 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Urate levels were compared by multiple regression between subjects with and without a PD diagnosis conditional on <i>LRRK2</i> status, controlling for age and sex.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nonmanifesting <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers had significantly higher levels of urate than those who developed PD in each of the 3 independent cohorts. A meta‐analysis demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 0.62 mg/dL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with similar results for separate assessments of women (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.02) and men (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). A 2 mg/dL increment in urate concentration decreased the odds of having PD by approximately 50% (odds ratio = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings identify and substantiate urate as a biomarker of resistance to PD among <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers. Ann Neurol 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>High remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with high risk of ischemic heart disease, but whether this is also the case for ischemic stroke is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that high remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the general population.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 102,964 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with information on remnant cholesterol at baseline in 2003–2015 were included in a prospective, observational association study. Individuals were followed for up to 14 years, during which time 2,488 were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results were independently confirmed in 9,548 individuals enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991–1994; 983 ischemic strokes developed during up to 26 years of follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Step‐wise higher remnant cholesterol concentrations were associated with step‐wise higher ischemic stroke risk in the Copenhagen General Population Study, with multivariable adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.99 (95%confidence interval: 1.49–2.67) for individuals with remnant cholesterol concentrations ≥1.5 mmol/l (58 mg/dl), compared to individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5 mmol/l (19 mg/dl). Results were similar in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke at age 80 in the Copenhagen General Population Study ranged from 7.3% for individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5 mmol/l (19 mg/dl) to 11.5% for individuals with remnant cholesterol ≥1.5 mmol/l (58 mg/dl).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Individuals with high remnant cholesterol concentrations had higher risk of ischemic stroke. These results indicate that randomized clinical trials with remnant cholesterol lowering in individuals with high concentrations, with the aim of preventing ischemic strokes, are needed.

In recent years, comparative single-cell transcriptomics has opened up new research avenues addressing these issues. Here, we review recent conceptual progress toward an evolutionary definition of cell types, and how it facilitates the identification and large-scale comparison of neuronal types and neuron type families from single-cell data — with the family of GABAergic neurons in distinct parts of the vertebrate forebrain as prime example. We also highlight strategies to infer cell type-specific innovation, so-called apomeres, from single-cell data.</p></div>

Single-cell sequencing studies show that different neuronal cell types express distinct combinations of cell-surface proteins important for synaptic connectivity and function. Emerging evidence indicates that glia-derived cell-surface proteins play critical roles in shaping connectivity as well. These studies begin to suggest that the proteins present on presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, glial processes, and secreted into the synaptic cleft and extracellular matrix together confer unique surface identities to different types of synaptic connections. Here, we summarize recent findings demonstrating that cell-surface proteins derived from both neurons and glia interact and cooperate to control the connectivity, architecture and function of specific synapses.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Lalanti Venkatasubramanian, Richard S Mann</p><div><p>In order to generate complex motor outputs, the nervous system integrates multiple sources of sensory information that ultimately controls motor neurons to generate coordinated movements. The neural circuits that integrate higher order commands from the brain and generate motor outputs are located in the nerve cord of the central nervous system. Recently, genetic access to distinct functional subtypes that make up the <em>Drosophila</em> adult ventral nerve cord has significantly begun to advance our understanding of the structural organization and functions of the neural circuits coordinating motor outputs. Moreover, lineage-tracing and genetic intersection tools have been instrumental in deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate and assemble the functional units of the adult nerve cord. Together, the <em>Drosophila</em> adult ventral nerve cord is emerging as a powerful system to understand the development and function of neural circuits that are responsible for coordinating complex motor outputs.</p></div>

<p>This article introduces a model-agnostic approach to study statistical
synergy, a form of emergence in which patterns at large scales are not
traceable from lower scales. Our framework leverages various multivariate
extensions of Shannon's mutual information, and introduces the O-information as
a metric capable of characterising synergy- and redundancy-dominated systems.
We develop key analytical properties of the O-information, and study how it
relates to other metrics of high-order interactions from the statistical
mechanics and neuroscience literature. Finally, as a proof of concept, we use
the proposed framework to explore the relevance of statistical synergy in
Baroque music scores.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11236">Principal Component Analysis for seizure characterization in EEG signals. (arXiv:1902.11236v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>A large variety of methods has been proposed for automatic seizure detection
in EEG signals. Those achieving maximal performance are based on
machine-learning techniques, which require long training sessions with large
labelled databases, and produce a verdict with no intuitive justification. As
an alternative, we here explore an unsupervised algorithm applicable to
intra-cranial EEG recordings that requires good sampling of the non-ictal
periods, but imposes no demands on the amount of data during ictal activity.
The algorithm analyses how the amount of power in each frequency band
fluctuates ( an evaluation physicians are familiar with ) and can be
implemented online. The analysis is performed electrode by electrode, thus
providing the spatio-temporal sequence in which the affected regions are
recruited into the crisis. We test it with 32 crisis registered in 5 patients,
for which we also have the degree of loss of consciousness as determined from a
behavioural analysis. The method can achieve a precision of 85% and a recall of
88% in the identification of seizures, and 77% and 88% in the identification of
recruited electrodes. The intuitive nature of the analysis allows us to
identify certain physiological features that are correlated with the degree of
loss of consciousness. For example, epileptic crisis in which the variance of
the power in the alpha band increases at around seizure onset are particularly
likely to impair consciousness. We conclude that the PCA of the distribution of
power in different frequency bands provides information both about the
detection and the characterization of epileptic seizures.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neocortical astrogenesis follows neuronogenesis and precedes oligogenesis. Among key factors dictating its temporal articulation, there are progression rates of pallial stem cells (SCs) towards astroglial lineages as well as activation rates of astrocyte differentiation programs in response to extrinsic gliogenic cues. In this study, we showed that high Foxg1 SC expression antagonizes astrocyte generation, while stimulating SC self-renewal and committing SCs to neuronogenesis. We found that mechanisms underlying this activity are mainly cell autonomous and highly pleiotropic. They include a concerted downregulation of 4 key effectors channeling neural SCs to astroglial fates, as well as defective activation of core molecular machineries implementing astroglial differentiation programs. Next, we found that SC Foxg1 levels specifically decline during the neuronogenic-to-gliogenic transition, pointing to a pivotal Foxg1 role in temporal modulation of astrogenesis. Finally, we showed that Foxg1 inhibits astrogenesis from human neocortical precursors, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily ancient trait.</span>

The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula.

<p>Stroke robustly stimulates adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. It is currently unknown whether this process induces beneficial or maladaptive effects, but morphological and behavioral studies have reported aberrant neurogenesis and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory following stroke. However, the intrinsic function and network incorporation of adult-born granule cells (ABGCs) after ischemia is unclear. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we evaluated doublecortin-positive (DCX<sup>+</sup>) ABGCs as well as DCX<sup>–</sup> dentate gyrus granule cells 2 weeks after a stroke or sham operation in DCX<i>/</i>DsRed transgenic mice of either sex. The developmental status, intrinsic excitability, and synaptic excitability of ABGCs were accelerated following stroke, while dendritic morphology was not aberrant. Regression analysis revealed uncoupled development of intrinsic and network excitability, resulting in young, intrinsically hyperexcitable ABGCs receiving disproportionately large glutamatergic inputs. This aberrant functional maturation in the subgroup of ABGCs in the hippocampus may contribute to defective hippocampal function and increased seizure susceptibility following stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stroke increases hippocampal neurogenesis but the functional consequences of the postlesional response is mostly unclear. Our findings provide novel evidence of aberrant functional maturation of newly generated neurons following stroke. We demonstrate that stroke not only causes an accelerated maturation of the intrinsic and synaptic parameters of doublecortin-positive, new granule cells in the hippocampus, but that this accelerated development does not follow physiological dynamics due to uncoupled intrinsic and synaptic maturation. Hyperexcitable immature neurons may contribute to disrupted network integration following stroke.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1744?rss=1">Compulsive Alcohol Seeking Results from a Failure to Disengage Dorsolateral Striatal Control over Behavior</a></h4>

<p>The acquisition of drug, including alcohol, use is associated with activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, over the course of drug exposure the control over drug seeking progressively devolves to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms. The causal importance of this functional recruitment of aDLS in the switch from controlled to compulsive drug use in vulnerable individuals remains to be established. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the susceptibility to aDLS dopamine-dependent control over alcohol seeking predicts and underlies the development of compulsive alcohol seeking. Male alcohol-preferring rats, the alcohol-preferring phenotype of which was confirmed in an intermittent two-bottle choice procedure, were implanted bilaterally with cannulae above the aDLS and trained instrumentally on a seeking–taking chained schedule of alcohol reinforcement until some individuals developed compulsive seeking behavior. The susceptibility to aDLS dopamine control over behavior was investigated before and after the development of compulsivity by measuring the extent to which bilateral aDLS infusions of the dopamine receptor antagonist α-flupenthixol (0, 5, 10, and 15 μg/side) decreased alcohol seeking at different stages of training, as follows: (1) after acquisition of instrumental taking responses for alcohol; (2) after alcohol-seeking behavior was well established; and (3) after the development of punishment-resistant alcohol seeking. Only alcohol-seeking, not alcohol-taking, responses became dependent on aDLS dopamine. Further, marked individual differences in the susceptibility of alcohol seeking to aDLS dopamine receptor blockade actually predicted the vulnerability to develop compulsive alcohol seeking, but only in subjects dependent on aDLS dopamine-dependent control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over the course of addictive drug exposure, there is a transition in the control over drug seeking from ventral to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms, but it is unclear whether this is causally involved in the development of compulsive drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the reliance of alcohol seeking on aDLS dopamine predicts and underlies the emergence of compulsive alcohol seeking. We identified individual differences in the reliance of well established alcohol seeking, but not taking behavior, on aDLS mechanisms and also showed that this predicted the subsequent development of compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior. Thus, those individuals in whom alcohol seeking depended on aDLS mechanisms were vulnerable subsequently to display compulsivity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1733?rss=1">Beta and Theta Oscillations Differentially Support Free Versus Forced Control over Multiple-Target Search</a></h4>

<p>Many important situations require human observers to simultaneously search for more than one object. Despite a long history of research into visual search, the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with multiple-target search are poorly understood. Here we test the novel theory that the efficiency of looking for multiple targets critically depends on the mode of cognitive control the environment affords to the observer. We used an innovative combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking while participants searched for two targets, within two different contexts: either both targets were present in the search display and observers were free to prioritize either one of them, thus enabling proactive control over selection; or only one of the two targets would be present in each search display, which requires reactive control to reconfigure selection when the wrong target has been prioritized. During proactive control, both univariate and multivariate signals of beta-band (15–35 Hz) power suppression before display onset predicted switches between target selections. This signal originated over midfrontal and sensorimotor regions and has previously been associated with endogenous state changes. In contrast, imposed target selections requiring reactive control elicited prefrontal power enhancements in the delta/theta band (2–8 Hz), but only after display onset. This signal predicted individual differences in associated oculomotor switch costs, reflecting reactive reconfiguration of target selection. The results provide compelling evidence that multiple target representations are differentially prioritized during visual search, and for the first time reveal distinct neural mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control over multiple-target search.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Searching for more than one object in complex visual scenes can be detrimental for search performance. Although perhaps annoying in daily life, this can have severe consequences in professional settings such as medical and security screening. Previous research has not yet resolved whether multiple-target search involves changing priorities in what people attend to, and how such changes are controlled. We approached these questions by concurrently measuring cortical activity and eye movements using EEG and eye tracking while observers searched for multiple possible targets. Our findings provide the first unequivocal support for the existence of two modes of control during multiple-target search, which are expressed in qualitatively distinct time-frequency signatures of the EEG both before and after visual selection.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Structural and functional differences in brain hemispheric asymmetry have been well documented between female and male adults. However, potential differences in the connectivity patterns of the rich-club organization of hemispheric structural networks in females and males remain to be determined. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct hemispheric structural networks in healthy subjects, and graph theoretical analysis approaches were applied to quantify hemisphere and gender differences in rich-club organization. The results showed that rich-club organization was consistently observed in both hemispheres of female and male adults. Moreover, a reduced level of connectivity was found in the left hemisphere. Notably, rightward asymmetries were mainly observed in feeder and local connections among one hub region and peripheral regions, many of which are implicated in visual processing and spatial attention functions. Additionally, significant gender differences were revealed in the rich-club, feeder, and local connections in rich-club organization. These gender-related hub and peripheral regions are involved in emotional, sensory, and cognitive control functions. The topological changes in rich-club organization provide novel insight into the hemisphere and gender effects on white matter connections and underlie a potential network mechanism of hemisphere- and gender-based differences in visual processing, spatial attention and cognitive control.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the stop-signal task, an electrophysiological signature of action-stopping is increased early right frontal beta band power for successful vs. failed stop trials. Here we tested whether the requirement to stop an unwanted thought from coming to mind also elicits this signature. We recorded scalp EEG during a Think/No-Think task and a subsequent stop signal task in 42 participants. In the Think/No-Think task, participants first learned word pairs. In a second phase, they received the left-hand word as a reminder and were cued either to retrieve the associated right-hand word (“Think”) or to stop retrieval (“No-Think”). At the end of each trial, participants reported whether they had experienced an intrusion of the associated memory. Finally, they received the left-hand reminder word and were asked to recall its associated target. Behaviorally, there was worse final recall for items in the No-Think condition, and decreased intrusions with practice for No-Think trials. For EEG, we reproduced increased early right frontal beta power for successful vs. failed action stopping. Critically, No-Think trials also elicited increased early right frontal beta power and this was stronger for trials without intrusion. These results suggest that preventing a thought from coming to mind also recruits fast prefrontal stopping.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical activity is organized across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Most research on the dynamics of neuronal spiking is concerned with timescales of 1 ms–1 s, and little is known about spiking dynamics on timescales of tens of seconds and minutes. Here, we used frequency domain analyses to study the structure of individual neurons’ spiking activity and its coupling to local population rate and to arousal level across 0.01–100 Hz frequency range. In mouse medial prefrontal cortex, the spiking dynamics of individual neurons could be quantitatively captured by a combination of interspike interval and firing rate power spectrum distributions. The relative strength of coherence with local population often differed across timescales: a neuron strongly coupled to population rate on fast timescales could be weakly coupled on slow timescales, and vice versa. On slow but not fast timescales, a substantial proportion of neurons showed firing anticorrelated with the population. Infraslow firing rate changes were largely determined by arousal rather than by local factors, which could explain the timescale dependence of individual neurons’ population coupling strength. These observations demonstrate how neurons simultaneously partake in fast local dynamics, and slow brain-wide dynamics, extending our understanding of infraslow cortical activity beyond the mesoscale resolution of fMRI.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus is functionally heterogeneous between the dorsal and ventral subfields with left–right asymmetry. To determine the possible location of contextual memory, we performed an inhibitory avoidance task to analyze synaptic plasticity using slice patch-clamp technique. The training bilaterally increased the AMPA/NMDA ratio at dorsal CA3–CA1 synapses, whereas the training did not affect the ratio at ventral CA3–CA1 synapses regardless of the hemisphere. Moreover, sequential recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents from the same CA1 neuron clearly showed learning-induced synaptic plasticity. In dorsal CA1 neurons, the training dramatically strengthened both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses in both hemispheres, whereas the training did not promote the plasticity in either hemisphere in ventral CA1 neurons. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis further revealed that the training bilaterally increased the number of AMPA or GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor channels at dorsal CA1 synapses, but not at ventral CA1 synapses, suggesting functional heterogeneity of learning-induced receptor mobility. Finally, the performance clearly impaired by the bilateral microinjection of plasticity blockers in dorsal, but not ventral CA1 subfields, suggesting a crucial role for contextual learning. The quantification of synaptic diversity in specified CA1 subfields may help us to diagnose and evaluate cognitive disorders at the information level.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Affective disorders are associated with increased sensitivity to negative feedback that influences approach–avoidance decision making. Although neuroimaging studies of these disorders reveal dysregulation in primate cingulate areas 25 and 32 and the anterior hippocampus (aHipp), the causal involvement of these structures and their interaction in the primate brain is unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of localized pharmacological manipulations of areas 25 and 32 and/or the aHipp of the marmoset monkey on performance of an anxiolytic-sensitive instrumental decision-making task in which an approach–avoidance conflict is created by pairing a response with reward and punishment. During control infusions animals avoided punishment, but this bias was reduced by increasing glutamate release within the aHipp or area 32, and inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25. Conversely, increasing glutamate release in area 25 enhanced punishment avoidance but, in contrast to previous reports, area 32 and aHipp inactivations had no effect. Simultaneous inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25, but not area 32, abolished the reduced punishment avoidance seen after increasing aHipp glutamate. Besides providing causal evidence that these primate areas differentially regulate negative feedback sensitivity, this study links the decision-making deficits in affective disorders to aberrant aHipp–area 25 circuit activity.</span>

Recent decades have seen dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries, typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology that is used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms that are used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Scott A Alpizar, In Ha Cho, Michael B Hoppa</p><div><p>Ion channels are microscopic pore proteins in the membrane that open and close in response to chemical and electrical stimuli. This simple concept underlies rapid electrical signaling in the brain as well as several important aspects of neural plasticity. Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.</p></div>

Autophagosomes and endosomes sequester cellular cargo through different mechanisms, but these pathways converge upon fusion with lysosomes. Both pathways are spatially regulated, with distinct features evident in the soma, axons, and dendrites, possibly as an adaptation to the unique morphology of neurons and the specific demands of each compartment. Relatively little is known about how autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation interact and how their activities may be coordinated. We review our current understanding of autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation in neurons, highlighting common features and differences as well as the intersection of these two essential cellular pathways.</p></div>

The GABA<sub>A</sub>R pore-forming (α, β, and non-α/β) subunits were isolated approximately 30 years ago and have since been the focus of extensive studies. As a result, many properties of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, including subunit assembly and channel and pharmacological properties, have been discovered. However, several of the underlying mechanisms such as the process for the synaptic localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs remain unsolved. A reinvestigation of native GABA<sub>A</sub>R complexes in the brain and primary neurons identified two major molecular constituents, namely, the transmembrane GARLH/LHFPL protein family and the inhibitory synaptic protein neuroligin 2. This identification of the principal components of native receptor complexes may provide new mechanistic insight on receptor regulation.</p></div>

As such, transport of messenger RNAs serves as a set of blueprints for the synthesis of specific proteins at distal sites. RNA localization to dendrites and axons confers the ability to regulate translation with extraordinary precision in space and time. Although the rationale for RNA localization is quite compelling, it is unclear how a neuron orchestrates such a complex task of distributing over a thousand different mRNAs to their respective subcellular compartments. Recent single-molecule imaging studies have led to insights into the kinetics of individual mRNAs. We can now peer into the transport dynamics of mRNAs in both dendrites and axons.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Roeland Vanhauwaert, Vinita Bharat, Xinnan Wang</p><div><p>Neurons need to allocate and sustain mitochondria to provide adequate energy and sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering capacity in each sub specialization of their extensive arborizations. Damaged mitochondria, which are highly deleterious to the neuron, must be rapidly repaired or eliminated, even when they are left at terminals extremely far away from the soma. The unique shape of neurons complicates the tasks of both transporting and clearing mitochondria. Errors in the underlying molecular regulations cause detrimental neurodegeneration. Here, we review the molecular machinery and regulatory mechanisms employed to transport, distribute, and clear mitochondria in neurons, and how these fundamental regulations are compromised in neurological disorders.</p></div>
