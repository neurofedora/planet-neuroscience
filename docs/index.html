                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can initiate complex pathophysiological changes in the brain. Numerous cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologic changes are altered after injury, including those involved in energy utilization, excitotoxicity, ionic disturbances, and inflammation. It is thought that targeting multiple mechanisms may be necessary to produce meaningful reductions in brain pathology and to improve outcome. Previous studies have reported that the anti-diabetic drug metformin can also affect inflammatory, cell survival, and metabolic outcomes, possibly by acting on multiple targets and/or pathways. We therefore questioned whether metformin treatment can reduce pathology after repeat mild closed head injury (rmCHI) in male C57Bl/6 mice. We found that metformin, administered acutely after each head impact, resulted in markedly reduced white matter damage, astrogliosis, loss of hippocampal parvalbumin neurons, and improved mitochondrial function. In addition, both motor and cognitive functions were significantly improved when tested after discontinuation of the treatment. These studies suggest that metformin may be beneficial as a treatment for repeat concussion.</p>

                Background: Sepsis causes several immunological and metabolic alterations that induce oxidative stress. The modulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) has been shown to worsen this condition. Extract of cogon grass root (ECGR) contains flavonoids and isoeugenol compounds that exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to assess the effects of ECGR on FABP4 and oxidative stressârelated factors in a sepsis mouse model. Methods: Twenty-nine male mice (Mus musculus) of the Deutsche Denken Yoken strain were divided into four groups: group 1, control; group 2, mice treated with 10 Î¼L/kg body weight (BW) lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and groups 3 and 4, mice pre-treated with 90 and 115 mg/kg BW, respectively, and then treated with 10 Î¼L/kg BW LPS for 14 d. Blood, liver, lymph, and cardiac tissue samples were collected and subjected to histological and complete blood examinations. Antioxidant (Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) and superoxide dismutase), FABP4 levels, and immune system-associated biomarker levels (TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-1Î² ) were measured. Results: Significant increases in platelet levels (p = 0.03), cardiomyocyte counts (p =0.004), and hepatocyte counts (p = 0.0004) were observed in group 4 compared with those in group 2. Conversely, compared with those in group 2, there were significant decreases in TNF-Î± expression in group 3 (p = 0.004), white pulp length and width in group 4 (p = 0.001), FABP4 levels in groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.012, respectively), lymphocyte counts in group 4 (p = 0.009), and monocyte counts (p = 0.000) and polymorphonuclear cell counts in the livers (p = 0.000) and hearts (p = 0.000) of groups 3 and 4. GPx3 activity was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 (p = 0.04). Conclusions: ECGR reduces FABP4 level and modulating oxidative stress markers in sepsis mouse model.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Novel measures of Morris water maze performance that use vector field maps to assess accuracy, uncertainty, and intention of navigational searches</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Most commonly used behavioral measures for testing learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) involve comparisons of an animal's residence time in different quadrants of the pool. Such measures are limited in their ability to test different aspects of the animal's performance. Here, we describe novel measures of performance in the MWM that use vector fields to capture the motion of mice as well as their search pattern in the maze. Using these vector fields, we develop quantitative measures of performance that are intuitive and more sensitive than classical measures. First, we describe search patterns in terms of vector field properties and use these properties to define three metrics of spatial memory namely Spatial Accuracy, Uncertainty and, Intensity of Search. We demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using four different data sets including comparisons between different strains of mice, an analysis of two mouse models of Noonan syndrome (NS; <i>Ptpn11</i> D61G and <i>Ptpn11</i> N308D/+), and a study of goal reversal training. Importantly, besides highlighting novel aspects of performance in this widely used spatial task, our measures were able to uncover previously undetected differences, including in an animal model of NS, which we rescued with the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor SL327. Thus, our results show that our approach breaks down performance in the MWM into sensitive measurable independent components that highlight differences in spatial learning and memory in the MWM that were undetected by conventional measures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ultrasound findings in lateral elbow tendinopathy: A retrospective analysis of radiological tendon features [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET) is prevalent in the upper extremity, with various therapeutic options. Understanding the types and the relations between the radiological tendon features would help to develop more specific treatments. This study reviewed ultrasound exams of LET to investigate the types of degenerative findings and the relationships between them in one of the most prominent sports medicine clinics in Latin America. Methods:Â A retrospective study was performed. We evaluated 4335 ultrasonographic exams with LET from 2017 and 2018. Five principal degenerative ultrasound criteria with subtypes were selected: hypoechogenicity, neovascularity, calcification, enthesopathy, and intrasubstance tear. A multiple linear regression model was conducted to explore the association between the findings, sex, and age. Results: Overall, 4324 ultrasound exams were analyzed; 2607 (60.29%) were males. Multiple degenerative tendon findings were found in adults (â¥18 years) with LET. Hypoechogenicity (67.77%) and neovascularity (37.8%) were the most frequent. The mean length of a tendon tear in both sexes was 4.44 (Â± 2.81) millimeters. Mild hypoechogenicity (PÂ < .001), and depth intrasubstance tear (PÂ < .01) were statistically significant between them. Severe hypoechogenicity was associated with an increase in all tendon tear dimensions for length 1.37 ([95% Confidence interval (CI), 0.57, 2.17];Â PÂ < .001), for width 1.10 ([95% CI, 0.33, 1.87];Â PÂ < .01) and for depth 1.64 ([95% CI, 0.40, 2.88];Â PÂ < .01). Additional findings associated with an increase in the length dimension were 0.42 associated with focal neovascularity ([95% CI, 0.19, 0.65];Â PÂ < .001), and 0.71 associated with multiple neovascularity ([95% CI, 0.27, 1.15];Â PÂ < .01). Conclusions: Hypoechogenicity and neovascularity findings presented a positive association with the size of tendon tear in patients with LET. This study reaffirms the increased predominance of tendon tear during the 4th to 6th decades of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An initial âsnapshotâ of sensory information biases the likelihood and speed of subsequent changes of mind</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William Turner, Daniel Feuerriegel, Robert Hester, Stefan Bode</p>

We often need to rapidly change our mind about perceptual decisions in order to account for new information and correct mistakes. One fundamental, unresolved question is whether information processed prior to a decision being made (âpre-decisional informationâ) has any influence on the likelihood and speed with which that decision is reversed. We investigated this using a luminance discrimination task in which participants indicated which of two flickering greyscale squares was brightest. Following an initial decision, the stimuli briefly remained on screen, and participants could change their response. Using psychophysical reverse correlation, we examined how moment-to-moment fluctuations in stimulus luminance affected participantsâ decisions. This revealed that the strength of even the very earliest (pre-decisional) evidence was associated with the likelihood and speed of later changes of mind. To account for this effect, we propose an extended diffusion model in which an initial âsnapshotâ of sensory information biases ongoing evidence accumulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using population-specific add-on polymorphisms to improve genotype imputation in underrepresented populations</a></h4>

Genome-wide association studies rely on the statistical inference of untyped variants, called imputation, to increase the coverage of genotyping arrays. However, the results are often suboptimal in populations underrepresented in existing reference panels and array designs, since the selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may fail to capture population-specific haplotype structures, hence the full extent of common genetic variation. Here, we propose to sequence the full genomes of a small subset of an underrepresented study cohort to inform the selection of population-specific add-on tag SNPs and to generate an internal population-specific imputation reference panel, such that the remaining array-genotyped cohort could be more accurately imputed. Using a Tanzania-based cohort as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing improvements in imputation accuracy after the addition of our designed add-on tags to the base H3Africa array.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dominating lengthscales of zebrafish collective behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yushi Yang, Francesco Turci, Erika Kague, Chrissy L. Hammond, John Russo, C. Patrick Royall</p>

Collective behaviour in living systems is observed across many scales, from bacteria to insects, to fish shoals. Zebrafish have emerged as a model system amenable to laboratory study. Here we report a three-dimensional study of the collective dynamics of fifty zebrafish. We observed the emergence of collective behaviour changing between ordered to randomised, upon adaptation to new environmental conditions. We quantify the spatial and temporal correlation functions of the fish and identify two length scales, the persistence length and the nearest neighbour distance, that capture the essence of the behavioural changes. The ratio of the two length scales correlates robustly with the polarisation of collective motion that we explain with a reductionist model of selfâpropelled particles with alignment interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">C-type lectin 4 regulates broad-spectrum melanization-based refractoriness to malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maria L. SimÃµes, Yuemei Dong, Godfree Mlambo, George Dimopoulos</p>

<i>Anopheles gambiae</i> melanization-based refractoriness to the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> has rarely been observed in either laboratory or natural conditions, in contrast to the rodent model malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> that can become completely melanized by a TEP1 complement-like system-dependent mechanism. Multiple studies have shown that the rodent parasite evades this defense by recruiting the C-type lectins CTL4 and CTLMA2, while permissiveness to the human malaria parasite was not affected by partial depletion of these factors by RNAi silencing. Using CRISPR/Cas9-based CTL4 knockout, we show that <i>A</i>. <i>gambiae</i> can mount melanization-based refractoriness to the human malaria parasite, which is independent of the TEP1 complement-like system and the major anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> immune pathway Imd. Our study indicates a hierarchical specificity in the control of <i>Plasmodium</i> melanization and proves CTL4 as an essential host factor for <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> transmission and one of the most potent mosquito-encoded malaria transmission-blocking targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Microbial defenses against mobile genetic elements and viruses: Who defends whom from what?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eduardo P. C. Rocha, David Bikard</p>

Prokaryotes have numerous mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that mediate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between cells. These elements can be costly, even deadly, and cells use numerous defense systems to filter, control, or inactivate them. Recent studies have shown that prophages, conjugative elements, their parasites (phage satellites and mobilizable elements), and other poorly described MGEs encode defense systems homologous to those of bacteria. These constitute a significant fraction of the repertoire of cellular defense genes. As components of MGEs, these defense systems have presumably evolved to provide them, not the cell, adaptive functions. While the interests of the host and MGEs are aligned when they face a common threat such as an infection by a virulent phage, defensive functions carried by MGEs might also play more selfish roles to fend off other antagonistic MGEs or to ensure their maintenance in the cell. MGEs are eventually lost from the surviving host genomes by mutational processes and their defense systems can be co-opted when they provide an advantage to the cell. The abundance of defense systems in MGEs thus sheds new light on the role, effect, and fate of the so-called âcellular defense systems,â whereby they are not only merely microbial defensive weapons in a 2-partner arms race, but also tools of intragenomic conflict between multiple genetic elements with divergent interests that shape cell fate and gene flow at the population level.

                Priapism in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) appears to be an infrequent manifestation as well as a crucial emergency. Here, we report an 18-year-old male presenting with a persistent erection of the penis for 20 days. We evaluated and compared the reported cases within 20 years discussing the management of priapism in CML. Cytoreductive therapy followed by leukapheresis, the administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and intra-cavernosal blood aspiration may resolve the symptoms of priapism. Early intervention for cytoreduction and aspiration are the pivotal keys to successfully impeding the complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 risk perceptions and precautions among the elderly: A study of CALD adults in South Australia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coping with COVID-19 is a challenge for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) older adults. In Australia, little attention has been given to understanding associations between cultural contexts, health promotion, and socio-emotional and mental health challenges of older CALD adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have collected data from older CALD adults to examine their COVID-19 risk perceptions and its association with their health precautions, behavioural dimensions and emergency preparation. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in South Australia. The CALD population aged 60âyears and above were approached through 11 South Australian multicultural NGOs. Results: We provide the details of 155 older CALD South Australiansâ demographics, risk perceptions, health precautions (problem-and-emotion-focused), behavioural dimensions and emergency preparation.Â  The explanatory variables included demographic characteristics (age, gender, education and ethnicity); and risk perception (cognitive [likelihood of being affected] and affective dimension [fear and general concerns], and psychometric paradigm [severity, controllability, and personal impact]. The outcome measure variables were health precautions (problem-focused and emotion-focused), behavioral adaptions and emergency preparation. Conclusions: This dataset may help the researchers who investigate multicultural health or aged care in the pandemic and or who may have interest to link with other datasets and secondary use of this primary dataset in order to develop culturally tailored pandemic-related response plan. The data set is available from Harvard Dataverse.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Causes and consequences of psychological stress in the working life and emergency services of veterinary professionals in the Federal Republic of Germany: A protocol for a nationwide cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Veterinarians are exposed to high workloads. International studies show they have an above-average risk of suicide and burnout. Hardly any studies dealing with causes and consequences of workload and emergency services are available in Germany. Methods: The aim of the observational cross-sectional study presented here is to assess their workloads and working conditions (Slesina questionnaire), health situation and well-being (KÃPS questionnaire - physical, psychological and social symptoms; Maslach Burnout Inventory MBI-GS; WHO-5 well-being index), as well as occupational psychological aspects (irritation scales; overcommitment; questionnaire on work-related behavior and experience patterns AVEM) which will be recorded and analyzed according to general sociodemographic and occupational data (sector-, gender, assignment- and country-specific). In addition, the heart rate variability of some members of the veterinary profession will be analyzed using 24 hour electrocardiogram recordings, which together with the subjective insights into the stress situation from the questionnaires, will allow objective psychophysiological stress analyses. Conclusions: The results of the study will provide further empirical insights into the workloads and stresses faced by the veterinary profession in Germany, based on which important insights into this professional groupâs mental health can be identified. In this way, it should be possible to identify (mis)stress-triggering factors in the target groups, derive target group-specific recommendations for health-promoting work design, and identify approaches to veterinary studies and career selection.

                Background - The new increasing homeless lately consist of women, children, youth, the elderly and marginalized ethnic or migrant groups. Some of them are working and earn salaries, however, the income is not sufficient to live modestly. Purpose â The purpose of this research is to establish a desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness in the country. Design/methodology/approach â This is an exploratory descriptive method study which employed quantitative techniques.Â  The study employed a social ecological model to investigate behavior of homeless via multiple levels of influences including intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and public policy. Surveys have been conducted on sixty-five homeless individuals.Â  Findings â It was found that support systems and structures should be derived from the whole streams from families, communities, organizations and government. Employment opportunities, long-term shelters within the community places and highly demanded skills are needed to improve their living condition. Research limitations â This study is only focused on the socio-economic structures of the homeless in a capital city. Originality/value â This is an empirical research using a social ecological model for the homeless in the Kuala Lumpur area. Research on homeless study has received little attention and has yet to be fully explored.

A clinical practice article [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer have a generally known 5-year overall survival of approximately 58% with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). During the last decades, addition of Cisplatinum-based NAC in fit patients prior to radical cystectomy (RC), has significantly improved OS, compared to RC only. However, some published studies following NAC addition, describe an intermediate risk increase of thromboembolic events (TEEs). Placement of central venous access (CVA) before NAC has also been suggested as being a potential risk factor for thrombosis. We present a combination of images and cases from the Northern Swedish health region where three patients developed venous TEE after CVA placement for NAC-administration and found that the time until curable RC was prolonged circa one month each, with an addition of one RC cancelled. These are serious events and to our knowledge, there are no current guidelines on prevention of TEE before RC. The aim with this report was to provide examples of these events and conclude that further prospective trials are warranted on prevention and future guidelines regarding venous anticoagulant treatment for TEE that occur pre-RC in NAC-patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for prophylactic treatment in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A:Â a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved wit</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients with severe hemophilia often present with painful joint and soft tissue bleeding which may restrict them from their daily activities. The current standard of care still relies on a regular prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII), which has a high daily treatment burden. Recently, rurioctocog alfa pegol, a third-generation recombinant FVIII with a modification in its polyethylene glycol (PEG) component, has been developed. Several trials have studied this synthetic drug as bleeding prophylaxis in severe hemophilia A. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Methods: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA guidelines. Data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, and CINAHL (via EBSCOhost). Study qualities were assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Modified Jadad scales. Results: Four studies involving 517 previously treated severe hemophilia A patients were included in this study. The pooled mean of total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and hemostatic efficacy was 2.59 (95% CI = 2.04â3.14) and 92% (95% CI = 85%â97%), respectively. Only 30 (2.3%) non-serious and one (1.4%) serious adverse events were considered related to rurioctocog alfa pegol treatment. At the end of the studies, no development of FVIII inhibitory antibodies was observed. None of the developed binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, or PEG was correlated to the treatment efficacy and safety. Conclusions: Despite the limited availability of direct comparison studies, our analyses indicate that rurioctocog alfa pegol could serve as a safe and effective alternative for bleeding prophylaxis in previously treated hemophilia A patients. Moreover, it appears to have low immunogenicity, which further increases the safety profile of the drug in such clinical conditions.

                Background: This study aimed to determine whether people living in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia would prefer to continue the practice of physical distancing after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or to return to their previous way of life. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to October 2020 in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. A pre-tested questionnaire was sent electronically through social media. Data on participantsâ demographics and their perspectives regarding post-pandemic physical distancing were collected. The calculated sample size was 1,066; however, the total number of responses included in the analysis was 989. Results: The average age of the participants was 31.15Â±11.93 years. There were 435 men and 554 women in the study. Participants showed significantly high levels of disagreement with statements indicating that they were willing to use public transportation (61%), attend social gatherings (36%), and hug relatives or colleagues (40%) after the pandemic (p<0.001); however, 43% agreed that they would spend time with family or friends (p<0.001). The level of education was also found to be significantly related to the responses, and the level of disagreement increased as the level of education increased (p<0.001). Conclusions: One-third of the study participants planned to continue engaging in physical distancing even after the current pandemic and if the COVID-19 related restriction will remain in place for longer, there is chance to increase in this proportion. However, it cannot be concluded whether or not this behavior will prevail in the long run, after the ease in restrictions. If so, it may greatly affect some businesses and perhaps some social norms and values as well.

                Bruxism is a disease with a multifactorial etiology. Its clinical manifestations are most often an unaesthetic smile with abraded tooth surfaces, temporomandibular disorders and muscle hyperactivity. Here we present a case of bruxism where proper articulation of the occlusal splint was performed using the T-scan Novus system. A patient with bruxism underwent treatment with stabilization splint made by 3D printer technology. Intraoral scanning was performed using Trios Color (3Shape, 2014), and the digital design was achieved using the 3Shape Dental system design - splint studio. Formlabs Form 2 printer with biocompatible resin Dental LT Clear Resin was used for printing. The T-Scan Novus system with software attached to it, version 9.1, was used for digital examination of the occlusion. A 2.7 mm thick occlusal splint was developed, and the software adapted the occlusion with antagonists. After adjustment with T-Scan Novus, a reduction in disocclusion time of the patient was achieved, which is a desired result in the treatment of bruxism. The position of the joint components was proven radiologically. The treatment of bruxism with splint therapy continues to be the main method of treatment. Using digital technology allows for more accurate constructions and precise balancing of occlusal relationships.

                Background Acute and chronic child undernutrition is a continuous problem in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was initiated to compare the prevalence of underweight and its associated factors among children aged 6-23 months in the Kuyu district, North Shewa zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. Methods An observational community-based study was conducted on 612 children (304 from household security and 308 from household food insecurity). A structured and standardize questionnaire was used in this study. Anthropometric measurements were generated using WHO standardize. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent variables associated with underweight (weight-for-age) among children in household food security and insecurity, a p value less than 0.05 with 95%CI was considered as statistically significant. Results The results indicated that 30.9% [95%CI; 25.7, 36.2] and 36.7% [95% CI; 31.8, 42.5] of children were underweight for their age in household food security and insecurity. Low wealth status (AOR=3.2; 95%CI: 1.099, 9.275), poor dietary diets (AOR=5.2; 95%CI: 2.046, 13.27), and lack of breastfeeding for two years (AOR= 2.1; 95%CI= 1.78, 5, 42) were associated with underweight children in household food security. Whereas lack of antenatal care visits (AOR=0.52; 95%CI: 0.12, 0.68) and poor dietary diets (AOR=3.01; 95%CI= 2.1, 17.4) were other independent variables associated with underweight children in household food insecurity. Conclusions This study established that there was a high prevalence of underweight in children from Oromia. Â Therefore, introducing household income generating activities are vital interventions in order to overcome the problem of undernutrition in this region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving prediction of core transcription factors for cell reprogramming and transdifferentiation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Identification of transcription factors (TFs) that could induce and direct cell conversion remains a challenge. Though several hundreds of TFs are usually transcribed in each cell type, the identity of a cell is controlled and can be achieved through the ectopic overexpression of only a small subset of so-called core TFs. Currently, the experimental identification of the core TFs for a broad spectrum of cell types remains challenging. Computational solutions to this problem would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling cell identity during natural embryonic or malignant development, as well as give a foundation for cell-based therapy. Herein, we propose a computational approach based on over-enrichment of transcription factors binding sites (TFBS) in differentially accessible chromatin regions that could identify the potential core TFs for a variety of primary human cells involved in hematopoiesis. Our approach enables the integration of both transcriptomic (single-cell RNA sequencing, scRNA-seq) and epigenenomic (single-cell assay for transposable-accessible chromatin, scATAC-seq) data at the single-cell resolution to search for core TFs, and can be scalable to predict subsets of core TFs and their role in a given conversion between cells.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence from invasive cortical stimulation mapping and non-invasive neuroimaging studies indicates that brain function may be preserved within brain tumors. However, a non-invasive approach to accurately and comprehensively delineate individual-specific functional networks in the whole brain, especially in brain tissues within and surrounding tumors, is still lacking.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed an individual-specific functional network parcellation approach using resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) that effectively captured functional networks within and nearby tumors in 20 patients. We examined the accuracy of the functional maps using invasive cortical stimulation and task response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that approximately 33.2% of the tumoral mass appeared to be functionally active and demonstrated robust functional connectivity with non-tumoral brain regions. Functional networks nearby tumors were validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping. Intratumoral sensorimotor networks mapped by our technique could be distinguished by their distinct cortico-cerebellar connectivity patterns and were consistent with hand movement evoked fMRI task activations. Furthermore, in some patients, cognitive networks that were detected in the tumor mass showed long-distance and distributed functional connectivity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our non-invasive approach to mapping individual-specific functional networks using rsfMRI represents a promising new tool for identifying regions with preserved functional connectivity within and surrounding brain tumors, and could be used as a complement to presurgical planning for patients undergoing tumor resection surgery.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration: emerging concepts and methods</a></h4>

              
                The understanding of lysosomes has come a long way since the initial discovery of their role in degrading cellular waste. The lysosome is now recognized as a highly dynamic organelle positioned at the crossroads of cell signaling, transcription, and metabolism. Underscoring its importance is the observation that, in addition to rare monogenic lysosomal storage disorders, genes regulating lysosomal function are implicated in common sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimerâs disease (AD), Parkinsonâs disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

                Maternal obesity during pregnancy has immediate and long-term detrimental effects on the offspring heart. In this study, we characterized the cardiac and circulatory lipid profiles in late gestation E18.5 fetuses of diet-induced obese pregnant mice and established the changes in lipid abundance and fetal cardiac transcriptomics. We used untargeted and targeted lipidomics and transcriptomics to define changes in the serum and cardiac lipid composition and fatty acid metabolism in male and female fetuses. From these analyses we observed: (1) maternal obesity affects the maternal and fetal serum lipidome distinctly; (2) female fetal heart lipidomes are more sensitive to maternal obesity than males; (3) changes in lipid supply might contribute to early expression of lipolytic genes in mouse hearts exposed to maternal obesity. These results highlight the existence of sexually dimorphic responses of the fetal heart to the same <i>in utero</i> obesogenic environment and identify lipids species that might mediate programming of cardiovascular health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Breaking antimicrobial resistance by disrupting extracytoplasmic protein folding</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is one of the greatest threats to global health. New antibacterial strategies are urgently needed, and the development of antibiotic adjuvants that either neutralize resistance proteins or compromise the integrity of the cell envelope is of ever-growing interest. Most available adjuvants are only effective against specific resistance proteins. Here we demonstrate that disruption of cell envelope protein homeostasis simultaneously compromises several classes of resistance determinants. In particular, we find that impairing DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation incapacitates diverse Î²-lactamases and destabilizes mobile colistin resistance enzymes. Furthermore, we show that chemical inhibition of DsbA sensitizes multidrug-resistant clinical isolates to existing antibiotics and that the absence of DsbA, in combination with antibiotic treatment, substantially increases the survival of <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae infected with multidrug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. This work lays the foundation for the development of novel antibiotic adjuvants that function as broad-acting resistance breakers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosophila p53 isoforms have overlapping and distinct functions in germline genome integrity and oocyte quality control</a></h4>

              
                p53 gene family members in humans and other organisms encode a large number of protein isoforms whose functions are largely undefined. Using <i>Drosophila</i> as a model, we find that a p53B isoform is expressed predominantly in the germline where it colocalizes with p53A into subnuclear bodies. It is only p53A, however, that mediates the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation in the germline and soma. In contrast, p53A and p53B are both required for the normal repair of meiotic DNA breaks, an activity that is more crucial when meiotic recombination is defective. We find that in oocytes with persistent DNA breaks p53A is also required to activate a meiotic pachytene checkpoint. Our findings indicate that <i>Drosophila</i> p53 isoforms have DNA lesion and cell type-specific functions, with parallels to the functions of mammalian p53 family members in the genotoxic stress response and oocyte quality control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Epigenetic scores for the circulating proteome as tools for disease prediction</a></h4>

              
                Protein biomarkers have been identified across many age-related morbidities. However, characterising epigenetic influences could further inform disease predictions. Here, we leverage epigenome-wide data to study links between the DNAm signatures of the circulating proteome and incident diseases. Using data from four cohorts, we trained and tested epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 scores that explained between 1% and 58% of the variance in protein levels after adjusting for known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) genetic effects. By projecting these EpiScores into an independent sample, (Generation Scotland; n=9,537) and relating them to incident morbidities over a follow-up of 14 years, we uncovered 137 EpiScore â disease associations. These associations were largely independent of immune cell proportions, common lifestyle and health factors and biological aging. Notably, we found that our diabetes-associated EpiScores highlighted previous top biomarker associations from proteome-wide assessments of diabetes. These EpiScores for protein levels can therefore be a valuable resource for disease prediction and risk stratification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Disruption of PIKFYVE causes congenital cataract in human and zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Congenital cataract, an ocular disease predominantly occurring within the first decade of life, is one of the leading causes of blindness in children. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of congenital cataract remain incompletely defined. Through whole-exome sequencing of a Chinese family with congenital cataract, we identified a potential pathological variant (p.G1943E) in <i>PIKFYVE</i>, which is located in the PIP kinase domain of the PIKFYVE protein. We demonstrated that heterozygous/homozygous disruption of PIKFYVE kinase domain, instead of overexpression of <i>PIKFYVE<sup>G1943E</sup></i> in zebrafish mimicked the cataract defect in human patients, suggesting that haploinsufficiency, rather than dominant-negative inhibition of PIKFYVE activity caused the disease. Phenotypical analysis of <i>pikfyve</i> zebrafish mutants revealed that loss of Pikfyve caused aberrant vacuolation (accumulation of Rab7<sup>+</sup>Lc3<sup>+</sup> amphisomes) in lens cells, which was significantly alleviated by treatment with the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1). Collectively, we identified <i>PIKFYVE</i> as a novel causative gene for congenital cataract and pinpointed the potential application of Baf-A1 for the treatment of congenital cataract caused by PIKFYVE deficiency.

                Here, we report the generation and characterization of a novel Huntingtonâs disease (HD) mouse model BAC226Q by using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system, expressing full-length human HTT with ~226 CAG-CAA repeats and containing endogenous human HTT promoter and regulatory elements. BAC226Q recapitulated a full-spectrum of age-dependent and progressive HD-like phenotypes without unwanted and erroneous phenotypes. BAC226Q mice developed normally, and gradually exhibited HD-like psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes at 2 months. From 3 to 4 months, BAC226Q mice showed robust progressive motor deficits. At 11 months, BAC226Q mice showed significant reduced life span, gradual weight loss and exhibited neuropathology including significant brain atrophy specific to striatum and cortex, striatal neuronal death, widespread huntingtin inclusions, and reactive pathology. Therefore, the novel BAC226Q mouse accurately recapitulating robust, age-dependent, progressive HD-like phenotypes will be a valuable tool for studying disease mechanisms, identifying biomarkers, and testing gene-targeting therapeutic approaches for HD.

                In silico modelling revealed how only three Spike mutations of maVie16 enhanced interaction with murine ACE2. MaVie16 induced profound pathology in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and the resulting mouse COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) replicated critical aspects of human disease, including early lymphopenia, pulmonary immune cell infiltration, pneumonia and specific adaptive immunity. Inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines IFNg and TNF substantially reduced immunopathology. Importantly, genetic ACE2-deficiency completely prevented mCOVID-19 development. Finally, inhalation therapy with recombinant ACE2 fully protected mice from mCOVID-19, revealing a novel and efficient treatment. Thus, we here present maVie16 as a new tool to model COVID-19 for the discovery of new therapies and show that disease severity is determined by cytokine-driven immunopathology and critically dependent on ACE2 <i>in vivo</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Shallow neural networks trained to detect collisions recover features of visual loom-selective neurons</a></h4>

              
                Animals have evolved sophisticated visual circuits to solve a vital inference problem: detecting whether or not a visual signal corresponds to an object on a collision course. Such events are detected by specific circuits sensitive to visual looming, or objects increasing in size. Various computational models have been developed for these circuits, but how the collision-detection inference problem itself shapes the computational structures of these circuits remains unknown. Here, inspired by the distinctive structures of LPLC2 neurons in the visual system of Drosophila, we build anatomically-constrained shallow neural network models and train them to identify visual signals that correspond to impending collisions. Surprisingly, the optimization arrives at two distinct, opposing solutions, only one of which matches the actual dendritic weighting of LPLC2 neurons. Both solutions can solve the inference problem with high accuracy when the population size is large enough. The LPLC2-like solutions reproduces experimentally observed LPLC2 neuron responses for many stimuli, and reproduces canonical tuning of loom sensitive neurons, even though the models are never trained on neural data. Thus, LPLC2 neuron properties and tuning are predicted by optimizing an anatomically-constrained neural network to detect impending collisions. More generally, these results illustrate how optimizing inference tasks that are important for an animal's perceptual goals can reveal and explain computational properties of specific sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis of Plasmodium vivax inhibition by antibodies binding to the circumsporozoite protein repeats</a></h4>

              
                Malaria is a global health burden, with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> (Pv) responsible for the majority of infections worldwide. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is the most abundant protein on the surface of <i>Plasmodium</i> sporozoites, and antibodies targeting the central repeat region of CSP can prevent parasite infection. Although much has been uncovered about the molecular basis of antibody recognition of the PfCSP repeats, data remains scarce for PvCSP. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for peptides comprising the PvCSP repeats from strains VK210 and VK247 to reveal how the PvCSP central repeats are highly disordered, with minor propensities to adopt turn conformations. Next, we solved eight crystal structures to unveil the interactions of two inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2F2 and 2E10.E9, with PvCSP repeats. Both antibodies can accommodate subtle sequence variances in the repeat motifs and recognize largely coiled peptide conformations that also contain isolated turns. Our structural studies uncover various degrees of Fab-Fab homotypic interactions upon recognition of the PvCSP central repeats by these two inhibitory mAbs, similar to potent mAbs against PfCSP. These findings augment our understanding of host-<i>Plasmodium</i> interactions, and contribute molecular details of Pv inhibition by mAbs to unlock structure-based engineering of PvCSP-based vaccines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Invariance in pitch perception</a></h4>

              
                Information in speech and music is often conveyed through changes in fundamental frequency (f0), the perceptual correlate of which is known as "pitch". One challenge of extracting this information is that such sounds can also vary in their spectral content due to the filtering imposed by a vocal tract or instrument body. Pitch is envisioned as invariant to spectral shape, potentially providing a solution to this challenge, but the extent and nature of this invariance remain poorly understood. We examined the extent to which human pitch judgments are invariant to spectral differences between natural sounds. Listeners performed up/down and interval discrimination tasks with spoken vowels, instrument notes, or synthetic tones, synthesized to be either harmonic or inharmonic (lacking a well-defined f0). Listeners were worse at discriminating pitch across different vowel and instrument sounds compared to when vowels/instruments were the same, being biased by differences in the spectral centroids of the sounds being compared. However, there was no interaction between this effect and that of inharmonicity. In addition, this bias decreased when sounds were separated by short delays. This finding suggests that the representation of a sound's pitch is itself unbiased, but that pitch comparisons between sounds are influenced by changes in timbre, the effect of which weakens over time. Pitch representations thus appears to be relatively invariant to spectral shape. But relative pitch judgments are not, even when spectral shape variation is naturalistic, and when such judgments are based on representations of the f0.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detailed measurements and simulations of electric field distribution of two TMS coils cleared for obsessive compulsive disorder in the brain and in specific regions associated with OCD</a></h4>

              
                The FDA cleared deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (Deep TMS) with the H7 coil for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment, following a double-blinded placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Two years later the FDA cleared TMS with the D-B80 coil on the basis of substantial equivalence. In order to investigate the induced electric field characteristics of the two coils, these were placed at the treatment position for OCD over the prefrontal cortex of a head phantom, and the field distribution was measured. Additionally, numerical simulations were performed in eight Population Head Model repository models with two sets of conductivity values and three Virtual Population anatomical head models and their homogeneous versions. The H7 was found to induce significantly higher maximal electric fields (p<0.0001, t=11.08) and to stimulate two to five times larger volumes in the brain (p<0.0001, t=6.71). The rate of decay of electric field with distance is significantly slower for the H7 coil (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). The field at the scalp is 306% of the field at a 3 cm depth with the D-B80, and 155% with the H7 coil. The H7 induces significantly higher intensities in broader volumes within the brain and in specific brain regions known to be implicated in OCD (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA)) compared to the D-B80.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparable human spatial memory distortions in physical, desktop virtual and immersive virtual environments</a></h4>

              
                Boundaries define regions of space and are integral to episodic memories. The impact of boundaries on spatial memory and neural representations of space has been extensively studied in freely-moving rodents. But less is known in humans and many prior studies have employed desktop virtual reality (VR) which lacks the body-based self-motion cues of the physical world, diminishing the potentially strong input from path integration to spatial memory. We replicated a desktop-VR study testing the impact of boundaries on spatial memory (Hartley et al., 2004) in a physical room (2.4m x 2.4m, 2m tall) by having participants (N = 27) learn the location of a circular stool and then after a short delay replace it where they thought they had found it. During the delay, the wall boundaries were either expanded or contracted. We compared performance to groups of participants undergoing the same procedure in a laser-scanned replica in both desktop VR (N = 44) and freely-walking head mounted display (HMD) VR (N = 39) environments. Performance was measured as goodness of fit between the spatial distributions of group responses and seven modelled distributions that prioritised different metrics based on boundary geometry or walking paths to estimate the stool location. The best fitting model was a weighted linear combination of all the geometric spatial models, but an individual model derived from place cell firing in Hartley et al. 2004 also fit well. High levels of disorientation in all three environments prevented detailed analysis on the contribution of path integration. We found identical model fits across the three environments, though desktop VR and HMD-VR appeared more consistent in spatial distributions of group responses than the physical environment and displayed known variations in virtual depth perception. Thus, while human spatial representation appears differentially influenced by environmental boundaries, the influence is similar across virtual and physical environments. Despite differences in body-based cue availability, desktop and HMD-VR allow a good and interchangeable approximation for examining human spatial memory in small-scale physical environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of Yap1 in adult neural stem cell activation</a></h4>

              
                Most adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) remain quiescent with only a minor portion undergoing active proliferation and neurogenesis. The molecular mechanisms that trigger eventually the transition from quiescence to activation are still poorly understood. Here, we found the activity of the transcriptional activator Yap1 to be enriched in active NSCs. Genetic deletion of Yap1 led to a significant reduction in the relative proportion of active NSCs supporting a physiological role of Yap1 in regulating the transition from quiescence to activation. Overexpression of wild type Yap1 in adult NSCs did not induce NSC activation suggesting tight upstream control mechanisms, but overexpression of a gain-of-function mutant (Yap1-5SA) elicited cell cycle entry in NSCs and hilar astrocytes. Consistent with a role of Yap1 in NSC activation, single cell RNA sequencing revealed the partial induction of an activated NSC gene expression program. Yet, Yap1-5SA expression also induced Taz and other key components of the Yap/Taz regulon previously identified in glioblastoma stem cell-like cells. Consequently, dysregulated Yap1 activity led to repression of hippocampal neurogenesis, promoting aberrant differentiation instead.

                Viral tracers that permit efficient retrograde targeting of projection neurons are powerful vehicles for structural and functional dissections of the neural circuit and for the treatment of brain diseases. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are the most potential candidates because they are low-toxic with high-level transgene expression and minimal host immune responses. Currently, some rAAVs based on capsid engineering for retrograde tracing have been widely used in the analysis and manipulation of neural circuits, but suffer from brain area selectivity and inefficient retrograde transduction in certain neural connections. Here, we discovered that the recombinant adeno-associated virus 11 (rAAV11) exhibits potent retrograde labeling of projection neurons with enhanced efficiency to rAAV2-retro in some neural connections. Combined with calcium recording technology, rAAV11 can be used to monitor neuronal activities by expressing Cre recombinase or calcium-sensitive functional probe. In addition, we further showed the suitability of rAAV11 for astrocyte targeting. These properties make rAAV11 a promising tool for the mapping and manipulation of neural circuits and gene therapy of some neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.

                Loss-of-function GRN mutations result in progranulin haploinsufficiency and are a common cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are emerging as a promising therapeutic modality for neurological diseases, but ASO-based strategies for increasing target protein levels are still relatively limited. Here, we report the use of ASOs to increase progranulin protein levels by targeting the miR-29b binding site in the 3' UTR of the GRN mRNA, resulting in increased translation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Precision Functional Atlas of Network Probabilities and Individual-Specific Network Topography</a></h4>

              
                The brain is organized into a broad set of functional neural networks. These networks and their various characteristics have been described and scrutinized through in vivo resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). While the basic properties of networks are generally similar between healthy individuals, there is vast variability in the precise topography across the population. These individual differences are often lost in population studies due to population averaging which assumes topographical uniformity. We leveraged precision brain mapping methods to establish a new open-source, method-flexible set of probabilistic functional network atlases: the Masonic Institute for the Developing Brain (MIDB) Precision Atlas. Using participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, single subject precision maps were generated with two supervised network-matching procedures (template matching and non-negative matrix factorization), as well as an unsupervised community detection algorithm (Infomap). We demonstrate that probabilistic network maps generated for two demographically-matched groups of n~3000 each were nearly identical, both between groups (Pearson r >0.999) and between methods (r=0.96), revealing both regions of high invariance and high variability. Compared to using parcellations based on groups averages, the MIDB Precision Atlases allowed us to derive a set of brain regions that are largely invariant in network topography and provide more reproducible statistical maps of executive function brain-wide associations. We explore an example use case for probabilistic maps, highlighting their potential for use in targeted neuromodulation. The MIDB Precision Atlas is expandable to alternative datasets and methods and is provided open-source with an online web interface to encourage the scientific community to experiment with probabilistic atlases and individual-specific topographies to more precisely relate network phenomenon to functional organization of the human brain.

                Vision plays a crucial role in instructing the brain's spatial navigation systems. However, little is known about how vision loss affects the neuronal encoding of spatial information. Here, recording from head direction (HD) cells in the anterior dorsal nucleus of the thalamus in mice, we find stable and robust HD tuning in blind animals. In contrast, placing sighted animals in darkness significantly impairs HD cell tuning. We find that blind mice use olfactory cues to maintain stable HD tuning and that prior visual experience leads to refined HD cell tuning in blind adult mice compared to congenitally blind animals. Finally, in the absence of both visual and olfactory cues, the HD attractor network remains intact but the preferred firing direction of HD cells continuously drifts over time. We thus demonstrate remarkable flexibility in how the brain uses diverse sensory information to generate a stable directional representation of space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced food motivation in obese mice is controlled by D1R expressing spiny projection neurons in the nucleus accumbens.</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is a chronic relapsing disorder that is caused by an excess of caloric intake relative to energy expenditure. In addition to homeostatic feeding mechanisms, there is growing recognition of the involvement of food reward and motivation in the development of obesity. However, it remains unclear how brain circuits that control food reward and motivation are altered in obese animals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that signaling through pro-motivational circuits in the core of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is enhanced in the obese state, leading to invigoration of food seeking. Using a novel behavioral assay that quantifies physical work during food seeking, we confirmed that obese mice work harder than lean mice to obtain food, consistent with an increase in the relative reinforcing value of food in the obese state. To explain this behavioral finding, we recorded neural activity in the NAc core with both in vivo electrophysiology and cell-type specific calcium fiber photometry. Here we observed greater activation of D1-receptor expressing NAc spiny projection neurons (NAc D1SPNs) during food seeking in obese mice relative to lean mice. With ex vivo slice physiology we identified both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms that contribute to this enhancement in NAc D1SPN activity in obese mice. Finally, blocking synaptic transmission from D1SPNs decreased physical work during food seeking and attenuated high-fat diet-induced weight gain. These experiments demonstrate that obesity is associated with a selective increase in the activity of D1SPNs during food seeking, which enhances the vigor of food seeking. This work also establishes the necessity of D1SPNs in the development of diet-induced obesity, identifying a novel potential therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parent-Child Autonomic Synchrony During Vicarious Extinction Learning in Pediatric PTSD</a></h4>

              
                Children must learn basic functional processes directly from their caregivers and child psychopathology may disrupt this transmission. This transmission may be seen through biological measures like peripheral nervous system outputs like skin conductance (SCR). Fear learning deficits have been seen in affective disorders like PTSD and are useful for studying parent-child learning transmission. Our study uses a vicarious fear extinction paradigm to study if biological synchrony (SCR and heart rate variability (HRV)) are potential mechanisms in which children learn safety cues from their parents. There were 16 dyads (PTSD n=11, TD n=5) undergoing a vicarious fear extinction paradigm. We used cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) to assess SCR and HRV synchrony between parent-child dyads. We then used a linear model looking at group differences between PTSD dyads and typically developing (TD) dyads. For SCR, we saw a significant group difference (p=.037) indicating that TD dyads had higher SCR synchrony compared to PTSD dyads. For HRV, there were no group differences between PTSD and TD dyads (p=.325). These results suggest that SCR synchrony, but not HRV, may be a potential mechanism that allows for fear and safety learning in youth. While this is preliminary, it may give the first insights on how therapies such as Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy critically rely on parental coaching to model appropriate fear responses to help their child to recover from trauma.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exogenous capture accounts for fundamental differences between prosaccade and antisaccade performance</a></h4>

              
                Oculomotor circuits generate eye movements based on the physical salience of objects and current behavioral goals, exogenous and endogenous influences, respectively. However, the interactions between exogenous and endogenous mechanisms and their dynamic contributions to target selection have been difficult to resolve because they evolve extremely rapidly. In a recent study (Salinas et al., 2019), we achieved the necessary temporal precision using an urgent variant of the antisaccade task wherein motor plans are initiated early and choice accuracy depends sharply on when exactly the visual cue information becomes available. Empirical and modeling results indicated that the exogenous signal arrives ~80 ms after cue onset and rapidly accelerates the (incorrect) plan toward the cue, whereas the informed endogenous signal arrives ~25 ms later to favor the (correct) plan away from the cue. Here, we scrutinize a key mechanistic hypothesis about this dynamic, that the exogenous and endogenous signals act at different times and independently of each other. We test quantitative model predictions by comparing the performance of human participants instructed to look toward a visual cue versus away from it under high urgency. We find that, indeed, the exogenous response is largely impervious to task instructions; it simply flips its sign relative to the correct choice, and this largely explains the drastic differences in psychometric performance between the two tasks. Thus, saccadic choices are strongly dictated by the alignment between salience and behavioral goals.

                Among the features of cisplatin chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy are chronic pain and innocuous mechanical hypersensitivity. The complete etiology of the latter remains unknown. Here, we show that cisplatin targets a heterogeneous population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) primary afferent dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs) within the primary afferent dorsal root ganglia in mice, determined using single-cell transcriptome and electrophysiological analyses. TH+ DRGNs regulate innocuous mechanical sensation through C-low threshold mechanoreceptors. A differential assessment of wild-type and vitamin E deficient TH+ DRGNs revealed heterogeneity and specific functional phenotypes. The TH+ DRGNs comprise; fast-adapting eliciting one action potential (AP; 1-AP), moderately-adapting (>=2-APs), in responses to square-pulse current injection, and spontaneously firing (SF). Cisplatin increased the input resistance and AP frequency but reduced the temporal coding feature of 1-AP and >= 2-APs neurons. By contrast, cisplatin has no measurable effect on the SF neurons. Vitamin E reduced the cisplatin-mediated increased excitability, but did not improve the TH+ neuron temporal coding properties. Cisplatin mediates its effect by targeting outward K+ current, likely carried by through K2P18.1 (Kcnk18), discovered through the differential transcriptome studies and heterologous expression. Studies show a potential new cellular target for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and implicate the possible neuroprotective effects of vitamin E in cisplatin chemotherapy.

                In addition to its critical role in encoding individual episodes, the hippocampus is capable of extracting regularities across experiences. This ability is central to category learning, and a growing literature indicates that the hippocampus indeed makes important contributions to this kind of learning. Using a neural network model that mirrors the anatomy of the hippocampus, we investigated the mechanisms by which the hippocampus may support novel category learning. We simulated three category learning paradigms and evaluated the network's ability to categorize and to recognize specific exemplars in each. We found that the trisynaptic pathway within the hippocampus-connecting entorhinal cortex to dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1-was critical for remembering individual exemplars, reflecting the rapid binding and pattern separation functions of this circuit. The monosynaptic pathway from entorhinal cortex to CA1, in contrast, was responsible for detecting the regularities that define category structure, made possible by the use of distributed representations and a slower learning rate. Together, the simulations provide an account of how the hippocampus and its constituent pathways support novel category learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A whole-cell recording database of neuromodulatory action in the adult neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Background: The recent release of two large intracellular electrophysiological databases now allows high-dimensional systematic analysis of mechanisms of information processing in the neocortex. Here, to complement these efforts, we introduce a freely and publicly available database that provides a comparative insight into the role of various neuromodulatory transmitters in controlling neural information processing. Findings: A database of in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from primary somatosensory and motor cortices (layers 2/3) of the adult mice (2-15 months old) from both sexes is introduced. A total of 464 current-clamp experiments from identified excitatory and inhibitory neurons are provided. Experiments include recordings with (i) Step-and-Hold protocol during which the current was transiently held at 10 steps, gradually increasing in amplitude, (ii) 'Frozen Noise' injections that model the amplitude and time-varying nature of synaptic inputs to a neuron in biological networks. All experiments follow a within neuron across drug design which includes a vehicle control and a modulation of one of the following targets in the same neuron: dopamine and its receptors D1R, D2R, serotonin 5HT1f receptor, norepinephrine Alpha1, and acetylcholine M1 receptors. Conclusions: This dataset is the first to provide a systematic and comparative insight into the role of the selected neuromodulators in controlling cellular excitability. The data will help to mechanistically address how bottom-up information processing can be modulated, providing a reference for studying neural coding characteristics and revealing the contribution of neuromodulation to information processing.

                Background: Cortical neuron loss is a pathological hallmark of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear which neuronal subtypes are most vulnerable to degeneration and contribute most to cognitive decline. Methods: We analyzed postmortem bulk brain RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) data collected from three studies of aging and AD comprising six neocortical regions (704 individuals; 1037 samples). We estimated relative cell type proportions from each brain sample using neuronal subclass-specific marker genes derived from ultra-high depth single-nucleus RNAseq data (snRNAseq). We associated cell type proportions with AD across all samples using mixed-effects mega-analyses. Bulk tissue analyses were complemented by analyses of three AD snRNAseq datasets using the same cell type definitions and diagnostic criteria (51 individuals). Lastly, we identified cell subtype associations with specific neuropathologies, cognitive decline, and residual cognition. Results: In our mega-analyses, we identified the strongest associations of AD with fewer somatostatin (SST) inhibitory neurons ({beta}=-0.48, pbonf=8.98x10-9) and intra-telencephalic (IT) excitatory neurons ({beta}=-0.45, pbonf =4.32x10-7). snRNAseq-based cell type proportion analyses especially supported the association of SST neurons. Analyses of cell type proportions with specific AD-related phenotypes in ROS/MAP consistently implicated fewer SST neurons with greater brain-wide postmortem tau and beta amyloid ({beta}=-0.155, pFDR=3.1x10-4) deposition, as well as more severe cognitive decline prior to death ({beta}=0.309, pFDR=3.9x10-6). Greater IT neuron proportions were associated strongly with improved cognition ({beta}=0.173, pFDR=8.3x10-5) and residual cognition ({beta}=0.175, pFDR=1.2x10-5), but not canonical AD neuropathology. Conclusions: Proportionally fewer SST and IT neurons were significantly associated with AD diagnosis across multiple studies and cortical regions. These findings support seminal work implicating somatostatin and pyramidal neurons in the pathogenesis of AD and improves our current understanding of neuronal vulnerability in AD.

                Methods to spatially profile the transcriptome are dominated by a trade-off between resolution and throughput. Here, we developed a method named EEL FISH that can rapidly process large tissue samples without compromising spatial resolution. By electrophoretically transferring RNA from a tissue section onto a capture surface, EEL speeds up data acquisition by reducing the amount of imaging needed, while ensuring that RNA molecules move straight down towards the surface, preserving single-cell resolution. We applied EEL on eight entire sagittal sections of the mouse brain and measured the expression patterns of up to 440 genes to reveal complex tissue organisation. Moreover, EEL enabled the study of challenging human samples by removing autofluorescent lipofuscin, so that we could study the spatial transcriptome of the human visual cortex. We provide full hardware specification, all protocols and complete software for instrument control, image processing, data analysis and visualization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theory for weakly polydisperse cytoskeleton filaments</a></h4>

              
                The ability of actins and tubulins to change dynamically from alterations in the number density of actins/tubulin, number density and type of binding agents, and electrolyte concentration is crucial for eukaryotic cells to regulate their cytoskeleton conformations in different cellular compartments. Conventional approaches on biopolymers solution break down for cytoskeleton filaments because they entail several approximations to treat their polyelectrolyte and mechanical properties. In this article, we introduce a novel density functional theory for polydisperse, semiflexible cytoskeleton filaments. The approach accounts for the equilibrium polymerization kinetics, length, and orientation filament distributions, as well as the electrostatic interaction between filaments and the electrolyte. This is essential for cytoskeleton polymerization in different cell compartments generating filaments of different lengths, sometimes long enough to become semiflexible. We characterized the thermodynamics properties of actin filaments in electrolyte aqueous solutions. We calculated the free energy, pressure, chemical potential, and second virial coefficient for each filament conformation. We also calculated the phase diagram of actin filaments solution and compared it with available experimental data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accounting for motion in fMRI: What part of the spectrum are we characterizing in autism spectrum disorder?</a></h4>

              
                The exclusion of high-motion participants can reduce the impact of motion in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, the exclusion of high-motion participants may change the distribution of clinically relevant variables in the study sample, and the resulting sample may not be representative of the population. Our goals are two-fold: 1) to document the biases introduced by common motion exclusion practices in functional connectivity research and 2) to introduce a framework to address these biases by treating excluded scans as a missing data problem. We use a study of autism spectrum disorder to illustrate the problem and the potential solution. We aggregated data from 545 children (8-13 years old) who participated in resting-state fMRI studies at Kennedy Krieger Institute (173 autistic and 372 typically developing) between 2007 and 2020. We found that autistic children were more likely to be excluded than typically developing children, with 29.1% and 16.1% of autistic and typically developing children excluded, respectively, using a lenient criterion and 80.8% and 59.8% with a stricter criterion. The resulting sample of autistic children with usable data tended to be older, have milder social deficits, better motor control, and higher intellectual ability than the original sample. These measures were also related to functional connectivity strength among children with usable data. This suggests that the generalizability of previous studies reporting naive analyses (i.e., based only on participants with usable data) may be limited by the selection of older children with less severe clinical profiles because these children are better able to remain still during an rs-fMRI scan. We adapt doubly robust targeted minimum loss based estimation with an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to address these data losses and the resulting biases. The proposed approach selects more edges that differ in functional connectivity between autistic and typically developing children than the naive approach, supporting this as a promising solution to improve the study of heterogeneous populations in which motion is common.

                Cyclin Dependent Kinase family members include members of the non-cell cycle CDK, such as PFTK1/Eip63E. Eip63E expresses primarily in postnatal and adult nervous system in Drosophila melanogaster but its role in CNS development remains unknown. We sought to understand its role in the CNS by studying the fly ventral nerve cord during development. Eip63E regulates axogenesis in neurons and its deficiency leads to neuronal defects. We describe a functional interaction between Eip63E and Rho1. Studies in cultured cortical neurons from PFTK1 knockout mice, confirmed that PFTK1 plays a role in axonal outgrowth and its deficiency resulted in faster growing axons. We demonstrate that GDP bound RhoA is a substrate of PFTK1 and this phosphorylation resulted in higher activity of RhoA. In conclusion, our work represents the first steps in the characterization of the neuronal functions of PFTK1 and points to RhoA activation in the regulation of PFTK1 mediated axogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal cues displayed by submissive rats promote prosocial choices by dominants</a></h4>

              
                Animals often display prosocial behaviours, performing actions that benefit others. Although prosociality is essential for social bonding and cooperation, we still know very little about how animals integrate behavioural cues from those in need to make decisions that increase their wellbeing. To address this question, we used a two-choice task where rats can provide rewards to a conspecific in the absence of self-benefit, and interrogated which conditions promote prosociality by manipulating the social context of the interacting animals. While sex or degree of familiarity did not affect prosocial choices in rats, social hierarchy revealed to be a potent modulator, with dominant decision-makers showing faster emergence and higher levels of prosocial choices towards their submissive cage-mates. Leveraging quantitative analysis of multimodal social dynamics prior to choice, we identified that pairs with dominant decision-makers exhibited more proximal interactions in social distance. Interestingly, these more coordinated interactions were driven by submissive animals that modulated their position and movement towards their dominants and increased 50kHz vocalisation rate when their partners were going to behave selfishly. This display of multimodal cues by submissive animals while signalling need promoted social saliency and a faster emergence of prosocial choices from dominant rats. Multivariate analysis highlighted non-canonical body language as the main information dominants use on a trial-by-trial basis to learn that their actions have effects on others. Our results provide a refined understanding of the behavioural dynamics that rats use for action-selection upon perception of socially relevant cues and navigate social decision-making.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroscience lacks a diverse repertoire of model organisms, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the general principles of neural function. Ctenophores display many neurobiological and experimental features which make them a promising candidate to fill this gap. They possess a nerve net distributed across their body surface in the epithelial layer. There is a long-held assumption that nerve nets are âsimpleâ and lack distinct organizational principles. We want to challenge this assumption and determine how stereotyped the structure of this network is. We estimated body surface area in <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> using custom optical projection tomography and light sheet morphometry imaging systems. Using an antibody against tyrosinated Î±-tubulin, we visualized the nerve net in situ and quantified the geometric properties using an automated segmentation approach. We characterized organizational rules of the epithelial nerve net in animals of different sizes and at different regions of the body. We found that specific morphological features within the nerve net are largely unchanged during growth. These properties must be essential to the functionality of the nervous system and therefore are maintained during a change in body size. We have also established the principles of organization of the network and showed that some of theÂ geometric propertiesÂ are variable across different parts of the body. This suggests that there may be different functions occurring in regions with different structural characteristics. This is the most comprehensive structural description of a ctenophore nerve net to date and demonstrates the amenability of <i>P. pileus</i> for whole organism network analysis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Repeated Administration of 2-Hydroxypropyl-{beta}-Cyclodextrin (HP{beta}CD) Attenuates the Chronic Inflammatory Response to Experimental Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Globally, more than 67 million people are living with the effects of ischemic stroke. Importantly, many stroke survivors develop a chronic inflammatory response that may contribute to cognitive impairment, a common and debilitating sequela of stroke that is insufficiently studied and currently untreatable. 2-Hydroxypropyl-&beta;-cyclodextrin (HP&beta;CD) is an FDA-approved cyclic oligosaccharide that can solubilize and entrap lipophilic substances. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the repeated administration of HP&beta;CD curtails the chronic inflammatory response to stroke by reducing lipid accumulation within stroke infarcts in a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model of stroke. To achieve this goal, we subcutaneously injected young adult and aged male mice with vehicle or HP&beta;CD 3 times per week, with treatment beginning 1 week after stroke. We evaluated mice at 7 weeks following stroke using immunostaining, RNA sequencing, lipidomic, and behavioral analyses. Chronic stroke infarct and peri-infarct regions of HP&beta;CD-treated mice were characterized by an upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and a downregulation of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity, reactive astrogliosis, and chemotaxis. Correspondingly, HP&beta;CD reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and plasma cells in stroke infarcts. Repeated administration of HP&beta;CD also preserved NeuN immunoreactivity in the striatum and thalamus and c-Fos immunoreactivity in hippocampal regions. Additionally, HP&beta;CD improved recovery through the protection of hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory and reduction of impulsivity. These results indicate that systemic HP&beta;CD treatment following stroke attenuates chronic inflammation and secondary neurodegeneration and prevents poststroke cognitive decline.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dementia is a common and debilitating sequela of stroke. Currently, there are no available treatments for poststroke dementia. Our study shows that lipid metabolism is disrupted in chronic stroke infarcts, which causes an accumulation of uncleared lipid debris and correlates with a chronic inflammatory response. To our knowledge, these substantial changes in lipid homeostasis have not been previously recognized or investigated in the context of ischemic stroke. We also provide a proof of principle that solubilizing and entrapping lipophilic substances using HP&beta;CD could be an effective strategy for treating chronic inflammation after stroke and other CNS injuries. We propose that using HP&beta;CD for the prevention of poststroke dementia could improve recovery and increase long-term quality of life in stroke sufferers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stopping Interference in Response Inhibition: Behavioral and Neural Signatures of Selective Stopping</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response inhibition is an essential aspect of cognitive control that is necessary for terminating inappropriate preplanned or ongoing responses. Response-selective stopping represents a complex form of response inhibition where only a subcomponent of a multicomponent action must be terminated. In this context, a substantial response delay emerges on unstopped effectors after the cued effector is successfully stopped. This response delay has been termed the stopping interference effect. Converging lines of evidence indicate that this effect results from a global response inhibition mechanism that is recruited regardless of the stopping context. However, behavioral observations reveal that the stopping interference effect may not always occur during selective stopping. This review summarizes the behavioral and neural signatures of response inhibition during selective stopping. An overview of selective stopping contexts and the stopping interference effect is provided. A "restart" model of selective stopping is expanded on in light of recent neurophysiological evidence of selective and nonselective response inhibition. Factors beyond overt action cancellation that contribute to the stopping interference effect are discussed. Finally, a pause-then-cancel model of action stopping is presented as a candidate framework to understand stopping interference during response-selective stopping. The extant literature indicates that stopping interference may result from both selective and nonselective response inhibition processes, which can be amplified or attenuated by response conflict, task familiarity, and functional coupling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gephyrin Interacts with the K-Cl Cotransporter KCC2 to Regulate Its Surface Expression and Function in Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter KCC2, encoded by the <I>Slc12a5</I> gene, is a neuron-specific chloride extruder that tunes the strength and polarity of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated transmission. In addition to its canonical ion transport function, KCC2 also regulates spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic function through interaction with a variety of molecular partners. KCC2 is enriched in the vicinity of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, the activity of which in turn regulates its membrane stability and function. KCC2 interaction with the submembrane actin cytoskeleton via 4.1N is known to control its anchoring near glutamatergic synapses on dendritic spines. However, the molecular determinants of KCC2 clustering near GABAergic synapses remain unknown. Here, we used proteomics to identify novel KCC2 interacting proteins in the adult rat neocortex. We identified both known and novel candidate KCC2 partners, including some involved in neuronal development and synaptic transmission. These include gephyrin, the main scaffolding molecule at GABAergic synapses. Gephyrin interaction with endogenous KCC2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation from rat neocortical extracts. We showed that gephyrin stabilizes plasmalemmal KCC2 and promotes its clustering in hippocampal neurons, mostly but not exclusively near GABAergic synapses, thereby controlling KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion. This study identifies gephyrin as a novel KCC2 anchoring molecule that regulates its membrane expression and function in cortical neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fast synaptic inhibition in the brain is mediated by chloride-permeable GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) and therefore relies on transmembrane chloride gradients. In neurons, these gradients are primarily maintained by the K/Cl cotransporter KCC2. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms controlling KCC2 expression and function is crucial to understand its physiological regulation and rescue its function in the pathology. KCC2 function depends on its membrane expression and clustering, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We describe the interaction between KCC2 and gephyrin, the main scaffolding protein at inhibitory synapses. We show that gephyrin controls plasmalemmal KCC2 clustering and that loss of gephyrin compromises KCC2 function. Our data suggest functional units comprising GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs, gephyrin, and KCC2 act to regulate synaptic GABA signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gli1 Regulates the Postnatal Acquisition of Peripheral Nerve Architecture</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral nerves are organized into discrete compartments. Axons, Schwann cells (SCs), and endoneurial fibroblasts (EFs) reside within the endoneurium and are surrounded by the perineurium, a cellular sheath comprised of layers of perineurial glia (PNG). SC secretion of Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) regulates this organization. In Dhh nulls, the perineurium is deficient and the endoneurium is subdivided into small compartments termed minifascicles. Human Dhh mutations cause a neuropathy with similar defects. Here we examine the role of Gli1, a canonical transcriptional effector of hedgehog signaling, in regulating peripheral nerve organization in mice of both genders. We identify PNG, EFs, and pericytes as Gli1-expressing cells by genetic fate mapping. Although expression of Dhh by SCs and Gli1 in target cells is coordinately regulated with myelination, Gli1 expression unexpectedly persists in Dhh null EFs. Thus, Gli1 is expressed in EFs noncanonically (i.e., independent of hedgehog signaling). Gli1 and Dhh also have nonredundant activities. Unlike Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls have a normal perineurium. Like Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls form minifascicles, which we show likely arise from EFs. Thus, Dhh and Gli1 are independent signals: Gli1 is dispensable for perineurial development but functions cooperatively with Dhh to drive normal endoneurial development. During development, Gli1 also regulates endoneurial extracellular matrix production, nerve vascular organization, and has modest, nonautonomous effects on SC sorting and myelination of axons. Finally, in adult nerves, induced deletion of Gli1 is sufficient to drive minifascicle formation. Thus, Gli1 regulates the development and is required to maintain the endoneurial architecture of peripheral nerves.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Peripheral nerves are organized into distinct cellular/ECM compartments: the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium. This organization, with its associated cellular constituents, is critical for the structural and metabolic support of nerves and their response to injury. Here, we show that Gli1, a transcription factor normally expressed downstream of hedgehog signaling, is required for the proper organization of the endoneurium but not the perineurium. Unexpectedly, Gli1 expression by endoneurial cells is independent of, and functions nonredundantly with, Schwann Cell-derived Desert Hedgehog in regulating peripheral nerve architecture. These results further delineate how peripheral nerves acquire their distinctive organization during normal development, and highlight mechanisms that may regulate their reorganization in pathologic settings, including peripheral neuropathies and nerve injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of RNA-Binding Protein HuR Leads to Defective Ependymal Cells and Hydrocephalus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multiciliated ependymal cells line the ventricle wall and generate CSF flow through ciliary beating. Defects in ependymal cells cause hydrocephalus; however, there are still significant gaps in our understanding the molecular, cellular and developmental mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Here, we demonstrate that specific deletion of RNA-binding protein (RBP) Hu antigen R (HuR) in the mouse brain results in hydrocephalus and causes postnatal death. HuR deficiency leads to impaired ependymal cell development with defective motile ciliogenesis in both female and male mice. Transcriptome-wide analysis reveals that HuR binds to mRNA transcripts related to ciliogenesis, including cilia and flagella associated protein 52 (<I>Cfap52</I>), the effector gene of Foxj-1 and Rfx transcriptional factors. HuR deficiency accelerates the degradation of <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA, while overexpression of Cfap52 is able to promote the development of HuR-deficient ependymal cells. Taken together, our results unravel the important role of HuR in posttranscriptional regulation of ependymal cell development by stabilizing <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study identifies Hu antigen R (HuR) as a genetic factor involved in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Mechanistically, HuR regulates ependymal cell differentiation and ciliogenesis through stabilizing <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA, the effector gene of Foxj-1 and Rfx transcriptional factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Control of Virtual Self-Motion Using Task-Specific Subspaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain&ndash;machine interfaces (BMIs) for reaching have enjoyed continued performance improvements, yet there remains significant need for BMIs that control other movement classes. Recent scientific findings suggest that the intrinsic covariance structure of neural activity depends strongly on movement class, potentially necessitating different decode algorithms across classes. To address this possibility, we developed a self-motion BMI based on cortical activity as monkeys cycled a hand-held pedal to progress along a virtual track. Unlike during reaching, we found no high-variance dimensions that directly correlated with to-be-decoded variables. This was due to no neurons having consistent correlations between their responses and kinematic variables. Yet we could decode a single variable&mdash;self-motion&mdash;by nonlinearly leveraging structure that spanned multiple high-variance neural dimensions. Resulting online BMI-control success rates approached those during manual control. These findings make two broad points regarding how to build decode algorithms that harmonize with the empirical structure of neural activity in motor cortex. First, even when decoding from the same cortical region (e.g., arm-related motor cortex), different movement classes may need to employ very different strategies. Although correlations between neural activity and hand velocity are prominent during reaching tasks, they are not a fundamental property of motor cortex and cannot be counted on to be present in general. Second, although one generally desires a low-dimensional readout, it can be beneficial to leverage a multidimensional high-variance subspace. Fully embracing this approach requires highly nonlinear approaches tailored to the task at hand, but can produce near-native levels of performance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many brain&ndash;machine interface decoders have been constructed for controlling movements normally performed with the arm. Yet it is unclear how these will function beyond the reach-like scenarios where they were developed. Existing decoders implicitly assume that neural covariance structure, and correlations with to-be-decoded kinematic variables, will be largely preserved across tasks. We find that the correlation between neural activity and hand kinematics, a feature typically exploited when decoding reach-like movements, is essentially absent during another task performed with the arm: cycling through a virtual environment. Nevertheless, the use of a different strategy, one focused on leveraging the highest-variance neural signals, supported high performance real-time brain&ndash;machine interface control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Speech Categorization Reveals the Role of Early-Stage Temporal-Coherence Processing in Auditory Scene Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal coherence of sound fluctuations across spectral channels is thought to aid auditory grouping and scene segregation. Although prior studies on the neural bases of temporal-coherence processing focused mostly on cortical contributions, neurophysiological evidence suggests that temporal-coherence-based scene analysis may start as early as the cochlear nucleus (i.e., the first auditory region supporting cross-channel processing over a wide frequency range). Accordingly, we hypothesized that aspects of temporal-coherence processing that could be realized in early auditory areas may shape speech understanding in noise. We then explored whether physiologically plausible computational models could account for results from a behavioral experiment that measured consonant categorization in different masking conditions. We tested whether within-channel masking of target-speech modulations predicted consonant confusions across the different conditions and whether predictions were improved by adding across-channel temporal-coherence processing mirroring the computations known to exist in the cochlear nucleus. Consonant confusions provide a rich characterization of error patterns in speech categorization, and are thus crucial for rigorously testing models of speech perception; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used in prior studies of scene analysis. We find that within-channel modulation masking can reasonably account for category confusions, but that it fails when temporal fine structure cues are unavailable. However, the addition of across-channel temporal-coherence processing significantly improves confusion predictions across all tested conditions. Our results suggest that temporal-coherence processing strongly shapes speech understanding in noise and that physiological computations that exist early along the auditory pathway may contribute to this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Temporal coherence of sound fluctuations across distinct frequency channels is thought to be important for auditory scene analysis. Prior studies on the neural bases of temporal-coherence processing focused mostly on cortical contributions, and it was unknown whether speech understanding in noise may be shaped by across-channel processing that exists in earlier auditory areas. Using physiologically plausible computational modeling to predict consonant confusions across different listening conditions, we find that across-channel temporal coherence contributes significantly to scene analysis and speech perception and that such processing may arise in the auditory pathway as early as the brainstem. By virtue of providing a richer characterization of error patterns not obtainable with just intelligibility scores, consonant confusions yield unique insight into scene analysis mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hypocretin/Orexin Interactions with Norepinephrine Contribute to the Opiate Withdrawal Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>We previously found that human heroin addicts and mice chronically exposed to morphine exhibit a significant increase in the number of detected hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt)-producing neurons. However, it remains unknown how this increase affects target areas of the hypocretin system involved in opioid withdrawal, including norepinephrine containing structures locus coeruleus (LC) and A1/A2 medullary regions. Using a combination of immunohistochemical, biochemical, imaging, and behavioral techniques, we now show that the increase in detected hypocretin cell number translates into a significant increase in hypocretin innervation and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in the LC without affecting norepinephrine-containing neuronal cell number. We show that the increase in TH is completely dependent on Hcrt innervation. The A1/A2 regions were unaffected by morphine treatment. Manipulation of the Hcrt system may affect opioid addiction and withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previously, we have shown that the hypothalamic hypocretin system undergoes profound anatomic changes in human heroin addicts and in mice exposed to morphine, suggesting a role of this system in the development of addictive behaviors. The locus coeruleus plays a key role in opioid addiction. Here we report that the hypothalamic hypocretin innervation of the locus coeruleus increases dramatically with morphine administration to mice. This increase is correlated with a massive increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression in locus coeruleus. Elimination of hypocretin neurons prevents the tyrosine hydroxylase increase in locus coeruleus and dampens the somatic and affective components of opioid withdrawal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Aging Enhances Neural Activity in Auditory, Visual, and Somatosensory Cortices: The Common Cause Revisited</a></h4>

              
                <p>In humans, age-related declines in vision, hearing, and touch coincide with changes in amplitude and latency of sensory-evoked potentials. These age-related differences in neural activity may be related to a common deterioration of supra-modal brain areas (e.g., PFC) that mediate activity in sensory cortices or reflect specific sensorineural impairments that may differ between sensory modalities. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured neuroelectric brain activity while 37 young adults (18-30 years, 18 males) and 35 older adults (60-88 years, 20 males) were presented with a rapid randomized sequence of lateralized auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Within each sensory domain, we compared amplitudes and latencies of sensory-evoked responses, source activity, and functional connectivity (via phase-locking value) between groups. We found that older adults' early sensory-evoked responses were greater in amplitude than those of young adults in all three modalities, which coincided with enhanced source activity in auditory, visual, and somatosensory cortices. Older adults also showed stronger neural synchrony than young adults between superior prefrontal and sensory cortices; and in older adults, the degree of phase synchrony was positively correlated with the magnitude of source activity in sensory areas. Critically, older adults who showed enhanced neural activity in one sensory domain also showed enhanced activity in other modalities. Together, these findings support the common cause hypothesis of aging and highlight the role of prefrontal regions in exerting top-down control over sensory cortices.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A prominent theory of aging posits that age-related declines in sensory processing across domains are related to a single common neurobiological mechanism. However, the neural evidence supporting this common cause hypothesis has remained elusive. Our study revealed robust age-related changes in three sensory domains across a range of neural metrics. Importantly, older adults who showed increased neural activity within one sensory domain also showed enhanced neural activity in the other two sensory modalities. No such relation among activity in sensory cortices was observed in young adults. Age-related increases in neural activity in sensory cortices coincided with enhanced neural synchrony between the PFC and sensory cortices, underlining the importance of the PFC in regulating sensory processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A One-Shot Shift from Explore to Exploit in Monkey Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Much animal learning is slow, with cumulative changes in behavior driven by reward prediction errors. When the abstract structure of a problem is known, however, both animals and formal learning models can rapidly attach new items to their roles within this structure, sometimes in a single trial. Frontal cortex is likely to play a key role in this process. To examine information seeking and use in a known problem structure, we trained monkeys in an explore/exploit task, requiring the animal first to test objects for their association with reward, then, once rewarded objects were found, to reselect them on further trials for further rewards. Many cells in the frontal cortex showed an explore/exploit preference aligned with one-shot learning in the monkeys' behavior: the population switched from an explore state to an exploit state after a single trial of learning but partially maintained the explore state if an error indicated that learning had failed. Binary switch from explore to exploit was not explained by continuous changes linked to expectancy or prediction error. Explore/exploit preferences were independent for two stages of the trial: object selection and receipt of feedback. Within an established task structure, frontal activity may control the separate processes of explore and exploit, switching in one trial between the two.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Much animal learning is slow, with cumulative changes in behavior driven by reward prediction errors. When the abstract structure a problem is known, however, both animals and formal learning models can rapidly attach new items to their roles within this structure. To address transitions in neural activity during one-shot learning, we trained monkeys in an explore/exploit task using familiar objects and a highly familiar task structure. When learning was rapid, many frontal neurons showed a binary, one-shot switch between explore and exploit. Within an established task structure, frontal activity may control the separate operations of exploring alternative objects to establish their current role, then exploiting this knowledge for further reward.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglial Correlates of Late Life Physical Activity: Relationship with Synaptic and Cognitive Aging in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physical activity relates to reduced dementia risk, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are unknown. We translated animal and <I>in vitro</I> studies demonstrating a causal link between physical activity and microglial homeostasis into humans. Decedents from Rush Memory and Aging Project completed actigraphy monitoring (average daily activity) and cognitive evaluation in life, and neuropathological examination at autopsy. Brain tissue was analyzed for microglial activation via immunohistochemistry (anti-human HLA-DP-DQ-DR) and morphology (% Stage I, II, or III), and synaptic protein levels (SNAP-25, synaptophysin, complexin-I, VAMP, syntaxin, synaptotagmin-1). Proportion of morphologically activated microglia (PAM) was estimated in ventromedial caudate, posterior putamen, inferior temporal (IT), and middle frontal gyrus. The 167 decedents averaged 90 years at death, two-thirds were nondemented, and 60% evidenced pathologic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adjusting for age, sex, education, and motor performances, greater physical activity associated with lower PAM in the ventromedial caudate and IT. Relationships between physical activity and PAM in the ventromedial caudate or IT were particularly prominent in adults evidencing microinfarcts or AD pathology, respectively. Mediational analyses indicated that PAM IT mediated ~30% of the relationships between (1) physical activity and synaptic protein in IT, and (2) physical activity and global cognition, in separate models. However, the size of the mediation depended on AD pathology ranging from &gt;40% in adults with high AD burden, but &lt;10% in adults with low AD burden. Lower microglial activation may be a pathway linking physical activity to age-related brain health in humans. Physical activity may promote AD-related synaptic and cognitive resilience through reduction of pro-inflammatory microglial states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Physical activity relates to better cognitive aging and reduced risk of neurodegenerative disease, yet the cellular and molecular pathways linking behavior-to-brain in humans are unknown. Animal studies indicate that increasing physical activity leads to decreased microglial activation and corresponding increases in synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. We objectively monitored physical activity (accelerometer-based actigraphy) and cognitive performances in life, and quantified microglial activation and synaptic markers in brain tissue at death in older adults. These are the first data supporting microglial activation as a physiological pathway by which physical activity relates to brain heath in humans. Although more interventional work is needed, we suggest that physical activity may be a modifiable behavior leveraged to reduce pro-inflammatory microglial states in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictive Representations in Hippocampal and Prefrontal Hierarchies</a></h4>

              
                <p>As we navigate the world, we use learned representations of relational structures to explore and to reach goals. Studies of how relational knowledge enables inference and planning are typically conducted in controlled small-scale settings. It remains unclear, however, how people use stored knowledge in continuously unfolding navigation (e.g., walking long distances in a city). We hypothesized that multiscale predictive representations guide naturalistic navigation in humans, and these scales are organized along posterior-anterior prefrontal and hippocampal hierarchies. We conducted model-based representational similarity analyses of neuroimaging data collected while male and female participants navigated realistically long paths in virtual reality. We tested the pattern similarity of each point, along each path, to a weighted sum of its successor points within predictive horizons of different scales. We found that anterior PFC showed the largest predictive horizons, posterior hippocampus the smallest, with the anterior hippocampus and orbitofrontal regions in between. Our findings offer novel insights into how cognitive maps support hierarchical planning at multiple scales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Whenever we navigate the world, we represent our journey at multiple horizons: from our immediate surroundings to our distal goal. How are such cognitive maps at different horizons simultaneously represented in the brain? Here, we applied a reinforcement learning-based analysis to neuroimaging data acquired while participants virtually navigated their hometown. We investigated neural patterns in the hippocampus and PFC, key cognitive map regions. We uncovered predictive representations with multiscale horizons in prefrontal and hippocampal gradients, with the longest predictive horizons in anterior PFC and the shortest in posterior hippocampus. These findings provide empirical support for the computational hypothesis that multiscale neural representations guide goal-directed navigation. This advances our understanding of hierarchical planning in everyday navigation of realistic distances.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Roles for Prefrontal Dopamine D1 and D2 Neurons in Social Hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls dominance hierarchies in groups of animals. Dopamine (DA) strongly modulates PFC activity mainly through D1 receptors (D1Rs) and D2 receptors (D2Rs). Still, it is unclear how these two subpopulations of DA receptor-expressing neurons in the PFC regulate social dominance hierarchy. Here, we demonstrate distinct roles for prefrontal D1R- and D2R-expressing neurons in establishing social hierarchy, with D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons determining dominance and D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons for subordinate. <I>Ex vivo</I> whole-cell recordings revealed that the dominant status of male mice correlates with rectifying AMPAR transmission and stronger excitatory synaptic strength onto D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons in PFC pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the submissive status is associated with higher neuronal excitability in D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons. Moreover, simultaneous manipulations of synaptic efficacy of D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons in dominant male mice and neuronal excitability of D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons of their male subordinates switch their dominant&ndash;subordinate relationship. These results reveal that prefrontal D1R<sup>+</sup> and D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons have distinct but synergistic functions in the dominance hierarchy, and DA-mediated regulation of synaptic strengths acts as a powerful behavioral determinant of intermale social rank.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dominance hierarchy exists widely among animals who confront social conflict. Studies have indicated that social status largely relies on the neuronal activity in the PFC, but how dopamine influences social hierarchy via subpopulation of prefrontal neurons is still elusive. Here, we explore the cell type-specific role of dopamine receptor-expressing prefrontal neurons in the dominance&ndash;subordinate relationship. We found that the synaptic strength of D1 receptor-expressing neurons determines the dominant status, whereas hyperactive D2-expressing neurons are associated with the subordinate status. These findings highlight how social conflicts recruit distinct cortical microcircuits to drive different behaviors and reveal how D1- and D2-receptor enriched neurocircuits in the PFC establish a social hierarchy.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Insight into the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) will provide a foundation for improved therapies. We studied a model in which an episode of prolonged seizures is followed by recovery lasting two weeks before emergence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. We focused on the interval between the prolonged seizures and the late onset recurrent seizures. We investigated the hippocampal mossy fiber CA3 pyramidal cell microcircuit in models spanning <I>in vitro</I>, <I>in vivo</I>, and <I>ex vivo</I> preparations. Expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in the dentate granule cells of <I>DGC ChR</I> mice enabled the selective activation of mossy fiber axons. <I>In vivo</I> studies revealed marked potentiation of mossy fiber evoked field potentials in hippocampal CA3 beginning within hours following seizures, a potentiation which persisted at least 7 d. Stimulation of mossy fibers in hippocampal slices <I>in vitro</I> using patterns of activity mimicking seizures induced LTP not only of the monosynaptic EPSC but also of the disynaptic IPSC of CA3 pyramidal cells. <I>Ex vivo</I> studies of slices isolated following seizures revealed evidence of LTP of mossy fiber evoked EPSC and disynaptic IPSC of CA3 pyramidal cells. We suggest that activation of dentate granule cells during seizures induces these plasticities <I>in vivo</I> and the retained balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition limits excessive activation of CA3 pyramidal cells, thereby protecting animals from spontaneous recurrent seizures at this interval following status epilepticus.</p>

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the worldâs economy, health and education in a blink of an eye. Almost 1 billion learners have been affected across the globe. This has resulted in a paradigm shift to blended learning. Therefore, it was felt necessary to provide practical guidelines for the development of blended curriculum in medical education. It would help to overcome the challenges faced due to unprecedented transformation of medical education on account of pandemic. Methods: Guidelines based on personal experience of the authors and literature search were developed using the complex adapted blended learning system (CALBS) framework. Seven experts developed these guidelines using the nominal group technique. The consent form and literature for CABLS framework was shared with experts. The experts developed the guidelines independently during phase one of the technique. After a given time, phase 2 started with moderator mediated discussion about the individual guidelines developed by the experts. After discussion and mutual consensus four types of guideline ideas were developed. During the third phase the experts ranked the guideline ideas on a scale of 1 to 5. The guideline idea that ranked highest was selected as a final guideline for developing a blended learning curriculum. Results: The group consensus resulted in developing seven guidelines for a blended course or curriculum in medical education. These guidelines are based on a conceptual framework supplemented by expertâs own personal experience and current evidence from literature. Conclusions: These guidelines would provide a comprehensive and systematic approach to develop a blended learning curriculum in medical education.

                Background: Academic sabbaticals are seen as an important aspect of academic life and require considerable resources, however, little research has been done into how they are used and whether their effects can be measured. We explored these issues at the University of Cambridge. Methods: A mixed method approach including 24 interviews with academics, eight interviews with administrators; alongside analysis of administrative and publication data between 2010 and 2019. Results: Academics underline the importance of sabbaticals in providing uninterrupted time for research that is used to think, explore new ideas, master new techniques, develop new collaborations, draw together previous work, set work in a wider context, and provide personal discretion in research direction. They also highlight sabbaticalsâ contributions in allowing the beneficial effects of combining teaching and research, while mitigating some of the disadvantages. However, it is difficult to detect the effect of sabbaticals on publications using a time series approach. Conclusions: Sabbaticals provide manifold contributions to academic research at the University of Cambridge; however, detecting and quantifying this contribution, and extending these findings requires wider and more detailed investigation.

                Background and objective: Stroke is the second leading cause of death in Jordan and over the world. Knowledge and awareness towards stroke play a crucial role in the management and prevention of its complications. This study aims to assess the knowledge and awareness about stroke among the Jordanian population and determine factors associated with stroke awareness. Methods: This cross-sectional study through a web-based anonymous questionnaire that needed 10 minutes to be completed. It examined sociodemographic characteristics and recognition of the risk factors, warning signs, stroke consequences, and early response to stroke symptoms. Logistic regression analysis identified the factors associated with poor knowledge of stroke.Â  Results: A total of 573 Jordanian adults participated in this study. The participant's ability to identify at least one early symptom of stroke and the proper response to the symptoms were significantly correlated with the educational level (OR of 3.4 and 2.5, respectively). At least one consequence of stroke was significantly associated with different demographic factors such as gender, socioeconomic income, females versus males and those with medium income versus low income had significantly higher odds (OR of 6.6 and 4.1, respectively). Conclusion: This study revealed a good knowledge and awareness level about stroke among Jordanians correlated mainly with their educational level. Therefore, new strategies should be considered to decrease the prevalence of stroke in Jordan, including the need for engagement in enhanced awareness campaigns.

                Thermal injuries in young children involving the buttocks, perineum, and lower limbs raise suspicion of child abuse. Determining the manner of death and ruling out homicide in a fatal case of scalding remains a challenge for forensic practitioners. One such issue is reported in the present case report, where a medicolegal evaluation of a fatal scald in a two-year-old girl child is discussed. Young children sustaining serious injuries from scalds is a grave social concern. Such young lives need to be protected from scald injuries whether accidental or purposeful. Differences in injury patterns on the basis of their distribution and their characteristics are important to determine manner of death in such cases.

Â The significant morbidity and mortality associated with these pathogens bespeaks the urgent need for novel safe and effective therapeutics.Â  This review highlights promising investigational antifungal agents in clinical phases of development: fosmanogepix, ibrexafungerp, rezafungin, encochleated amphotericin B, oteseconazole (VT-1161), VT-1598, PC945, and olorofim.Â  We discuss three first-in-class members of three novel antifungal classes, as well as new agents within existing antifungal classes with improved safety and tolerability profiles due to enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

                Background: Oxidative stress and the mild inflammatory process present in diabetes play a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease and its comorbidities. This understanding has opened new avenues and targets for developing improved treatments since the risk factors associated with diabetes may be reduced through non-pharmacological interventions. In this sense, plant extracts could be efficient in preventing or assisting these pathological conditions treatment. Methods: Diabetes mellitus was induced in 24 rats, which were allocated in 4 groups: Control (CT), Control+Baccharis (CT-B), Diabetes (DB), and Diabetes+Baccharis (DB-B). For 28 days, the animals of CT-B and DB-B groups were treated, via gavage, with B. dracunculifolia extract at 50 mg.kg-1. Results: The DB group presented higher values than the DB-B group on parameters such as creatinine (26.42%), urea (31.42%), and triglycerides (60.80%). Creatinine and triglycerides values of DB-B group (0.39Â±0.01 e 75.0Â±8.4, receptively) were equivalent to the values of CT group (0.32Â±0.01 e 71.7Â±5.4) and of CT-B group (0.39Â±0.01, and 58.8Â±4.5). The treatment with B. dracunculifolia improved the levels of fasting glucose and response of glucose tolerance (32%), insulin (52,17%) and lipid peroxidation (liver 33.33%, kidney 38.77%) when compared to the DB group. Conclusions: The phenolic compounds and the anti-inflammatory activity of the extract of Baccharis dracunculifolia may be responsible for the hypoglycemic effect observed in the study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hybrid simulation modelling of networks of heterogeneous care homes and the inter-facility spread of Covid-19 by sharing staff</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Le Khanh Ngan Nguyen, Itamar Megiddo, Susan Howick</p>

Although system dynamics [SD] and agent-based modelling [ABM] have individually served as effective tools to understand the Covid-19 dynamics, combining these methods in a hybrid simulation model can help address Covid-19 questions and study systems and settings that are difficult to study with a single approach. To examine the spread and outbreak of Covid-19 across multiple care homes via bank/agency staff and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting this group, we develop an integrated hybrid simulation model combining the advantages of SD and ABM. We also demonstrate how we use several approaches adapted from both SD and ABM practices to build confidence in this model in response to the lack of systematic approaches to validate hybrid models. Our modelling results show that the risk of infection for residents in care homes using bank/agency staff was significantly higher than those not using bank/agency staff (Relative risk [RR] 2.65, 95% CI 2.57â2.72). Bank/agency staff working across several care homes had a higher risk of infection compared with permanent staff working in a single care home (RR 1.55, 95%CI 1.52â1.58). The RR of infection for residents is negatively correlated to bank/agency staffâs adherence to weekly PCR testing. Within a network of heterogeneous care homes, using bank/agency staff had the most impact on care homes with lower intra-facility transmission risks, higher staff-to-resident ratio, and smaller size. Forming bubbles of care homes had no or limited impact on the spread of Covid-19. This modelling study has implications for policy makers considering developing effective interventions targeting staff working across care homes during the ongoing and future pandemics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimism and pessimism in optimised replay</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Georgy Antonov, Christopher Gagne, Eran Eldar, Peter Dayan</p>

The replay of task-relevant trajectories is known to contribute to memory consolidation and improved task performance. A wide variety of experimental data show that the content of replayed sequences is highly specific and can be modulated by reward as well as other prominent task variables. However, the rules governing the choice of sequences to be replayed still remain poorly understood. One recent theoretical suggestion is that the prioritization of replay experiences in decision-making problems is based on their effect on the choice of action. We show that this implies that subjects should replay sub-optimal actions that they dysfunctionally choose rather than optimal ones, when, by being forgetful, they experience large amounts of uncertainty in their internal models of the world. We use this to account for recent experimental data demonstrating exactly pessimal replay, fitting model parameters to the individual subjectsâ choices.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Robust dynamic experiments for the precise estimation of respiration and fermentation parameters of fruit and vegetables</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arno Strouwen, Bart M. NicolaÃ¯, Peter Goos</p>

Dynamic models based on non-linear differential equations are increasingly being used in many biological applications. Highly informative dynamic experiments are valuable for the identification of these dynamic models. The storage of fresh fruit and vegetables is one such application where dynamic experimentation is gaining momentum. In this paper, we construct optimal O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gas input profiles to estimate the respiration and fermentation kinetics of pear fruit. The optimal input profiles, however, depend on the true values of the respiration and fermentation parameters. Locally optimal design of input profiles, which uses a single initial guess for the parameters, is the traditional method to deal with this issue. This method, however, is very sensitive to the initial values selected for the model parameters. Therefore, we present a robust experimental design approach that can handle uncertainty on the model parameters.

                The commonly accepted model to quantify the specificity of transcription factor binding to DNA is the position weight matrix, also called the position-specific scoring matrix. Position weight matrices are used in thousands of projects and computational tools in regulatory genomics, including prediction of the regulatory potential of single-nucleotide variants. Yet, recently Yan et al. presented new experimental method for analysis of regulatory variants and, based on its results, reported that "the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power". Here, we re-analyze the rich experimental dataset obtained by Yan et al. and show that appropriately selected position weight matrices in fact can successfully quantify transcription factor binding to alternative alleles.

                Background: There have been claims amongst nutrition stakeholders in Tanzania that the food basket regions, are the regions most affected by stunting among Â children. However, this study could not find evidence that combines food production and stunting levels, to substantiate this claim. Therefore, this study aims to compare data on stunting, food production and consumption within administrative regions of the Tanzania mainland. Methods: The study used an ecological study design to show the relationship between stunting, poverty, food production and consumption across administrative regions in Tanzania. The study used data from three national wide surveys: 2017/2018 Household Budget Survey (HBS), Tanzania National Nutrition Survey (TNNS) 2018 and Agriculture Statistics for Food Security report 2018/2019. Results: The study showed that there is a positive relationship between the prevalence of stunting and food production (r=0.43, p=0.03), while there is a negative relationship between stunting and the level of both the average monthly household consumption expenditure (r = -0.48, p = 0.01) and average monthly household food consumption expenditure (r = -0.509, p = 0.01). It was further found that some regions which have higher levels of stunting such as Njombe, have the lowest level of basic need poverty. Conclusion: The study found a positive relationship between food production and the prevalence of stunting using data across regions in mainland Tanzania. This is an indication that regional food security may not entail nutrition security, hence a call for more advocacy on nutrition-sensitive agriculture.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising noninvasive brain stimulation technique with advantages of high spatial precision and ability to target deep brain regions. This study aimed to develop a TUS protocol to effectively induce brain plasticity in human subjects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An 80-second train of theta burst patterned TUS (tbTUS), regularly patterned TUS (rTUS) with the same sonication duration, and sham tbTUS was delivered to the motor cortex in healthy subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to examine changes in corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and the site of plasticity induction. The effects of motor cortical tbTUS on a visuomotor task and the effects of occipital cortex tbTUS on motor cortical excitability were also tested.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The tbTUS produced consistent increase in corticospinal excitability for at least 30Â minutes, whereas rTUS and sham tbTUS produced no significant change. tbTUS decreased short-interval intracortical inhibition and increased intracortical facilitation. The effects of TMS in different current directions suggested that the site of the plastic changes was within the motor cortex. tbTUS to the occipital cortex did not change motor cortical excitability. Motor cortical tbTUS shortened movement time in a visuomotor task.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>tbTUS is a novel and efficient paradigm to induce cortical plasticity in humans. It has the potential to be developed for neuromodulation treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders, and to advance neuroscience research. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mutationathon highlights the importance of reaching standardization in estimates of pedigree-based germline mutation rates</a></h4>

              
                In the past decade, several studies have estimated the human per-generation germline mutation rate using large pedigrees. More recently, estimates for various non-human species have been published. However, methodological differences among studies in detecting germline mutations and estimating mutation rates make direct comparisons difficult. Here, we describe the many different steps involved in estimating pedigree-based mutation rates, including sampling, sequencing, mapping, variant calling, filtering, and how to appropriately account for false-positive and false-negative rates. For each step, we review the different methods and parameter choices that have been used in the recent literature. Additionally, we present the results from a 'Mutationathon', a competition organized among five research labs to compare germline mutation rate estimates for a single pedigree of rhesus macaques. We report almost a two-fold variation in the final estimated rate among groups using different post-alignment processing, calling, and filtering criteria and provide details into the sources of variation across studies. Though the difference among estimates is not statistically significant, this discrepancy emphasizes the need for standardized methods in mutation rate estimations and the difficulty in comparing rates from different studies. Finally, this work aims to provide guidelines for computational and statistical benchmarks for future studies interested in identifying germline mutations from pedigrees.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons integrates homeostatic state with dopamine signalling in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons increase motivation for food, however whether metabolic sensing of homeostatic state in AgRP neurons potentiates motivation by interacting with dopamine reward systems is unexplored. As a model of impaired metabolic-sensing, we used the AgRP-specific deletion of carnitine acetyltransferase (<i>Crat</i>) in mice. We hypothesized that metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons is required to increase motivation for food reward by modulating accumbal or striatal dopamine release. Studies confirmed that <i>Crat</i> deletion in AgRP neurons (KO) impaired <i>ex vivo</i> glucose-sensing, as well as <i>in vivo</i> responses to peripheral glucose injection or repeated palatable food presentation and consumption. Impaired metabolic-sensing in AgPP neurons reduced acute dopamine release (seconds) to palatable food consumption and during operant responding, as assessed by GRAB-DA photometry in the nucleus accumbens, but not the dorsal striatum. Impaired metabolic-sensing in AgRP neurons suppressed radiolabelled 18F-fDOPA accumulation after ~30 minutes in the dorsal striatum but not the nucleus accumbens. Impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons suppressed motivated operant responding for sucrose rewards during fasting. Thus, metabolic-sensing in AgRP neurons is required for the appropriate temporal integration and transmission of homeostatic hunger-sensing to dopamine signalling in the striatum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chromatin topology defines estradiol-primed progesterone receptor and PAX2 binding in endometrial cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Estrogen (E2) and Progesterone (Pg), via their specific receptors (ERalpha and PR), are major determinants in the development and progression of endometrial carcinomas, However, their precise mechanism of action and the role of other transcription factors involved are not entirely clear. Using Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, we report that E2 treatment exposes a set of progestin-dependent PR binding sites which include both E2 and progestin target genes. ChIP-seq results from hormone-treated cells revealed a non-random distribution of PAX2 binding in the vicinity of these estrogen-promoted PR sites. Altered expression of hormone regulated genes in PAX2 knockdown cells suggests a role for PAX2 in fine-tuning ERalpha and PR interplay in transcriptional regulation. Analysis of long-range interactions by Hi-C coupled with ATAC-seq data showed that these regions, that we call 'progestin control regions' (PgCRs), exhibited an open chromatin state even before hormone exposure and were non-randomly associated with regulated genes. Nearly 20% of genes potentially influenced by PgCRs were found to be altered during progression of endometrial cancer. Our findings suggest that endometrial response to progestins in differentiated endometrial tumor cells results in part from binding of PR together with PAX2 to accessible chromatin regions. What maintains these regions open remains to be studied.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recapitulating human cardio-pulmonary co-development using simultaneous multilineage differentiation of pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                The extensive crosstalk between the developing heart and lung is critical to their proper morphogenesis and maturation. However, there remains a lack of models that investigate the critical cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during human embryogenesis. Here, we reported a novel stepwise strategy for directing the simultaneous induction of both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via temporal specific tuning of WNT and nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D suspension culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (mTs), and expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage mT effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. We expect that our multilineage differentiation model will offer an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systematic investigation of the link between enzyme catalysis and cold adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Cold temperature is prevalent across the biosphere and slows the rates of chemical reactions. Increased catalysis has been predicted to be a dominant adaptive trait of enzymes to reduced temperature, and this expectation has informed physical models for enzyme catalysis and influenced bioprospecting strategies. To systematically test rate enhancement as an adaptive trait to cold, we paired kinetic constants of 2223 enzyme reactions with their organismâs optimal growth temperature (<i>T</i><sub>Growth</sub>) and analyzed trends of rate constants as a function of <i>T</i><sub>Growth</sub>. These data do not support a general increase in rate enhancement in cold adaptation. In the model enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), there is prior evidence for temperature adaptation from a change in an active site residue that results in a tradeoff between activity and stability. Nevertheless, we found that little of the rate constant variation for 20 KSI variants was accounted for by <i>T</i><sub>Growth</sub>. In contrast, and consistent with prior expectations, we observed a correlation between stability and <i>T</i><sub>Growth</sub> across 433 proteins. These results suggest that temperature exerts a weaker selection pressure on enzyme rate constants than stability and that evolutionary forces other than temperature are responsible for the majority of enzymatic rate constant variation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Motor planning brings human primary somatosensory cortex into action-specific preparatory states</a></h4>

              
                Motor planning plays a critical role in producing fast and accurate movement. Yet, the neural processes that occur in human primary motor and somatosensory cortex during planning, and how they relate to those during movement execution, remain poorly understood. Here we used 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a delayed movement paradigm to study single finger movement planning and execution. The inclusion of no-go trials and variable delays allowed us to separate what are typically overlapping planning and execution brain responses. Although our univariate results show widespread deactivation during finger planning, multivariate pattern analysis revealed finger-specific activity patterns in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which predicted the planned finger action. Surprisingly, these activity patterns were as informative as those found in contralateral primary motor cortex (M1). Control analyses ruled out the possibility that the detected information was an artifact of subthreshold movements during the preparatory delay. Furthermore, we observed that finger-specific activity patterns during planning were highly correlated to those during execution. These findings reveal that motor planning activates the specific S1 and M1 circuits that are engaged during the execution of a finger press, while activity in both regions is overall suppressed. We propose that preparatory states in S1 may improve movement control through changes in sensory processing or via direct influence of spinal motor neurons.

                Peripheral nerves are vascularized by a dense network of blood vessels to guarantee their complex function. Despite the crucial role of vascularization to ensure nerve homeostasis and regeneration, the mechanisms governing nerve invasion by blood vessels remain poorly understood. We found, in mice, that the sciatic nerve invasion by blood vessels begins around embryonic day 16 and continues until birth. Interestingly, intra-nervous blood vessel density significantly decreases during post-natal period, starting from P10. We show that, while the axon guidance molecule Netrin-1 promotes nerve invasion by blood vessels via the endothelial receptor UNC5B during embryogenesis, myelinated Schwann cells negatively control intra-nervous vascularization during postnatal period.

                Success in many real-world tasks depends on our ability to dynamically track hidden states of the world. To understand the underlying neural computations, we recorded brain activity in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of monkeys navigating by optic flow to a hidden target location within a virtual environment, without explicit position cues. In addition to sequential neural dynamics and strong interneuronal interactions, we found that the hidden state -- monkey's displacement from the goal -- was encoded in single neurons, and could be dynamically decoded from population activity. The decoded estimates predicted navigation performance on individual trials. Task manipulations that perturbed the world model induced substantial changes in neural interactions, and modified the neural representation of the hidden state, while representations of sensory and motor variables remained stable. The findings were recapitulated by a task-optimized recurrent neural network model, suggesting that neural interactions in PPC embody the world model to consolidate information and track task-relevant hidden states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal control methods for nonlinear parameter estimation in biophysical neuron models</a></h4>

              
                Functional forms of biophysically-realistic neuron models are constrained by neurobiological and anatomical considerations, such as cell morphologies and the presence of known ion channels. Despite these constraints, neurons models still contain unknown static parameters which must be inferred from experiment. This inference task is most readily cast into the framework of state-space models, which systematically takes into account partial observability and measurement noise. Inferring only dynamical state variables such as membrane voltages is a well-studied problem, and has been approached with a wide range of techniques beginning with the well-known Kalman filter. Inferring both states and fixed parameters, on the other hand, is less straightforward. Here, we develop a method for joint parameter and state inference that combines traditional state space modeling with chaotic synchronization and optimal control. Our methods are tailored particularly to situations with considerable measurement noise, sparse observability, very nonlinear or chaotic dynamics, and highly uninformed priors. We illustrate our approach both in a canonical chaotic model and in a phenomenological neuron model, showing that many unknown parameters can be uncovered reliably and accurately from short and noisy observed time traces. Our method holds promise for estimation in larger-scale systems, given ongoing improvements in calcium reporters and genetically-encoded voltage indicators.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heterosynaptic NMDA Receptor Plasticity in Hippocampal Dentate Granule Cells</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus is a key relay station that controls information transfer from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus proper. This process heavily relies on dendritic integration by dentate granule cells (GCs) of excitatory synaptic inputs from medial and lateral entorhinal cortex via medial and lateral perforant paths (MPP and LPP, respectively). N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) can contribute significantly to the integrative properties of neurons. While early studies reported that excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex onto GCs can undergo activity-dependent long-term plasticity of NMDAR-mediated transmission, the input-specificity of this plasticity along the dendritic axis remains unknown. Here, we examined the NMDAR plasticity rules at MPP-GC and LPP-GC synapses using physiologically relevant patterns of stimulation in acute rat hippocampal slices. We found that MPP-GC, but not LPP-GC synapses, expressed homosynaptic NMDAR-LTP. In addition, induction of NMDAR-LTP at MPP-GC synapses heterosynaptically potentiated distal LPP-GC NMDAR plasticity. The same stimulation protocol induced homosynaptic -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-LTP at MPP-GC but heterosynaptic AMPAR-LTD at distal LPP synapses, demonstrating that NMDAR and AMPAR are governed by different plasticity rules. Remarkably, heterosynaptic but not homosynaptic NMDAR-LTP required Ca2+ release from intracellular, ryanodine-dependent Ca2+ stores. Lastly, the induction and maintenance of both homo- and heterosynaptic NMDAR-LTP were blocked by GluN2D antagonism, suggesting the recruitment of GluN2D-containing receptors to the synapse. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which distinct inputs to the dentate gyrus may interact functionally and contribute to hippocampal-dependent memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GR-regulated enhancers play a central role in the gene regulatory networks underlying drug addiction</a></h4>

              
                Substance abuse and addiction represent a major public health problem that impacts multiple dimensions of society, including healthcare, economy, and workforce. In 2021, over 100,000 drug overdose deaths have been reported in the US with an alarming increase in fatalities related to opioids and psychostimulants. Understanding of the fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms underlying addiction and related behaviors could facilitate more effective treatments. To explore how repeated drug exposure alters gene regulatory networks in the brain, we combined capped small (cs)RNA-seq, which accurately captures nascent-like initiating transcripts from total RNA, with Hi-C and single nuclei (sn)ATAC-seq. We profiled initiating transcripts in two addiction-related brain regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), from rats that were never exposed to drugs or were subjected to prolonged abstinence after oxycodone or cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA). Interrogating over 100,000 active transcription start regions (TSRs) revealed that most TSRs had hallmarks of bona-fide enhancers and highlighted the KLF/SP1, RFX and AP1 transcription factors families as central to establish brain-specific gene regulatory programs. Analysis of rats with addiction-like behaviors versus controls identified addiction-associated repression of transcription at regulatory enhancers recognized by nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C (NR3C) factors, which include glucocorticoid receptors. Cell-type deconvolution analysis using snATAC-seq uncovered a potential role of glial cells in driving the gene regulatory programs associated with addiction-related phenotypes. These findings highlight the power of advanced transcriptomics methods to provide insight into how addiction perturbs gene regulatory programs in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Propofol anesthesia alters cortical traveling waves</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory dynamics in cortex seem to organize into traveling waves that serve a variety of functions. Recent studies show that propofol, a widely used anesthetic, dramatically alters cortical oscillations by increasing slow-delta oscillatory power and coherence. It is not known how this affects traveling waves. We compared traveling waves across the cortex of non-human primates (NHPs) before, during, and after propofol-induced loss-of-consciousness (LOC). After LOC, traveling waves in the slow-delta (~ 1Hz) range increased, grew more organized, and travelled in different directions relative to the awake state. Higher frequency (8-30 Hz) traveling waves, by contrast, decreased, lost structure, and switched to directions where the slow-delta waves were less frequent. The results suggest that LOC may be due, in part, to changes in slow-delta traveling waves that, in turn, alter and disrupt traveling waves in the higher frequencies associated with cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mid-level feature differences underlie early animacy and object size distinctions: Evidence from EEG decoding</a></h4>

              
                Responses to visually-presented objects along the cortical surface of the human brain have a large-scale organization reflecting the broad categorical divisions of animacy and object size. Mounting evidence indicates that this topographical organization is driven by differences between objects in mid-level perceptual features. With regard to the timing of neural responses, images of objects quickly evoke neural responses with decodable information about animacy and object size, but are mid-level features sufficient to evoke these rapid neural responses? Or is slower iterative neural processing required to untangle information about animacy and object size from mid-level features? To answer this question, we used electroencephalography(EEG) to measure human neural responses to images of objects and their texform counterparts - unrecognizable images which preserve some mid-level feature information about texture and coarse form. We found that texform images evoked neural responses with early decodable information about both animacy and real-world size, as early as responses evoked by original images. Further, successful cross-decoding indicates that both texform and original images evoke information about animacy and size through a common underlying neural basis. Broadly, these results indicate that the visual system contains a mid-level feature bank carrying linearly decodable information on animacy and size, which can be rapidly activated without requiring explicit recognition or protracted temporal processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal protein aggregation signatures fully distinguish pathogenic and wildtype UBQLN2 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the UBQLN2 gene cause X-linked dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) characterised by ubiquilin 2 aggregates in neurons of the motor cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, ubiquilin 2 neuropathology is also seen in sporadic and familial ALS or FTD cases not caused by UBQLN2 mutations, particularly C9ORF72-linked cases. This makes the mechanistic role of ubiquilin 2 mutations and the value of ubiquilin 2 pathology for predicting genotype unclear. Here we examine a cohort of 31 genotypically diverse ALS cases with or without FTD, including four cases with UBQLN2 mutations (resulting in p.P497H, p.P506S, and two cases with p.T487I). Using double-, triple-, and six-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we mapped the co-localisation of ubiquilin 2 with phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43), dipeptide repeat aggregates, and p62, in the hippocampus of controls (n=5), or ALS with or without FTD in sporadic (n=19), unknown familial (n=3), SOD1-linked (n=1), C9ORF72-linked (n=4), and UBQLN2-linked (n=4) cases. We differentiate between i) ubiquilin 2 aggregation together with, or driven by, pTDP-43 or dipeptide repeat proteins, and ii) ubiquilin 2 self-aggregation driven by UBQLN2 gene mutations. Together we describe a hippocampal protein aggregation signature that fully distinguishes mutant from wildtype ubiquilin 2 in ALS with or without FTD, whereby mutant ubiquilin 2 is more prone than wildtype to aggregate independently of driving factors. This neuropathological signature can be used to assess the pathogenicity of UBQLN2 gene mutations and to understand the mechanisms of UBQLN2-linked disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal Transplants of Fetal GABAergic Progenitors Regulate Adult Neurogenesis in Mice with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic interneurons within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus regulate adult neurogenesis, including proliferation, migration, and maturation of new granule cells born in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), some adult-born granule cells migrate ectopically into the hilus, and these cells contribute to increased hyperexcitability and seizures. Yet, transplanting embryonic day 13.5 fetal mouse medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) GABAergic progenitors into the hippocampus of mice with TLE ameliorates spontaneous seizures, due in part, to increased postsynaptic inhibition of adult-born granule cells. Here, we asked whether MGE progenitor transplantation affects earlier stages of adult neurogenesis, by comparing patterns of neurogenesis in naive mice and epileptic (TLE) mice, with or without MGE transplants. In naive and TLE mice, transplanted MGE cells showed comparable migration and process outgrowth. However, in TLE mice with MGE transplants, fewer adult-born Type 3 progenitors migrated ectopically. Furthermore, more Type 3 progenitors survived and migrated into the granule cell layer (GCL), as determined by immunostaining for doublecortin or the thymidine analogue, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). To determine whether MGE transplants affected earlier stages of adult neurogenesis, we compared proliferation in the SGZ two-hours after pulse labeling with BrdU in naive vs. TLE mice and found no significant differences. Furthermore, MGE progenitor transplantation had no effect on cell proliferation in the SGZ. Moreover, when compared to naive mice, TLE mice showed increases in inverted Type 1 progenitors and Type 2 progenitors, concomitant with a decrease in the normally oriented radial Type 1 progenitors. Strikingly, these alterations were abrogated by MGE transplantation. Thus, MGE transplants appear to reverse seizure-induced abnormalities in adult neurogenesis by increasing differentiation and radial migration of adult-born granule cell progenitors, outcomes that may ameliorate seizures.
