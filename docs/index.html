                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The understanding of neurofilament light chain (NfL) presence and release in oligodendrocytes is limited. This study aims to determine the NfL expression in oligodendrocytes, investigate whether excess ɑ-synuclein (α-syn) impacts NfL expression, release, and functions in oligodendrocytes, as well as detect plasma NfL-positive oligodendrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (ODEVs) changes in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls (HCs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>NfL expression in oligodendrocytes was assessed using RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining in human and mouse brain slices, as well as flow cytometry in mouse brain single-cells. The MO3.13 oligodendrocyte cell line was used to mimic MSA pathology with α-syn overexpression or preformed fibril treatment. NfL levels were detected in cell line, brain tissues and condition media, and the differences between MSA pathology and controls were compared. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were quantified using nano-scale flow cytometry in a cohort of 101 MSA patients, 96 PD patients, and 97 HCs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both <i>NEFL</i> mRNA and NfL protein showed co-localization with typical oligodendrocyte marker anti-2,3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). A total of 58.5% of CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes co-expressed NfL. Increased α-syn load elevates NfL expression in both oligodendrocyte cell line and MSA patient brain slices. NfL overexpression inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, but did not affect α-syn-induced cell viability deficits. α-Syn promoted oligodendrocytic NfL release via extracellular vesicles. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were elevated in MSA patients compared to PD and HCs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest additional cellular roles for NfL in oligodendrocytes beyond its established function in neurons and have potential implications for the neurodegenerative pathophysiology of MSA. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

">Visuospatial working memory is cortically enabled through veridical, categorical and semantic representations</a></h4>

              
                A single visual stimulus can elicit multiple concurrent representations throughout the cortex. We show that during a visual working memory task several cortical regions utilize categorical, semantic, and spatial representational formats to maintain visual stimuli in a robust fashion. We assessed the nature of orientation representations in an fMRI dataset of 40 participants performing an orientation memory task using multivariate encoding modelling. Our results show that orientation representations across the cortex form a gradient of abstraction, with more veridical representations in sensory areas and more abstract, categorical codes in anterior areas. We use cross-condition modelling to demonstrate shared neural codes between orientation and congruent verbal and location stimuli, used at different points during the trial. These findings provide evidence for a distributed account of working memory storage, where memory representations, distinct in nature and content, are present concurrently throughout the cortex.

">Corticothalamic circuit mechanisms underlying brain region and ageing variations in resting-state alpha activity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying oscillations in resting-state brain activity, which exhibit substantial spatial and age-related variations, remains a significant challenge. This study aims to characterize the contributions of neural circuits to the mechanisms governing resting-state alpha oscillations, which are crucial for various neurocognitive processes and pathologies. Using the Cam-CAN dataset, source-space MEG analyses revealed a pronounced posterior-anterior gradient in alpha frequency, alpha power, and aperiodic components, alongside notable age-related changes. Through neurophysiological modelling, we uncover strong corticothalamic interactions in occipital regions, contrasting with predominantly corticocortical interactions in frontal areas. Ageing is associated with reduced intrathalamic activity and increased corticothalamic delay in occipital regions, while fronto-central regions exhibit increased intrathalamic activity. These findings establish how different circuits shape alpha oscillations across posterior-anterior axis and age, providing a mechanistic foundation for targeted clinical interventions and offering benchmarks for future studies in patient populations.

">Cell-type-selective synaptogenesis during the development of excitatory connectivity in the mammalian neocortex</a></h4>

              
                The function of mammalian neocortex relies on the timing of axon extension and establishment of cell-type-biased patterns of excitatory synaptic connections. A subtype of excitatory neurons, layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6CThNs), ultimately exhibit a marked preference for synapsing onto parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory interneurons over more common excitatory cells in layers 6 and 4 (L6, L4). We show that the intracortical axons of L6CThNs develop in phases, elongating within L6, then pausing before extending translaminar branches into L4. Decreasing L6CThN excitability selectively enhanced axon growth in L6 but not later elaboration in L4. For both layers, we tested whether preferential synaptogenesis onto rarer PV interneurons, or promiscuous synapse formation followed by selective pruning, generated adult connectivity. We found that L6CThNs formed functional AMPA-receptor-containing synapses preferentially onto PV interneurons. Silent L6CThN synapses were not detected. Our findings show that cell-type-biased synaptogenesis underlies the formation of functional cell-type-specific excitatory connections in the neocortex.

                <p>by Weheliye H. Weheliye, Javier Rodriguez, Luigi Feriani, Avelino Javer, Virginie Uhlmann, André E. X. Brown</p>

High-resolution posture tracking of <i>C. elegans</i> has applications in genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening. While classic methods can reliably track isolated worms on uniform backgrounds, they fail when worms overlap, coil, or move in complex environments. Model-based tracking and deep learning approaches have addressed these issues to an extent, but there is still significant room for improvement in tracking crawling worms. Here we train a version of the DeepTangle algorithm developed for swimming worms using a combination of data derived from Tierpsy tracker and hand-annotated data for more difficult cases. DeepTangleCrawl (DTC) outperforms existing methods, reducing failure rates and producing more continuous, gap-free worm trajectories that are less likely to be interrupted by collisions between worms or self-intersecting postures (coils). We show that DTC enables the analysis of previously inaccessible behaviours and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in phenotypic screens, even for data that was specifically collected to be compatible with legacy trackers including low worm density and thin bacterial lawns. DTC broadens the applicability of high-throughput worm imaging to more complex behaviours that involve worm-worm interactions and more naturalistic environments including thicker bacterial lawns.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) is critical for memory formation and has been widely used to identify the neural substrate of memory traces, termed memory engram cells. Functions of IEGs have been known to be different depending on their types. However, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which different types of IEGs are selectively or concurrently involved in the formation of memory engram. To address this question, we investigated the combinative expression of c-Fos, Arc, and Npas4 proteins using immunohistochemistry following aversive and rewarding experiences across subregions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Using an automated cell detection algorithm, we found that expression patterns of c-Fos, Npas4, and Arc varied across different brain areas, with a higher increase of IEG expressing cells in the PFC and posterior BLA than in the DG. The combinative expression patterns, along with their experience-induced changes, also differed across brain areas; the co-expression of IEGs increased in the PFC and BLA following experience, whereas the increase was less pronounced in the DG and RSC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different area-to-area functional connectivity networks were extracted by different IEGs. These findings provide insights into how different IEGs and their combinations identify engram cells, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional significance of IEG-tagged memory engram cells.</p>

                Vision is crucial for effective navigation. Li et al. reveal that the dorsolateral nucleus, a higher-order thalamic area linking visual and navigational networks, encodes direction of optic flow and turning in free explorations, which contributes to spatial cognition and spatial memory.

                Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive malignancy in humans, where early diagnosis significantly improves patient outcomes. However, effective methods for accurate and early detection remain limited. In this multiethnic study involving human subjects, we developed a liquid biopsy signature based on extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) linked to radiomics features extracted from patients’ tumor imaging. We integrated eight datasets containing clinical records, imaging data of benign and malignant pancreatic lesions, and small RNA sequencing data from plasma-derived EVs of PC patients. Radiomics features were extracted and analyzed using the limma package, with feature selection conducted via the Boruta algorithm and model construction through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression. Radiomics-related low-abundance EV miRNAs were identified via weighted gene co-expression network analysis and validated for diagnostic accuracy using 10 machine-learning algorithms. Three key EV miRNAs were found to robustly distinguish malignant from benign lesions. Subsequent molecular clustering of these miRNAs and their predicted targets identified two PC subtypes, with distinct survival profiles and therapeutic responses. Specifically, one cluster was associated with prolonged overall survival and higher predicted sensitivity to immunotherapy, while the other indicated high-risk tumors potentially amenable to targeted drug interventions. This radiogenomic EV miRNA signature in human plasma represents a promising non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of PC, with potential implications for precision treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107534">Long-term live imaging, cell identification and cell tracking in regenerating crustacean legs</a></h4>

              
                High-resolution live imaging of regeneration presents unique challenges due to the nature of the specimens (large mobile animals), the duration of the process (spanning days or weeks), and the fact that cellular resolution must be achieved without damage caused by lengthy exposures to light. Building on previous work that allowed us to image different parts of the process of leg regeneration in the crustacean <i>Parhyale hawaiensis</i>, we present here a method for live imaging that captures the entire process of leg regeneration, spanning up to 10 days, at cellular resolution. Our method includes (1) mounting and long-term live imaging of regenerating legs under conditions that yield high spatial and temporal resolution but minimise photodamage, (2) fixing and in situ staining of the regenerated legs that were imaged, to identify cell fates, and (3) computer-assisted cell tracking to determine the cell lineages and progenitors of identified cells. The method is optimised to limit light exposure while maximising tracking efficiency. Combined with appropriate cell-type-specific markers, this method may allow the description of cell lineages for every regenerated cell type in the limb.

Yet, we remain short of a framework that definitively explains the structure-function relationships of this fundamental neuroanatomical motif. To better understand how physical substrates of cortical circuitry facilitate their neuronal dynamics, we employ a computational approach using recurrent neural networks and representational analyses. We examine the differences manifested by the inclusion and exclusion of biologically motivated interareal laminar connections on the computational roles of different neuronal populations in the microcircuit of hierarchically related areas throughout learning. Our findings show that the presence of feedback connections correlates with the functional modularization of cortical populations in different layers and provides the microcircuit with a natural inductive bias to differentiate expected and unexpected inputs at initialization, which we justify mathematically. Furthermore, when testing the effects of training the microcircuit and its variants with a predictive-coding-inspired strategy, we find that doing so helps better encode noisy stimuli in areas of the cortex that receive feedback, all of which combine to suggest evidence for a predictive-coding mechanism serving as an intrinsic operative logic in the cortex.</span>

While the widespread presence of neural response variability shared throughout a neural population limits the amount of stimulus-related information those populations can accurately represent, how this variability affects the interareal communication of sensory information is unknown. We propose a mathematical framework to understand the impact of neural population response variability on sensory information transmission. We combine linear Fisher information, a metric connecting stimulus representation and variability, with the framework of communication subspaces, which suggests that functional mappings between cortical populations are low-dimensional relative to the space of population activity patterns. From this, we partition Fisher information depending on the alignment between the population covariance and the mean tuning direction projected onto the communication subspace or its orthogonal complement. We provide mathematical and numerical analyses of our proposed decomposition of Fisher information and examine theoretical scenarios that demonstrate how to leverage communication subspaces for flexible routing and gating of stimulus information.

In this study, we use recurrent network models to probe the distinctions between two forms of contextual modulation of neural dynamics, at the level of neuronal excitability and at the level of synaptic strength. We characterize these mechanisms in terms of their functional outcomes, focusing on their robustness to context ambiguity and, relatedly, their efficiency with respect to packing multiple tasks into finite-size networks. We also demonstrate the distinction between these mechanisms at the level of the neuronal dynamics they induce. Together, these characterizations indicate complementarity and synergy in how these mechanisms act, potentially over many timescales, toward enhancing the robustness of multitask learning.</span>

Selecting the best possible hyperparameter out of them becomes an Np-hard problem since 2N grows in N faster then any polynomial Np. Here, we introduce a layer-by-layer data-driven pruning method based on the mathematical idea aiming at a computationally scalable entropic relaxation of the pruning problem. The sparse subnetwork is found from the pretrained (full) CNN using the network entropy minimization as a sparsity constraint. This allows deploying a numerically scalable algorithm with a sublinear scaling cost.

However, the ubiquity of degeneracy in systems generated through adaptive processes complicates our understanding of the behavioral and computational strategies they employ. In this study, we investigated degeneracy in simple computational agents, known as Markov brains, trained using an artificial evolution algorithm to solve a spatial navigation task with or without associative memory. We analyzed degeneracy at three levels: behavioral, structural, and computational, with a focus on the last. Using information-theoretical concepts, Tononi et al. (1999) proposed a functional measure of degeneracy within biological networks. Here, we extended this approach to compare degeneracy across multiple networks. Using information-theoretical tools and causal analysis, we explored the computational strategies of the evolved agents and quantified their computational degeneracy. Our findings reveal a hierarchy of degenerate solutions, from varied behaviors to diverse structures and computations. Even agents with identical evolved behaviors demonstrated different underlying structures and computations. These results underscore the pervasive nature of degeneracy in neural networks, blurring the lines between the algorithmic and implementation levels in adaptive systems, and highlight the importance of advanced analytical tools to understand their complex behaviors.</span>

As recording capabilities expand to include neuronal populations across multiple brain areas, cortical layers, and cell types, interest in extending gaussian process factor models to characterize multipopulation interactions has grown. However, the cubic runtime scaling of current methods with the length of experimental trials and the number of recorded populations (groups) precludes their application to large-scale multipopulation recordings. Here, we improve this scaling from cubic to linear in both trial length and group number. We present two approximate approaches to fitting multigroup gaussian process factor models based on inducing variables and the frequency domain. Empirically, both methods achieved orders of magnitude speed-up with minimal impact on statistical performance, in simulation and on neural recordings of hundreds of neurons across three brain areas. The frequency domain approach, in particular, consistently provided the greatest runtime benefits with the fewest trade-offs in statistical performance. We further characterize the estimation biases introduced by the frequency domain approach and demonstrate effective strategies to mitigate them. This work enables a powerful class of analysis techniques to keep pace with the growing scale of multipopulation recordings, opening new avenues for exploring brain function.</span>

">Autophagy Dysfunction in iPSCs-Derived Neurons and Midbrain Organoids Carrying a SNCA Triplication</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD), characterized by a-Synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic neuronal loss, has no current cure. Autophagy is critical for a-Synuclein clearance, yet its real-time dynamics remain challenging to assess in human-relevant systems. Here, we used live-cell imaging to assess autophagy within human neuronal cultures and midbrain organoids (hMOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of PD patients carrying a triplication of the a-Synuclein gene (3xSNCA). Using the LC3-Rosella dual-fluorescent reporter, we quantified autolysosomes dynamics in real time. In 3xSNCA neuronal cultures, we detected early autophagy defects. In 3xSNCA hMOs, reduced autolysosome area, increased total and phosphorylated a-Synuclein (pS129), and decreased electrophysiological activity were observed at 50 days of differentiation (DoD). By 70 DoD, autophagy impairment became more pronounced, overlapping with dopaminergic neuron loss. These findings support the use of human iPSCs-derived models to study autophagy dysfunction in PD and demonstrate a temporal correlation between impaired autophagy, a-Synuclein pathology and neuronal degeneration.

">Inhibiting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex selectively enhances unsupervised statistical learning</a></h4>

              
                The brain must balance the automatic extraction of environmental regularities with top-down cognitive control, yet the causal neural mechanisms governing this interplay are debated. In particular, the hemispheric contributions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) remain unresolved. Here, we applied inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left, right, or bilateral DLPFC in 95 healthy adults during a probabilistic sequence learning task. We found that inhibiting the right and bilateral DLPFC significantly enhanced statistical learning compared to sham and left DLPFC stimulation. Contrary to the hypothesis that this competition is mediated by the suppression of existing knowledge, episodic memory performance was unaffected across all stimulation groups. These findings challenge a direct episodic gating mechanism and suggest the DLPFC's influence on statistical learning is hemisphere-dependent. As an alternative, we propose that right DLPFC inhibition shifts cognitive processing toward a more exploratory information-sampling strategy, a view supported by our finding of significantly greater reaction time variability in the right and bilateral stimulation groups. Together, our results provide causal evidence for a right-lateralized suppressive influence of the DLPFC on unsupervised learning and suggest its modulatory role is linked to information processing style rather than direct competition with episodic memory systems.

">Two forms of uncertainty hierarchically shape lexical predictions during natural speech processing</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension relies on contextual lexical predictions to optimize the processing of incoming words. As in other predictive paradigms, it is commonly assumed that prediction error, or surprisal, is weighted by a single summary statistic: uncertainty. Uncertainty reflects the overall unpredictability of the context and is typically quantified using Shannon entropy. However, for predictions involving many alternatives, as in speech, Shannon entropy is an ambiguous measure. We investigated alternative measures of uncertainty, namely the family of Renyi entropies, of which Shannon entropy is a special case. Using whole-brain intracranial EEG recordings in 33 epilepsy patients listening to natural, continuous speech, we show that, rather than Shannon entropy, contextual lexical uncertainty in speech is best captured by two extremes of the Renyi family. These reflect the probability of the most likely word and the spread across all plausible alternatives, which we term strength and dispersion, respectively. These representations are processed in distinct neural populations in a spatiotemporal hierarchy, with the encoding of dispersion preceding that of strength. Around each word onset, information flows between these clusters in a top-down and subsequently bottom-up sequence. Finally, they interact differentially with word surprisal during word processing. Our findings demonstrate that the brain encodes a multidimensional representation of uncertainty and reveal that multiple summary statistics may coexist in predictive processing. More broadly, this work introduces a flexible framework for characterizing the neural bases of uncertainty. It also highlights the potential mismatch between formal definitions of cognitive variables and their neural implementation.

">From one schema to another: How the prefrontal cortex responds to conflicting information</a></h4>

              
                Over time, we develop event schemas or scripts that shape our expectations about what typically happens in certain contexts. However, even after forming a memory about a certain event, we are often exposed to related information about that same event at later points in time. This additional information sometimes causes one to have to re-evaluate the interpretation of the original event. Over a two-day fNIRS experiment, participants were exposed to events that were subsequently updated with schema-congruent or schema-incongruent additional details. These schema-incongruent additional details make those events more fitting to another schema than originally was the case, meaning that participants would need to dissociate that event from the original schema and re-integrate it with another schema. The fNIRS results showed stronger PFC activity for events updated with schema-congruent compared to schema-incongruent details. When specifically looking at those events that were updated with schema-incongruent details, our results suggest that dissociating an event from the original schema and re-integrating it with another schema was accompanied by an initial PFC decrease early in the trial followed by a PFC increase later in the trial. This was a distinctly different pattern compared to trials in which participants failed to re-integrate the event with another schema, which showed delayed PFC increase with lower amplitude and no initial PFC decrease. Our results refine our understanding of mechanisms of adaptive memory updating in the face of conflicting information.

">A Core Pattern of Cerebellar and Brainstem Degeneration and Reduced Cerebrocerebellar Structural Covariance in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3): MRI Volumetrics from ENIGMA-Ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease. Here, we profile the spatial spread of atrophy across the whole brain, determine whether brain degeneration preferentially maps onto specific functional networks, and investigate the relationship between cerebellar and cerebral anatomical changes. Methods: Whole-brain grey and white matter (GM and WM) voxel-based morphometry was performed on 408 individuals with SCA3 (82 pre-ataxic) and 293 controls. The SCA3 cohort was stratified by ataxia severity to investigate disease progression, with cerebellar GM atrophy mapped onto a task-based functional atlas. Volume was correlated with disease duration and intensity. Cerebrocerebellar volumetric covariance was assessed to determine whether atrophy was coupled between infra- and supratentorial regions. Results: The pattern of atrophy is spatially consistent but progressive in magnitude across the disease course. The greatest atrophy was found in the pons, cerebellar WM, and cerebellar peduncles; correlations with disease severity and duration were also strongest in these regions. Cerebellar GM atrophy was greatest in functional regions associated with motor execution and planning, attention, and emotional processing. Sparse cerebral cortical atrophy appears only in the most severe disease subgroup, while striatal atrophy begins in the earliest stages. Reduced cerebrocerebellar structural covariance is observed in SCA3 participants versus controls. Interpretation: While cerebellar and brainstem atrophy become more severe, the pattern of atrophy remains largely consistent as SCA3 progresses. Cerebellar GM degeneration occurs in regions associated with motor, cognitive, and affective control, in line with clinical presentation. Cerebellar atrophy is not directly mirrored by cerebral changes.

">N100 as a Neural Marker of Atypical Early Auditory Encoding in Autism: Sensitivity to Pitch, Distance-Based Intensity, and Spatial Location</a></h4>

              
                Background: Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show atypical auditory perception. The N100 event-related potential (ERP) reflects early auditory encoding, predictive coding, and sensory gain. Therefore, this study examined N100 responses to speech stimuli as a neural marker of auditory processing differences in ASD. Methods: Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded using OpenBCI in 12 boys diagnosed with Level 1 ASD (requiring minimal support) and 15 typically developing (TD) peers. Participants passively listened to Romanian sentences systematically varied in pitch (normal, high, low), distance-based intensity (0.5, 1, 2 meters; 65, 59, 53 dB), and spatial presentation (binaural, left, right). N100 amplitudes and latencies were analyzed using Python and SPSS. Results: ASD group indicated significantly reduced N100 amplitudes for normal pitch stimuli (p = .030, = .175) and binaural presentation (p = .030, = .175). Marginal reductions were also observed for low pitch (p = .096, = .120), speech presented from a 0.5-meter distance (p = .058, = .147), and unilateral conditions (ps = .066.077, s = .130.142). No group differences emerged for N100 latency. These findings suggest attenuated early auditory responses in ASD to both typical and spatially complex speech cues. Conclusions: Results support predictive coding models proposing reduced sensory precision in ASD. The consistent amplitude attenuation, including near-significant findings, points to subtle but pervasive impairments in early auditory encoding. The use of ecologically valid speech stimuli and portable EEG underscores the translational potential of N100 as a biomarker for early identification and intervention in autism.

">Wide-ranging behavioral dysfunction in two mouse models of pathological human variants in the GRIK2 kainate receptor gene</a></h4>

              
                De novo variants in a subset of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) genes cause nonsyndromic neurodevelopmental disorders in individuals. Two recurrent variants in the kainate receptor (KAR) gene GRIK2 result in the gain-of-function (GoF) substitutions p.Ala657Thr and p.Thr660Lys in a critical pore-forming domain of the GluK2 subunit. Disorders in individuals with these variants manifest as intellectual disability, developmental delay, motor impairments, and, in the case of p.Thr660Lys, epilepsy. To explore their pathogenicity and phenotypic consequences in vivo, we generated knock-in mouse models harboring orthologous Grik2 mutations. Behavioral analyses revealed a range of developmental, motor, cognitive, and naturalistic behavior impairments in both lines, with T660K mice typically exhibiting more severe phenotypes, consistent with clinical observations in humans. GluK2(T660K) mice also display interictal EEG abnormalities and handling-induced seizures. These models establish the first in vivo platforms for dissecting the underlying mechanisms of NDDs caused by a GoF mutation in the GluK2 KAR subunit and represent crucial tools for therapeutic development.

">Left-to-right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex interhemispheric projections mediate psychosocial stress vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                Functional asymmetries in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are significant attributes of this brain area, implicated in its role in emotional processing and executive function. Evidence suggests that, under normal conditions, there is a tonic inhibition of the right (R) mPFC by the left (L) mPFC, and a dysregulation of this hemispheric functional lateralization is implicated in detrimental chronic stress effects. Considering the wide interhemispheric connection and the inhibitory tone from the LmPFC to the RmPFC, we hypothesize that alterations in the activity of the direct projections between the mPFC hemispheres during stressful situations are related to stress vulnerability. To address this question, we used a chemogenetic approach to modulate the activity of L-to-R dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) monosynaptic projections during psychosocial stress (PSS) exposure in mice. We found that activating LdmPFC projections during a repeated PSS protocol prevents stress-induced apathy-like behavior in females and males and social avoidance in male mice. On the other hand, inhibiting such projections during a single session of PSS increases vulnerability to stress effects in male mice, increasing social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors. Both glutamatergic and GABAergic cells compose the projecting interhemispheric neurons in the dmPFC. However, the LdmPFC showed a higher density of glutamatergic projections to the RdmPFC than the opposite. In conclusion, our results revealed an involvement of the monosynaptic projections from the LdmPFC to RdmPFC in the vulnerability to the behavioral alterations induced by PSS in female and male mice.

">Multivesicular release at a small central excitatory synaptic contact</a></h4>

              
                We set out to study the properties of excitatory synaptic transmission at a central connection likely to consist of a single small synaptic contact. In the cerebellar cortex, molecular layer interneurones extend sparse thin dendrites in a parasagittal plane. The nonbranching parallel fibres traverse at right angles to the dendritic plane, forming en passant excitatory synapses. This arrangement makes it very likely that any synaptic connection between a parallel fibre and an interneurone will involve only a single contact. We obtained 20 paired recordings of synaptically connected granule cells and interneurones in cerebellar slices of immature rat, recorded at room temperature. Three of these pairs were successfully labelled using biocytin and a single point of contact between them was indentified. In 19/20 recordings, multiple release events corresponding to asynchronously released vesicles were frequently resolved following a single action potential. The frequency of these events could not be accounted for by spontaneous EPSCs, whose frequency was very low. We conclude that at this excitatory synaptic contact an action potential can release more than one vesicle.

">Adolescent girls at familial risk for depression with more advanced adrenarche have altered gut microbiota</a></h4>

              
                facing a three times higher risk. Emerging evidence suggests a link between gut microbiota, neural function, and depression risk, possibly through pathways that involve brain-body interactions, including the vagus nerve. During adolescence, sex-specific changes in the microbiota align with pubertal development, although their connection to depression vulnerability remains unclear. We compared gut microbiota in adolescents at high and low familial risk for depression and explored whether differences are affected by vagal activity and pubertal stage. Methods: We collected clinical assessments, physiological data, and stool samples from 52 adolescents (aged 9-15, including 31 females), consisting of 27 high-risk and 25 low-risk individuals. We used 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing to analyze the diversity, structure, composition, and predicted function of the microbial community. A laboratory stressor task was employed to examine changes in vagally mediated heart rate variability (stress reactivity). Regressions were used to assess the relationship between depression risk, gut microbiota, and cardiovascular stress reactivity indices. Exploratory analyses investigated the effects of sex, age, and pubertal stage (adrenarche and gonarche). Results: High-risk adolescents exhibited a distinct gut microbiota profile compared to low-risk adolescents, with this effect primarily driven by female participants. This profile was characterized by a higher abundance of Prevotella, which was 2-fold higher in high-risk females, and lower levels of other beneficial genera. High-risk females were also significantly more advanced in adrenarcheal development; the link between depression risk and adrenarcheal development was mediated by gut microbiota in females. Cardiovascular stress reactivity did not differ between groups and was not linked to gut microbiota. Conclusions: Our results reveal sex-specific links between depression risk, adrenarcheal development, and gut microbiota in adolescence. The increase of Prevotella in high-risk females suggests inflammation-related pathways may connect familial vulnerability to mood disorders. Future long-term studies examining hormones, microbiota, and mood during pubertal changes are essential to determine causality and develop targeted treatments.

">Kinematic Dissection of Arm Paresis after Focal New M1, Old M1 and Red Nucleus Lesions in Non-Human Primates</a></h4>

              
                Stroke survivors typically transition through a stereotyped sequence of upper limb recovery. After initial weakness and loss of dexterity, spasticity and fixed muscle coactivation patterns (synergies) appear. Early work suggested that different features arise from distinct primary motor cortex (M1) subdivisions. Here we investigated this with modern methods, using focal ischemic lesions of cortex and electrocoagulation lesions of magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) in rhesus monkeys. Nine animals were trained on a reach and grasp task; hand kinematics were assessed with markerless tracking. Focal M1 lesions within the central sulcus (New M1 in Strick's terminology) and the posterior part of M1 on the gyrus (Posterior Old M1) both produced increases in reach trajectory variability and reductions in speed. The speed deficit was more long-lasting for Posterior Old M1, the trajectory variability deficit was more consistent for New M1. Anterior Old M1 lesions produced only small effects on speed. An extensive cortical lesion, which combined New and Old M1 with pre-motor and somatosensory cortex damage produced no more extensive deficits than lesions to OldM1 or NewM1 alone, suggesting that effects arose mainly from damage to descending pathways rather than cortico-cortical interactions. Lesions of RNm led to long-lasting slowing of reach, but no increase in variability. Subsequent cortical lesions to Old M1 led to more severe effects, and worse recovery, than without the preceding RNm lesion. This emphasizes a key compensatory role of the rubrospinal tract following cortical damage in monkey, which is not possible in humans where the rubrospinal tract is vestigial. None of the lesions investigated led to overt abnormal synergies. The results fit with differences in descending connections from each area: New M1 has fast cortico-motoneuronal output, known to be important for fine motor control (here assessed by trajectory variability); Old M1 has cortico-reticular connections able to activate the reticulospinal tract, important for generating the high forces needed for fast movements.

                <p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial endotoxin that induces innate immune responses. The present study aimed to elucidate alterations in cerebral cortical surface morphology induced by neonatal exposure to LPS using gyrencephalic ferrets. Male ferret pups received a subcutaneous injection of LPS (500&nbsp;&micro;g/g of body weight) on Postnatal Day (P)6 and P7. Furthermore, EdU and BrdU were administered on P5 and P7, respectively, to label postproliferative and proliferating cells that were exposed to LPS in the late stage of cortical neurogenesis. On P20 when the primary sulci and gyri had formed, MRI-based morphometry revealed an anterior shift in sulcal infolding in the medial and dorsolateral cortices of LPS-exposed ferrets. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that LPS increased the density of BrdU-labeled cells and reduced their apoptosis, as indicated by cleaved caspase-3 (cCasp3) immunostaining, in the outer stratum of the lateral sulcus located on the parietal association cortex. Furthermore, cCasp3 immunostaining of EdU-labeled cells was enhanced in the presylvian and lateral sulci located in the prefrontal and parietal association cortices, respectively, but was reduced in the coronal sulcus and gyrus located on the primary motor cortex in LPS-exposed ferrets. This study is the first to elucidate the effect of bacterial components on cerebral cortical sulcogyrogenesis, which is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Such altered sulcal topology may be attributed to a region-related effect on cortical neuron apoptosis in the medial and dorsolateral cortices caused by neonatal LPS exposure.</p>

Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in driving transcript expression and shaping the phenotypic plasticity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), contributing to tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms dynamically regulate the expression of key oncogenic and stemness-associated genes, enabling GSCs to adapt to environmental cues and evade targeted therapies. Importantly, epigenetic reprogramming allows GSCs to transition between cellular states, including therapy-resistant mesenchymal-like phenotypes, underscoring the need for epigenetic-targeting strategies to disrupt these adaptive processes. Understanding these epigenetic drivers of gene expression provides a foundation for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating GSCs and improving glioblastoma outcomes. Using machine learning (ML), we employ cross-patient prediction of transcript expression in GSCs by combining epigenetic features from various sources, including ATAC-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, RNAPII ChIP-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. We investigate different ML and deep learning (DL) models for this task and ultimately build our final pipeline using XGBoost. The model trained on one patient generalizes to other 11 patients with high performance. Notably, H3K27Ac alone from a single patient is sufficient to predict gene expression in all 11 patients. Furthermore, the distribution of H3K27Ac peaks across the genomes of all patients is remarkably similar. These findings suggest that GSCs share a common distributional pattern of enhancer activity characterized by H3K27Ac, which can be utilized to predict gene expression in GSCs across patients. In summary, while GSCs are known for their transcriptomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, we propose that they share a common epigenetic pattern of enhancer activation that defines their underlying transcriptomic expression pattern. This pattern can predict gene expression across patient samples, providing valuable insights into the biology of GSCs.

β-arrestins (βarrs) play a crucial role in regulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and trafficking. Canonically, interactions of βarr with the phosphorylated intracellular GPCR-tail induce a multi-step conformational transition that results in the activation of βarr. Depending on the specific interaction pattern with the receptor, βarrs adopt multiple conformational states, each tightly linked to a specific functional outcome of βarr recruitment. Despite its physiological relevance, the structural determinants of βarr activation remain poorly understood. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical and cell-based experiments, we reveal how specific interactions with a chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) promote the unbinding of the βarr2 C-tail—a crucial step in arrestin activation. Importantly, we observe that the expulsion of the C-tail is promoted by the displacement of a conserved arginine residue (Arg394) within the βarr polar core, which we dub “the arginine switch.” Our study uncovers a role for the arginine switch that, upon engagement, destabilizes the polar core as a crucial step in the CXCR7-induced βarr activation.

                <p>by Aster Q. Perkins, Erin L. Rich</p>

Economic decisions often require weighing multiple dimensions, or attributes. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to be important for computing the integrated value of an option from its attributes and comparing values to make a choice. Although OFC neurons are known to encode integrated values, evidence for value comparison has been limited. Here, we used a multi-attribute choice task for monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) to investigate how OFC neurons integrate and compare multi-attribute options. By representing attributes with separate cues and using eye tracking to measure attention, we demonstrate that OFC neurons encode the value of attended attributes independent of other attributes in the same option. Encoding was negatively weighted by the value of the matching attribute in the other option, consistent with a comparison between like attributes. These results indicate that OFC computes comparisons between attributes rather than integrated values, and does so dynamically, shifting with the focus of attention.

                <p>by Claudio Basile, Marzio Gerbella, Alfonso Gravante, Amelia Lapadula, Francesca Rodà, Luciano Simone, Leonardo Fogassi, Stefano Rozzi</p>

The lateral prefrontal cortex has been classically defined as an associative region involved in the so-called executive functions, such as guiding behavior based on abstract rules and mnemonic information. However, most neurophysiological studies on monkeys did not address the issue of whether distinct anatomical sectors of lateral prefrontal cortex play different functional roles. The main aim of this work is to study functional properties of neurons recorded from a large part of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPF) of two monkeys performing passive visual tasks and a visuo-motor task, and to map them on the anatomical areas defined on the basis of our recent parcellations. Our results show that some functional features are broadly distributed within VLPF, while others characterize specific areas. In particular, the temporal structuring of events and the general behavioral rule appear to be coded in all recorded areas, while each area differently contributes to the encoding of visual features and to the exploitation of contextual information for guiding behavior. Caudal VLPF areas, and especially caudal 12r, are characterized by a strong coding of visual information, both when passively presented or exploited for guiding behavior, while middle VLPF areas, and especially middle 46v, are rather more involved in the processing of contextual information for action organization. In this latter sector, visual stimuli/instructions appear to be encoded in a pragmatic format, that is, in terms of the associated behavioral outcome. Finally, area 45A and more anterior VLPF areas are characterized by a generally lower responsiveness to the employed tasks. Altogether, our findings indicate that caudal VLPF areas represent the first processing stage of visual input while middle VLPF areas primarily contribute to the selection and planning of contextually appropriate behaviors.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) pose a significant risk during pregnancy because of hormonal changes and increased hemodynamic stress. This study aims to assess the risk of AVM rupture during pregnancy and puerperium and to identify risk factors associated with rupture.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study included 588 women with AVMs and a history of pregnancy, enrolled from a nationwide registry in China between August 2011 and August 2021. A case-crossover design was used to compare rupture risk during pregnancy, puerperium, and non-pregnancy periods, adjusting for clinical and morphological factors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified independent risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The risk of AVM rupture was significantly higher during pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy periods (4.5% vs 1.6%; risk ratio [RR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3–4.2; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The risk was particularly elevated during the second and third trimesters. Key factors independently associated with increased rupture risk included adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy (adolescent ≤19 years or advanced ≥35 years, odds ratio [OR], 8.32; 95% CI, 2.09–28.12, <i>p</i> = 0.001), a history of AVM rupture before pregnancy (OR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.37–11.40; <i>p</i> = 0.007), diffuse nidus (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.07–5.12; <i>p</i> = 0.033), and multifetal pregnancy (OR 18.31; 95% CI, 1.14–293.27; <i>p</i> = 0.040).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pregnancy substantially increases the risk of AVM rupture, particularly during the second and third trimesters and compared to pre-first pregnancy periods. Risk factors such as adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy and multifetal pregnancy further increase the risk. These findings underscore the importance of tailored management during pregnancy for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A better understanding of factors associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and disability is needed. Given the strong link between comorbid depression and MS disease activity and disability, we aimed to determine whether the depression genetic burden, as modelled using its polygenic score, is associated with MS disease activity and disability worsening.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cohort study, we used samples from neurologist-defined adult people with MS (PwMS) followed in clinical care or during a clinical trial from existing cohorts: Canada, the United States (US), and Sweden with extensive longitudinal phenotypes. We computed the depression polygenic score (PGS) and tested its association with annualized relapse rate and worsening disability. In the US cohort, we additionally explored the time to relapse, number of enhancing lesions, and confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) worsening during the study period.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 3,420 relapsing-onset PwMS of European genetic ancestry with a median follow-up of 3 to 5 years. Meta-analyses revealed for each 1-standard deviation increase in the depression PGS, the relapse rate increased (incidence rate ratio: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.50). In the US cohort, higher depression PGS was associated with protocol-defined relapses (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.03–2.43), and time to confirmed EDSS worsening (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03–2.22) with this effect largely direct.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Meta-analyses showed a higher depression genetic burden was associated with increased MS disease activity. In the US clinical trial cohort only, we found a significant association between higher depression PGS and time to relapse and confirmed EDSS worsening. These findings may provide insights into MS disease activity and disability worsening. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>If a map-like representation in the brain originates within a distributed network of brain regions, then this network should be underpinned by white-matter pathways. To test this, we had 83 young adults learn 15 virtual environments through free exploration, followed by tests of their allocentric and non-allocentric representation of these environments. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) - based tractography was used to extract the main white matter tracts in the brain, including the inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculus, the main connections between the temporal lobe and the visual cortices, as well as the fornix, the main output pathway from the hippocampus to the cortex. Higher microstructural integrity in the inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculus and fornix, as indexed by higher FA, was associated with a more accurate scale, rotation, and translation-invariant allocentric representation of the objects' positional pattern. These findings show that properties of white matter fiber pathways that link visual cortices to the temporal lobe and the temporal lobe to other parts of the brain underpin a person's ability to form successful map-like representations.</p>

                Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) encompasses non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation, which modulate the central nervous system to probe causal links between the brain and behavior and treat disorders. Unfortunately, fixed stimulation paradigms induce variable effects due to intra- and interindividual factors. Consequently, personalized approaches to tES are increasingly used. In this review, we highlight this emerging domain of human brain stimulation, examining strategies for the personalization of stimulation parameters and their underlying rationales. Multiparameter personalization and the identification of markers indicating tES efficacy represent promising directions. Personalization is not a panacea for all the challenges of tES, but marks an essential step toward reducing the variability of this technique.

Sehgal et al. show that Δex5Δex19 NRCAM is essential for high-grade glioma growth and that its targeting by monoclonal antibodies enables in vitro killing by T cells.

                Li et al. perform multi-omics comparative analyses in subterranean mammals and identify convergent genomic signatures associated with adaptation to underground life, while their gut microbiomes show no structural or functional convergence. These findings suggest that host genome convergence, rather than microbiome convergence, underlies adaptation to subterranean environments across subterranean mammals.

                Imanishi et al. employ murine models of type 2 skin inflammation to uncover a key basophil-fibroblast pro-inflammatory feedforward loop driving pathology. Through single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) and in vivo validation, the authors demonstrate that disrupting fibroblast IL-4/13 and OSM signaling synergistically reduces skin inflammation and immune recruitment.

The derivative of the linear relationship between lipolytic flux and lipid droplet surface area is called lipolytic efficiency, which is equivalent to the lipase activity.

                Wang et al. demonstrated that Zbtb16 orchestrates the fate plasticity of heterogeneous cardiovascular progenitors (CPs) through collaborating with IGF2BP3 to specifically stabilize mRNAs for the CP subpopulation committed to cardiomyocytes, which clarifies the intrinsic link between the heterogeneity of CP subpopulations and the regulation of cardiovascular multi-lineage fate determination.

                <p>Nature Methods, Published online: 07 August 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02743-x">doi:10.1038/s41592-025-02743-x</a></p>We present a cost-effective ultra-high-throughput cytometry-based framework for the detection of physical interactions between cells, along with the characterization of complex cellular landscapes. Application of our approach can offer a systems-level understanding of immunity and facilitate study of the kinetics, mode of action and personalized response prediction of immunotherapies.

Now, in Pd5AlI2, frustrated electron motion is shown to emerge from the atomic orbital configuration, rather than the lattice geometry — which means the search space for unusual electronic structures and correlated behaviour can be broadened to materials with simpler, more common structures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100961">Molecular and mechanical signatures contributing to mouse epidermal differentiation and barrier formation</a></h4>

              
                Formation of the skin barrier requires rapid proliferation coupled with differentiation and stratification of the embryonic epidermis. Basal progenitors give rise to progeny throughout development – first to intermediate cells, a transient proliferative suprabasal cell population, and later to spinous cells. Neither the function nor the differentiation trajectory of intermediate cells has been documented. We generated transcriptomes of intermediate and spinous cells and identified specific markers that distinguish these two populations. Further, we found that intermediate cells express a subset of genes in common with granular cells of the epidermis – the terminal living cell type that helps establish the barrier. Lineage tracing revealed that most intermediate cells directly transition to granular cells without expressing markers specific to spinous cells, thus revealing a distinct lineage pathway leading to granular fate. In addition to their transcriptional similarities, intermediate and granular cells both had hallmarks of increased actomyosin contractility. We found that rather than simply lying downstream of cell fate pathways, contractility was sufficient to suppress spinous fate and promote granular gene expression. Together, these data establish the molecular and mechanical characteristics of the developing epidermis that allow this tissue to rapidly develop barrier activity.

                <i>Salmonella</i> is one of the most common foodborne pathogens, resulting in inflammatory gastroenteritis and frequently accompanied by dysbiosis. Gut commensals, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> species, have been proven to exhibit broad antibacterial activities and protect hosts against pathogenic infections. Here, <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> strain P118, screened from 290 isolates recovered from fermented yogurts and healthy piglet intestines using traditional and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>-infection screening strategies, exerts great probiotic properties. Notably, P118 and its supernatant exhibited great antibacterial activities and attenuated <i>C. elegans</i> susceptibility to <i>Salmonella</i> infection. We found that P118 protected mice against <i>Salmonella</i> lethal infections by enhancing colonization resistance, reducing pathogen invasion, alleviating intestinal pro-inflammatory response, and improving microbial dysbiosis and fecal metabolite changes. Microbiota and fecal metabolome analyses suggested P118 administration significantly decreased the relative abundances of potentially harmful microbes (e.g., <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Anaeroplasma</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>) and increased the fecal levels of tryptophan and its derivatives (indole, indole-3-acrylic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetate). Deterministic processes determined the gut microbial community assembly of P118-pretreated mice. Integrated omics further demonstrated that P118 probiotic activities in enhancing host tolerance to <i>Salmonella</i> infection were mediated by microbe-derived tryptophan/indole metabolites (e.g., indole-3-acrylic acid, indole, tryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptophan). Collective results demonstrate that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> P118 could enhance host tolerance to <i>Salmonella</i> infections via various pathways, including direct antibacterial actions, inhibiting <i>Salmonella</i> colonization and invasion, attenuating pro-inflammatory responses of intestinal macrophages, and modulating gut microbiota mediated by microbe-derived indole metabolites.

">Cocaine use disorder is associated with lower brain state transition energy particularly in higher order and excitatory networks</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder (CUD) detrimentally impacts personal health, social relationships, and economic opportunity. Here, we assess CUD-associated shifts in brain dynamics using Network Control Theory and examine how they align with previously identified changes in neurological systems and behavioral profiles of people with CUD. The SUDMEX CONN dataset consists of multi-modal MRI, cocaine use metrics, behavioral measures, and demographics of individuals with CUD (N=132, 71 CUD). We identified recurring brain activity states and used NCT to calculate the transition energy (TE) between pairs of states. ANCOVAs examined global and regional TE associations with drug use group (CUD vs controls (NC)), years of CUD, and risk-taking behaviors. We identified potential mechanisms driving the differences by correlating CUD-related regional TE effects with neurotransmitter/receptor systems. People with CUD had significantly lower global TE and default mode, dorsal attention and limbic network TE compared to non-user controls, particularly in regions enriched for noradrenaline and mu opioid receptors. Longer duration of CUD was associated with more decreased global TE, top-down TE, default mode, control and ventral attention network TE, and regional TE enriched for excitatory neurotransmitters and receptors. People with CUD needed to expend more global and top-down TE to perform better on a risk-taking task (the Iowa Gambling task), an effect which was not found in NCs. Our analysis of whole-brain activity dynamics provides a link between the effects of upstream glutamatergic excitotoxicity and/or opioid receptor dysfunction, and downstream weakening of inhibitory control that is central to CUD.

">Drift-like dynamics and information flow across the cortical hierarchy during working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is supported by widespread and distributed brain regions spanning across the cortical hierarchy. However, how working memory content evolves and is transmitted across cortical regions remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the flow of working memory information across the cortex using time-resolved fMRI decoding. Across multiple regions in visual and parietal cortex, we found that decoded working memory content drifted over time from the memoranda towards the later errors in memory reports, consistent with drift-like dynamics predicted by attractor models. These behaviorally predictive neural memory errors emerged earliest in higher-order dorsal visual area (V3AB) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS0), and then later in early visual cortex (V1), suggesting a propagation of mnemonic information originated in higher-level visual area. Inter-areal correlation analyses revealed that during memory maintenance, information flowed predominantly in a top-down manner, from higher to lower visual areas whereas during passive viewing feedforward dynamics prevailed. Together, our findings demonstrate that working memory maintenance involves temporally structured drift dynamics and feedback-dominated information flow across cortical hierarchy, providing a mechanistic link between neural population dynamics and the formation of memory errors.

">Neural Oscillations Coordinate Continuous Error Correction During Force Control</a></h4>

              
                Effective motor control depends on the brain's ability to monitor performance and make continuous corrections. While many studies focus on discrete errors, everyday actions often require ongoing feedback-based adjustments. Here, we used an isometric force control task with EEG to investigate the neural dynamics supporting real-time error correction. Participants maintained a constant grip force with or without continuous visual feedback. With feedback, behavior showed ~6 Hz rhythmic fluctuations, consistent with active correction. These fluctuations were mirrored in EEG activity across theta, beta, and alpha bands, oscillations linked to performance monitoring, updating, and attentional control. Without feedback, performance decayed linearly, and the corresponding neural signatures were reduced. These findings suggest that continuous sensory feedback engages a dynamic feedback loop involving distinct neural processes that support adaptive behavior. Our results highlight the importance of oscillatory activity in tracking and correcting moment-to-moment fluctuations in force, offering insight into the neural basis of feedback-loop force control.

">Serotonin shapes the temporal window for associative fear learning</a></h4>

              
                Fear learning is a critical adaptive mechanism that enables the association of an environmental cue (the conditioned stimulus, CS) with a potential threat (the unconditioned stimulus, US), even when these events are temporally discontiguous. When associations are instead formed between unrelated cues and threats, the maladaptive learning process can give rise to neurological disorders. Therefore, maintaining accurate temporal boundaries for forming such associations is crucial for distinguishing real threats from irrelevant stimuli. Despite its importance, the mechanisms defining this precise time window remain poorly understood. Here, we report that serotonin plays a crucial role in modulating the associable interval in trace fear conditioning. Specifically, we show that serotonergic projections from the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) to the CA1 region of the ventral hippocampus (vCA1) dynamically regulate the association of discontiguous CS and US. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sustained serotonin release in the vCA1 maintains the ensemble activity of 5-HT2C receptor-expressing pyramidal neurons, facilitating the association between temporally separated events. In contrast, when the trace interval exceeds the associable window, transient serotonin release fails to drive vCA1 neuronal ensemble activity, thus preventing maladaptive learning. These findings highlight a key role for serotonin in regulating the temporal precision of fear learning and reveal the DRN-vCA1 serotonergic pathway as a potential therapeutic target for related disorders.

">Frontocentral brain networks amplify action-oriented temporal prediction errors</a></h4>

              
                Successful sensorimotor behavior depends on anticipating when a tactile event will occur and translating it into rapid action, yet it remains unclear how action requirements shape temporal prediction in the human cortex. Here, we combined Magnetoencephalography (MEG), multivariate decoding and computational modeling to contrast temporally jittered finger stimulations under passive versus action-oriented conditions. We characterized a distributed frontal sensorimotor network that was linked to fast tactile-motor associations and predicted reaction-time variability. We found that trial-by-trial deviations from expected stimulus timing modulated behavior, with stronger frontocentral prediction-error encoding when an overt response was required. Temporal prediction errors were primarily encoded in a motor rather than sensory reference frame. These results reveal that action demands dynamically amplify temporal error signaling in sensorimotor circuits, in line with predictive coding frameworks postulating that the brain preferentially encodes task-relevant and goal-directed sensory prediction errors.

">Human Beta Oscillations Reflect Magnitude and Fidelity of Priority Shifts in Working Memory.</a></h4>

              
                Flexible prioritisation in working memory (WM) is supported by neural oscillations in frontal and sensory brain areas, but the roles of different oscillations remain poorly understood. Recordings in humans suggest an interplay between prefrontal slow frequency (2-8Hz) and posterior alpha-band (10Hz) oscillations regulating top-down control and retrieval of WM representations, respectively. Complementary work, primarily in non-human primates, suggests an additional role for beta (15-30Hz) oscillations in clearing or inhibiting stimuli from entering WM. Here we investigated the role of neural oscillations in prioritising WM content using electroencephalography (EEG) as participants (humans of any sex) performed a task requiring frequent priority switches between two memorized oriented bars. Behavioral performance revealed switch costs, which scaled with the angular distance between the two items, suggesting that priority shifts are modulated by shift magnitude. Time-frequency analyses revealed increased frontal theta (4-8Hz) and decreased central-parietal beta (15-25Hz) power during switches. Crucially, only beta desynchronization scaled with the magnitude of the priority shift and predicted the fidelity of neural decoding of the newly prioritized item during subsequent recall. Theta power, by contrast, was elevated on switch trials but did not vary with update magnitude or decoding strength, suggesting a more general role in signaling control demands. Our findings highlight a particular and previously overlooked role for beta-band desynchronization in the flexible prioritisation of WM content.

">Neural correlates of individual variability in reward-based motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in motor learning are linked to variability in the neural processes associated with feedback processing and motor memory retention. This study investigated the neural correlates of reward-based motor learning and focused on two electrophysiological markers: event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor cortex and feedback-related negativity (FRN) from frontal EEG channels. Sixty-four healthy adults performed a visuomotor rotation task with monetary reward or punishment feedback. Learning amount, defined as the degree of error compensation, and retention amount, defined as the maintenance of adapted motor behavior in a no-vision condition, were quantified. Scalp EEG was recorded to assess alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) ERD over the primary motor cortex (M1) during movement preparation and FRN amplitude following feedback presentation. Stepwise regression revealed that FRN amplitude in the late adaptation phase was associated with learning amount, but only among participants with robust event-related potential (ERP) responses (amplitude > {+/-}5 V). This finding suggests that greater neural sensitivity to feedback supports better learning. In contrast, alpha ERD magnitude in the late adaptation phase, along with reinforcement conditions, was a significant predictor of motor skill retention in the full sample, although no interaction effect was observed. These findings suggest that FRN and alpha ERD reflect dissociable neural mechanisms underlying learning and retention, respectively, with FRN indexing feedback sensitivity and alpha ERD reflecting cortical excitability related to memory consolidation. The absence of interaction effects between neural markers and reinforcement conditions further supports the idea that these processes contribute independently to motor adaptation. Practically, combining reward-based training with interventions that increase M1 excitability may enhance retention, while tailoring feedback strategies to maximize FRN responses may improve learning efficiency. These findings provide novel insights into the neural basis of individual variability in motor learning and suggest avenues for personalized approaches in rehabilitation and skill learning.

">Comparing Robotic and Computer Vision Assessments of Unilateral and Bilateral Reaching in Healthy Adults</a></h4>

              
                Assessment of reaching is foundational to upper limb neurorehabilitation. Current neurorehabilitation needs have increased the demand for quantitative clinical assessments of bilateral coordination. Robotics and computer vision for motion tracking are two means to provide relevant quantitative metrics but have many differences including the dimensionality of reaching movements (planar versus three-dimensional) and data acquisition. We do not know how consistent measures of bilateral coordination performance are between these different assessments. In this study, we examined how one robotic and one computer vision method can identify differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical reaching, and the correlations in movement time, and hand lag between these two approaches. Thirty healthy young adults completed four reaching games using the Kinarm exoskeleton robot and a custom developed augmented reality assessment using computer vision. We found that both approaches were able to detect well-established movement time and hand lag differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical reaching, with the differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical being larger with the computer vision approach. Moderate correlations were found between approaches for unilateral and symmetric reaching in both movement time and hand lags; however, no significant correlations were found between approaches for asymmetric reaching. Our results show that reaching task performance differs between robotic and computer vision-based assessment, however, both approaches provide quantitative metrics of unilateral and bilateral reaching that are consistent with prior research. There are benefits and tradeoffs to each approach, and this study informs how clinicians and researchers can consider the methodological differences when determining which assessment method to use.

">Rapamycin enhances VEGFA and VSMC contractile protein expression in MSCs via mTORC1 inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Intracranial aneurysm (ICA) rupture is the most common cause of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, a devastating type of stroke. Vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) and endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and death play important roles in the etiology of ICA formation, rupture and treatment failure. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been extensively investigated for their therapeutic potential in vascular diseases. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulatory pathway involved in cellular functions controlling intracellular anabolic and regulatory processes. Rapamycin, a specific mTOR complex 1 inhibitor, is widely used in the clinical management of cardiac and vascular pathologies. In this study, we explored MSCs potential to express VSMC and EC markers under the influence of rapamycin. Methods Human MSCs were treated with rapamycin for 2, 5, and 10 days, and cell death and proliferation determined by MTT analysis. Protein expression and phosphorylation levels were determined by western blot analysis. Calcein AM and PI staining was used to determine cell viability, and morphology. Results MTT and Calcein AM analysis demonstrated that prolonged rapamycin treatment did not affect MSC viability but was found to reduce MSC proliferation and cause a nearly threefold increase in cell size compared to controls. Rapamycin treatment increased expression of the VSMC protein markers, Alpha-SMA, and transgelin and was required to maintain elevated expression levels both proteins. In contrast, selective inhibition of mTORC2 with JR-AB2-01 caused a decrease in Alpha-SMA and trangelin expression, suggesting mTORC1 regulation of Alpha-SMA and transgelin expression, rather than mTORC2. Rapamycin treated MSC were also found to induce cell sprouting between adjacent cells. MSCs were found not to express endothelial protein markers under either basal conditions or following rapamycin treatment. However, rapamycin treatment was found to increase VEGFA expression, a known promoter of angiogenesis. Conclusion Rapamycin has the potential to increase VSMC protein expression in MSCs by its action on mTORC1. The ability of rapamycin to increase VEGFA expression in MSCs could allow for a novel MSC-based therapeutic intervention in cerebral aneurysm management which could aid in ICA healing and reducing rupture risk.

">Single-cell multiomic human brain atlas reveals regulatory drivers of cortical regionality</a></h4>

              
                Distinct regional functionality of the human cortex is orchestrated by diverse cellular and molecular processes, yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. We performed multiomic single-cell and spatial characterization of nine regions of the human cortex to define the gene regulatory networks and transcription factors that govern cell-type and region specificity. With the combined data of over three million cells, two striking patterns of cortical neuron specialization were uncovered: a rostral-caudal gradient of calcium regulatory machinery, and subunit switching of multiple signaling receptor families across the transmodal-sensory axis. Gene regulatory network analysis revealed putative transcriptional regulators of cortical neuron specialization with cell-type- and region-specific gene regulation patterns. While regionalization was observed in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and spatial distributions, these modalities exhibited distinct cortical patterns. Our findings illuminate critical neuronal pathways that vary throughout the cortex and the gene regulatory networks that establish cortical regionalization in the human brain.

">CK2 inhibition suppresses glial inflammation in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation plays a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. Chronic activation of astrocytes and microglia fuels neuronal damage via cytokine secretion, oxidative stress, and proteolysis. However, glial inflammatory regulation remains poorly understood. Using chemoproteomics, we identified CK2, particularly the brain-enriched catalytic subunit CK22, as a key driver of astrocytic inflammation. CK2 enhances NF-{kappa}B activity by phosphorylating NF-{kappa}B S529 and I{kappa}B S32, promoting pro-inflammatory gene expression. CK2 inhibition via genetic or chemical approaches dampens inflammation, including IL-6 and IL-8 expression in an acute neuroinflammation mouse model. CK22 is upregulated in AD postmortem tissues and patient-derived astrocytes. AD astrocytes exhibit a hyperinflammatory state that can be attenuated by CK2 inhibition. Overexpression of CK22 in cortical organoids mimics AD pathology, whereas CK2 inhibition using the potent, selective, and brain-penetrant probe TAL606 rescues inflammatory markers in transgenic AD mice. These findings position CK2 as a central regulator of neuroinflammation and a promising therapeutic target for AD and related disorders.

">Exogenous Photoreceptor-Specific N-Glycosylated PROM1 Rescues Retinal Degeneration in Patient and Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                PROM1 is widely expressed across various tissues. However, its pathogenic mutations are exclusively associated with inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD). The mechanisms underlying this retina-specific vulnerability remain poorly understood, and no effective treatment currently exists for PROM1-IRD. Here, we utilized urine cells, hiPSCs, hiPSC-RPE cells, retinal organoids (ROs) and Prom1-/- mice to address these challenges. During photoreceptor development in ROs, PROM1 co-localized with ciliary marker ARL13B and outer segment (OS) marker PRPH2. It exhibited photoreceptor-specific mRNA splicing isoforms and unique N-glycosylation. In IRD patient-specific models with the PROM1 c.619G>T (p.E207X) homozygous mutation, we observed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and altered splicing, leading to complete loss of PROM1 protein and OS-like structure disruption, faithfully recapitulating PROM1-IRD pathology. To rescue these defects, we engineered a photoreceptor-specific AAV7m8-CRXp-hPROM1, which successfully restored PROM1 expression and OS-like structures in patient-derived ROs. Therapeutic efficacy was further validated in Prom1-/- mice, where subretinal delivery of AAV8-CRXp-hPROM1 led to photoreceptor-specific expression of human PROM1, significantly preserving OS morphology and improving visual function. These findings not only provide the first solid preclinical evidence supporting gene therapy for PROM1-IRD, but also reveal photoreceptor-specific vulnerability to PROM1 mutations, offering a novel conceptual framework for investigating and treating related IRDs.

">Tau deletion results in sex-dependent modulation of synaptic weakening in rat hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Tangles, a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are composed principally of hyperphosphorylated and misfolded tau species. However, dysregulation of tau precedes tangle formation by many years and is associated with cognitive decline, the best functional correlate of which is synaptic weakening and eventual synaptic loss. Although tau is present at synapses, its normal synaptic function is poorly understood - information vital to the rational development of tau-modifying therapies. Since rats have a greater cognitive repertoire than mice and display more robust signs of tau pathology in AD models, we developed a tau knockout (Mapt-/-) rat to investigate the impact of tau elimination on synaptic function. We observed that long-term depression (LTD), a form of synaptic weakening, is enhanced in the hippocampus of male, but not female, rats. This enhanced LTD was dependent on the synaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and involved altered synaptic actin polymerization. These studies therefore provide mechanistic insights into how tau modulates synaptic function via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Our findings are relevant to the understanding of the physiological roles of synaptic tau, the functional consequences of tau-lowering therapies, and the influence of sex in AD susceptibility.

">Energy Landscape Analysis with Automated Region-of-Interest Selection via Genetic Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                Understanding brain dynamics is essential for advancing cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Energy landscape analysis (ELA), based on the pairwise maximum entropy model, is a powerful framework to characterize brain activity as transitions among discrete states defined by regional activity patterns. However, traditional approaches require a predefined set of regions of interest (ROIs), usually chosen based on prior knowledge from hypothesis-driven studies, which introduces subjectivity and may overlook previously unknown patterns. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new ELA framework enhanced by automated ROI selection using genetic algorithm optimization, called ELA/GAopt. ELA/GAopt employs a genetic algorithm to select ROI subsets that maximize model fitting accuracy while accounting for individual variability. We applied ELA/GAopt to two independent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. In Scenario 1, we tested how well the method generalizes using the Creativity dataset (OpenNeuro: ds002330), which includes 66 healthy adults (29 males, 36 females, and one non-binary individual; average age 26.6 {+/-} 4.3 years). ELA/GAopt was performed on a discovery set (n = 31), and the optimized ROI sets were validated on a test set (n = 30). Over 100 independent optimization runs, the selected ROI sets achieved significantly higher objective function values than randomly chosen ROI sets (permutation test, p < 0.05, false discovery-rate corrected). The similarity of local minimum states between discovery and test sets was also significantly higher for ELA/GAopt than for random selection (p < 0.05). These results confirm the reproducibility and generalizability of the proposed approach. In Scenarios 2-4, we analyzed data from 293 participants in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II dataset, including 157 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 136 typically developing controls (CTL) from discovery cohort A and validated findings in an independent cohort (54 ASD and 72 CTL participants). ELA/GAopt showed that ASD participants tend to visit local minima characterized by global co-activation of selected ROIs, especially within sensory-motor and visual networks. Additionally, ROI sets optimized for one group (ASD or CTL) did not generalize across groups, with significant differences in the number and structure of local minima (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05, false discovery-rate corrected). These findings demonstrate that ELA/GAopt offers a robust, data-driven approach to modeling brain state dynamics, minimizing biases from predefined ROI selection. It improves reproducibility and could aid in discovering neuroimaging biomarkers for clinical conditions.

">Coordinate-Dependent Neuroinflammation and Metabolic Disruption Following Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term neurological dysfunction, with secondary neuroinflammation playing a pivotal role in disease progression. Microglia, the brains resident immune cells, respond to injury in a spectrum of activation states, influencing neuronal survival and cognitive recovery. While past studies have broadly examined neuroinflammatory responses following TBI, the influence of injury approach, specifically, anterior vs. posterior impact, on microglial activation and neuronal damage remains unexplored. This study investigated how the site of controlled cortical impact (CCI) in a moderate TBI model alters neuroinflammatory responses and neuronal vulnerability, providing key insights into coordinate-specific mechanisms of injury.

                Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) offers sub-diffraction resolution vascular imaging by tracking individual contrast microbubbles. However, transcranial implementation in non-human primates remains challenging due to the skull's acoustic attenuation and distortion. This study presents a method for non-invasive transcranial ULM imaging of the anesthetized squirrel monkey through intact skull and skin. We systematically evaluated key ultrasound acquisition parameters and identified an optimal configuration balancing resolution, depth, and vascular representation. Using these refined parameters, we achieved a system resolution of 9.5 m, measured by Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC), and consistently visualized vessels as small as 23 m. Full-brain coronal and sagittal acquisitions revealed major vascular landmarks that were reproducible across animals and slices. Importantly, this resolution enables reliable detection of penetrating arterioles and venules, key elements in neurovascular coupling and implicated in various cerebrovascular pathologies. Finally, by tracking microbubbles, we quantified flow velocities from 8.8 to 55 mm/s, corresponding to flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 279 L/min, demonstrating the technique's ability to access micro- and macrovascular dynamics. This work establishes a framework for high-resolution, non-invasive brain imaging in non-human primates, and opens promising perspectives for studying cerebral structure, function, and dysfunction in translational neuroscience.

                <p>Neurite outgrowth is critically controlled by calcium influx-mediated cytoskeleton dynamics. Spastin, a AAA ATPase microtubule-severing protein, also plays an important role in neurite outgrowth. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying posttranscriptional fine-tuning spastin activity, particularly in the context of calcium signaling, remain elusive. Here, we identified that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (CaMKII&beta;) isoform acted as an upstream kinase to mediate the phosphorylation of spastin. CaMKII&beta; interacted with and phosphorylated spastin on Ser233 and Ser562 amino acids. Moreover, CaMKII&beta;-mediated phosphorylation reduced the polyubiquitination level of spastin and suppressed its proteasomal degradation. This enhanced protein stability by CaMKII&beta; increased the microtubule-severing activity of spastin and coordinately promoted the neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. Inhibition of spastin or CaMKII&beta; impaired synaptic activity, as evidenced by reduced frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Behaviorally, treatment with spastin or CaMKII&beta; inhibitors led to deficits in short-term working memory and spatial learning, as assessed by Y-maze and Morris water maze tests in male mice, respectively. In general, this study unveils a novel mechanism whereby CaMKII&beta;-mediated phosphorylation of spastin connects extracellular calcium signaling to the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics and neurite outgrowth.</p>

                <p>Interpreting ambiguous environmental cues, like facial expressions, becomes increasingly challenging with age, especially as cognitive resources decline. Managing these challenges requires adaptive neural mechanisms that are essential for maintaining mental well-being. The locus ceruleus (LC), the brain's main norepinephrine source, regulates attention, arousal, and stress response. With extensive cortical connections, the LC supports adapting to cognitive demands and resolving conflicting cues from environment, particularly in later life. Previous research suggests that LC interacts with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during high-conflict tasks. However, whether LC activity and its connectivity with the PFC support emotional ambiguity processing and contributes to emotional well-being in healthy aging remains unclear. To address this gap, we used 7T-MRI to examine LC function in 75 younger (25.8 &plusmn; 4.02&nbsp;years, 35 females) and 69 older adults (71.3 &plusmn; 4.1&nbsp;years, 35 females) during facial emotion recognition task morphed with varying ambiguity: unambiguous, intermediate ambiguity, and absolute ambiguity. Behaviorally, participants had longer response times and lower confidence during the absolute-ambiguity condition, while older adults perceived ambiguous faces as happy more frequently than younger adults. Neuroimaging results revealed older adults exhibited greater LC activity and enhanced connectivity with dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) during absolute ambiguity compared with younger adults. This heightened connectivity in older adults was linked to better task-independent self-reported mental well-being questionnaires and greater emotional resilience scores derived from principal component analysis. Overall, these findings suggest that greater LC activity supports managing cognitively demanding tasks, while enhanced LC&ndash;dlPFC connectivity promotes emotional well-being, highlighting this neural pathway's role in healthy aging.</p>

                <p>Stress is a critical risk factor for the development of psychological disorders, including anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Key brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC), play crucial roles in fear regulation. Our previous research demonstrated that neuronal genomic activity of glucocorticoid receptors in the BLA during a 2&nbsp;h acute restraint stress (ARS) is essential for inducing anxiety-like behavior 10&nbsp;d later. Additionally, blocking BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during the elevated plus maze is crucial for preventing this stress-induced delayed anxiety-like behavior. Here, we utilized adult male Wistar rats to expand on these findings, revealing that a single ARS session increases the activity of BLA neurons and their projections to the IL-mPFC while decreasing the activity of IL-mPFC neurons and their projections to the BLA during fear extinction. This finding highlights the key role of the BLAIL-mPFC circuitry in fear extinction and its susceptibility to acute stress-induced changes. Notably, the delayed stress-induced fear extinction deficit and decreased IL-mPFC activity during fear extinction depend on the stress-responsive BLA neuronal ensemble and BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during contextual fear conditioning (CFC) 10&nbsp;d poststress. Our findings demonstrate the significance of BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during CFC, as it induces delayed stress-induced impairments in extinction and regulates IL-mPFC activity during fear extinction. Furthermore, this study indicates that the BLA is a pivotal regulator of delayed stress effects at both the circuitry and behavioral levels, thus shedding new light on the mechanisms underlying stress-related psychiatric conditions.</p>

                <p>Nicotine addiction remains a major cause of disease and premature death worldwide. Nicotine modulates neural pathways that underlie both rewarding and aversive behavioral effects, but persistent activation of brain reward circuitry drives nicotine consumption despite the negative consequences. When nicotine users attempt to quit, additional neural mechanisms are recruited to generate an aversive withdrawal state, which contributes to the remarkably high relapse rate among nicotine users. The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) and its presynaptic inputs from the medial habenula are key mediators of aversive nicotine withdrawal symptoms, but the downstream neural targets mediating these effects are unknown. The aversive effects of acute exposure to high doses of nicotine require inhibitory IPN GABAergic projections to the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg), a key driver of reward-related dopamine signaling. Here we show that optogenetic inhibition of these IPN-&gt;LDTg projections reduces behavioral and physiological effects of nicotine withdrawal in male and female mice. Using fiber photometry, we found that nicotine withdrawal reduced reward-related signaling with decreases in both LDTg neuronal activity and nucleus accumbens dopamine release. These studies demonstrate a direct link between aversive and appetitive neural pathways that is active during nicotine withdrawal, providing novel targets for treating nicotine addiction.</p>

                <p>The endogenous aspect of social influence, reflected in the spontaneous alignment of behaviors within close social relationships, plays a crucial role in understanding human social behavior. In two studies involving 222 human subjects (Study 1: <I>n</I> = 175, 106 females; Study 2: <I>n</I> = 47, 33 females), we used a longitudinal behavioral study and a naturalistic stimuli neuroimaging study to investigate the endogenous consumer behavior similarities and their neural basis in real-world social networks. The findings reveal that friends, compared with nonfriends, exhibit higher similarity in product evaluation, which undergoes dynamic changes as the structure of social networks changes. Both neuroimaging and meta-analytic decoding results indicate that friends exhibit heightened neural synchrony, which is linked to cognitive functions such as object perception, attention, memory, social judgment, and reward processing. Stacking machine learning-based predictive models demonstrate that the functional connectivity maps of brain activity can predict the purchase intention of their friends or their own rather than strangers. Based on the significant neural similarity which exists among individuals in close relationships within authentic social networks, the current study reveals the predictive capacity of neural activity in predicting the behavior of friends.</p>

                <p>The brain's representation of hand position is critical for voluntary movement. Representation is multisensory, combining visual and proprioceptive cues. When these cues conflict, the brain recalibrates its unimodal estimates, shifting them closer together to compensate. Research suggests such updates to body representation are communicated to the motor system to keep hand movements accurate. The neural mechanism is unclear and may depend on how the brain integrates and recalibrates visuoproprioceptive signals: models ranging from hierarchical convergence after unisensory processing to more distributed frameworks have been proposed. We hypothesized that the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is crucial in this updating process due to its role in proprioception and connections with both primary motor cortex (M1) and multisensory regions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). In human participants of both sexes, Experiment 1 showed that short-latency afferent inhibition, a measure of somatosensory&ndash;motor integration, changed with proprioceptive recalibration and only in the presence of a cue conflict. This indicates that S1 activity reflects the results of multisensory computations and is inconsistent with a pure hierarchical convergence model of visuoproprioceptive integration. Experiment 2 found that modulating S1, but not M1, with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation increased proprioceptive variance and recalibration. This is consistent with the idea that motor effects of proprioceptive recalibration are mediated by the S1-&gt;M1 pathway, although not directly controlled by M1 itself. The specificity of our findings to proprioceptive&mdash;not visual&mdash;recalibration argues against a fully distributed framework, but our findings support a model of multisensory integration with reciprocal interactions between S1 and PPC.</p>

                <p>Identification of the neuron type is critical when using extracellular recordings in awake, behaving animal subjects to understand computation in neural circuits. Yet, modern recording probes have limited power to resolve neuron identity. Here, we present a generalizable framework for assigning the neuron type from extracellular recordings in nonhuman primates. The framework uses a combination of logic, circuit architecture, laminar information, and functional discharge properties. We apply the framework to the well characterized architecture of the cerebellar circuit by using well validated strategies to perform expert identification for a subset of extracellular neural recordings in behaving male rhesus macaques. We then use the subpopulation of expert-labeled neurons to train deep-learning classifiers to perform neuron identification with readily accessible extracellular features as inputs. Waveform, discharge statistics, and the anatomical layer each provide information about neuron identity for a sizable fraction of cerebellar units. Together, as inputs to a deep-learning classifier, the features perform even better. Our tools and methodologies, validated during smooth pursuit eye movements in the cerebellar floccular complex of awake behaving monkeys, can guide expert identification of the neuron type across neural circuits and species by leveraging the circuit layer, waveforms, discharge statistics, anatomical context, and circuit-specific knowledge. Thus, our generalized methodology lays essential groundwork for characterization of information processing at the level of neural circuits.</p>

                <p>In sleep, the brain balances protecting processes like memory consolidation with preserving responsiveness to significant external stimuli. Although reductions in higher-level auditory processes during deeper sleep have been described, the sleep-dependent changes across levels of auditory hierarchy, particularly as regards early sound representations, remain undefined. The frequency-following response (FFR) is an evoked auditory response that indexes neural encoding of sound periodicity. It is generated by neural populations in the brainstem, thalamus, and auditory cortex that phase-lock to periodic auditory stimuli and encode pitch information. The FFR&rsquo;s neural sources, which can be resolved using magnetoencephalography, allow evaluation of neural representation strength throughout the auditory neuraxis as a function of sleep state, as well as neural events like slow waves and sleep spindles that are hypothesized to attenuate acoustic processing as a means of preserving the sleep state. We recorded FFRs during a 2.5 h nap from 14 healthy male and female human adults to investigate how sleep depth and microarchitecture affect auditory encoding. We show that FFR strength is maintained across non-rapid eye movement sleep stages in subcortical nuclei, yet decreases in deeper sleep in the auditory cortex. FFR strength was not influenced by slow wave or spindle activity, but rather by reduced communication between the thalamus and cortex. This differentiation in sound representation across the auditory hierarchy suggests a means by which the brain might balance environmental monitoring with preserving critical restorative processes.</p>

                <p>Extensive evidence shows that humans are inconsistent in their choices. Yet, the neural mechanism underlying inconsistent choice remains unknown. Here, we aim to show that inconsistent choice is tied to the valuation process but is also linked to motor dynamics during task execution. We report the results from two behavioral and one neuroimaging studies. Human subjects (<I>n</I> = 206, 117 females) completed a well validated risky-choice task to measure their inconsistency levels, followed by two novel tasks, explicitly designed to examine motor dynamics free of value computations. We record mouse trajectories during task execution and extract 34 features to examine the role of motor dynamics in choice inconsistency. We show that motor dynamics predict inconsistency levels, even when motor output is absent any sort of valuation elements, nor is it related to deliberation about the decision. These results are robust across all three studies and when using various analysis strategies. We then apply neuroimaging and show that inconsistency is represented in value brain areas but, at the same time, is also related to activity in motor brain regions. These findings suggest that inconsistent choice behavior may arise from multiple cognitive processes and invite choice theorists to examine models of inconsistent choice that include heterogeneous sources of stochasticity.</p>
