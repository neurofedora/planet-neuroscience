">Cerebrovascular Health Mediates Processing Speed Change Through Anterior White Matter Alterations: A UK Biobank Study</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increased likelihood of developing dementia. While cardiovascular risk factors are modifiable and may reduce the risk of later-life cognitive dysfunction, the relationship between cerebrovascular risk factors, brain integrity and cognition remains poorly characterised. Using a large UK Biobank sample of predominantly middle-aged adults, without neurological disease, our structural equation mediation models showed that poor cerebrovascular health, indicated by the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors, was associated with slowed processing speed. This effect was best explained by anterior white matter microstructure changes, rather than posterior changes. Effects were also significantly reduced when considering other forms of cognition, demonstrating both regional- and cognitive-specificity of our effects. Critically, our findings also demonstrate that including measures of risk factor duration may be particularly important for improving estimations of cerebrovascular burden. In summary, our study demonstrates the specific impact of early cerebrovascular burden on brain structure and cognitive function, highlighting the necessary next steps for improving cerebrovascular burden quantification and improving clinical predictions.

                <p>Singing-based treatments of aphasia can improve language outcomes, but the neural benefits of group-based singing in aphasia are unknown. Here, we set out to determine the structural neuroplasticity changes underpinning group-based singing-induced treatment effects in chronic aphasia. Twenty-eight patients with at least mild nonfluent poststroke aphasia were randomized into two groups that received a 4-month multicomponent singing intervention (singing group) or standard care (control group). High-resolution T1 images and multishell diffusion-weighted MRI data were collected in two time points (baseline/5&nbsp;months). Structural gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) neuroplasticity changes were assessed using language network region of interest-based voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and quantitative anisotropy-based connectometry, and their associations to improved language outcomes (Western Aphasia Battery Naming and Repetition) were evaluated. Connectometry analyses showed that the singing group enhanced structural WM connectivity in the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and corpus callosum as well as in the frontal aslant tract (FAT), superior longitudinal fasciculus, and corticostriatal tract bilaterally compared with the control group. Moreover, in VBM, the singing group showed GM volume increase in the left inferior frontal cortex (Brodmann area 44) compared with the control group. The neuroplasticity effects in the left BA44, AF, and FAT correlated with improved naming abilities after the intervention. These findings suggest that in the poststroke aphasia group, singing can bring about structural neuroplasticity changes in left frontal language areas and in bilateral language pathways, which underpin treatment-induced improvement in speech production.</p>

                <p>Infrared neural stimulation (INS) is a promising area of interest for the clinical application of a neuromodulation method. This is in part because of its low invasiveness, whereby INS modulates the activity of the neural tissue mainly through temperature changes. Additionally, INS may provide localized brain stimulation with less tissue damage. The inferior colliculus (IC) is a crucial auditory relay nucleus and a potential target for clinical application of INS to treat auditory diseases and develop artificial hearing devices. Here, using continuous INS with low to high-power density, we demonstrate the laminar modulation of neural activity in the mouse IC in the presence and absence of sound. We investigated stimulation parameters of INS to effectively modulate the neural activity in a facilitatory or inhibitory manner. A mathematical model of INS-driven brain tissue was first simulated, temperature distributions were numerically estimated, and stimulus parameters were selected from the simulation results. Subsequently, INS was administered to the IC of anesthetized mice, and the modulation effect on the neural activity was measured using an electrophysiological approach. We found that the modulatory effect of INS on the spontaneous neural activity was bidirectional between facilitatory and inhibitory effects. The modulatory effect on sound-evoked responses produced only an inhibitory effect to all examined stimulus intensities. Thus, this study provides important physiological evidence on the response properties of IC neurons to INS. Overall, INS can be used for the development of new therapies for neurological disorders and functional support devices for auditory central processing.</p>

                Background This study conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to identify the gaps in the existing literature related to Online marketing and brand awareness strategies for HEI. It has evaluated the current state of the literature on the given topic showing the pivotal role of online marketing and brand awareness in higher education for enrollment. Methods The study used a web-based application, Biblioshiny, which comes in the bibliometrix package. The study used the Scopus database to create the data set, given its conventional construction and quality of the sources. The analysis done is descriptive. By using the bibliometrix software, the study showed the authors name, articles, sources, citations, relevant journals and co-citation from the year 2017 to 2022. The time period selected by the study was five years which means that articles published from 2017 to 2022 have been taken for the study. Results We found that HEI online marketing and brand awareness have not been explored much as it has not reached the stage of maturity. Most of the publication was done during the time of Covid-19. Also, the role of brand awareness in student enrollment decisions for HEI requires more investigation. Top most publications their sources and top authors are identified. Conclusions Bibliometric analysis has provided valuable insights into the seminal work, emerging trends, and the gap in the study. This area of study has been explored but not as much as challenges, and the effectiveness of online marketing tools like seo, sem,ppc and more has not been measured. Further, this paper allows researchers to study by examining the pattern of publications by seeing the different authorships, co-authors, collaborations, relevant sources, and citations. The insights of this paper will help education policymakers devise more creative strategies to increase enrollment, ensuring sustained relevance and competitive advantage in higher education institutions .

                <p>by Marko Šterk, Yaowen Zhang, Viljem Pohorec, Eva Paradiž Leitgeb, Jurij Dolenšek, Richard K. P. Benninger, Andraž Stožer, Vira Kravets, Marko Gosak</p>

Within the islets of Langerhans, beta cells orchestrate synchronized insulin secretion, a pivotal aspect of metabolic homeostasis. Despite the inherent heterogeneity and multimodal activity of individual cells, intercellular coupling acts as a homogenizing force, enabling coordinated responses through the propagation of intercellular waves. Disruptions in this coordination are implicated in irregular insulin secretion, a hallmark of diabetes. Recently, innovative approaches, such as integrating multicellular calcium imaging with network analysis, have emerged for a quantitative assessment of the cellular activity in islets. However, different groups use distinct experimental preparations, microscopic techniques, apply different methods to process the measured signals and use various methods to derive functional connectivity patterns. This makes comparisons between findings and their integration into a bigger picture difficult and has led to disputes in functional connectivity interpretations. To address these issues, we present here a systematic analysis of how different approaches influence the network representation of islet activity. Our findings show that the choice of methods used to construct networks is not crucial, although care is needed when combining data from different islets. Conversely, the conclusions drawn from network analysis can be heavily affected by the pre-processing of the time series, the type of the oscillatory component in the signals, and by the experimental preparation. Our tutorial-like investigation aims to resolve interpretational issues, reconcile conflicting views, advance functional implications, and encourage researchers to adopt connectivity analysis. As we conclude, we outline challenges for future research, emphasizing the broader applicability of our conclusions to other tissues exhibiting complex multicellular dynamics.

                <p>by Yasuhiro Mochizuki, Norihiro Harasawa, Mayank Aggarwal, Chong Chen, Haruaki Fukuda</p>

Changes in risk preference have been reported when making a series of independent risky choices or non-foraging economic decisions. Behavioral economics has put forward various explanations for specific effects on risk preference in non-foraging tasks, but a consensus regarding the general principle underlying these effects has not been reached. In contrast, recent studies have investigated human economic risky choices using tasks adapted from foraging theory, which require consideration of past choices and future opportunities to make optimal decisions. In these foraging tasks, human economic risky choices are explained by the ethological principle of fitness maximization, which naturally leads to dynamic risk preference. Here, we conducted two online experiments to investigate whether the principle of fitness maximization can explain risk preference dynamics in a non-foraging task. Participants were asked to make a series of independent risky economic decisions while the environmental richness changed. We found that participants’ risk preferences were influenced by the current and past environments, making them more risk-averse during and after the rich environment compared to the poor environment. These changes in risk preference align with fitness maximization. Our findings suggest that the ethological principle of fitness maximization might serve as a generalizable principle for explaining dynamic preferences, including risk preference, in human economic decision-making.

                <p>by Blox Bloxham, Hyunseok Lee, Jeff Gore</p>

How natural communities maintain their remarkable biodiversity and which species survive in complex communities are central questions in ecology. Resource competition models successfully explain many phenomena but typically predict only as many species as resources can coexist. Here, we demonstrate that sequential resource utilization, or diauxie, with periodic growth cycles can support many more species than resources. We explore how communities modify their own environments by sequentially depleting resources to form sequences of temporal niches, or intermediately depleted environments. Biodiversity is enhanced when community-driven or environmental fluctuations modulate the resource depletion order and produce different temporal niches on each growth cycle. Community-driven fluctuations under constant environmental conditions are rare, but exploring them illuminates the temporal niche structure that emerges from sequential resource utilization. With environmental fluctuations, we find most communities have more stably coexisting species than resources with survivors accurately predicted by the same temporal niche structure and each following a distinct optimal strategy. Our results thus present a new niche-based approach to understanding highly diverse fluctuating communities.

                <p>by Fleur Zeldenrust, Niccolò Calcini, Xuan Yan, Ate Bijlsma, Tansu Celikel</p>

Sensory neurons reconstruct the world from action potentials (spikes) impinging on them. To effectively transfer information about the stimulus to the next processing level, a neuron needs to be able to adapt its working range to the properties of the stimulus. Here, we focus on the intrinsic neural properties that influence information transfer in cortical neurons and how tightly their properties need to be tuned to the stimulus statistics for them to be effective. We start by measuring the intrinsic information encoding properties of putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons in L2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex. Excitatory neurons show high thresholds and strong adaptation, making them fire sparsely and resulting in a strong compression of information, whereas inhibitory neurons that favour fast spiking transfer more information. Next, we turn to computational modelling and ask how two properties influence information transfer: 1) spike-frequency adaptation and 2) the shape of the IV-curve. We find that a subthreshold (but not threshold) adaptation, the ‘h-current’, and a properly tuned leak conductance can increase the information transfer of a neuron, whereas threshold adaptation can increase its working range. Finally, we verify the effect of the IV-curve slope in our experimental recordings and show that excitatory neurons form a more heterogeneous population than inhibitory neurons. These relationships between intrinsic neural features and neural coding that had not been quantified before will aid computational, theoretical and systems neuroscientists in understanding how neuronal populations can alter their coding properties, such as through the impact of neuromodulators. Why the variability of intrinsic properties of excitatory neurons is larger than that of inhibitory ones is an exciting question, for which future research is needed.

We introduce an innovative, data-driven topological data analysis (TDA) technique for estimating the state spaces of dynamically changing functional human brain networks at rest. Our method utilizes the Wasserstein distance to measure topological differences, enabling the clustering of brain networks into distinct topological states. This technique outperforms the commonly used k-means clustering in identifying brain network state spaces by effectively incorporating the temporal dynamics of the data without the need for explicit model specification. We further investigate the genetic underpinnings of these topological features using a twin study design, examining the heritability of such state changes. Our findings suggest that the topology of brain networks, particularly in their dynamic state changes, may hold significant hidden genetic information.

                <p>by Ariana Chriss, G. Valentin Börner, Shawn D. Ryan</p>

During meiosis, pairing of homologous chromosomes (homologs) ensures the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates crossover recombination and homolog segregation during the ensuing reductional cell division. Mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive, but rapid chromosome movements during prophase I appear to play a role in the process. Apart from homolog attraction, provided by early intermediates of homologous recombination, dissociation of non-homologous associations also appears to contribute to homolog pairing, as suggested by the detection of stable non-homologous chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants. Here, we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble. The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements, as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions. Chromosome number and size as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces are identified as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction. Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. Incorporating natural chromosome lengths, the model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>For stroke patients with unknown time of onset, mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can guide thrombolytic intervention. However, access to MRI for hyperacute stroke is limited. Here, we sought to evaluate whether a portable, low-field (LF)-MRI scanner can identify DWI-FLAIR mismatch in acute ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eligible patients with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke underwent LF-MRI acquisition on a 0.064-T scanner within 24 h of last known well. Qualitative and quantitative metrics were evaluated. Two trained assessors determined the visibility of stroke lesions on LF-FLAIR. An image coregistration pipeline was developed, and the LF-FLAIR signal intensity ratio (SIR) was derived.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 71 patients aged 71 ± 14 years and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 6 (interquartile range 3–14). The interobserver agreement for identifying visible FLAIR hyperintensities was high (<i>κ</i> = 0.85, 95% CI 0.70–0.99). Visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch had a 60% sensitivity and 82% specificity for stroke patients &lt;4.5 h, with a negative predictive value of 93%. LF-FLAIR SIR had a mean value of 1.18 ± 0.18 &lt;4.5 h, 1.24 ± 0.39 4.5–6 h, and 1.40 ± 0.23 &gt;6 h of stroke onset. The optimal cut-point for LF-FLAIR SIR was 1.15, with 85% sensitivity and 70% specificity. A cut-point of 6.6 h was established for a FLAIR SIR &lt;1.15, with an 89% sensitivity and 62% specificity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A 0.064-T portable LF-MRI can identify DWI-FLAIR mismatch among patients with acute ischemic stroke. Future research is needed to prospectively validate thresholds and evaluate a role of LF-MRI in guiding thrombolysis among stroke patients with uncertain time of onset.

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide range of clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic presentation to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Although COVID-19 disease progression was studied elsewhere, it is largely unknown in Bangladesh. Methods We conducted this cross-sectional study in November 2020 to January 2021 on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Pearson chi-square tests were used to assess the disease progressions across selected variables. A logistic regression model was used to assess the associated factors of COVID-19 infection for explanatory variables. All statistics were performed using the Stata software version 14.0 (Stata corporation, college station, Texas, USA). Results A total of 384 of respondents were involved in the survey. Of participants, most males (73%), unmarried (69%), aged 18 to 35 years during survey, and lived in urban community (73%). Overall, 41% of patients were in asymptotic condition, 44% were in mild condition, while 17% were moderate to severe conditions. Male patients and patients over 50 years had severe symptoms, accounting for 52% and 50%, respectively. Nearly half of business persons and office employees had severe symptoms. Almost all married patients (98%) had severe symptoms. The severity of symptoms was also higher for patients living in urban areas (79%), smoking (95%), and not physically active (52%). Patients with diabetes, asthma/COPD, and cancer were significantly associated with severe stage of COVID-19 (p≤0.05). Patient’s age, gender, smoking status, diabetics, working conditions significantly affect Covid-19 disease progression. Conclusion The study found that 7.03% of patients had severe, 9.11% had moderate and 40.36% had asymptomatic conditions. The heterogenic association between the disease progressions with age, sex, residence, marital status, smoking habits, diabetes, physical exercise, working conditions, sedentary lifestyles. Findings highlight the idea of using vulnerability ratings for each risk factor related to disease progression.

                Background Pseudomonads are gram negative bacteria and readily form biofilms in the environment, allowing long-term colonization and persistence in sinks, water systems. They pose a risk of life-threatening opportunistic infections in immune-compromised individuals. MDR strains, make treatment increasingly difficult. Environmentally persistent MDR strains are typically problematic within healthcare facilities, however, data on MDR pseudomonad reservoirs in settings with community-acquired infections to inform preventive interventions, in resource-constrained settings is scarce. Here, we determined reservoirs and antibiotic susceptibility of Pseudomonas species in water sources in Kisumu County, Kenya with reported high levels of community acquired pseudomonad infections. Methods We adopted a cross-sectional design, randomly collecting 297 samples from tap heads, sinks, tanks, vendor and household storage containers in six selected sub-locations and one hospital (KCRH). Standard microbiological procedures were used for identification and AST of the isolates. Results We isolated Pseudomonads from 14.1% of the samples collected, predominantly from the community 10.4%. Seven different pseudomonads were identified, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominating 6.7% overall, in the community samples 5.7%, and among isolates from water tanks 21.4%. Pseudomonad isolates were 62% non-susceptible to piperacillin, 57% to tigecycline, 24% meropenem, 21% cefepime, 19% levofloxacin and 14% colistin. Carbapenem resistance was mainly detected in P. aeruginosa 80% (8/10) from Milimani sub-location 75% (6/8). 45% of the isolates recovered were MDR, mainly community-associated carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) 42%, strains susceptible to colistin. The MDR pseudomonads exhibited high multiple antibiotic resistance indices, ranging from 0.43 to 1. Conclusion This study reveals a higher prevalence of MDR pseudomonads, including CRPA strains in community water sources. These potential conduits of drug resistance present a critical public health threat, especially among immunocompromised. Regular cleaning of water storage facilities, water treatment and implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs, are required to prevent a rise in AMR and eliminate the environmental reservoirs that put the vulnerable populations at risk.

	<p>Background: Patients with supratentorial cavernous malformations (SCMs) commonly present with seizures. First-line treatments for cavernoma-related epilepsy (CRE) include conservative management (antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)) and surgery. We compared seizure outcomes of CRE patients after early (&amp;amp;le;6 months) vs. delayed (&amp;amp;gt;6 months) surgery. Methods: We compared outcomes of CRE patients with SCMs surgically treated at our large-volume cerebrovascular center (1 January 2010&amp;amp;ndash;31 July 2020). Patients with 1 sporadic SCM and &amp;amp;ge;1-year follow-up were included. Primary outcomes were International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) class 1 seizure freedom and AED independence. Results: Of 63 CRE patients (26 women, 37 men; mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD age, 36.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.6 years), 48 (76%) vs. 15 (24%) underwent early (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 2.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 months) vs. delayed (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 6.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.1 years) surgery. Most (32 (67%)) with early surgery presented after 1 seizure; all with delayed surgery had &amp;amp;ge;2 seizures. Seven (47%) with delayed surgery had drug-resistant epilepsy. At follow-up (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 5.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.3 years), CRE patients with early surgery were more likely to have ILAE class 1 seizure freedom and AED independence than those with delayed surgery (92% (44/48) vs. 53% (8/15), p = 0.002; and 65% (31/48) vs. 33% (5/15), p = 0.03, respectively). Conclusions: Early CRE surgery demonstrated better seizure outcomes than delayed surgery. Multicenter prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.</p>

	<p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enables the assessment of changes in brain tissue microstructure during maturation and ageing. In general, patterns of cerebral maturation and decline render non-monotonic lifespan trajectories of DTI metrics with age, and, importantly, the rate of microstructural changes is heterochronous for various white matter fibres. Recent studies have demonstrated that diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics are more sensitive to microstructural changes during ageing compared to those of DTI. In a previous work, we demonstrated that the Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d of mean diffusional kurtosis (dMK) represents a useful biomarker for quantifying maturation heterochronicity. However, some inferences on the maturation grades of different fibre types, such as association, projection, and commissural, were of a preliminary nature due to the insufficient number of fibres considered. Hence, the purpose of this follow-up work was to further explore the heterochronicity of microstructural maturation between pre-adolescence and middle adulthood based on DTI and DKI metrics. Using the effect size of the between-group parametric changes and Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d, we observed that all commissural fibres achieved the highest level of maturity, followed by the majority of projection fibres, while the majority of association fibres were the least matured. We also demonstrated that dMK strongly correlates with the maxima or minima of the lifespan curves of DTI metrics. Furthermore, our results provide substantial evidence for the existence of spatial gradients in the timing of white matter maturation. In conclusion, our data suggest that DKI provides useful biomarkers for the investigation of maturation spatial heterogeneity and heterochronicity.</p>

	<p>The duration of slow-wave sleep (SWS) is related to the reported sleep quality and to the important variables of mental and physical health. The internal cues to end an episode of SWS are poorly understood. One such internal cue is the initiation of a body movement, which is detectable as electromyographic (EMG) activity in sleep-electroencephalography (EEG). In the present study, we characterized the termination of SWS episodes by movement to explore its potential as a biomarker. To this end, we characterized the relation between the occurrence of SWS termination by movement and individual characteristics (age, sex), SWS duration and spectral content, chronotype, depression, medication, overnight memory performance, and, as a potential neurological application, epilepsy. We analyzed 94 full-night EEG-EMG recordings (75/94 had confirmed epilepsy) in the video-EEG monitoring unit of the EpiCARE Centre Salzburg, Austria. Segments of SWS were counted and rated for their termination by movement or not through the visual inspection of continuous EEG and EMG recordings. Multiple linear regression was used to predict the number of SWS episodes that ended with movement by depression, chronotype, type of epilepsy (focal, generalized, no epilepsy, unclear), medication, gender, total duration of SWS, occurrence of seizures during the night, occurrence of tonic-clonic seizures during the night, and SWS frequency spectra. Furthermore, we assessed whether SWS movement termination was related to overnight memory retention. According to multiple linear regression, patients with overall longer SWS experienced more SWS episodes that ended with movement (t = 5.64; p = 0.001). No other variable was related to the proportion of SWS that ended with movement, including no epilepsy-related variable. A small sample (n = 4) of patients taking Sertraline experienced no SWS that ended with movement, which was significant compared to all other patients (t = 8.00; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and to n = 35 patients who did not take any medication (t = 4.22; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). While this result was based on a small subsample and must be interpreted with caution, it warrants replication in a larger sample with and without seizures to further elucidate the role of the movement termination of SWS and its potential to serve as a biomarker for sleep continuity and for medication effects on sleep.</p>

	<p>Once thought of as an immune-privileged site, we now know that the nervous system communicates in a bidirectional manner with the immune system via the neuroimmune axis. Neuropeptides constitute a component of this axis, playing critical roles in the brain and periphery. The function of salivary neuropeptides in the acute stress response is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate salivary neuropeptide levels during acute stress. Salivary samples were collected from fire recruits engaged in a stress training exercise previously shown to induce acute stress, at three separate timepoints during the exercise and levels of oxytocin, neurotensin, Substance P, &amp;amp;alpha;-MSH, and &amp;amp;beta;-Endorphin were measured using the Human Neuropeptide 5-Plex Custom Assay Eve Technologies. All neuropeptides increased throughout the acute stress simulation and during the recovery phase. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified one factor contributing to baseline values across five neuropeptides and Pairwise Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis showed positive correlations &amp;amp;gt;0.9 for almost all neuropeptide combinations at the pre-stress timepoint. Further analysis identified negative and positive correlations between past-life trauma and self-assessed hardiness, respectively. Calculated neuropeptide scores showed an overall positive correlation to self-assessed hardiness. Altogether, our results suggest that salivary neuropeptides increase synchronously during acute stress and higher levels correlate with an increase in self-assessed hardiness. Further study is required to determine if interventions designed to enhance neuropeptide activity can increase stress resilience, especially in high-stress occupations such as firefighting.</p>

	<p>Executive functions (EFs) are related abilities, associated with the frontal lobes functions, that allow individuals to modify behavioral patterns when they become unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to assess EFs in children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and in children with &amp;amp;ldquo;specific language impairment&amp;amp;rdquo; (SLI), compared with a control group of children with normal development, to identify specific skill deficits. Three groups of preschool children aged between 2 and 6 years were assessed: 19 children with normal hearing, cognitive, and language development, 10 children with SNHL, and 20 children with SLI. The FE-PS 2-6 Battery was used for the assessment of preschool EFs, supplemented with the Modified Bell Test for the analysis of selective attention. Statistically significant differences were found between the two experimental groups and the control one, regarding the investigated skills. Children with SNHL showed a clear deficit in flexibility, whereas children with SLI had greater problems in self-regulation and management of waiting for gratification. Selective attention was found to be deficient in all three groups, with no statistically significant differences. This study shows that the skills investigated were found to be deficient in both SNHL and SLI patients. It is essential to start targeted exercises based on specific deficient skills as part of the rehabilitation program. It is of great importance to understand the consequences of EF deficit in preschool children to achieve an accurate diagnosis and carry out customized rehabilitation programs.</p>

">Antibiotic treatment induces microbiome dysbiosis and reduction of neuroinflammation following traumatic brain injury in mice.</a></h4>

              
                The gut microbiome is linked to brain pathology in cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet the specific bacteria that are implicated are not well characterized. To address this gap, in this study, we induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) in male C57BL/6J mice using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury model. After 35 days, we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) cocktail (ampicillin, gentamicin, metronidazole, vancomycin) through oral gavage for 2 days to diminish existing microbiota. Subsequently, we inflicted a second TBI on the mice and analyzed the neuropathological outcomes five days later. Longitudinal analysis of the microbiome showed significant shifts in the diversity and abundance of bacterial genera during both acute and chronic inflammation. These changes were particularly dramatic following treatment with ABX and after the second TBI. ABX treatment did not affect the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) but did alter intestinal morphology, characterized by reduced villus width and a lower count of goblet cells, suggesting potential negative impacts on intestinal integrity. Nevertheless, diminishing the intestinal microbiome reduced cortical damage, apoptotic cell density, and microglial/macrophage activation in the cortical and thalamic regions of the brain. Our findings suggest that eliminating colonized gut bacteria via broad-spectrum ABX reduces neuroinflammation and enhances neurological outcomes in TBI despite implications to gut health.

">A novel perspective on equal and cross-frequency neural coupling: integration and segregation of the brain networks' function</a></h4>

              
                We introduce a novel perspective in equal and multifrequency coupling derived from considering neuronal synchrony as a possible equivalence relation. The experimental results agree with the theoretical prediction that cross-frequency coupling results in a partition of the brain synchrony state space. We place these results in the framework of the integration and segregation of information in the processing of sensorimotor transformations by the brain cell circuits and propose that equal frequency (1:1) connectivity favours integration of information in the brain whereas cross-frequency coupling (n:m) favours segregation. These observations may provide an outlook about how to reconcile the need for stability in the brain's operations with the requirement for diversity of activity in order to process many sensorimotor transformations simultaneously.

">Alternative splicing of clock transcript mediates the response of circadian clocks to temperature changes</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks respond to temperature changes over the calendar year, allowing organisms to adjust their daily biological rhythms to optimize health and fitness. In Drosophila, seasonal adaptations and temperature compensation are regulated by temperature-sensitive alternative splicing (AS) of period (per) and timeless (tim) genes that encode key transcriptional repressors of clock gene expression. Although clock (clk) gene encodes the critical activator of clock gene expression, AS of its transcripts and its potential role in temperature regulation of clock function have not been explored. We therefore sought to investigate whether clk exhibits AS in response to temperature and the functional changes of the differentially spliced transcripts. We observed that clk transcripts indeed undergo temperature-sensitive AS. Specifically, cold temperature leads to the production of an alternative clk transcript, hereinafter termed clk-cold, which encodes a CLK isoform with an in-frame deletion of four amino acids proximal to the DNA binding domain. Notably, serine 13 (S13), which we found to be a CK1alpha-dependent phosphorylation site, is among the four amino acids deleted in CLK-cold protein. Using a combination of transgenic fly, tissue culture, and in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that upon phosphorylation at CLK(S13), CLK-DNA interaction is reduced, thus decreasing CLK occupancy at clock gene promoters. This is in agreement with our findings that CLK occupancy at clock genes and transcriptional output are elevated at cold temperature, which can be explained by the higher amounts of CLK-cold isoforms that lack S13 residue. This study provides new insights into the complex collaboration between AS and phospho-regulation in shaping temperature responses of the circadian clock.

">Accelerated protein retention expansion microscopy using microwave radiation</a></h4>

              
                Protein retention expansion microscopy (ExM) retains genetically encoded fluorescent proteins or antibody-conjugated fluorescent probes in fixed tissue and isotropically expands the tissue through a swellable polymer network to allow nanoscale (<70 nm) resolution on diffraction-limited confocal microscopes. Despite numerous advantages ExM brings to biological studies, the full protocol is time-consuming and can take multiple days to complete. Here, we adapted the ExM protocol to the vibratome-sectioned brain tissue of Xenopus laevis tadpoles and implemented a microwave-assisted protocol to reduce the workflow from days to hours. In addition to the significantly accelerated processing time, our microwave-assisted ExM (M/WExM) protocol maintains the superior resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the original ExM protocol. Furthermore, the M/WExM protocol yields higher magnitude of expansion, suggesting that in addition to accelerating the process through increased diffusion rate of reagents, microwave radiation may also facilitate the expansion process. To demonstrate the applicability of this method to other specimens and protocols, we adapted the microwave-accelerated protocol to whole mount adult brain tissue of Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies, and successfully reduced the total processing time of a widely-used Drosophila IHC-ExM protocol from 6 days to 2 days. Our results demonstrate that with appropriate adjustment of the microwave parameters (wattage, pulse duration, interval, and number of cycles), this protocol can be readily adapted to different model organisms and tissue types to greatly increase the efficiency of ExM experiments.

">Active vision in freely moving marmosets using head-mounted eye tracking</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of how vision functions as primates actively navigate the real-world is remarkably sparse. As most data have been limited to chaired and typically head-restrained animals, the synergistic interactions of different motor actions/plans inherent to active sensing e.g. eyes, head, posture, movement, etc. on visual perception are largely unknown. To address this considerable gap in knowledge, we developed an innovative wireless head-mounted eye tracking system called CEREBRO for small mammals, such as marmoset monkeys. Our system performs Chair-free Eye-Recording using Backpack mounted micROcontrollers. Because eye illumination and environment lighting change continuously in natural contexts, we developed a segmentation artificial neural network to perform robust pupil tracking in these conditions. Leveraging this innovative system to investigate active vision, we demonstrate that although freely-moving marmosets exhibit frequent compensatory eye movements equivalent to other primates, including humans, the predictability of the visual system is enhanced when animals are freely-moving relative to when they are head-fixed. Moreover, despite increases in eye/head-motion during locomotion, gaze stabilization actually improved over periods when the monkeys were stationary. Rather than impair vision, the dynamics of gaze stabilization in freely-moving primates has been optimized over evolution to enable active sensing during natural exploration.

">Non-canonical function of ADAM10 in presynaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) plays a pivotal role in shaping neuronal networks by orchestrating the activity of numerous membrane proteins through the shedding of their extracellular domains. Despite its significance in the brain, the specific cellular localization of ADAM10 remains not well understood due to a lack of appropriate tools. Here, using a specific ADAM10 antibody suitable for immunostainings, we discover that ADAM10 is localized to presynapses and especially enriched at presynaptic vesicles of mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus. These synapses undergo pronounced frequency facilitation of neurotransmitter release, a process that play critical roles in information transfer and neural computation. We demonstrate, that in conditional ADAM10 knockout mice the ability of MF synapses to undergo this type of synaptic plasticity is greatly reduced. The loss of facilitation depends on the cytosolic domain of ADAM10 and association with the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 rather than its proteolytic activity. Our findings unveil a new pathway contributing to the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

">Distinct molecular and functional properties of human induced-proprioceptor and low-threshold mechanoreceptor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Sensing mechanical stimuli is crucial for the function of internal and external tissues, such as the skin and muscles. Much of our understanding of mechanosensory physiology relies on rodent studies, which may not directly translate to humans. To address the knowledge gap in human mechanosensation, we developed distinct populations of human mechanosensory neuronal subtypes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). By inducing co-expression of NGN2/RUNX3 or NGN2/SHOX2 in hPSC-derived migrating neural crest cells we directed their specification to proprioceptor and low-threshold mechanoreceptor neuronal subtypes, respectively. The induced neurons exhibited transcriptional profiles consistent with mechanosensory neurons and displayed functional responses to mechanical stimuli, such as stretch and submicrometer probe indentation to the soma. Notably, each subtype displayed unique mechanical thresholds and desensitization properties akin to proprioceptors and low-threshold mechanoreceptors and both induced neuronal subtypes fired action potentials in response to minute mechanical stimuli, predominantly relying on PIEZO2 for mechanosensory function. Collectively, this study provides a foundational model for exploring human neuronal mechanosensory biology.

">PTPRS is a novel marker for early tau pathology and synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                We examined the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTPRS) in the context of Alzheimers disease and synaptic integrity. Publicly available datasets (BRAINEAC, ROSMAP, ADC1) and a cohort of asymptomatic but at risk individuals (PREVENT-AD) were used to explore the relationship between PTPRS and various Alzheimers disease biomarkers. We identified that PTPRS rs10415488 variant C shows features of neuroprotection against early tau pathology and synaptic degeneration in Alzheimers disease. This single nucleotide polymorphism correlated with higher PTPRS transcript abundance and lower P-tau181 and GAP-43 levels in the CSF. In the brain, PTPRS protein abundance was significantly correlated with the quantity of two markers of synaptic integrity: SNAP25 and SYT-1. We also found the presence of sexual dimorphism for PTPRS, with higher CSF concentrations in males than females. Male carriers for variant C were found to have a 10-month delay in the onset of AD. We thus conclude that PTPRS acts as a neuroprotective receptor in Alzheimers disease. Its protective effect is most important in males, in whom it postpones the age of onset of the disease.

">A Stochastic Dynamic Operator framework that improves the precision of analysis and prediction relative to the classical spike-triggered average method, extending the toolkit.</a></h4>

              
                Here we test the Stochastic Dynamic Operator (SDO) as a new framework for describing physiological signal dynamics relative to spiking or stimulus events. The SDO is a natural extension of existing spike-triggered averaging (STA), or stimulus-triggered averaging, methods currently used in neural analysis. It extends the classic STA to cover state-dependent and probabilistic responses where STA may fail. SDO methods are more sensitive and specific than the STA for identifying state-dependent relationships in simulated data. We have tested SDO analysis for interactions between electrophysiological recordings of spinal interneurons, single motor units, and aggregate muscle electromyograms (EMG) of major muscles in the spinal frog hindlimb. When predicting target signal behavior relative to spiking events, the SDO framework outperformed or matched classical spike-triggered averaging methods. SDO analysis permits more complicated spike-signal relationships to be captured, analyzed, and interpreted visually and intuitively. SDO methods can be applied at different scales of interest where spike-triggered averaging methods are currently employed, and beyond, from single neurons to gross motor behaviors. SDOs may be readily generated and analyzed using the provided SDO Analysis Toolkit. We anticipate this method will be broadly useful for describing dynamical signal behavior and uncovering state-dependent relationships of stochastic signals relative to discrete event times.

">Intradental mechano-nociceptors serve as sentinels that prevent tooth damage</a></h4>

              
                Pain is the anticipated output of the trigeminal sensory neurons that innervate the tooth's vital interior; however, the contribution of intradental neurons to healthy tooth sensation has yet to be defined. Here, we employ in vivo Ca2+ imaging to identify and define a population of myelinated high-threshold mechanoreceptors (intradental HTMRs) that detect superficial structural damage of the tooth and initiate jaw opening to protect teeth from damage. Intradental HTMRs remain inactive when direct forces are applied to the intact tooth but become responsive to forces when the structural integrity of the tooth is compromised, and the dentin or pulp is exposed. Their terminals collectively innervate the inner dentin through overlapping receptive fields, allowing them to monitor the superficial structures of the tooth. Indeed, intradental HTMRs detect superficial enamel damage and encode its degree, and their responses persist in the absence of either PIEZO2 or Nav1.8. Optogenetic activation of intradental HTMRs triggers a rapid, jaw opening reflex via contraction of the digastric muscle. Taken together, our data indicate that intradental HTMRs serve as sentinels that guard against mechanical threats to the tooth, and their activation results in physical tooth separation to minimize irreversible structural damage. Our work provides a new perspective on the role of intradental neurons as protective rather than exclusively pain-inducing and illustrates additional diversity in the functions of interoreceptors.

                Background: Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons (CIN) are drivers of L-Dopa induced Dyskinesias (LID). However, what signaling pathways elicit aberrant CIN activity remains unclear. CIN express D2 and D5 receptors suggesting repeated activation of these receptors in response to L-Dopa could promote LID. While the role of D5 in this process has recently been probed, little is known about the role of D2. Method: Mice with CIN-specific D2 ablation (D2CINKO) underwent unilateral 6-OHDA lesion and chronic L-Dopa dosing, throughout which LID severity was quantified. The effect of D2CINKO on histological markers of LID severity and CIN activity were also quantified postmortem. Results: D2CINKO attenuated LID across L-Dopa doses, reduced expression of histological LID marker p-ERK, and prevented L-Dopa-induced increases in CIN activity marker p-rpS6 in the dorsolateral striatum. Conclusion: The activation of D2 specifically on CIN is a key driver of LID.

">Paired vagus nerve stimulation drives precise remyelination and motor recovery after myelin loss</a></h4>

              
                Myelin loss in the central nervous system can cause permanent motor or cognitive deficits in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). While current immunotherapy treatments decrease the frequency of demyelinating episodes, they do not promote myelin repair or functional recovery. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulation therapy which enhances neuroplasticity and the recovery of motor function after stroke, but its effects on myelin repair are not known. To determine if VNS influences myelin repair, we applied VNS following a demyelinating injury and measured longitudinal myelin dynamics and functional recovery. We found that VNS promotes remyelination by increasing the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Pairing VNS with a skilled reach task leads to the regeneration of myelin sheaths on previously myelinated axon segments, enhancing the restoration of the original pattern of myelination. Moreover, the magnitude of sheath pattern restoration correlates with long-term motor functional improvement. Together, these results suggest that recovery of the myelin sheath pattern is a key factor in the restoration of motor function following myelin loss and identify paired VNS as a potential remyelination therapy to treat demyelinating diseases.

">Neural mechanisms of resource allocation in working memory</a></h4>

              
                To mitigate capacity limits of working memory, people allocate resources according to the relevance of an item. However, the neural mechanisms supporting such a critical operation remain unknown. Here, we developed computational neuroimaging methods to decode and demix neural responses associated with multiple items in working memory with different priorities. In striate and extrastriate cortex, the gain of neural responses tracked the priority of memoranda. Higher-priority memoranda were decoded with smaller error and lower uncertainty. Moreover, these neural differences predicted behavioral differences in memory prioritization. Remarkably, trial-wise variability in the magnitude of delay activity in frontal cortex predicted differences in decoded precision between low and high-priority items in visual cortex. These results suggest a model in which feedback signals broadcast from frontal cortex sculpt the gain of memory representations in visual cortex according to behavioral relevance, thus, identifying a neural mechanism for resource allocation.

                Background: Deep brain stimulation of central thalamus (CT-DBS) has potential for modulating states of consciousness, but it can also trigger spike-wave discharges (SWDs). Objectives: To report the probability of inducing SWDs during CT-DBS in awake mice. Methods: Mice were implanted with electrodes to deliver unilateral and bilateral CT-DBS at different frequencies while recording EEG. We titrated stimulation current by gradually increasing it at each frequency until an SWD appeared. Subsequent stimulations to test arousal modulation were performed at the current one step below the current that caused an SWD during titration. Results: In 2.21% of the test stimulations (10 out of 12 mice), CT-DBS caused SWDs at currents lower than the titrated current, at currents as low as 20 uA. Conclusion: Our study found a small but significant probability of inducing SWDs even after titration and at relatively low currents. EEG should be closely monitored for SWDs when performing CT-DBS in both research and clinical settings.

">Naturalistic acute pain states decoded from neural and facial dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Pain is a complex experience that remains largely unexplored in naturalistic contexts, hindering our understanding of its neurobehavioral representation in ecologically valid settings. To address this, we employed a multimodal, data-driven approach integrating intracranial electroencephalography, pain self-reports, and facial expression quantification to characterize the neural and behavioral correlates of naturalistic acute pain in twelve epilepsy patients undergoing continuous monitoring with neural and audiovisual recordings. High self-reported pain states were associated with elevated blood pressure, increased pain medication use, and distinct facial muscle activations. Using machine learning, we successfully decoded individual participants' high versus low self-reported pain states from distributed neural activity patterns (mean AUC = 0.70), involving mesolimbic regions, striatum, and temporoparietal cortex. High self-reported pain states exhibited increased low-frequency activity in temporoparietal areas and decreased high-frequency activity in mesolimbic regions (hippocampus, cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex) compared to low pain states. This neural pain representation remained stable for hours and was modulated by pain onset and relief. Objective facial expression changes also classified self-reported pain states, with results concordant with electrophysiological predictions. Importantly, we identified transient periods of momentary pain as a distinct naturalistic acute pain measure, which could be reliably differentiated from affect-neutral periods using intracranial and facial features, albeit with neural and facial patterns distinct from self-reported pain. These findings reveal reliable neurobehavioral markers of naturalistic acute pain across contexts and timescales, underscoring the potential for developing personalized pain interventions in real-world settings.

">Prioritizing of working memory resources depends onprefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The role the prefrontal cortex plays in working memory remains controversial. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the allocation of limited resources that support working memory is strategically controlled by a visual map in the human frontal cortex. Remarkably, transcranial magnetic stimulation of retinotopically-defined superior precentral sulcus disrupted the normal allocation of resources to memorized items based on their behavioral priority, thus providing causal support for this hypothesis.

">Decoding Early Psychoses: Unraveling Stable Microstructural Features Associated with Psychopathology Across Independent Cohorts</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early Psychosis patients (EP, within 3 years after psychosis onset) show significant variability, making outcome predictions challenging. Currently, little evidence exists for stable relationships between neural microstructural properties and symptom profiles across EP diagnoses, limiting the development of early interventions. Methods: A data-driven approach, Partial Least Squares (PLS) correlation, was used across two independent datasets to examine multivariate relationships between white matter (WM) properties and symptomatology, to identify stable and generalizable signatures in EP. The primary cohort included EP patients from the Human Connectome Project-Early Psychosis (n=124). The replication cohort included EP patients from the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research (n=78). Both samples included individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic mood disorders. Results: In both cohorts, a significant latent component (LC) corresponded to a symptom profile combining negative symptoms, primarily diminished expression, with specific somatic symptoms. Both LCs captured comprehensive features of WM disruption, primarily a combination of subcortical and frontal association fibers. Strikingly, the PLS model trained on the primary cohort accurately predicted microstructural features and symptoms in the replication cohort. Findings were not driven by diagnosis, medication, or substance use. Conclusions: This data-driven transdiagnostic approach revealed a stable and replicable neurobiological signature of microstructural WM alterations in EP, across diagnoses and datasets, showing a strong covariance of these alterations with a unique profile of negative and somatic symptoms. This finding suggests the clinical utility of applying data-driven approaches to reveal symptom domains that share neurobiological underpinnings.

	<p>In recent years, new technologies have been applied in cerebral palsy. Among these, immersive virtual reality is one with promising motor and cognitive effects along with the reduced costs of its application. The level of immersion of the subject in the illusional world gives the feeling of being a real part of the virtual environment. This study aims to investigate the safety and the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in children affected by cerebral palsy. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, RehabData, and Web of Science were screened up to February 2023 to identify eligible clinical studies. Results: Out of 788, we included 15 studies involving CP patients. There was high heterogeneity in the outcomes considered, and the results showed non-inferiority to conventional therapy and initial additional benefits in comparison with conventional rehabilitation. Conclusion: Immersive virtual reality emerges as a pivotal technological tool in rehabilitation, seamlessly integrating with conventional therapy within CP rehabilitation programs. Indeed, it not only enhances motivation but significantly increases children&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional capacity and abilities.</p>

<p>Our results suggest that the lateral spiriform nucleus of the pretectum in birds modulates brainstem-projecting tectobulbar neurons in a manner comparable to the influence of globus pallidus internus on motor thalamus in mammals and receives its striatal input from a newly recognized third striatal region called the intrapeduncular nucleus.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We used diverse methods to characterize the role of avian lateral spiriform nucleus (SpL) in basal ganglia motor function. Connectivity analysis showed that SpL receives input from globus pallidus (GP), and the intrapeduncular nucleus (INP) located ventromedial to GP, whose neurons express numerous striatal markers. SpL-projecting GP neurons were large and aspiny, while SpL-projecting INP neurons were medium sized and spiny. Connectivity analysis further showed that SpL receives inputs from subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and that the SNr also receives inputs from GP, INP, and STN. Neurochemical analysis showed that SpL neurons express ENK, GAD, and a variety of pallidal neuron markers, and receive GABAergic terminals, some of which also contain DARPP32, consistent with GP pallidal and INP striatal inputs. Connectivity and neurochemical analysis showed that the SpL input to tectum prominently ends on GABAA receptor-enriched tectobulbar neurons. Behavioral studies showed that lesions of SpL impair visuomotor behaviors involving tracking and pecking moving targets. Our results suggest that SpL modulates brainstem-projecting tectobulbar neurons in a manner comparable to the demonstrated influence of GP internus on motor thalamus and of SNr on tectobulbar neurons in mammals. Given published data in amphibians and reptiles, it seems likely the SpL circuit represents a major direct pathway-type circuit by which the basal ganglia exerts its motor influence in nonmammalian tetrapods. The present studies also show that avian striatum is divided into three spatially segregated territories with differing connectivity, a medial striato-nigral territory, a dorsolateral striato-GP territory, and the ventrolateral INP motor territory.</p>

">Switching patterns of cortical-subcortical interaction in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state fMRI studies show that functional connectivity (FC), defined as the correlation between the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals of different brain areas, undergoes rapid fluctuations, a phenomenon called dynamic or time-varying FC. Although the neural mechanisms underlying dynamic FC remain poorly understood, a recent contribution, based on a limited sample size, suggested that FC fluctuations are coordinated between cortex and subcortex, with rapidly switching FC patterns involving a dynamic reconfiguration of cortico-subcortical interactions (Favaretto et al., 2022). Here, building on the Human Connectome Project's database, we replicate those findings in a much larger cohort. Our analysis confirms that FC shifts are synchronized in cortex and subcortex, as two core subcortical clusters comprising, respectively, limbic regions (hippocampus and amygdala) and subcortical nuclei (thalamus and basal ganglia) change their connectivity pattern with cortical regions. In particular, we consistently identify two FC patterns (states). State 1 is characterized by a strong opposition of task-positive (sensorimotor networks, dorsal attention network) and task-negative networks (default mode network, limbic regions), State 2 by a strong segregation between sensorimotor networks and association networks, and a positive coupling of limbic regions with sensorimotor networks. Our findings are robust with respect to changes in the preprocessing pipeline and the precise choice of cortical or subcortical parcellation, and hint at a general relevance of cortico-subcortical interactions in the generation of whole-brain spontaneous FC patterns.

">Striatal output regulates the postnatal maturation of cortical circuits</a></h4>

              
                The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is interconnected with the basal ganglia (BG) through large-scale circuit loops that regulate critical motor and cognitive functions. In mice, these circuits undergo extensive postnatal maturation with marked changes in neural activity and expansion of synaptic connectivity. While cortical activity is known to regulate the development of downstream striatal circuits, the role of the basal ganglia in cortical maturation remains unknown. Here, we used mesoscale two-photon microscopy and whole-cell electrophysiology to examine whether striatal output during early postnatal development impacts the maturation of upstream dmPFC circuits. We found that ablating spiny projection neurons of the direct or indirect pathways of the striatum during the first two postnatal weeks causes bidirectional changes in dmPFC neural activity, similar to what is observed in mature circuits. In addition, these manipulations alter the maturation of synaptic connectivity of dmPFC layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, shifting the balance of excitation and inhibition of cortical circuits. These findings demonstrate that striatal output regulates the activity of cortical circuits during early postnatal development and suggest a regulatory role of the basal ganglia in the establishment of cortical circuits.

">Human Substantia Nigra Neurons Encode Reward Expectations</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) signals originating from substantia nigra (SN) neurons are centrally involved in the regulation of motor and reward processing. DA signals behaviorally relevant events where reward outcomes differ from expectations (reward prediction errors, RPEs). RPEs play a crucial role in learning optimal courses of action and in determining response vigor when an agent expects rewards. Nevertheless, how reward expectations, crucial for RPE calculations, are conveyed to and represented in the dopaminergic system is not fully understood, especially in the human brain where the activity of DA neurons is difficult to study. One possibility, suggested by evidence from animal models, is that DA neurons explicitly encode reward expectations. Alternatively, they may receive RPE information directly from upstream brain regions. To address whether SN neuron activity directly reflects reward expectation information, we directly examined the encoding of reward expectation signals in human putative DA neurons by performing single-unit recordings from the SN of patients undergoing neurosurgery. Patients played a two-armed bandit decision-making task in which they attempted to maximize reward. We show that neuronal firing rates (FR) of putative DA neurons during the reward expectation period explicitly encode reward expectations. First, activity in these neurons was modulated by previous trial outcomes, such that FR were greater after positive outcomes than after neutral or negative outcome trials. Second, this increase in FR was associated with shorter reaction times, consistent with an invigorating effect of DA neuron activity during expectation. These results suggest that human DA neurons explicitly encode reward expectations, providing a neurophysiological substrate for a signal critical for reward learning.

	<p>Background: Clinical case illustrations of patients with an impairment of personality functioning (IPF) have repeatedly reported that progress during psychotherapy is reflected by alterations in dream content. However, quantitative studies based on samples of psychotherapy patients are scarce. As a core component of both personality functioning and contemporary psychodynamic dream theory, the construct of affect regulation is of specific significance in this context. Aims: To test if improvement in personality functioning in the course of psychotherapy is associated with an increasing ability to regulate affects in dreams. Method: In a longitudinal design, affect regulation was compared in N = 94 unsolicited dream reports from the first vs. last third of long term psychotherapy of ten patients with initial IPF. Dream reports were transcribed from recordings of the sessions. Expert ratings of the level of personality functioning were obtained using the Scales of Psychological Capacities. The capacity for affect regulation was assessed using the Zurich Dream Process Coding System. Group differences were assessed using linear mixed models, controlling for dream length as well as the nested structure of this data set. Results: Patients demonstrated an increased capacity for affect regulation in dreams that was primarily evident in three core features: the complexity of dream elements (cf., e.g., parameter attributes, p = 0.024); the extent of affective involvement in the dream ego (cf., e.g., parameter subject feeling, p = 0.014); and the flexibility to regulate the dynamics of safety/involvement processes (p = &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). This pattern was especially prominent in a subgroup (n = 7) of patients with more pronounced improvements in personality functioning. Conclusion: These findings support the hypotheses that decreasing IPF during psychotherapy is associated with increases in the capacity for affect regulation in dreams. Thus, researchers and therapists can utilize dream reports to illuminate the important aspects of treatment progress in clinical practice.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The discovery of novel diagnostic methods and therapies for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) faces significant challenges. Previous research has shed light on the neuroprotective properties of Apelin-13 in neurodegenerative disorders. However, elucidating the mechanism underlying its efficacy in combating AD-related nerve injury is imperative. In this study, we aimed to investigate Apelin-13&amp;amp;rsquo;s mechanism of action in an in vivo model of AD induced by streptozocin (STZ). (2) Methods: We utilized an STZ-induced nerve injury model of AD in mice to investigate the effects of Apelin-13 administration. Apelin-13 was administered intranasally, and cognitive impairment was assessed using standardized behavioral tests, primarily, behavioral assessment, histological analysis, and biochemical assays, in order to evaluate synaptic plasticity and oxidative stress signaling pathways. (3) Results: Our findings indicate that intranasal administration of Apelin-13 ameliorated cognitive impairment in the STZ-induced AD model. Furthermore, we observed that this effect was potentially mediated by the enhancement of synaptic plasticity and the attenuation of oxidative stress signaling pathways. (4) Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that intranasal administration of Apelin-13 holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. By improving synaptic plasticity and mitigating oxidative stress, Apelin-13 may offer a novel approach to neuroprotection in AD and related conditions.</p>

	<p>Exploring the spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for interpreting dementia and related cognitive decline. Spatiotemporal patterns of EEG can be described through microstate analysis, which provides a discrete approximation of the continuous electric field patterns generated by the brain cortex. Here, we propose a novel microstate spatiotemporal dynamic indicator, termed the microstate sequence non-randomness index (MSNRI). The essence of the method lies in initially generating a sequence of microstate transition patterns through state space compression of EEG data using microstate analysis. Following this, we assess the non-randomness of these microstate patterns using information-based similarity analysis. The results suggest that this MSNRI metric is a potential marker for distinguishing between health control (HC) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (HC vs. FTD: 6.958 vs. 5.756, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), as well as between HC and populations with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) (HC vs. AD: 6.958 vs. 5.462, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Healthy individuals exhibit more complex macroscopic structures and non-random spatiotemporal patterns of microstates, whereas dementia disorders lead to more random spatiotemporal patterns. Additionally, we extend the proposed method by integrating the Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) method to explore spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of microstates at specific frequency scales. Moreover, we assessed the effectiveness of this innovative method in predicting cognitive scores. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of CEEMD-enhanced microstate dynamic indicators significantly improved the prediction accuracy of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (R2 = 0.940). The CEEMD-enhanced MSNRI method not only aids in the exploration of large-scale neural changes in populations with dementia but also offers a robust tool for characterizing the dynamics of EEG microstate transitions and their impact on cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic increased symptoms of stress and anxiety and induced changes in sleep quality, dream activity, and parasomnia episodes. It has been shown that stressful factors and/or bad sleep habits can affect parasomnia behaviors. However, investigations on how COVID-19 has affected sleep, dreams, and episode frequency in parasomnias are rare. The current study focuses on the impact of the pandemic on a specific parasomnia characterized by speech production (sleep talking, ST). Methods: We selected 27 participants with frequent ST episodes (STs) during the pandemic and compared them with 27 participants with frequent STs from a previous study conducted during a pre-pandemic period. All participants performed home monitoring through sleep logs and recorded their nocturnal STs for one week. Results: We observed a higher frequency of STs in the pandemic group. Moreover, STs were related to the emotional intensity of dreams, independent of the pandemic condition. The pandemic was associated with lower bizarreness of dreams in the pandemic group. There were no differences in sleep variables between the two groups. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest a stressful effect of COVID-19 on the frequency of STs. Both the pandemic and the frequency of STs affect qualitative characteristics of dreams in this population.</p>

                <p>Both the retina and brain exhibit neurovascular coupling, increased blood flow during increased neural activity. In the retina increased blood flow can be evoked by flickering light, but the magnitude of the metabolic change that underlies this is not known. Local changes in oxygen consumption (QO<SUB>2</SUB>) are difficult to measure in vivo when both supply and demand are changing. Here we isolated the C57BL/6J mouse retina and supplied it with oxygen from both sides of the tissue. Microelectrode recordings of PO<SUB>2</SUB> were made in darkness and during 20&nbsp;s of high scotopic flickering light at 1&nbsp;Hz. Flicker led to a PO<SUB>2</SUB> increase in the outer retina and a decrease in the inner retina, indicating that outer retinal QO<SUB>2</SUB> (QOR) decreased and inner retinal QO<SUB>2</SUB> (QIR) increased. A four-layer oxygen diffusion model was fitted to PO<SUB>2</SUB> values obtained in darkness and at the end of flicker to determine the values of QOR and QIR. QOR in flicker was 76 &plusmn; 14% (mean and SD, <I>n</I> = 10) of QOR in darkness. The increase in QIR was smaller, 6.4 &plusmn; 5.0%. These metabolic changes are likely smaller than the maximum changes, because with no regeneration of pigment in the isolated retina, we limited the illumination. Further modeling indicated that at high illumination, QIR could increase by up to 45%, which is comparable to the magnitude of flow changes. This suggests that the blood flow increase is at least roughly matched to the increased metabolic demands of activity in the retina.</p>

                Background The aim of this study was to observe and analyze vascular function in ‘prolonged sitting’, followed by a yoga asana routine and pranayama intervention. Participants in this study include those who work from desks in offices. The study required the participants to attend on three separate days at random, and they had to finish a computerized test on each day. On the first day, participants were required to complete a computer test while sitting still for four hours (with the exception of washroom breaks). The next day, they underwent a computerized test along with a pranayama intervention. Finally, on the last day, they underwent a computerized test along with a yoga asana intervention. At the start of the study and after two and four hours, we measured the diameter and velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Methods The study was a within-subjects prospective single-center trial conducted in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India, between September 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to do one of the following ‘activities’ over successive weeks: Week 1 – Prolonged sitting; Week 2 – Pranayama intervention; and Week 3 – Yoga asana intervention during prolonged sitting. The baseline and follow-up variables of pulse velocity, endothelial thickness, and shear rate were assessed for normality through a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Results Our sample included 11 participants with moderate physical activity, five with high physical activity and one with low physical activity. Yoga asana intervention comprised participants sitting continuously for four hours, with a yoga asana intervention being provided every hour, lasting for 10 minutes. Conclusions Yoga asana improves vascular functions in prolonged sitting conditions. This routine can promote the concept of interrupted sitting and ways to reduce it with efficient yoga asana practice without changing the work culture and provide better physical relief.

                Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), a serious clinical challenge caused by incomplete abortion in female, calls for efficient and minimally invasive therapies to treat symptoms and protect reproductive health. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has been discovered as a viable therapeutic strategy to treat DUB following an incomplete abortion. The existing information and clinical experience of UAE for this particular indication were thoroughly reviewed. A female’s quality of life may be negatively affected by incomplete abortion, which is defined as residual fetal tissue inside the uterine cavity. This frequently results in heavy and continuous uterine bleeding. Medical procedures and traditional management techniques such as dilatation and curettage (D&C) do not always produce the desired effects or might have inherent dangers. UAE, a less invasive technique first developed for treating uterine fibroids, has shown promise as a substitute solution for DUB caused by an incomplete abortion.

                <p>by Meng Wang, Xinyue Yan, Yanan Dong, Xiaoqin Li, Bin Gao</p>

The heterogeneity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) poses a barrier to effective treatment. Stratifying highly heterogeneous HCC into molecular subtypes with similar features is crucial for personalized anti-tumor therapies. Although driver genes play pivotal roles in cancer progression, their potential in HCC subtyping has been largely overlooked. This study aims to utilize driver genes to construct HCC subtype models and unravel their molecular mechanisms. Utilizing a novel computational framework, we expanded the initially identified 96 driver genes to 1192 based on mutational aspects and an additional 233 considering driver dysregulation. These genes were subsequently employed as stratification markers for further analyses. A novel multi-omics subtype classification algorithm was developed, leveraging mutation and expression data of the identified stratification genes. This algorithm successfully categorized HCC into two distinct subtypes, CLASS A and CLASS B, demonstrating significant differences in survival outcomes. Integrating multi-omics and single-cell data unveiled substantial distinctions between these subtypes regarding transcriptomics, mutations, copy number variations, and epigenomics. Moreover, our prognostic model exhibited excellent predictive performance in training and external validation cohorts. Finally, a 10-gene classification model for these subtypes identified <i>TTK</i> as a promising therapeutic target with robust classification capabilities. This comprehensive study provides a novel perspective on HCC stratification, offering crucial insights for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis and the development of promising treatment strategies.

                Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a prominent cause of illness and mortality worldwide, with a significant amount of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries performed each year. It is a complicated technique that results in several clinical and functional issues. While CABG is an effective treatment, it comes with clinical and functional challenges, including reduced lung volume, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure, and thoracic mobility after surgery. Incisional pain has been associated with a decline in postoperative lung function; however, this resolves a month following surgery. There is no documented association between respiratory muscle strength and lung function after heart surgery. The POWERbreathe Medic Plus is intended for patients who have extremely weak breathing muscles as a result of illness, hospitalization, or existing respiratory health disorders such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. To address these challenges, a study will investigate the efficacy of the POWERbreathe Medic Plus device in improving maximal inspiratory pressure, functional capacity, and quality of life in CABG patients.

                Research data and software are widely accepted as an outcome of scientific work. However, in comparison to text-based publications, there is not yet an established process to assess and evaluate quality of research data and research software publications. This paper presents an attempt to fill this gap. Initiated by the Working Group Open Science of the Helmholtz Association, the Task Group Helmholtz Quality Indicators for Data and Software Publications currently develops a quality indicator for research data and research software publications to be used within the Association. This report summarizes the vision of the group of what all contributes to such an indicator. The proposed approach relies on generic well-established concepts for quality criteria, such as the FAIR Principles and the COBIT Maturity Model. It does – on purpose – not limit itself to technical implementation possibilities to avoid using an existing metric for a new purpose. The intention of this paper is to share the current state for further discussion with all stakeholders, particularly with other groups also working on similar metrics but also with entities that use the metrics.

They provide experimental evidence that deficiency in JAK1 prevents tumor formation, and they identified C/EBPδ as a critical downstream effector of the pro-tumorigenic functions of JAK1/STAT signaling.

Despite no impact on in vitro cell phenotype and primary tumor growth, ZDHHC20 depletion curbs metastasis in mice. This effect is dependent on the immune system, particularly natural killer cells.

They further show that PAM-relaxed variants still require sequence recognition for efficient target search, highlighting the importance of considering target-searching kinetics in PAMless SpCas9 engineering.

">Developmental alterations of indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons in mouse models of Huntington's disease.</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the Huntingtin protein (Htt). While symptoms, primarily characterized by progressive deterioration of the striatum and motor and cognitive functions, typically manifest in adulthood, recent studies have also highlighted developmental defects in HD. Indeed, alterations in cortical and striatal development have been observed in individuals carrying the mutation as early as in embryonic stages. However, despite the striatum being one of the most affected regions in HD, few studies have investigated potential developmental alterations in this structure, especially in the early weeks after birth. To address this question, we compared striatal development between wild-type (WT) mice and two murine models of HD, R6/1 and CAG140 mice crossed with reporter mice to identify D1- and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1- and D2-MSNs). Using ex vivo electrophysiology and neuronal reconstruction, we observed that the maturation of electrical properties was selectively disrupted in D2-MSNs of the matrix compartment of HD mice during the first post-natal days. D2-MSNs arbor also an increased dendritic complexity. When studying the establishment of striatal afferents, we observed that cortico-striatal glutamatergic transmission was specifically reduced in D2-MSNs during the second postnatal week. All these alterations were transient before the circuit normalized on its own after the second postnatal week. These anatomical and electrophysiological data highlight the significant impact of the Htt mutation on numerous striatal development processes during the postnatal period. Interestingly, we observed that these alterations specifically affect MSNs in the indirect pathway. This preferential vulnerability aligns with the early death of these neurons in adulthood, suggesting that early treatment of these alterations could potentially modify the disease's progression.

">Sex-dependent effects of early life stress on network and behavioral states.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with numerous detriments in health, including increased vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses. Early life stress (ELS) in rodents has been shown to effectively model several of the behavioral and endocrine impacts of ACEs and has been utilized to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to disease. However, the precise neural mechanisms responsible for mediating the impact of ELS on vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses remain largely unknown. Methods: We use behavior, immunoassay, in vivo LFP recording, histology, and patch clamp to describe the effects of ELS on stress behaviors, endocrinology, network states, protein expression, and cellular physiology in male and female mice. Results: We demonstrate that a murine maternal separation (MS) ELS model causes sex-dependent alterations in behavioral and hormonal responses following an acute stressor. Local field potential (LFP) recordings in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and frontal cortex (FC) reveal similar sex-dependent alterations at baseline, in response to acute ethological stress, and during fear memory extinction, supporting a large body of literature demonstrating that these network states contribute to stress reactivity and vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses. Sex differences were accompanied by altered physiology of BLA principal neurons in males and BLA PV interneurons in females. Conclusions: Collectively, these results implicate novel, sex-dependent mechanisms through which ACEs may impact psychiatric health, involving altered cellular physiology and network states involved in emotional processing.

">"What" and "when" predictions jointly modulate speech processing</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior rests on forming predictions based on previous statistical regularities encountered in the environment. Such regularities pertain not only to the contents of the stimuli ("what") but also their timing ("when"), and both interactively modulate sensory processing. In speech streams, predictions can be formed at multiple hierarchical levels, both in terms of contents (e.g. single syllables vs. words) and timing (e.g., faster vs. slower time scales). Whether and how these hierarchies map onto each other in terms of integrating "what" and "when" predictions remains unknown. Under one hypothesis neural hierarchies may link "what" and "when" predictions within sensory processing areas: with lower cortical regions mediating interactions for smaller units e.g., syllables, and higher cortical areas mediating interactions for larger units e.g., words. Alternatively, interactions between "what" and "when" predictions might rest on a generic, sensory-independent mechanism, mediated by common attention-related (e.g., frontoparietal) networks. To address those questions, we manipulated "what" and "when" predictions at two levels - single syllables and disyllabic pseudowords - while recording neural activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy volunteers (N=22). We studied how syllable and/or word deviants are modulated by "when" predictability, both analyzing event-related fields and using source reconstruction and dynamic causal modeling to explain the observed effects in terms of the underlying effective connectivity. "When" predictions modulated "what" mismatch responses in a specific way with regards to speech hierarchy, such that mismatch responses to deviant words (vs. syllables) were amplified by temporal predictions at a slower (vs. faster) time scale. However, these modulations were source-localized to a shared network of cortical regions, including frontal and parietal sources. Effective connectivity analysis showed that, while mismatch responses to violations of "what" predictions modulated connectivity between regions, the integration of "what" and "when" predictions selectively modulated connectivity within regions, consistent with gain effects. These results suggest that the brain integrates "what" and "when" predictions that are congruent with respect to their hierarchical level, but this integration is mediated by a shared and distributed cortical network. This contrasts with recent studies indicating separable networks for different levels of hierarchical speech processing.

">Near infrared fluorescent nanosensors for high spatiotemporal oxytocin imaging</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin is a neuropeptide thought to play a central role in regulating social and emotional behavior. Current techniques for neuropeptide imaging are generally limited in spatial and temporal resolution, real-time imaging capacity, selectivity for oxytocin over vasopressin, and application in young and non-model organisms. To avoid the use of endogenous oxytocin receptors for oxytocin probe development, we employed a protocol to evolve purely synthetic molecular recognition on the surface of near-infrared fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This probe reversibly undergoes up to a 172% fluorescence increase in response to oxytocin with a Kd of 4.93 uM. Furthermore, this probe responds selectively to oxytocin over oxytocin analogs, receptor agonists and antagonists, and most other neurochemicals. Lastly, we show our probe can image synaptic evoked oxytocin release in live mouse brain slices. Optical probes with the specificity and resolution requisite to image endogenous oxytocin signaling can advance the study of oxytocin neurotransmission for its role in both health and disease.

">Depression in Parkinson's disease is associated with dopamine unresponsive reduced reward sensitivity during effort-based decision making</a></h4>

              
                Willingness to exert effort for a given goal is dependent on the magnitude of the potential rewards and effort costs of an action. Such effort-based decision making is an essential component of motivation, in which the dopaminergic system plays a key role. Depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common, disabling and has poor outcomes. Motivational symptoms such as apathy and anhedonia, are prominent in PD depression and related to dopaminergic loss. We hypothesised that dopamine-dependent disruption in effort-based decision-making contributes to depression in PD. In the present study, an effort-based decision-making task was administered to 62 patients with PD, with and without depression, ON and OFF their dopaminergic medication across two sessions, as well as to 34 patients with depression and 29 matched controls on a single occasion. During the task, on each trial, participants decided whether to accept or reject offers of different levels of monetary reward in return for exerting varying levels of physical effort via grip force, measured using individually calibrated dynamometers. The primary outcome variable was choice (accept/decline offer), analysed using both logistic mixed-effects modelling and a computational model which dissected the individual contributions of reward and effort on depression and dopamine state in PD. We found PD depression was characterised by lower acceptance of offers, driven by markedly lower incentivisation by reward (reward sensitivity), compared to all other groups. Within-subjects analysis of the effect of dopamine medication revealed that, although dopamine treatment improves reward sensitivity in non-depressed PD patients, this therapeutic effect is not present in PD patients with depression. These findings suggest that disrupted effort-based decision-making, unresponsive to dopamine, contributes to PD depression. This highlights reward sensitivity as a key mechanism and treatment target for PD depression that potentially requires non-dopaminergic therapies.

">AVN: A Deep Learning Approach for the Analysis of Birdsong</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning tools for behavior analysis have enabled important new insights and discoveries in neuroscience. Yet, they often compromise interpretability and generalizability for performance, making it difficult to quantitively compare phenotypes across datasets and research groups. We developed a novel deep learning-based behavior analysis pipeline, Avian Vocalization Network (AVN), for the learned vocalizations of the most extensively studied vocal learning model species - the zebra finch. AVN annotates songs with high accuracy across multiple animal colonies without the need for any additional training data and generates a comprehensive set of interpretable features to describe the syntax, timing, and acoustic properties of song. We use this feature set to compare song phenotypes across multiple research groups and experiments, and to predict a bird's stage in song development. Additionally, we have developed a novel method to measure song imitation that requires no additional training data for new comparisons or recording environments, and outperforms existing similarity scoring methods in its sensitivity and agreement with expert human judgements of song similarity. These tools are available through the open-source AVN python package and graphical application, which makes them accessible to researchers without any prior coding experience. Altogether, this behavior analysis toolkit stands to facilitate and accelerate the study of vocal behavior by enabling a standardized mapping of phenotypes and learning outcomes, thus helping scientists better link behavior to the underlying neural processes.

">Optimal AAV capsid/promoter combinations to target specific cell types in the common marmoset cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                To achieve cell type-specific gene expression, using target cell-tropic AAV capsids is advantageous. However, their tropism across brain cell types remains unexplored in non-human primates. We assessed the tropism of nine AAV serotype capsids (AAV1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, rh.10 (rh10), and DJ) on marmoset cerebral cortical cell types. Marmoset cerebral cortex was injected with different serotype AAVs expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP) by the ubiquitous chicken beta-actin hybrid (CBh) promoter. After 4 weeks, all nine AAV capsid vectors, especially AAV9 and AAVrh10, caused highly neuron-selective EGFP expression. Some AAV capsids, including AAV5, caused EGFP expression in oligodendrocytes to a lesser extent, with minimal or no expression in astrocytes and microglia. Different ubiquitous CMV and CAG promoters showed similar neuron-predominant transduction. Conversely, all nine AAV capsid vectors with the astrocyte-specific hGFA(ABC1D) promoter selectively transduced astrocytes, except AAV5, which transduced oligodendrocytes modestly. Oligodendrocyte-specific mouse myeline basic protein (mMBP) promoter in AAV5 vectors transduced oligodendrocytes specifically and efficiently. Our results suggest optimal combinations of capsids and promoters for cell type-specific expression: AAV9 or AAVrh10 and ubiquitous CBh, CMV, or CAG promoter for neuron-specific transduction; AAV2 or 7 and hGFA(ABC1D) promoter for astrocyte-specific transduction; and AAV5 and mMBP promoter for oligodendrocyte-specific transduction.

">Two-photon voltage imaging with rhodopsin-based sensors</a></h4>

              
                The recent advances in sophisticated optical techniques, coupled with two-photon sensitive genetic voltage indicators (GEVIs), have enabled in-depth voltage imaging in vivo at single spike and single-cell resolution. To date, these results have been only achieved using ASAP-type sensors, as the complex photocycle of rhodopsin-based voltage indicators posed challenges for their two-photon use, restricting their application to one-photon approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that rhodopsin-based GEVIs (FRET-opsin) can be used under two-photon illumination when their peculiar light intensity dependence of kinetics and sensitivity are considered. We rationally engineer a fully genetically-encoded, rhodopsin-based voltage indicator with the brightest known fluorophore AaFP1, Jarvis, and demonstrate its utility under both one- and two-photon illumination. We also showed two-photon usability of the similar FRET-opsin sensor pAce. Our comparison of 2P scanless with fast 2P scanning illumination revealed that the latter approach is less suitable for this class of indicators and, on the contrary, both sensors responded well when scanless approaches were used. Furthermore, utilising Jarvis, we demonstrated high-fidelity, high-SNR action potential detection at kilohertz-imaging rates both in mouse hippocampal slices and in zebrafish larvae. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report of a fully genetically-encoded rhodopsin-based voltage indicator for high contrast action potential detection under two-photon illumination in vitro and in vivo.

">Molecular Myelin Dysfunction in the Most Common Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies - CMT1A and HNPP</a></h4>

              
                Increased and decreased dosage of the Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene cause dysmyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (CMT1A, PMP22 duplication) and Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP, PMP22 deletion) are the most common inherited peripheral neuropathies, yet gaps remain about their pathophysiology and pathomechanims. Our previous results with CMT1A model mice demonstrate that muscle atrophy occurs without evidence of secondary axon degeneration suggesting that primary myelin dysfunction may contribute to functional deficits in CMT1A and motivating investigation of myelin dysfunction. Here we used CMT1A and HNPP model mice and confocal immunofluorescence imaging of teased tibial nerve fibers to determine how altered PMP22 expression disrupts myelin integrity and reveal CMT1A and HNPP pathomechanisms. We identified dramatic changes to molecular machinery at Schmidt-Lanterman incisures (SLIs) and Nodes of Ranvier that led us to propose two potential pathomechanisms for CMT1A and HNPP: impaired metabolic support and axonal ion disequilibrium. We also developed a working model for these pathomechanims that is driven by PMP22-mediated regulation of adherens junctions. Ongoing studies are aimed at testing these proposed pathomechanisms and determining how altered PMP22 and adherens junctions cause these defects. This work will provide insight into CMT1A and HNPP pathogenesis and may reveal novel approaches for developing therapeutics.

	<p>Background: Parents report associations between children&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep disturbances and behaviors. Children with neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., Williams Syndrome and autism) are consistently reported to experience increased sleeping problems. Sleep in children with vision impairment and children with a dual diagnosis of vision impairment and autism remains understudied. Methods: Our exploratory study compared sleep profiles in 52 children (aged 4&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) and their parents (n = 37), across four groups: children with vision impairment (VI; n = 9), autism (n = 10), comorbid vision impairment + autism (n = 6), and typically developing children (n = 27). Childhood sleep was measured using the parental report Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire and sleep diaries. Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive functioning was measured using digit span, semantic, and phonemic verbal fluency measures. Parental sleep was measured via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Results: Clinically disordered sleep was reported in all child groups (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), particularly children with VI + autism. Age, not sleep quality/quantity, predicted cognitive task performance in TD and autistic groups, but not in VI and VI + autism groups. The child&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagnosis affected parental sleep, particularly in children with a dual diagnosis of VI + autism. Conclusions: All participants experienced problematic sleep to varying degrees. Those most affected were children and parents in the VI + autism group, suggesting that autism may be the main driver of sleep problems in our sample.</p>

	<p>Recently, we and others have shown that manipulating the activity of cholinergic interneurons (CIN) present in the NAc can modulate binge alcohol consumption. The present study is designed to examine the relationship between binge alcohol consumption and the activity of the CIN in real time by using an in vivo microendoscopic technique. We hypothesized that mice exposed to Drinking in the Dark (DID)&amp;amp;mdash;a recognized mouse model for binge drinking&amp;amp;mdash;would exhibit increased activity in the accumbal shell region (NAcSh). To test this hypothesis, male mice expressing Cre-recombinase in the cholinergic neurons were exposed to binge alcohol consumption (alcohol group), employing the DID method, and utilized in vivo calcium imaging to observe CIN activity in real time during alcohol consumption. The control (sucrose) group was exposed to 10% (w/v) sucrose. As compared to sucrose, mice in the alcohol group displayed a significant increase in the frequency and amplitude of discharge activity, which was measured using calcium transients in the CIN present in the NAcSh. In summary, our findings suggest that the activity of CIN in the NAcSh plays a crucial role in alcohol self-administration. These results emphasize the potential significance of targeting CIN activity as a therapeutic approach for addressing AUD.</p>

	<p>Background: Despite the availability of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treating obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD), alternative approaches need to be explored due to the high likelihood of treatment resistance. Neuronavigated 20 Hz theta burst stimulation (TBS-20 Hz), targeting the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) augmented with the right orbitofrontal cortex (ROFC), was tested for treating OCD comorbid with depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on fourteen patients treated for moderate-to-severe OCD in a private outpatient clinic. Twelve patients had comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), and thirteen patients had either generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder (PD). Patients completed the Y-BOCS-SR, BDI-II, and BAI rating scales weekly, which were used to measure the changes in OCD, depression, and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Results: Neuronavigated TBS-20 Hz was sequentially applied to the right DLPFC (RDLPFC), left DLPFC (LDLPFC), and ROFC. A total of 64% (9/14) of patients achieved remission from OCD (Y-BOCS-SR &amp;amp;le; 14) in an average of 6.1 weeks of treatment (SD = 4.0). A total of 58% (7/12) of patients remitted from MDD (BDI &amp;amp;lt; 13) in an average of 4.1 weeks (SD = 2.8), and 62% (8/13) of patients remitted from GAD/PD (BAI &amp;amp;lt; 8) in an average of 4.3 weeks (SD = 2.5). Conclusions: The neuronavigated TBS-20 Hz sequential stimulation of RDLPFC and LDLPFC, followed by ROFC, significantly reduced OCD, MDD, and GAD/PD symptoms. Randomized sham controls are warranted to validate these results.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between Cathepsin B and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD), with a particular focus on determining the role of N-acetylaspartate as a potential mediator. Methods: We used summary-level data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, exploring the association between Cathepsin B (3301 cases) and PD (4681 cases). A sequential two-step MR approach was applied (8148 cases) to study the role of N-acetylaspartate. Results: The MR analysis yielded that genetically predicted elevated Cathepsin B levels correlated with a reduced risk of developing PD (p = 0.0133, OR: 0.9171, 95% CI: 0.8563&amp;amp;ndash;0.9821). On the other hand, the analysis provided insufficient evidence to determine that PD affected Cathepsin B levels (p = 0.8567, OR: 1.0035, 95% CI: 0.9666&amp;amp;ndash;1.0418). The estimated effect of N-acetylaspartate in this process was 7.52% (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;3.65% to 18.69%). Conclusions: This study suggested that elevated Cathepsin B levels decreased the risk of developing PD, with the mediation effect of N-acetylaspartate. Further research is needed to better understand this relationship.</p>

	<p>Hyperserotonemia is one of the most studied endophenotypes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there are still no unequivocal results about its causes or biological and behavioral outcomes. This systematic review summarizes the studies investigating the relationship between blood serotonin (5-HT) levels and ASD, comparing diagnostic tools, analytical methods, and clinical outcomes. A literature search on peripheral 5-HT levels and ASD was conducted. In total, 1104 publications were screened, of which 113 entered the present systematic review. Of these, 59 articles reported hyperserotonemia in subjects with ASD, and 26 presented correlations between 5-HT levels and ASD-core clinical outcomes. The 5-HT levels are increased in about half, and correlations between hyperserotonemia and clinical outcomes are detected in a quarter of the studies. The present research highlights a large amount of heterogeneity in this field, ranging from the characterization of ASD and control groups to diagnostic and clinical assessments, from blood sampling procedures to analytical methods, allowing us to delineate critical topics for future studies.</p>

                <p>The primary motor cortex (M1) integrates sensory and cognitive inputs to generate voluntary movement. Its functional impairments have been implicated in the pathophysiology of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, dopaminergic degeneration and basal ganglia dysfunction entrain M1 neurons into the abnormally synchronized bursting pattern of activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. However, how degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons affects the anatomy, microcircuit connectivity, and function of the M1 network remains poorly understood. The present study examined whether and how the loss of dopamine (DA) affects the morphology, cellular excitability, and synaptic physiology of Layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing (PV<sup>+</sup>) cells in the M1 of mice of both sexes. Here, we reported that loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons does not alter the number, morphology, and physiology of Layer 5 PV<sup>+</sup> cells in M1. Moreover, we demonstrated that the number of perisomatic PV<sup>+</sup> puncta of M1 pyramidal neurons as well as their functional innervation of cortical pyramidal neurons were not altered following the loss of DA. Together, the present study documents an intact GABAergic inhibitory network formed by PV<sup>+</sup> cells following the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.</p>

                <p>More and more patients worldwide are diagnosed with dementia, which emphasizes the urgent need for early detection markers. In this study, we built on the auditory hypersensitivity theory of a previous study&mdash;which postulated that responses to auditory input in the subcortex as well as cortex are enhanced in cognitive decline&mdash;and examined auditory encoding of natural continuous speech at both neural levels for its indicative potential for cognitive decline. We recruited study participants aged 60 years and older, who were divided into two groups based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, one group with low scores (<I>n</I> = 19, participants with signs of cognitive decline) and a control group (<I>n</I> = 25). Participants completed an audiometric assessment and then we recorded their electroencephalography while they listened to an audiobook and click sounds. We derived temporal response functions and evoked potentials from the data and examined response amplitudes for their potential to predict cognitive decline, controlling for hearing ability and age. Contrary to our expectations, no evidence of auditory hypersensitivity was observed in participants with signs of cognitive decline; response amplitudes were comparable in both cognitive groups. Moreover, the combination of response amplitudes showed no predictive value for cognitive decline. These results challenge the proposed hypothesis and emphasize the need for further research to identify reliable auditory markers for the early detection of cognitive decline.</p>

                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                The routine genomic surveillance of pathogens in diverse geographical settings and equitable data sharing are critical to inform effective infection control and therapeutic development. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of routine genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to detect emerging variants of concern. However, the majority of high-income countries sequenced >0.5% of their COVID-19 cases, unlike low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, many countries around the world had managed to establish capacity for pathogen genomic surveillance. Notably, Beta and Omicron; 2 of the 5 current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were first discovered in Africa through an aggressive sequencing campaign led by African scientists. To sustain such infrastructure and expertise beyond this pandemic, other endemic pathogens should leverage this investment. Therefore, countries are establishing multi-pathogen genomic surveillance strategies. Here we provide a catalog of the current landscape of sequenced and publicly shared pathogens in different countries in Africa. Drawing upon our collective knowledge and expertise, we review the ever-evolving challenges and propose innovative recommendations.

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                <p>by Hazal Koptagel, Seong-Hwan Jun, Joanna Hård, Jens Lagergren</p>

Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method’s robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells.

                <p>by Raphael Sonabend, Hugo Gruson, Leo Wolansky, Agnes Kiragga, Daniel S. Katz</p>

This paper extends the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines to provide criteria for assessing if software conforms to best practices in open source. By adding “USE” (User-Centered, Sustainable, Equitable), software development can adhere to open source best practice by incorporating user-input early on, ensuring front-end designs are accessible to all possible stakeholders, and planning long-term sustainability alongside software design. The FAIR-USE4OS guidelines will allow funders and researchers to more effectively evaluate and plan open-source software projects. There is good evidence of funders increasingly mandating that all funded research software is open source; however, even under the FAIR guidelines, this could simply mean software released on public repositories with a Zenodo DOI. By creating FAIR-USE software, best practice can be demonstrated from the very beginning of the design process and the software has the greatest chance of success by being impactful.

                Background In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organization recommended the use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) to curb transmission, leading to increased production and use. This has posed a danger of production and use of poor-quality ABHRs. Methods This study assessed and compared the quality of ABHRs in the Kenyan market that were produced before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Quality testing was carried out against European EN 1500:2013 and Kenyan EAS 789:2013 Standards and 20 samples analyzed for alcohol content by GC-FID. Results The study found that 27.8% of the peri-COVID-19 pandemic sanitizers had less than 90% bactericidal reduction activity as compared to 12.5% manufactured pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Only 25% peri-COVID-19 pandemic ABHRs met the EAS 789:2013 acceptable limit of over 60% alcohol content. Product adulteration with methanol was found in 20 % of the samples with only 5% complying with FDA approval limit of <0.063% v/v methanol. Study found no correlation between the total alcohol content and the efficacy of ABHRs. Conclusions The study found that more substandard products were produced during the pandemic. This raises a concern about possible emergence of alcohol resistant strains of microorganisms. The study therefore recommends an adequate quality monitoring system to curb against substandard products.

                Background Parthenium is an invasive annual weed that affects crop production, rangelands, grasslands, animals, the environment, and human health. Since its introduction into Ethiopia, different management options such as uprooting, slashing, burning, plowing, and applying synthetic herbicides have been practiced. However, these options are not sustainable in weed management. However, Zygogramma bicolorata is known to be used in different countries. Although many countries use it under field conditions, its population-based efficacy has not been well studied in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Z. bicolorata populations on parthenium plants under greenhouse conditions. Methods This experiment was conducted at the Ambo Agricultural Research Center. Different numbers of Z. bicolorata per plant were used as treatments and were laid out in a completely randomized design with three replications. The numbers of damaged leaves, eggs, and larvae were recorded daily until the leaves were completely defoliated. The collected data and the correlation between beetle population and leaf defoliation were analyzed using SAS. Results The result revealed that all beetle populations caused damage to weed plants. A higher population of beetles completely defoliated the leaves within 12 days. However, lower numbers required 21 days to completely defoliate the weed. In contrast, a higher number of eggs (328.67) and larvae (272.33) were obtained from plants that received 20 pairs of beetles. The beetle population and exposure time were positively correlated, and the effectiveness of the bioagent was greater following the emergence of larvae. Conclusions Z. bicolorata can manage parthenium weeds, even with a lower population. However, more than 15 pairs of beetles could be suggested to manage weeds in a shorter time, and further study is needed under field conditions by considering the different agroecologies of the country.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1448/v2?src=rss">COVID-19 in the Arab countries: Three-year review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Twenty-two Arab countries share a common language, history, and culture. Nevertheless, governmental policies, healthcare systems, and resources differ from one Arab country to another. We have been following Coronavirus (COVID-19) from the beginning in each Arab country. In the present study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world and to compare these findings with other significantly affected countries. Methods Websites of the World Health Organization, World COVID-vaccinations tracker, Worldometer, and Ministries of Health were used to extract COVID-19 data in all Arab countries between the period January 2020 to December 2022. Results All Arab countries had 14,218,042 total confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13,384,924 total recovered cases and 173,544 total related deaths. The trend demonstrated that the third quarter of 2021 recorded the highest death toll and the first quarter of 2022 recorded the highest number of confirmed and recovered cases. Compared to the top 15 affected countries, the Arab world ranked last as it had the lowest overall incidence per million population (PMP) of 31,609. The data on total deaths PMP showed that India had the lowest number of deaths with only 377 cases followed by the Arab world with 386 cases. Conclusions Although the number of confirmed, death, and subsequently recovered cases of COVID-19 have greatly reduced in the last quarter of 2022 in most Arab countries, many Arab countries still need to re-campaign about COVID-19 vaccines and raise awareness programs about boosters. COVID-19 has had a relatively smaller impact on Arab countries than on other countries that have been significantly affected.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity are considered closely related motor signs in Parkinson disease (PD), but recent neurophysiological findings suggest distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. This study aims to examine and compare longitudinal changes in bradykinesia and rigidity in PD patients treated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical progression of appendicular and axial bradykinesia and rigidity was assessed up to 15 years after STN-DBS in the best treatment conditions (ON medication and ON stimulation). The severity of bradykinesia and rigidity was examined using ad hoc composite scores from specific subitems of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III). Short- and long-term predictors of bradykinesia and rigidity were analyzed through linear regression analysis, considering various preoperative demographic and clinical data, including disease duration and severity, phenotype, motor and cognitive scores (eg, frontal score), and medication.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 301 patients were examined before and 1 year after surgery. Among them, 101 and 56 individuals were also evaluated at 10-year and 15-year follow-ups, respectively. Bradykinesia significantly worsened after surgery, especially in appendicular segments (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, rigidity showed sustained benefit, with unchanged clinical scores compared to preoperative assessment (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Preoperative motor disability (eg, composite scores from the UPDRS-III) predicted short- and long-term outcomes for both bradykinesia and rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Executive dysfunction was specifically linked to bradykinesia but not to rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity show long-term divergent progression in PD following STN-DBS and are associated with independent clinical factors, supporting the hypothesis of partially distinct pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to characterize quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) features in participants from the Natural history study of RTT and Related Disorders and to assess the potential for these features to act as objective measures of cortical function for Rett syndrome (RTT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>EEG amplitude and power features were derived from the resting EEG of 60 females with RTT (median age = 10.7 years) and 26 neurotypical females (median age = 10.6 years). Analyses focus on group differences and within the RTT group, associations between the EEG parameters and clinical severity. For a subset of participants (n = 20), follow-up data were available for assessing the reproducibility of the results and the stability in the parameters over 1 year.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to neurotypical participants, participants with RTT had greater amplitude variability and greater low-frequency activity as reflected by greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower theta/delta, alpha/delta, beta/delta, alpha/theta, and beta/theta ratios. Greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower power ratios were associated with greater severity. Analyses of year 1 data replicated the associations between 1/f slope and power ratios and clinical severity and demonstrated good within-subject consistency in these measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, group comparisons reflected a greater predominance of lower versus higher frequency activity in participants with RTT, which is consistent with prior clinical interpretations of resting EEG in this population. The observed associations between the EEG power measures and clinical assessments and the repeatability of these measures underscore the potential for EEG to provide an objective measure of cortical function and clinical severity for RTT.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Classic research has shown a division in the neuroanatomical structures that support flexible (e.g., short-cutting) and habitual (e.g., familiar route following) navigational behavior, with hippocampal–caudate systems associated with the former and putamen systems with the latter. There is, however, disagreement about whether the neural structures involved in navigation process particular forms of spatial information, such as associations between constellations of cues forming a cognitive map, versus single landmark-action associations, or alternatively, perform particular reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the use of different spatial strategies, so-called model-based (flexible) or model-free (habitual) forms of learning. We sought to test these theories by asking participants (<i>N</i> = 24) to navigate within a virtual environment through a previously learned, 9-junction route with distinctive landmarks at each junction while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a series of probe trials, we distinguished knowledge of individual landmark-action associations along the route versus knowledge of the correct <i>sequence</i> of landmark-action associations, either by having absent landmarks, or “out-of-sequence” landmarks. Under a map-based perspective, sequence knowledge would not require hippocampal systems, because there are no constellations of cues available for cognitive map formation. Within a learning-based model, however, responding based on knowledge of sequence <i>would</i> require hippocampal systems because prior context has to be utilized. We found that hippocampal–caudate systems were more active in probes requiring sequence knowledge, supporting the learning-based model. However, we also found greater putamen activation in probes where navigation based purely on sequence memory could be planned, supporting models of putamen function that emphasize its role in action sequencing.</p>

                Aging may lead to low-level chronic inflammation that increases the susceptibility to age-related conditions, including memory impairment and progressive loss of brain volume. As brain health is essential to promoting healthspan and lifespan, it is vital to understand age-related changes in the immune system and central nervous system (CNS) that drive normal brain aging. However, the relative importance, mechanistic interrelationships, and hierarchical order of such changes and their impact on normal brain aging remain to be clarified. Here, we synthesize accumulating evidence that age-related DNA damage and cellular senescence in the immune system and CNS contribute to the escalation of neuroinflammation and cognitive decline during normal brain aging. Targeting cellular senescence and immune modulation may provide a logical rationale for developing new treatment options to restore immune homeostasis and counteract age-related brain dysfunction and diseases.

                Neurons capable of mixed selectivity enhance the brain’s computational capabilities by responding to various inputs in complex ways, beyond simple combinations. Here, we describe possible neural mechanisms underlying mixed selectivity and discuss how they contribute to the brain’s dynamic flexibility in processing diverse information with efficiency.

	<p>In patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a lower level of cognitive function is associated with a higher likelihood of progression to dementia. In addition, gait disturbances and structural changes on brain MRI scans reflect cognitive levels. Therefore, we aimed to classify MCI based on cognitive level using gait parameters and brain MRI data. Eighty patients diagnosed with MCI from three dementia centres in Gangwon-do, Korea, were recruited for this study. We defined MCI as a Clinical Dementia Rating global score of &amp;amp;ge;0.5, with a memory domain score of &amp;amp;ge;0.5. Patients were classified as early-stage or late-stage MCI based on their mini-mental status examination (MMSE) z-scores. We trained a machine learning model using gait and MRI data parameters. The convolutional neural network (CNN) resulted in the best classifier performance in separating late-stage MCI from early-stage MCI; its performance was maximised when feature patterns that included multimodal features (GAIT + white matter dataset) were used. The single support time was the strongest predictor. Machine learning that incorporated gait and white matter parameters achieved the highest accuracy in distinguishing between late-stage MCI and early-stage MCI.</p>

	<p>The Michelangelo effect is a phenomenon that shows a reduction in perceived effort and an improvement in performance among both healthy subjects and patients when completing a motor task related to artistic stimuli, compared to performing the same task with non-artistic stimuli. It could contribute to the efficacy of art therapy in neurorehabilitation. In this study, the possible occurrence of this effect was tested in a cognitive task by asking 15 healthy subjects and 17 patients with a history of stroke to solve a digital version of the classical memory card game. Three different types of images were used in a randomized order: French cards, artistic portraits, and photos of famous people (to compensate for the possible effects of face recognition). Healthy subjects were involved to test the usability and the load demand of the developed system, reporting no statistically significant differences among the three sessions (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conversely, patients had a better performance in terms of time (p = 0.014) and the number of attempts (p = 0.007) needed to complete the task in the presence of artistic stimuli, accompanied by a reduction in the perceived effort (p = 0.033). Furthermore, artistic stimuli, with respect to the other two types of images, seemed more associated with visuospatial control than linguistic functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-972/v2?src=rss">Online food delivery services: cross-sectional study of consumers’ attitude in Malaysia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysian consumers were more likely to purchase food online and have it delivered to their doorstep. To stay afloat, many restaurants were pushed to provide online food delivery services (OFDS), and this sector has grown tremendously. However, will the trend persist after the pandemic? This study aims to look into how consumers’ perceptions of OFDS affect their attitude towards them. It investigates the relationship between convenience motivation, perceived ease of use, time-saving orientation and price-saving orientation in terms of future intent to use OFDS. Method Primary data was collected from 307 respondents in Malaysia using convenience sampling method through an online survey. Respondents’ demographic background was presented statistically in cross tabulation tables to study the ratio comparison implicitly. Consistent Partial Least Square approach and bootstrapping techniques with 5,000 subsamples was employed, with the aid of SmartPLS.V3 software, to identify the significant factors influencing consumers’ continuance intention after the pandemic. Result Perceived ease of use does not contribute significantly to continuance intention as most consumers have prior online purchase experience. Nevertheless, time-saving orientation has a positive correlation with perceived ease of use due to the simplicity of placing an order with just a click. It is also found that price-saving orientation is related to convenience motivation, particularly when prices can be compared on the websites or online ordering platforms. Consumers’ intention to continue using OFDS even after the COVID-19 pandemic is positively influenced by all the parameters studied, except for perceived ease of use. Conclusion Limited work has been done on the continuance intention to use OFDS beyond the pandemic. This study provides insight for food retailers on how to enhance their business and retain their customers with the support of technology, even after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Introduction HIV affects over 38 million people worldwide, affecting the immune system and leading to symptoms like fever, lymphadenopathy, and sore throat. High viral loads can lead to opportunistic infections and tumors. The life expectancy of HIV patients has increased due to high-efficiency combination anti-retroviral therapy. Urothelial carcinoma, a malignant development, damages the urinary canal lining. The connection between HIV and urinary cancers is unclear, the aims of this study to report a case of urethral urothelial Carcinoma in HIV patient who underwent total urethrectomy and perineal urethrostomy. Case presentation A 34-year-old male patient with a papilliferous lump on the glans penis for over six months was admitted to the hospital. Preoperative screening revealed HIV and a urethral mass was found. A partial urethrectomy was performed, revealing high grade papillary urothelial Carcinoma. Five months after surgery, the patient developed a recurrent lump, requiring a total urethrectomy, TUR (transurethral resection) of the mass in the prostatic urethra, and perineal urethrostomy. Conclusion Primary carcinoma of the urethra in HIV patient is an extremely rare case. To date, there is no consensus on the primary urethral carcinoma therapy. The treatment of primary urethral carcinoma is tailored specifically to the patient based on the location, histology, and stage of the carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-460/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Branch retinal vein occlusion following COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection while taking oral contraceptives [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Oral contraceptive use, vaccination for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) generally develops mid-60s patients. Herein, we present a case of BRVO caused by the above mentioned risk factors in a young woman. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about BRVO associated with oral contraceptives, COVID-19 vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2. A 21-year-old woman presented with loss of visual acuity in her right eye for 10 days. She had been receiving oral contraceptives for 2 years for oligomenorrhea before noticing ophthalmological symptoms. Despite having received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, she contracted COVID-19 and developed fever, sore throat, cough, low back pain, and general malaise about 40 days before the initial visit. However, only cough persisted for more than a month. The right eye showed BRVO with macular edema (ME). She did not smoke nor had diabetes or hypertension. Blood test results, including cardiolipin antibody IgG, were normal. She was treated with an intravitreal aflibercept injection. ME in the fundus showed rapid improvement and resolution. Although more than 20 months have passed since the first injection, there has been no relapse of ME. The combination of oral contraceptive use, COVID-19 vaccination, and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce the development of venous thromboembolism, thereby leading to BRVO. Given that cases of COVID-19 have increased globally, patients with retinal vein occlusion who use oral contraceptives are likely to be encountered more frequently.

                <p>A classic example of experience-dependent plasticity is ocular dominance (OD) shift, in which the responsiveness of neurons in the visual cortex is profoundly altered following monocular deprivation (MD). It has been postulated that OD shifts also modify global neural networks, but such effects have never been demonstrated. Here, we use wide-field fluorescence optical imaging (WFOI) to characterize calcium-based resting-state functional connectivity during acute (3&nbsp;d) MD in female and male mice with genetically encoded calcium indicators (<I>Thy1</I>-GCaMP6f). We first establish the fundamental performance of WFOI by computing signal to noise properties throughout our data processing pipeline. Following MD, we found that  band (0.4&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) GCaMP6 activity in the deprived visual cortex decreased, suggesting that excitatory activity in this region was reduced by MD. In addition, interhemispheric visual homotopic functional connectivity decreased following MD, which was accompanied by a reduction in parietal and motor homotopic connectivity. Finally, we observed enhanced internetwork connectivity between the visual and parietal cortex that peaked 2&nbsp;d after MD. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that early MD induces dynamic reorganization of disparate functional networks including the association cortices.</p>

                <p>GPR37L1 is an orphan receptor that couples through heterotrimeric G-proteins to regulate physiological functions. Since its role in humans is not fully defined, we used an unbiased computational approach to assess the clinical significance of rare <I>G-protein-coupled receptor 37-like 1</I> (<I>GPR37L1</I>) genetic variants found among 51,289 whole-exome sequences from the DiscovEHR cohort. Rare <I>GPR37L1</I> coding variants were binned according to predicted pathogenicity and analyzed by sequence kernel association testing to reveal significant associations with disease diagnostic codes for epilepsy and migraine, among others. Since associations do not prove causality, rare <I>GPR37L1</I> variants were functionally analyzed in SK-N-MC cells to evaluate potential signaling differences and pathogenicity. Notably, receptor variants exhibited varying abilities to reduce cAMP levels, activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and/or upregulate receptor expression in response to the agonist prosaptide (TX14(A)), as compared with the wild-type receptor. In addition to signaling changes, knock-out (KO) of <I>GPR37L1</I> or expression of certain rare variants altered cellular cholesterol levels, which were also acutely regulated by administration of the agonist TX14(A) via activation of the MAPK pathway. Finally, to simulate the impact of rare nonsense variants found in the large patient cohort, a KO mouse line lacking <I>Gpr37l1</I> was generated. Although KO animals did not recapitulate an acute migraine phenotype, the loss of this receptor produced sex-specific changes in anxiety-related disorders often seen in chronic migraineurs. Collectively, these observations define the existence of rare <I>GPR37L1</I> variants associated with neuropsychiatric conditions in the human population and identify the signaling changes contributing to pathological processes.</p>

                <p>In the study of bodily awareness, the predictive coding theory has revealed that our brain continuously modulates sensory experiences to integrate them into a unitary body representation. Indeed, during multisensory illusions (e.g., the rubber hand illusion, RHI), the synchronous stroking of the participant&rsquo;s concealed hand and a fake visible one creates a visuotactile conflict, generating a prediction error. Within the predictive coding framework, through sensory processing modulation, prediction errors are solved, inducing participants to feel as if touches originated from the fake hand, thus ascribing the fake hand to their own body. Here, we aimed to address sensory processing modulation under multisensory conflict, by disentangling somatosensory and visual stimuli processing that are intrinsically associated during the illusion induction. To this aim, we designed two EEG experiments, in which somatosensory- (SEPs; Experiment 1; <I>N</I> = 18; <I>F</I> = 10) and visual-evoked potentials (VEPs; Experiment 2; <I>N</I> = 18; <I>F</I> = 9) were recorded in human males and females following the RHI. Our results show that, in both experiments, ERP amplitude is significantly modulated in the illusion as compared with both control and baseline conditions, with a modality-dependent diametrical pattern showing decreased SEP amplitude and increased VEP amplitude. Importantly, both somatosensory and visual modulations occur in long-latency time windows previously associated with tactile and visual awareness, thus explaining the illusion of perceiving touch at the sight location. In conclusion, we describe a diametrical modulation of somatosensory and visual processing as the neural mechanism that allows maintaining a stable body representation, by restoring visuotactile congruency under the occurrence of multisensory conflicts.</p>

                <p>How humans transform sensory information into decisions that steer purposeful behavior is a central question in psychology and neuroscience that is traditionally investigated during the sampling of external environmental signals. The decision-making framework of gradual information sampling toward a decision has also been proposed to apply when sampling internal sensory evidence from working memory. However, neural evidence for this proposal remains scarce. Here we show (using scalp EEG in male and female human volunteers) that sampling internal visual representations from working memory elicits a scalp EEG potential associated with gradual evidence accumulation&mdash;the central parietal positivity. Consistent with an evolving decision process, we show how this signal (1) scales with the time participants require to reach a decision about the cued memory content and (2) is amplified when having to decide among multiple contents in working memory. These results bring the electrophysiology of decision-making into the domain of working memory and suggest that variability in memory-guided behavior may be driven (at least in part) by variations in the sampling of our inner mental contents.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/19/e1544232024?rss=1">The Intellectual Disability Risk Gene Kdm5b Regulates Long-Term Memory Consolidation in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B is implicated in recessive intellectual disability disorders, and heterozygous, protein-truncating variants in <I>KDM5B</I> are associated with reduced cognitive function in the population. The KDM5 family of lysine demethylases has developmental and homeostatic functions in the brain, some of which appear to be independent of lysine demethylase activity. To determine the functions of KDM5B in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we first studied male and female mice homozygous for a <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> allele that lacks demethylase activity. <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID/</I><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> mice exhibited hyperactivity and long-term memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks. The expression of immediate early, activity-dependent genes was downregulated in these mice and hyperactivated upon a learning stimulus compared with wild-type (WT) mice. A number of other learning-associated genes were also significantly dysregulated in the <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID/</I><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> hippocampus. Next, we knocked down <I>Kdm5b</I> specifically in the adult, WT mouse hippocampus with shRNA. <I>Kdm5b</I> knockdown resulted in spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and long-term potentiation deficits. These findings identify KDM5B as a critical regulator of gene expression and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus and suggest that at least some of the cognitive phenotypes associated with <I>KDM5B</I> gene variants are caused by direct effects on memory consolidation mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Glycinergic neurons regulate nociceptive and pruriceptive signaling in the spinal cord, but the identity and role of the glycine-regulated neurons are not fully known. Herein, we have characterized spinal glycine receptor alpha 3 (<I>Glra3</I>) subunit-expressing neurons in <I>Glra3</I>-Cre female and male mice. <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons express <I>Glra3</I>, are located mainly in laminae III&ndash;VI, and respond to glycine. Chemogenetic activation of spinal <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons induced biting/licking, stomping, and guarding behaviors, indicative of both a nociceptive and pruriceptive role for this population. Chemogenetic inhibition did not affect mechanical or thermal responses but reduced behaviors evoked by compound 48/80 and chloroquine, revealing a pruriceptive role for these neurons. Spinal cells activated by compound 48/80 or chloroquine express <I>Glra3</I>, further supporting the phenotype. Retrograde tracing revealed that spinal <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons receive input from afferents associated with pain and itch, and dorsal root stimulation validated the monosynaptic input. In conclusion, these results show that spinal <I>Glra3</I>(+) neurons contribute to acute communication of compound 48/80- and chloroquine-induced itch in hairy skin.</p>

                <p>Coordinated neuronal activity has been identified to play an important role in information processing and transmission in the brain. However, current research predominantly focuses on understanding the properties and functions of neuronal coordination in hippocampal and cortical areas, leaving subcortical regions relatively unexplored. In this study, we use single-unit recordings in female Sprague Dawley rats to investigate the properties and functions of groups of neurons exhibiting coordinated activity in the auditory thalamus&mdash;the medial geniculate body (MGB). We reliably identify coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs), which are groups of neurons that fire synchronously, in the MGB. cNEs are shown not to be the result of false-positive detections or by-products of slow-state oscillations in anesthetized animals. We demonstrate that cNEs in the MGB have enhanced information-encoding properties over individual neurons. Their neuronal composition is stable between spontaneous and evoked activity, suggesting limited stimulus-induced ensemble dynamics. These MGB cNE properties are similar to what is observed in cNEs in the primary auditory cortex (A1), suggesting that ensembles serve as a ubiquitous mechanism for organizing local networks and play a fundamental role in sensory processing within the brain.</p>

                <p>Excitotoxicity and the concurrent loss of inhibition are well-defined mechanisms driving acute elevation in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and neuronal cell death following an ischemic insult to the brain. Despite the high prevalence of long-term disability in survivors of global cerebral ischemia (GCI) as a consequence of cardiac arrest, it remains unclear whether E/I imbalance persists beyond the acute phase and negatively affects functional recovery. We previously demonstrated sustained impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons correlating with deficits in learning and memory tasks in a murine model of cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Here, we use CA/CPR and an in vitro ischemia model to elucidate mechanisms by which E/I imbalance contributes to ongoing hippocampal dysfunction in male mice. We reveal increased postsynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) clustering and function in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that reduces the E/I ratio. Importantly, reduced GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R clustering observed in the first 24&nbsp;h rebounds to an elevation of GABAergic clustering by 3&nbsp;d postischemia. This increase in GABAergic inhibition required activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ion channel transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2), previously implicated in persistent LTP and memory deficits following CA/CPR. Furthermore, we find Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling, likely downstream of TRPM2 activation, upregulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity, thereby driving the elevation of postsynaptic inhibitory function. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism by which inhibitory synaptic strength is upregulated in the context of ischemia and identify TRPM2 and CaMKII as potential pharmacological targets to restore perturbed synaptic plasticity and ameliorate cognitive function.</p>

                <p>BMAL2 (ARNTL2) is a paralog of BMAL1 that can form heterodimers with the other circadian factors CLOCK and NPAS2 to activate transcription of clock and clock-controlled genes. To assess a possible role of <I>Bmal2</I> in the circadian regulation of metabolism, we investigated daily variations of energy metabolism, feeding behavior, and locomotor behavior, as well as ability to anticipate restricted food access in male mice knock-out for <I>Bmal2</I> (B2KO). While their amount of food intake and locomotor activity were normal compared with wild-type mice, B2KO mice displayed increased adiposity (1.5-fold higher) and fasted hyperinsulinemia (fourfold higher) and tended to have lower energy expenditure at night. Impairment of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei was evidenced by the shorter free-running period (&ndash;14&nbsp;min/cycle) of B2KO mice compared with wild-type controls and by a loss of daily rhythmicity in expression of intracellular metabolic regulators (e.g., <I>Lipoprotein lipase</I> and <I>Uncoupling protein 2</I>). The circadian window of eating was longer in B2KO mice. The circadian patterns of food intake and meal numbers were bimodal in control mice but not in B2KO mice. In response to restricted feeding, food-anticipatory activity was almost prevented in B2KO mice, suggesting altered food clock that controls anticipation of food availability. In the mediobasal hypothalamus of B2KO mice, expression of genes coding orexigenic neuropeptides (including <I>Neuropeptide y</I> and <I>Agouti-Related Peptide</I>) was downregulated, while <I>Lipoprotein lipase</I> expression lost its rhythmicity. Together, these data highlight that BMAL2 has major impacts on brain regulation of metabolic rhythms, sleep&ndash;wake cycle, and food anticipation.</p>

                <p>Perception is a probabilistic process dependent on external stimulus properties and one's internal state. However, which internal states influence perception and via what mechanisms remain debated. We studied how spontaneous alpha-band activity (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) and pupil fluctuations impact visual detection and confidence across stimulus contrast levels (i.e., the contrast response function, CRF). In human subjects of both sexes, we found that low prestimulus alpha power induced an "additive" shift in the CRF, whereby stimuli were reported present more frequently at all contrast levels, including contrast of zero (i.e., false alarms). Conversely, prestimulus pupil size had a "multiplicative" effect on detection such that stimuli occurring during large pupil states (putatively corresponding to higher arousal) were perceived more frequently as contrast increased. Signal detection modeling reveals that alpha power changes detection criteria equally across the CRF but not detection sensitivity (<I>d</I>'), whereas pupil-linked arousal modulated sensitivity, particularly for higher contrasts. Interestingly, pupil size and alpha power were positively correlated, meaning that some of the effect of alpha on detection may be mediated by pupil fluctuations. However, pupil-independent alpha still induced an additive shift in the CRF corresponding to a criterion effect. Our data imply that low alpha boosts detection and confidence by an additive factor, rather than by a multiplicative scaling of contrast responses, a profile which captures the effect of pupil-linked arousal. We suggest that alpha power and arousal fluctuations have dissociable effects on behavior. Alpha reflects the baseline level of visual excitability, which can vary independent of arousal.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus receives powerful synaptic inputs from corticotectal neurons in the visual cortex. The function of these corticotectal neurons remains largely unknown due to a limited understanding of their response properties and connectivity. Here, we use antidromic methods to identify corticotectal neurons in awake male and female rabbits, and measure their axonal conduction times, thalamic inputs and receptive field properties. All corticotectal neurons responded to sinusoidal drifting gratings with a nonlinear (nonsinusoidal) increase in mean firing rate but showed pronounced differences in their ON&ndash;OFF receptive field structures that we classified into three groups, Cx, S2, and S1. Cx receptive fields had highly overlapping ON and OFF subfields as classical complex cells, S2 had largely separated ON and OFF subfields as classical simple cells, and S1 had a single ON or OFF subfield. Thus, all corticotectal neurons are homogeneous in their nonlinear spatial summation but very heterogeneous in their spatial integration of ON and OFF inputs. The Cx type had the fastest conducting axons, the highest spontaneous activity, and the strongest and fastest visual responses. The S2 type had the highest orientation selectivity, and the S1 type had the slowest conducting axons. Moreover, our cross-correlation analyses found that a subpopulation of corticotectal neurons with very fast conducting axons and high spontaneous firing rates (largely "Cx" type) receives monosynaptic input from retinotopically aligned thalamic neurons. This previously unrecognized fast-conducting thalamic-mediated corticotectal pathway may provide specialized information to superior colliculus and prime recipient neurons for subsequent corticotectal or retinal synaptic input.</p>

                <p>Elevated iron deposition in the brain has been observed in older adult humans and persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has been associated with lower cognitive performance. We investigated the impact of iron deposition, and its topographical distribution across hippocampal subfields and segments (anterior, posterior) measured along its longitudinal axis, on episodic memory in a sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults at elevated familial risk for AD (<I>N</I> = 172, 120 females, 52 males; mean age = 68.8 &plusmn; 5.4 years). MRI-based quantitative susceptibility maps were acquired to derive estimates of hippocampal iron deposition. The Mnemonic Similarity Task was used to measure pattern separation and pattern completion, two hippocampally mediated episodic memory processes. Greater hippocampal iron load was associated with lower pattern separation and higher pattern completion scores, both indicators of poorer episodic memory. Examination of iron levels within hippocampal subfields across its long axis revealed topographic specificity. Among the subfields and segments investigated here, iron deposition in the posterior hippocampal CA1 was the most robustly and negatively associated with the fidelity memory representations. This association remained after controlling for hippocampal volume and was observed in the context of normal performance on standard neuropsychological memory measures. These findings reveal that the impact of iron load on episodic memory performance is not uniform across the hippocampus. Both iron deposition levels as well as its spatial distribution, must be taken into account when examining the relationship between hippocampal iron and episodic memory in older adults at elevated risk for AD.</p>

                <p>Exercise is known to benefit motor skill learning in health and neurological disease. Evidence from brain stimulation, genotyping, and Parkinson's disease studies converge to suggest that the dopamine D2 receptor, and shifts in the cortical excitation and inhibition (E:I) balance, are prime candidates for the drivers of exercise-enhanced motor learning. However, causal evidence using experimental pharmacological challenge is lacking. We hypothesized that the modulatory effect of the dopamine D2 receptor on exercise-induced changes in the E:I balance would determine the magnitude of motor skill acquisition. To test this, we measured exercise-induced changes in excitation and inhibition using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 22 healthy female and male humans, and then had participants learn a novel motor skill&mdash;the sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT). We examined the effect of D2 receptor blockade (800&nbsp;mg sulpiride) on these measures within a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our key result was that motor skill acquisition was driven by an interaction between the D2 receptor and E:I balance. Specifically, poorer skill learning was related to an attenuated shift in the E:I balance in the sulpiride condition, whereas this interaction was not evident in placebo. Our results demonstrate that exercise-primed motor skill acquisition is causally influenced by D2 receptor activity on motor cortical circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/19/e2345232024?rss=1">Developmentally Unique Cerebellar Processing Prioritizes Self- over Other-Generated Movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals must distinguish the sensory consequences of self-generated movements (reafference) from those of other-generated movements (exafference). Only self-generated movements entail the production of motor copies (i.e., corollary discharges), which are compared with reafference in the cerebellum to compute predictive or internal models of movement. Internal models emerge gradually over the first three postnatal weeks in rats through a process that is not yet fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated in postnatal day (P) 8 and P12 rats that precerebellar nuclei convey corollary discharge and reafference to the cerebellum during active (REM) sleep when pups produce limb twitches. Here, recording from a deep cerebellar nucleus (interpositus, IP) in P12 rats of both sexes, we compared reafferent and exafferent responses with twitches and limb stimulations, respectively. As expected, most IP units showed robust responses to twitches. However, in contrast with other sensory structures throughout the brain, relatively few IP units showed exafferent responses. Upon finding that exafferent responses occurred in pups under urethane anesthesia, we hypothesized that urethane inhibits cerebellar cortical cells, thereby disinhibiting exafferent responses in IP. In support of this hypothesis, ablating cortical tissue dorsal to IP mimicked the effects of urethane on exafference. Finally, the results suggest that twitch-related corollary discharge and reafference are conveyed simultaneously and in parallel to cerebellar cortex and IP. Based on these results, we propose that twitches provide opportunities for the nascent cerebellum to integrate somatotopically organized corollary discharge and reafference, thereby enabling the development of closed-loop circuits and, subsequently, internal models.</p>

                <p>Forebrain neurons deprived of activity become hyperactive when activity is restored. Rebound activity has been linked to spontaneous seizures in vivo following prolonged activity blockade. Here, we measured the time course of rebound activity and the contributing circuit mechanisms using calcium imaging, synaptic staining, and whole-cell patch clamp in organotypic slice cultures of mouse neocortex. Calcium imaging revealed hypersynchronous activity increasing in intensity with longer periods of deprivation. While activity partially recovered 3&nbsp;d after slices were released from 5&nbsp;d of deprivation, they were less able to recover after 10&nbsp;d of deprivation. However, even after the longer period of deprivation, activity patterns eventually returned to baseline levels. The degree of deprivation-induced rebound was age-dependent, with the greatest effects occurring when silencing began in the second week. Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors indicated that hypersynchronous rebound activity did not require activation of Hebbian plasticity. In single-neuron recordings, input resistance roughly doubled with a concomitant increase in intrinsic excitability. Synaptic imaging of pre- and postsynaptic proteins revealed dramatic reductions in the number of presumptive synapses with a larger effect on inhibitory than excitatory synapses. Putative excitatory synapses colocalizing PSD-95 and Bassoon declined by 39 and 56% following 5 and 10&nbsp;d of deprivation, but presumptive inhibitory synapses colocalizing gephyrin and VGAT declined by 55 and 73%, respectively. The results suggest that with prolonged deprivation, a progressive reduction in synapse number is accompanied by a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition and increased cellular excitability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-510/v3?src=rss">Exploring the moderating effects of SIRT1 and gene polymorphisms rs7895833 on the relationship between hemoglobin levels and physical frailty in elderly adults with comorbid chronic diseases: A moderated mediation analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 appro</a></h4>

              
                Background Relationship age, hemoglobin, and physical frailty have all been investigated in older people with more than one chronic disease. There has been little analysis of the relationship between hemoglobin, age, physical frailty, plasma levels of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), and the gene polymorphism (SNP) rs7895833 A>G. The goal of this study was to find out how SIRT1 level, SNP rs7895833, hemoglobin, age, and physical frailty (frail score) are related in older Indonesian adults with comorbid chronic diseases. Methods This was an observational study. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from the electronic health records of Universitas Sumatera Utara Hospital, Medan, Indonesia. Physical frailty, SIRT1 level, and SNP rs7895833 were measured using an appropriate and valid method. Purposive sampling was used to determine the eligibility of 132 elderly adults from November 2022 to February 2023. Results The indirect effect of hemoglobin on the frail score (FS) through age was negative and significant, according to a conditional mediation analysis (β=-0.0731; p=0.023). Meanwhile, the direct effect of hemoglobin on the FS was negative and not significant (β=0.1632; p=0.052). According to the conditional moderated mediation analysis, the size of the direct effect of age on FS was increased by genotype AG-GG and SIRT1 level (βlow=0.2647; p=0.002, βmiddle=0.2956; p<0.001, and βhigh=0.319; p<0.001). The size of the conditional indirect effect of Hemoglobin on FS through age was negative and significantly increased by SNP genotype AG-GG and SIRT1 level (βlow=-0.0647; p=0.032, βmiddle=-0.0723; p=0.024, and βhigh=-0.078; p=0.02). Conclusions Higher plasma levels of SIRT1 and the SNP genotype AG-GG may both contribute to physical frailty in the elderly population. Hemoglobin levels in the blood fall with age, which can negatively impact older persons who already have chronic diseases. However, the interactions between these factors are intricate, requiring more study to completely understand the processes underlying development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-441/v2?src=rss">The interaction between brain-based learning strategies and patterns of infographics and its influence on the development of information concepts among Saudi undergraduate cybersecurity students [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The study reported in this paper investigates the impact of the interaction between brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments and its impact on the development of informational concepts among cybersecurity students. The quantitative data were collected by means of Information Concept Test to determine the levels of information concepts according to the Frayer model (1969). The research sample consists of 80 male and female undergraduate students in Qassim University, who were classified into four quasi-experimental groups according to their preferred patterns in the infographic. Quantitative analysis of findings from this study shows an effect for the interaction between the variables of brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments in the test scores of information concepts in the post-administration, where the significance level (.011) is less than the significance level (0.05). Findings also revealed that the repetition of information at increasing intervals of time using the infographics is effective to learning concepts in an organized manner and to improving short memory. Furthermore, the mental model’s strategy also helped to retain information. The study recommends encouraging the use of brain-based learning strategies and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments to explore the relationships between different scientific concepts, to expand students’ knowledge, and to discover inter-relationships between different subject elements. The study provides a platform for further research to employ different brain-based learning strategies within e-learning environments to acquire higher-order thinking skills and improve students’ memory and mental capacity with the use of modern technological techniques that achieve learning quality.

The activation levels of biologically significant gene sets are emerging tumor molecular markers and play an irreplaceable role in the tumor research field; however, web-based tools for prognostic analyses using it as a tumor molecular marker remain scarce. We developed a web-based tool PESSA for survival analysis using gene set activation levels. All data analyses were implemented via R. Activation levels of The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets were assessed using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method based on data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and supplementary tables of articles. PESSA was used to perform median and optimal cut-off dichotomous grouping of ssGSEA scores for each dataset, relying on the survival and survminer packages for survival analysis and visualisation. PESSA is an open-access web tool for visualizing the results of tumor prognostic analyses using gene set activation levels. A total of 238 datasets from the GEO, TCGA, EGA, and supplementary tables of articles; covering 51 cancer types and 13 survival outcome types; and 13,434 tumor-related gene sets are obtained from MSigDB for pre-grouping. Users can obtain the results, including Kaplan–Meier analyses based on the median and optimal cut-off values and accompanying visualization plots and the Cox regression analyses of dichotomous and continuous variables, by selecting the gene set markers of interest. PESSA (https://smuonco.shinyapps.io/PESSA/ OR http://robinl-lab.com/PESSA) is a large-scale web-based tumor survival analysis tool covering a large amount of data that creatively uses predefined gene set activation levels as molecular markers of tumors.
