              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population coding strategies in human tactile afferents</a></h4>

              
                Sensory information is conveyed by populations of neurons, and coding strategies cannot always be deduced when considering individual neurons. Moreover, information coding depends on the number of neurons available and on the composition of the population when multiple classes with different response properties are available. Here, we study population coding in human tactile afferents by employing a recently developed simulator of mechanoreceptor firing activity. First, we demonstrate that the optimal afferent density for conveying maximal information depends on the tactile feature under consideration and the afferent class coding this feature. Second, we find that information is spread across different classes for all tactile features, such that combining information from multiple afferent classes improves information transmission, and is often more efficient than increasing the density of afferents from the same class. Finally, we test the importance of timing precision and afferent identity in the population code to probe whether temporal and spatial information can be traded against each other. Destroying temporal information turns out to be more destructive than removing spatial information, and the contribution of either cannot be completely recovered from the other. Overall, our results suggest that both optimal afferent innervation densities and the composition of the population depend in complex ways on the tactile features in question, potentially accounting for the variety in which tactile peripheral populations are assembled in different regions across the body.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Katanin is involved in Microtubule Polymerization into Dendritic Spines and regulates Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic microtubules transiently polymerize into dendritic spines, however intracellular factors that regulate this process and their functional role at synapses are hardly understood. Using live imaging, electrophysiology, and glutamate uncaging, we show that the microtubule-severing complex katanin is located at individual spine synapses, participates in the activity-dependent process of microtubule polymerization into dendritic spines, and regulates synaptic plasticity. Overexpression of a dominant-negative ATPase-deficient katanin subunit, did not alter microtubule growth velocities or comet density in dendrites, but significantly reduced the activity-dependent invasion of microtubules into dendritic spines. Notably, functional inhibition of katanin significantly affected the potentiation of AMPA-receptor-mediated excitatory currents after chemical induction of long-term potentiation (cLTP). Furthermore, interference with katanin function prevented structural spine remodeling following single spine glutamate uncaging. Our data identify katanin at individual spine synapses in association with PSD-95. Thus, katanin regulates postsynaptic microtubules and modulates synaptic structure and function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of physical and temporal certainty on locomotion with discrete underfoot perturbations</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ambulation over complex terrain requires active control of foot placement to maintain a normal kinematic relationship between the center of mass and base of support. Recent investigations have suggested that foot placement location may be selected to anticipate shifts to the underfoot center of pressure. However, it is unclear whether temporal affordance and physical certainty contribute to the selection of a perturbation-specific anticipatory strategy. This study investigates anticipatory and reactive locomotor strategies for repeated underfoot perturbations with varying levels of temporal certainty, temporal affordance, and physical certainty. Methods: Thirteen healthy adults walked with random underfoot perturbations from a mechanized shoe. Temporal certainty was challenged by presenting the perturbations with or without warning. Temporal affordance was challenged by adjusting the timing of a warning tone before the perturbation. Physical certainty was challenged with conditions that included only eversion perturbations, only inversion perturbations, or both eversion and inversion perturbations. Linear-mixed effects models assessed the effect of each condition on the percent change of margin of stability and step width, respectively. Results: For temporally uncertain perturbations and perturbations with one stride or less of affordance, we observed few changes to step width or margin of stability. As affordance increased to two strides, participants adopted a wider step width in anticipation of the perturbation (p = 0.001). Physical certainty had little effect on gait for the step of the perturbation, but participants recovered normal gait sooner when the physical nature of the perturbation was predictable (p < 0.001). Discussion: Despite having information about the timing and magnitude of upcoming perturbations, individuals do not develop perturbation-specific feedforward strategies but instead rely on feedback control to recover normal gait after a perturbation. However, physical certainty appears to improve the efficiency of the feedback controller and allows individuals to recover normal gait sooner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A marked enhancement of a BLOC-1 gene, pallidin, associated with somnolent mouse models deficient in histamine transmission</a></h4>

              
                Histamine (HA) and orexin (Ox, or hypocretin) neurons act distinctly and synergistically in wake control. A double knock out mouse genotype lacking both HA and Ox shows all sleep disorders of human narcolepsy. We identified in this mouse brain a sharp upregulation of a BLOC-1 gene, pallidin that is associated with dramatic changes in the balance of cholinergic and aminergic systems in mice and an enhanced sleep in drosophila. This study demonstrates potential sleep disorders-associated compensatory mechanisms with pallid as a novel biomarker.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual cycles travel across retinotopic space</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception waxes and wanes periodically as a function of the phase of low-frequency brain oscillations (theta, 4-7 Hz; alpha, 8-13 Hz) [1-9]. Perceptual cycles are defined as the corresponding periodic modulation of perceptual performance (review [10, 11]). Here, using psychophysics, we tested the hypothesis that brain oscillations travel across the visual cortex, leading to predictable perceptual consequences across the visual field, i.e., perceptual cycles travel across the retinotopic visual space. An oscillating disk (inducer) was presented in the periphery of the visual field to induce brain oscillations at low frequencies (4, 6, 8 or 10 Hz) at a specific retinotopic cortical location. Target stimuli at threshold (50% detection) were displayed at random times during the periodic disk stimulation, at one of three possible distances from the disk. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants performed a detection task. EEG analyses showed that the periodic stimulation produced a complex brain oscillation composed of the induced frequency and its first harmonic likely due to the overlap of the periodic response and the neural response to individual stimuli. This complex oscillation, which originated from a precise retinotopic position, modulated detection performance periodically at each target position and at each frequency. Critically, the optimal behavioral phase, i.e., of highest performance, of the 8 Hz and 10 Hz oscillations (alpha range) consistently shifted across target distance to the inducer. Together, the results demonstrate that alpha-induced perceptual cycles traveled across the retinotopic space in human observers at a propagation speed between 0.2 and 0.4 m/s.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral and brain responses to verbal stimuli reveal transient periods of cognitive integration of external world in all sleep stages</a></h4>

              
                Sleep has long been considered as a state of disconnection from the environment, with absent reactivity to external stimuli. Here, we questioned this sleep disconnection dogma by directly investigating behavioral responsiveness in 49 napping subjects (27 with narcolepsy and 22 healthy volunteers) engaged in a lexical decision task. Participants were instructed to frown or smile depending on the stimulus type (words vs pseudo-words). We found accurate behavioral responses, visible via contractions of the corrugator or zygomatic muscles, in all sleep stages in both groups (except slow-wave sleep for healthy volunteers). Stimuli presented during states with high (vs. low) values of neural markers indexing rich cognitive states more often yielded responses. Our findings suggest that transient windows of reactivity to external stimuli exist in all sleep stages, even in healthy individuals. Such windows of reactivity could be used to probe sleep-related mental and cognitive processes in real-time across all sleep stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ribotoxic collisions on CAG expansions disrupt proteostasis and stress responses in Huntington's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions encoding a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene1. Although mutant HTT (mHTT) protein tends to aggregate, the exact causes of neurotoxicity in HD remain unclear2. Here we show that altered elongation kinetics on CAG expansions cause ribosome collisions that trigger ribotoxicity, proteotoxicity and maladaptive stress responses. CAG expansions cause an elongation rate conflict during HTT translation, when ribosomes rapidly decoding the optimal polyQ encounter a flanking slowly-decoded polyproline tract. The ensuing ribosome collisions lead to premature termination and release of aggregation-prone mHTT fragments. Due to the presence of a stress-responsive upstream open reading frame (uORF), HTT translation and aggregation are limited under normal conditions but enhanced under stress, seeding a vicious cycle of dysfunction. mHTT further exacerbates ribotoxicity by progressively sequestering eIF5A, a key regulator of translation elongation, polyamine metabolism and stress responses. eIF5A depletion in HD cells leads to widespread ribosome pausing on eIF5A-dependent sites, impaired cotranslational proteostasis, disrupted polyamine metabolism and maladaptive stress responses. Importantly, drugs that reduce translation initiation attenuate ribosome collisions and mitigate this escalating cascade of ribotoxic stress and dysfunction in HD.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evolution Increases Primates Brain Complexity Extending RbFOX1 Splicing Activity to LSD1 Modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent branching (100 MYA) of the mammalian evolutionary tree has enhanced brain complexity and functions at the putative cost of increased emotional circuitry vulnerability. Thus, to better understand psychopathology, a burden for the modern society, novel approaches should exploit evolutionary aspects of psychiatric-relevant molecular pathways. A handful of genes is nowadays tightly associated to psychiatric disorders. Among them, neuronal-enriched RbFOX1 modifies the activity of synaptic regulators in response to neuronal activity, keeping excitability within healthy domains. We here dissect a higher primates-restricted interaction between RbFOX1 and the transcriptional corepressor Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A). A single nucleotide variation (AA to AG) in <I>LSD1</I> gene appeared in higher primates and humans, endowing RbFOX1 with the ability to promote the alternative usage of a novel 3' AG splice site, which extends LSD1 exon E9 in the upstream intron (E9-long). Exon E9-long regulates LSD1 levels by Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay. As reintroduction of the archaic <I>LSD1</I> variant (AA) abolishes E9-long splicing, the novel 3' AG splice site is necessary for RbFOX1 to control LSD1 levels. LSD1 is a homeostatic immediate early genes (IEGs) regulator playing a relevant part in environmental stress-response. In primates and humans, inclusion of LSD1 as RbFOX1 target provides RbFOX1 with the additional ability to regulate the IEGs. These data, together with extensive RbFOX1 involvement in psychiatric disorders and its stress-dependent regulation in male mice, suggest the RbFOX1-LSD1-IEGs axis as an evolutionary recent psychiatric-relevant pathway. Notably, outside the nervous system, RbFOX2-dependent LSD1 modulation could be a candidate deregulated mechanism in cancer.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To be better understood, anxiety and depression need large human genetics studies aimed at further resolving the often ambiguous, aberrant neuronal pathomechanisms that impact corticolimbic circuitry physiology. Several genetic associations of the alternative splicing regulator RbFOX1 with psychiatric conditions suggest homeostatic unbalance as a neuronal signature of psychopathology. Here we move a step forward, characterizing a disease-relevant higher primates-specific pathway by which RbFOX1 acquires the ability to regulate neuronal levels of Lysine Specific Demethylase 1, an epigenetic modulator of environmental stress response. Thus, two brain-enriched enzymes, independently shown to homeostatically protect neurons with a clear readout in terms of emotional behavior in lower mammals, establish in higher primates and humans a new functional cooperation enhancing the complexity of environmental adaptation and stress vulnerability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Longitudinal Allometry of Sulcal Morphology in Health and Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scaling between subcomponents of folding and total brain volume (TBV) in healthy individuals (HIs) is allometric. It is unclear whether this is true in schizophrenia (SZ) or first-episode psychosis (FEP). This study confirmed normative allometric scaling norms in HIs using discovery and replication samples. Cross-sectional and longitudinal diagnostic differences in folding subcomponents were then assessed using an allometric framework. Structural imaging from a longitudinal (Sample 1: HI and SZ, n<SUB>HI Baseline</SUB> = 298, n<SUB>SZ Baseline</SUB> = 169, n<SUB>HI Follow-up</SUB> = 293, n<SUB>SZ Follow-up</SUB> = 168, totaling 1087 images, all individuals &ge; 2 images, age 16-69 years) and a cross-sectional sample (Sample 2: n<SUB>HI</SUB> = 61 and n<SUB>FEP</SUB> = 89, age 10-30 years), all human males and females, is leveraged to calculate global folding and its nested subcomponents: sulcation index (SI, total sulcal/cortical hull area) and determinants of sulcal area: sulcal length and sulcal depth. Scaling of SI, sulcal area, and sulcal length with TBV in SZ and FEP was allometric and did not differ from HIs. Longitudinal age trajectories demonstrated steeper loss of SI and sulcal area through adulthood in SZ. Longitudinal allometric analysis revealed that both annual change in SI and sulcal area was significantly stronger related to change in TBV in SZ compared with HIs. Our results detail the first evidence of the disproportionate contribution of changes in SI and sulcal area to TBV changes in SZ. Longitudinal allometric analysis of sulcal morphology provides deeper insight into lifespan trajectories of cortical folding in SZ.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Psychotic disorders are associated with deficits in cortical folding and brain size, but we lack knowledge of how these two morphometric features are related. We leverage cross-sectional and longitudinal samples in which we decompose folding into a set of nested subcomponents: sulcal and hull area, and sulcal depth and length. We reveal that, in both schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis, (1) scaling of subcomponents with brain size is different from expected scaling laws and (2) caution is warranted when interpreting results from traditional methods for brain size correction. Longitudinal allometric scaling points to loss of sulcal area as a principal contributor to loss of brain size in schizophrenia. These findings advance the understanding of cortical folding atypicalities in psychotic disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Critical Role for DLK and LZK in Axonal Repair in the Mammalian Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <p>The limited ability for axonal repair after spinal cord injury underlies long-term functional impairment. Dual leucine-zipper kinase [DLK; MAP kinase kinase kinase 12; MAP3K12] is an evolutionarily conserved MAP3K implicated in neuronal injury signaling from <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> to mammals. However, whether DLK or its close homolog leucine zipper kinase (LZK; MAP3K13) regulates axonal repair in the mammalian spinal cord remains unknown. Here, we assess the role of endogenous DLK and LZK in the regeneration and compensatory sprouting of corticospinal tract (CST) axons in mice of both sexes with genetic analyses in a regeneration competent background provided by PTEN deletion. We found that inducible neuronal deletion of both DLK and LZK, but not either kinase alone, abolishes PTEN deletion-induced regeneration and sprouting of CST axons, and reduces naturally-occurring axon sprouting after injury. Thus, DLK/LZK-mediated injury signaling operates not only in injured neurons to regulate regeneration, but also unexpectedly in uninjured neurons to regulate sprouting. Deleting DLK and LZK does not interfere with PTEN/mTOR signaling, indicating that injury signaling and regenerative competence are independently controlled. Together with our previous study implicating LZK in astrocytic reactivity and scar formation, these data illustrate the multicellular function of this pair of MAP3Ks in both neurons and glia in the injury response of the mammalian spinal cord.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Functional recovery after spinal cord injury is limited because of a lack of axonal repair in the mammalian CNS. Dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK) and leucine zipper kinase (LZK) are two closely related protein kinases that have emerged as regulators of neuronal responses to injury. However, their role in axonal repair in the mammalian spinal cord has not been described. Here, we show that DLK and LZK together play critical roles in axonal repair in the mammalian spinal cord, validating them as potential targets to promote repair and recovery after spinal cord injury. In addition to regulating axonal regeneration from injured neurons, both kinases also regulate compensatory axonal growth from uninjured neurons, indicating a more pervasive role in CNS repair than originally anticipated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Columnar Localization and Laminar Origin of Cortical Surface Electrical Potentials</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrocorticography (ECoG) methodologically bridges basic neuroscience and understanding of human brains in health and disease. However, the localization of ECoG signals across the surface of the brain and the spatial distribution of their generating neuronal sources are poorly understood. To address this gap, we recorded from rat auditory cortex using customized &mu;ECoG, and simulated cortical surface electrical potentials with a full-scale, biophysically detailed cortical column model. Experimentally, &mu;ECoG-derived auditory representations were tonotopically organized and signals were anisotropically localized to less than or equal to &plusmn;200 &mu;m, that is, a single cortical column. Biophysical simulations reproduce experimental findings and indicate that neurons in cortical layers V and VI contribute ~85% of evoked high-gamma signal recorded at the surface. Cell number and synchrony were the primary biophysical properties determining laminar contributions to evoked &mu;ECoG signals, whereas distance was only a minimal factor. Thus, evoked &mu;ECoG signals primarily originate from neurons in the infragranular layers of a single cortical column.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> ECoG methodologically bridges basic neuroscience and understanding of human brains in health and disease. However, the localization of ECoG signals across the surface of the brain and the spatial distribution of their generating neuronal sources are poorly understood. We investigated the localization and origins of sensory-evoked ECoG responses. We experimentally found that ECoG responses were anisotropically localized to a cortical column. Biophysically detailed simulations revealed that neurons in layers V and VI were the primary sources of evoked ECoG responses. These results indicate that evoked ECoG high-gamma responses are primarily generated by the population spike rate of pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI of single cortical columns and highlight the possibility of understanding how microscopic sources produce mesoscale signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tracing Modification to Cortical Circuits in Human and Nonhuman Primates from High-Resolution Tractography, Transcription, and Temporal Dimensions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neural circuits that support human cognition are a topic of enduring interest. Yet, there are limited tools available to map brain circuits in the human and nonhuman primate brain. We harnessed high-resolution diffusion MR tractography, anatomic, and transcriptomic data from individuals of either sex to investigate the evolution and development of frontal cortex circuitry. We applied machine learning to RNA sequencing data to find corresponding ages between humans and macaques and to compare the development of circuits across species. We transcriptionally defined neural circuits by testing for associations between gene expression and white matter maturation. We then considered transcriptional and structural growth to test whether frontal cortex circuit maturation is unusually extended in humans relative to other species. We also considered gene expression and high-resolution diffusion MR tractography of adult brains to test for cross-species variation in frontal cortex circuits. We found that frontal cortex circuitry development is extended in primates, and concomitant with an expansion in corticocortical pathways compared with mice in adulthood. Importantly, we found that these parameters varied relatively little across humans and studied primates. These data identify a surprising collection of conserved features in frontal cortex circuits across humans and Old World monkeys. Our work demonstrates that integrating transcriptional and structural data across temporal dimensions is a robust approach to trace the evolution of brain pathways in primates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Diffusion MR tractography is an exciting method to explore pathways, but there are uncertainties in the accuracy of reconstructed tracts. We broaden the repertoire of toolkits to enhance our ability to trace human brain pathways from diffusion MR tractography. Our integrative approach finds corresponding ages across species and transcriptionally defines neural circuits. We used this information to test for variation in circuit maturation across species and found a surprising constellation of similar features in frontal cortex neural circuits across humans and primates. Integrating across scales of biological organization expands the repertoire of tools available to study pathways in primates, which opens new avenues to study pathways in health and diseases of the human brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Term Inactivation of Sodium Channels as a Mechanism of Adaptation in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells function as place cells, increasing their firing rate when a specific place field is traversed. The dependence of CA1 place cell firing on position within the place field is asymmetric. We investigated the source of this asymmetry by injecting triangular depolarizing current ramps to approximate the spatially tuned, temporally diffuse depolarizing synaptic input received by these neurons while traversing a place field. Ramps were applied to CA1 pyramidal neurons from male rats <I>in vitro</I> (slice electrophysiology) and <I>in silico</I> (multicompartmental NEURON model). Under control conditions, CA1 neurons fired more action potentials at higher frequencies on the up-ramp versus the down-ramp. This effect was more pronounced for dendritic compared with somatic ramps. We incorporated a four-state Markov scheme for Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6 channels into our model and calibrated the spatial dependence of long-term inactivation according to the literature; this spatial dependence was sufficient to explain the difference in dendritic versus somatic ramps. Long-term inactivation reduced the firing frequency by decreasing open-state occupancy, and reduced spike amplitude during trains by decreasing occupancy in the closed state, which comprises the available pool. PKC activator phorbol-dibutyrate, known to reduce Na<SUB>V</SUB> long-term inactivation, removed spike amplitude attenuation <I>in vitro</I> more visibly in dendrites and greatly reduced adaptation, consistent with our hypothesized mechanism. Intracellular application of a peptide inducing long-term Na<SUB>V</SUB> inactivation elicited spike amplitude attenuation during spike trains in the soma and greatly enhanced adaptation. Our synergistic experimental/computational approach shows that long-term inactivation of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6 is a key mechanism of adaptation in CA1 pyramidal cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hippocampus plays an important role in certain types of memory, in part through context-specific firing of "place cells"; these cells were first identified in rodents as being particularly active when an animal is in a specific location in an environment, called the place field of that neuron. In this <I>in vitro</I>/<I>in silico</I> study, we found that long-term inactivation of sodium channels causes adaptation in the firing rate that could potentially skew the firing of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons earlier within a place field. A computational model of the sodium channel revealed differential regulation of spike frequency and amplitude by long-term inactivation, which may be a general mechanism for spike frequency adaptation in the CNS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Encoding of Environmental Cues in Central Amygdala Neurons during Foraging</a></h4>

              
                <p>To successfully forage in an environment filled with rewards and threats, animals need to rely on familiar structures of their environment that signal food availability. The central amygdala (CeA) is known to mediate a panoply of consummatory and defensive behaviors, yet how specific activity patterns within CeA subpopulations guide optimal choices is not completely understood. In a paradigm of appetitive conditioning in which mice freely forage for food across a continuum of cues, we found that two major subpopulations of CeA neurons, Somatostatin-positive (CeA<sup>Sst</sup>) and protein kinase C-positive (CeA<sup>PKC</sup>) neurons, can assign motivational properties to environmental cues. Although the proportion of food responsive cells was higher within CeA<sup>Sst</sup> than CeA<sup>PKC</sup> neurons, only the activities of CeA<sup>PKC</sup>, but not CeA<sup>Sst</sup>, neurons were required for learning of contextual food cues. Our findings point to a model in which CeA<sup>PKC</sup> neurons may incorporate stimulus salience together with sensory features of the environment to encode memory of the goal location.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The CeA has a very important role in the formation of memories that associate sensory information with aversive or rewarding representation. Here, we used a conditioned place preference paradigm, where freely moving mice learn to associate external cues with food availability, to investigate the roles of CeA neuron subpopulations. We found that CeA<sup>Sst</sup> and CeA<sup>PKC</sup> neurons encoded environmental cues during foraging but only the activities of CeA<sup>PKC</sup> neurons were required for learning of contextual food cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Variable Clock Underlies Internally Generated Hippocampal Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans have the ability to store and retrieve memories with various degrees of specificity, and recent advances in reinforcement learning have identified benefits to learning when past experience is represented at different levels of temporal abstraction. How this flexibility might be implemented in the brain remains unclear. We analyzed the temporal organization of male rat hippocampal population spiking to identify potential substrates for temporally flexible representations. We examined activity both during locomotion and during memory-associated population events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). We found that spiking during SWRs is rhythmically organized with higher event-to-event variability than spiking during locomotion-associated population events. Decoding analyses using clusterless methods further indicate that a similar spatial experience can be replayed in multiple SWRs, each time with a different rhythmic structure whose periodicity is sampled from a log-normal distribution. This variability increases with experience despite the decline in SWR rates that occurs as environments become more familiar. We hypothesize that the variability in temporal organization of hippocampal spiking provides a mechanism for storing experiences with various degrees of specificity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One of the most remarkable properties of memory is its flexibility: the brain can retrieve stored representations at varying levels of detail where, for example, we can begin with a memory of an entire extended event and then zoom in on a particular episode. The neural mechanisms that support this flexibility are not understood. Here we show that hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, which mark the times of memory replay and are important for memory storage, have a highly variable temporal structure that is well suited to support the storage of memories at different levels of detail.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortico-Striatal Control over Adaptive Goal-Directed Responding Elicited by Cues Signaling Sucrose Reward or Punishment</a></h4>

              
                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been associated with the expression of adaptive and maladaptive behavior elicited by fear-related and drug-associated cues. However, reported effects of mPFC manipulations on cue-elicited natural reward-seeking and inhibition thereof have been varied, with few studies examining cortico-striatal contributions in tasks that require adaptive responding to cues signaling reward and punishment within the same session. The current study aimed to better elucidate the role of mPFC and NAc subdivisions, and their functional connectivity in cue-elicited adaptive responding using a novel discriminative cue responding task. Male Long&ndash;Evans rats learned to lever-press on a VR5 schedule for a discriminative cue signaling reward, and to avoid pressing the same lever in the presence of another cue signaling punishment. Postacquisition, prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) areas of the mPFC, NAc core, shell, PL-core, or IL-shell circuits were pharmacologically or chemogenetically inhibited while animals performed under (1) nonreinforced (extinction) conditions, where the appetitive and aversive cues were presented in alternating trials alone or as a compound stimulus; and (2) reinforced conditions, whereby cued responding was accompanied by associated outcomes. PL and IL inactivation attenuated nonreinforced and reinforced goal-directed cue responding, whereas NAc core and shell inactivation impaired nonreinforced responding for the appetitive, but not aversive cue. Furthermore, PL-core and IL-shell inhibition disinhibited nonreinforced but not reinforced cue responding. Our findings implicate the mPFC as a site of confluence of motivationally significant cues and outcomes, and in the regulation of nonreinforced cue responding via downstream NAc targets.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to discriminate and respond appropriately to environmental cues that signal availability of reward or punishment is essential for survival. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in adaptive and maladaptive behavior elicited by fear-related and drug-associated cues. However, less is known about the role they play in orchestrating adaptive responses to natural reward and punishment cues within the same behavioral task. Here, using a novel discriminative cue responding task combined with pharmacological or chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC, NAc and mPFC-NAc circuits, we report that mPFC is critically involved in responding to changing cued response-outcomes, both when the responses are reinforced, and nonreinforced. Furthermore, the mPFC coordinates nonreinforced discriminative cue responding by suppressing inappropriate responding via downstream NAc targets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cross-Frequency Brain Network Dynamics Support Pitch Change Detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>Processing auditory sequences involves multiple brain networks and is crucial to complex perception associated with music appreciation and speech comprehension. We used time-resolved cortical imaging in a pitch change detection task to detail the underlying nature of human brain network activity, at the rapid time scales of neurophysiology. In response to tone sequence presentation to the participants, we observed slow inter-regional signaling at the pace of tone presentations (2-4 Hz) that was directed from auditory cortex toward both inferior frontal and motor cortices. Symmetrically, motor cortex manifested directed influence onto auditory and inferior frontal cortices via bursts of faster (15-35 Hz) activity. These bursts occurred precisely at the expected latencies of each tone in a sequence. This expression of interdependency between slow/fast neurophysiological activity yielded a form of local cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling in auditory cortex, which strength varied dynamically and peaked when pitch changes were anticipated. We clarified the mechanistic relevance of these observations in relation to behavior by including a group of individuals afflicted by congenital amusia, as a model of altered function in processing sound sequences. In amusia, we found a depression of inter-regional slow signaling toward motor and inferior frontal cortices, and a chronic overexpression of slow/fast phase-amplitude coupling in auditory cortex. These observations are compatible with a misalignment between the respective neurophysiological mechanisms of stimulus encoding and internal predictive signaling, which was absent in controls. In summary, our study provides a functional and mechanistic account of neurophysiological activity for predictive, sequential timing of auditory inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory sequences are processed by extensive brain networks, involving multiple systems. In particular, fronto-temporal brain connections participate in the encoding of sequential auditory events, but so far, their study was limited to static depictions. This study details the nature of oscillatory brain activity involved in these inter-regional interactions in human participants. It demonstrates how directed, polyrhythmic oscillatory interactions between auditory and motor cortical regions provide a functional account for predictive timing of incoming items in an auditory sequence. In addition, we show the functional relevance of these observations in relation to behavior, with data from both normal hearing participants and a rare cohort of individuals afflicted by congenital amusia, which we considered here as a model of altered function in processing sound sequences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spectral Fingerprints of Cortical Neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pupil size has been established as a versatile marker of noradrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulation, which has profound effects on neuronal processing, cognition, and behavior. However, little is known about the cortical control and effects of pupil-linked neuromodulation. Here, we show that pupil dynamics are tightly coupled to temporally, spectrally, and spatially specific modulations of local and large-scale cortical population activity in the human brain. We quantified the dynamics of band-limited cortical population activity in resting human subjects using magnetoencephalography and investigated how neural dynamics were linked to simultaneously recorded pupil dynamics. Our results show that pupil-linked neuromodulation does not merely affect cortical population activity in a stereotypical fashion. Instead, we identified three frontal, precentral, and occipitoparietal networks, in which local population activity with distinct spectral profiles in the theta, beta, and alpha bands temporally preceded and followed changes in pupil size. Furthermore, we found that amplitude coupling at ~16 Hz in a large-scale frontoparietal network predicted pupil dynamics. Our results unravel network-specific spectral fingerprints of cortical neuromodulation in the human brain that likely reflect both the causes and effects of neuromodulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain function is constantly affected by modulatory neurotransmitters. Pupil size has been established as a versatile marker of noradrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulation. However, because the cortical correlates of pupil dynamics are largely unknown, fundamental questions remain unresolved. Which cortical networks control pupil-linked neuromodulation? Does neuromodulation affect cortical activity in a stereotypical or region-specific fashion? To address this, we quantified the dynamics of cortical population activity in human subjects using magnetoencephalography. We found that pupil dynamics are coupled to highly specific modulations of local and large-scale cortical activity in the human brain. We identified four cortical networks with distinct spectral profiles that temporally predicted and followed pupil size dynamics. These effects likely reflect both the cortical control and effect of neuromodulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mixed Selectivity in the Cerebellar Purkinje-Cell Response during Visuomotor Association Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although the cerebellum has been traditionally considered to be exclusively involved in motor control, recent anatomic and clinical studies show that it also has a role in reward-processing. However, the way in which the movement-related and the reward-related neural activity interact at the level of the cerebellar cortex and contribute toward learning is still unclear. Here, we studied the simple spike activity of Purkinje cells in the mid-lateral cerebellum when 2 male monkeys learned to associate a right or left-hand movement with one of two visual symbolic cues. These cells had distinctly different discharge patterns between an overtrained symbol&ndash;hand association and a novel symbol&ndash;hand association, responding in association with the movement of both hands, although the kinematics of the movement did not change between the two conditions. The activity change was not related to the pattern of the visual symbols, the movement kinematics, the monkeys' reaction times, or the novelty of the visual symbols. The simple spike activity changed throughout the learning process, but the concurrent complex spikes did not instruct that change. Although these neurons also have reward-related activity, the reward-related and movement-related signals were independent. We suggest that this mixed selectivity may facilitate the flexible learning of difficult reinforcement learning problems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellum receives both motor-related and reward-related information. However, it is unclear how these two signals interact at the level of cerebellar cortex and contribute to learning nonmotor skills. Here we show that in the mid-lateral cerebellum, the reward information is encoded independently from the motor information such that during reward-based learning, only the reward information carried by the Purkinje cells inform learning while the motor information remains unchanged with learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Consolidation of Sleep-Dependent Appetitive Memory Is Mediated by a Sweet-Sensing Circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep is a universally conserved physiological state which contributes toward basic organismal functions, including cognitive operations such as learning and memory. Intriguingly, organisms can sometimes form memory even without sleep, such that <I>Drosophila</I> display sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory in an olfactory appetitive training paradigm. Sleep-dependent memory can be elicited by the perception of sweet taste, and we now show that a mixed-sex population of flies maintained on sorbitol, a tasteless but nutritive substance, do not require sleep for memory consolidation. Consistent with this, silencing sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons in fed flies triggers a switch to sleep-independent memory consolidation, whereas activating sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons results in the formation of sleep-dependent memory in starved flies. Sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory relies on distinct subsets of reward signaling protocerebral anterior medial dopaminergic neurons (PAM DANs) such that PAM-&beta;'2mp DANs mediate memory in fed flies whereas PAM-&alpha;1 DANs are required in starved flies. Correspondingly, we observed a feeding-dependent calcium increase in PAM-&beta;'2mp DANs, but not in PAM-&alpha;1 DANs. Following training, the presence of sweet sugars recruits PAM-&beta;'2mp DANs, whereas tasteless medium increases calcium in PAM-&alpha;1 DANs. Together, this work identifies mechanistic underpinnings of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, in particular demonstrating a role for the processing of sweet taste reward signals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep is essential for encoding and consolidating memories, but animals must often suppress sleep for survival. Consequently, <I>Drosophila</I> have evolved sleep-independent consolidation that allows retention of essential information without sleep. In the presence of food, sleep is required for memory, but mechanisms that transmit signals from food cues to regulate the need for sleep in memory are largely unknown. We found that sweet-sensing neurons drive the recruitment of specific reward signaling dopaminergic neurons to establish sleep-dependent memory. Conversely, in the absence of a sweet stimulus, different neurons are activated within the same dopaminergic cluster for sleep-independent memory consolidation. Therefore, the processing of sleep-dependent memory relies on the presence of sweet sugars that signal through reward circuitry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Divergent Histopathological Networks of Frontotemporal Degeneration Proteinopathy Subytpes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Network analyses inform complex systems such as human brain connectivity, but this approach is seldom applied to gold-standard histopathology. Here, we use two complimentary computational approaches to model microscopic progression of the main subtypes of tauopathy versus TDP-43 proteinopathy in the human brain. Digital histopathology measures were obtained in up to 13 gray matter (GM) and adjacent white matter (WM) cortical brain regions sampled from 53 tauopathy and 66 TDP-43 proteinopathy autopsy patients. First, we constructed a weighted non-directed graph for each group, where nodes are defined as GM and WM regions sampled and edges in the graph are weighted using the group-level Pearson's correlation coefficient for each pairwise node comparison. Additionally, we performed mediation analyses to test mediation effects of WM pathology between anterior frontotemporal and posterior parietal GM nodes. We find greater correlation (i.e., edges) between GM and WM node pairs in tauopathies compared with TDP-43 proteinopathies. Moreover, WM pathology strongly correlated with a graph metric of pathology spread (i.e., node-strength) in tauopathies (<I>r</I> = 0.60, <I>p</I> &lt; 0.03) but not in TDP-43 proteinopathies (<I>r</I> = 0.03, <I>p</I> = 0.9). Finally, we found mediation effects for WM pathology on the association between anterior and posterior GM pathology in FTLD-Tau but not in FTLD-TDP. These data suggest distinct tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies may have divergent patterns of cellular propagation in GM and WM. More specifically, axonal spread may be more influential in FTLD-Tau progression. Network analyses of digital histopathological measurements can inform models of disease progression of cellular degeneration in the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we uniquely perform two complimentary computational approaches to model and contrast microscopic disease progression between common frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) proteinopathy subtypes with similar clinical syndromes during life. Our models suggest white matter (WM) pathology influences cortical spread of disease in tauopathies that is less evident in TDP-43 proteinopathies. These data support the hypothesis that there are neuropathologic signatures of cellular degeneration within neurocognitive networks for specific protienopathies. These distinctive patterns of cellular pathology can guide future efforts to develop tissue-sensitive imaging and biological markers with diagnostic and prognostic utility for FTLD. Moreover, our novel computational approach can be used in future work to model various neurodegenerative disorders with mixed proteinopathy within the human brain connectome.</p>

                Introduction: This study investigates the impact of informative prior on Bayesian structural equation model (BSEM) with heteroscedastic error structure. A major drawback of homogeneous error structure is that, in most studies the underlying assumption of equal variance across observation is often unrealistic, hence the need to consider the non-homogenous error structure. Methods: Updating appropriate informative prior, four different forms of heteroscedastic error structures were considered at sample sizes 50, 100, 200 and 500. Results: The results show that both posterior predictive probability (PPP) and log likelihood are influenced by the sample size and the prior information, hence the model with the linear form of error structure is the best. Conclusions: The study has been able to address sufficiently the problem of heteroscedasticity of known form using four different heteroscedastic conditions, the linear form outperformed other forms of heteroscedastic error structure thus can accommodate any form of data that violates the homogenous variance assumption by updating appropriate informative prior. Thus, this approach provides an alternative approach to the existing classical method which depends solely on the sample information.

                Background: Ayres Sensory Integration (ASI) is widely employed by occupational therapists working with clients who experience challenges in sensory integration, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is a dearth of research examining the feasibility of ASI outside of Western nations. This study documented the barriers associated with ASI in Saudi Arabia and assessed whether the intervention could improve process and participation skills. Methods: Single-Subject experimental design was used. The participant was a 4-year-old girl with ASD from Saudi Arabia. Data were gathered on sensory processing, motor skills, and participation in activities of daily living. The study used semi-structured interviews and assessments (Sensory Integration and Praxis Tests, the Sensory Processing Measure-Preschool, and the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-2) to develop goals, identify outcome measures, and plan an ASI intervention. Results: Despite the limited availability of resources (e.g., toys, treatment spaces) and Arabic measures, improvements were observed on motor and sensory tasks and in occupational performance. Conclusion: ASI that adheres to the ASI fidelity tool can be of value for Saudi Arabian children with ASD. Additionally, the study provides a stepping-stone to further research for occupational therapists in Saudi Arabia working with children with ASD.

                Synthetic lethal interactions (SLIs), genetic interactions in which the simultaneous inactivation of two genes leads to a lethal phenotype, are promising targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer, as exemplified by the recent success of PARP inhibitors in treating BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. We present SL-Cloud, a new component of the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC), that provides an integrated framework of cloud-hosted data resources and curated workflows to enable facile prediction of SLIs. This resource addresses two main challenges related to SLI inference: the need to wrangle and preprocess large multi-omic datasets and the availability of multiple comparable prediction approaches. SL-Cloud enables customizable computational inference of SLIs and testing of prediction approaches across multiple datasets. We anticipate that cancer researchers will find utility in this tool for discovery of SLIs to support further investigation into potential drug targets for anticancer therapies.

                <p>by Alessio Gravina, Jennifer L. Wilson, Davide Bacciu, Kevin J. Grimes, Corrado Priami</p>

Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder, leading to both physical and social morbidity. Worldwide 1% of the population is struggling with the disease, with 100,000 new cases annually only in the United States. Despite its importance, the goal of finding effective treatments for schizophrenia remains a challenging task, and previous work conducted expensive large-scale phenotypic screens. This work investigates the benefits of Machine Learning for graphs to optimize drug phenotypic screens and predict compounds that mitigate abnormal brain reduction induced by excessive glial phagocytic activity in schizophrenia subjects. Given a compound and its concentration as input, we propose a method that predicts a score associated with three possible compound effects, i.e., reduce, increase, or not influence phagocytosis. We leverage a high-throughput screening to prove experimentally that our method achieves good generalization capabilities. The screening involves 2218 compounds at five different concentrations. Then, we analyze the usability of our approach in a practical setting, i.e., prioritizing the selection of compounds in the SWEETLEAD library. We provide a list of 64 compounds from the library that have the most potential clinical utility for glial phagocytosis mitigation. Lastly, we propose a novel approach to computationally validate their utility as possible therapies for schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mechanistic basis for multidrug resistance and collateral drug sensitivity conferred to the malaria parasite by polymorphisms in PfMDR1 and PfCRT</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah Heckmatt Shafik, Sashika Natasha Richards, Ben Corry, Rowena Elizabeth Martin</p>

Polymorphisms in the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> multidrug resistance protein 1 (<i>pfmdr1</i>) gene and the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> chloroquine resistance transporter (<i>pfcrt</i>) gene alter the malaria parasite’s susceptibility to most of the current antimalarial drugs. However, the precise mechanisms by which PfMDR1 contributes to multidrug resistance have not yet been fully elucidated, nor is it understood why polymorphisms in <i>pfmdr1</i> and <i>pfcrt</i> that cause chloroquine resistance simultaneously increase the parasite’s susceptibility to lumefantrine and mefloquine—a phenomenon known as collateral drug sensitivity. Here, we present a robust expression system for PfMDR1 in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes that enables direct and high-resolution biochemical characterizations of the protein. We show that wild-type PfMDR1 transports diverse pharmacons, including lumefantrine, mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin, piperaquine, amodiaquine, methylene blue, and chloroquine (but not the antiviral drug amantadine). Field-derived mutant isoforms of PfMDR1 differ from the wild-type protein, and each other, in their capacities to transport these drugs, indicating that PfMDR1-induced changes in the distribution of drugs between the parasite’s digestive vacuole (DV) and the cytosol are a key driver of both antimalarial resistance and the variability between multidrug resistance phenotypes. Of note, the PfMDR1 isoforms prevalent in chloroquine-resistant isolates exhibit reduced capacities for chloroquine, lumefantrine, and mefloquine transport. We observe the opposite relationship between chloroquine resistance-conferring mutations in PfCRT and drug transport activity. Using our established assays for characterizing PfCRT in the <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte system and in live parasite assays, we demonstrate that these PfCRT isoforms transport all 3 drugs, whereas wild-type PfCRT does not. We present a mechanistic model for collateral drug sensitivity in which mutant isoforms of PfMDR1 and PfCRT cause chloroquine, lumefantrine, and mefloquine to remain in the cytosol instead of sequestering within the DV. This change in drug distribution increases the access of lumefantrine and mefloquine to their primary targets (thought to be located outside of the DV), while simultaneously decreasing chloroquine’s access to its target within the DV. The mechanistic insights presented here provide a basis for developing approaches that extend the useful life span of antimalarials by exploiting the opposing selection forces they exert upon PfCRT and PfMDR1.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Early Predictors of Clinical and MRI Outcomes Using LASSO in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to identify predictors in common between different clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing predictive models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 704 patients from our center seen at MS onset, measuring 37 baseline demographic, clinical, treatment, and MRI predictors, and 10-year outcomes. Our primary aim was identifying predictors in common among clinical outcomes: aggressive MS, benign MS, and secondary-progressive (SP)MS. We also investigated MRI outcomes: T2 lesion volume (T2LV) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The performance of the full 37-predictor model was compared with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-selected model of predictors in common between each outcome by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full 37-predictor model was highly predictive of clinical outcomes: in-sample AUC was 0.91 for aggressive MS, 0.81 for benign MS, and 0.81 for SPMS. After variable selection, 10 LASSO-selected predictors were in common between each clinical outcome: age, Expanded Disability Status Scale, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory and bowel/bladder signs, timed 25-foot walk ≥6 seconds, poor attack recovery, no sensory attacks, and time-to-treatment. This reduced model had comparable cross-validation AUC as the full 37-predictor model: 0.84 versus 0.81 for aggressive MS, 0.75 versus 0.73 for benign MS, and 0.76 versus 0.75 for SPMS, respectively. In contrast, 10-year MRI outcomes were more strongly influenced by initial T2LV and BPF than clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Early prognostication of MS is possible using LASSO modeling to identify a limited set of accessible clinical features. These predictive models can be clinically usable in treatment decision making once implemented into web-based calculators. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Coastal South India: A 8-year retrospective study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare, benign condition of unknown etiology, presenting as cervical lymphadenitis. Lymphadenopathy is usually tender and maybe associated with systemic symptoms. Despite the extensive literature on this disease, it continues to be misdiagnosed owing to its misleading clinical presentation. Methods: A retrospective hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in tertiary care hospitals from 2011 to 2019. All patients with confirmed KFD diagnosis were included and after ethics committee approval the clinical details and histopathological data was retrieved from the medical records department and analyzed. Results: A total of 67 cases were included. The mean age was 26.9±11.3 years with a female: male ratio of 1.9:1. There were 50 patients with tender cervical lymphadenopathy which was the most common clinical presentation. The mean length and width of palpable lymph nodes were 2.3±1.0 cm and 2.2±0.7 cm respectively. Histology revealed proliferative stage in majority of patients (n=40, 59.7%). Lymphadenopathy resolved in 83.6% within 2 months. There were 42 patients who had complete recovery with symptomatic treatment within a period of 9 months. Conclusions: KFD is prevalent in young, female patients of Asian descent and often presents as tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Early diagnosis with excisional lymph node biopsy is crucial to avoid unnecessary investigations and treatment. Treatment is symptomatic unless complicated, where steroid therapy is considered. KFD has an excellent prognosis with almost no risk of fatality.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Effect of Imaging Markers on Reperfusion Therapy in Basilar Artery Occlusion</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of endovascular therapy (EVT) versus intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO), based on the information of advanced imaging.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data of stroke patients with radiologically confirmed BAO within 24 hours. BAO subjects were categorized into “top-of-the-basilar” syndrome (TOBS) and other types. An initial infarct size of &lt;70ml and a ratio of ischemic tissue to infarct volume of ≥1.8 was defined as “target mismatch.” The primary outcome was a good outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 at 3 months. Propensity score adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity score methods were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 474 BAO patients, 93 (19.6%) were treated with IVT prior to EVT, 91 (19.2%) were treated with IVT alone, 95 (20.0%) were treated with EVT alone, and 195 (41.1%) were treated with antithrombotic therapy. In IPTW analyses, we found no benefit of EVT over IVT for good outcome in either TOBS patients (odds ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88–1.31) or those with other types (odds ratio = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.94–1.36). However, in patients with other types, if there existed a target mismatch, EVT was independently related to good outcome (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17–1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The “target mismatch profile” seems to be a possible candidate selection standard of EVT for those with other types of BAO. Future studies should separate TOBS from other types of BAO, and try to use advanced imaging. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Introduction: In the COVID-19 context, university teachers have had to face the most complex educational demands, psychosocial risks, and the anxiety of responding to limitations in terms of connectivity and fulfillment of academic objectives. To identify the levels of Burnout and anxiety in the COVID-19 context and determine how these levels are manifested in the participating teachers. Methods: This was an analytical non-experimental, cross-sectional study. The population was 150 teachers of the Human Medicine Program of the University of San Martín de Porres, Chiclayo, Peru, and the sample was 66 teachers. The survey consisted of three sections: 1. Informed consent, 2. Maslach's Burnout Inventory, 3. Beck's Anxiety Inventory. Data processing was performed using the SPSS V.27 statistical software and all citations and bibliographical references were processed using Mendeley Desktop 1.19.8. Results: In the variable burnout syndrome, 25% of the participants were in the high level downwards; they present anxiety in 30.30% of the total. It was found that 50% of teachers presented mild to moderate anxiety. Conclusions: the largest number of teachers surveyed present anxiety due to burnout syndrome in the COVID-19 context. Finally, it is found that there is a correlation between anxiety and the sociodemographic variables sex, age, and marital status.

                Genetic and environmental factors during development are involved in autism, and in this issue of Neuron Krüttner et al. (2022) find environment may play a more acute role in modulating autism behavior in a Shank3 exon 21 deletion mutant mouse (Shank3ΔC/ΔC).

                In a recent issue of Nature, Marek et al. (2022) demonstrate that cross-sectional brain-behavior correlations are often small and unreliable without large samples. This observation pushes human neuroscience toward study designs that either maximize sample sizes to detect small effects or maximize effect sizes using focused investigations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bayesian inference of kinetic schemes for ion channels by Kalman filtering</a></h4>

              
                Inferring adequate kinetic schemes for ion channel gating from ensemble currents is a daunting task due to limited information in the data. We address this problem by using a parallelized Bayesian filter to specify hidden Markov models for current and fluorescence data. We demonstrate the flexibility of this algorithm by including different noise distributions. Our generalized Kalman filter outperforms both a classical Kalman filter and a rate equation approach when applied to patch-clamp data exhibiting realistic open-channel noise. The derived generalization also enables inclusion of orthogonal fluorescence data, making unidentifiable parameters identifiable and increasing the accuracy of the parameter estimates by an order of magnitude. By using Bayesian highest credibility volumes, we found that our approach, in contrast to the rate equation approach, yields a realistic uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the Bayesian filter delivers negligibly biased estimates for a wider range of data quality. For some data sets it identifies more parameters than the rate equation approach. These results also demonstrate the power of assessing the validity of algorithms by Bayesian credibility volumes in general. Finally, we show that our Bayesian filter is more robust against errors induced by either analog filtering before analog-to-digital conversion or by limited time resolution of fluorescence data than a rate equation approach.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A discrete parasubthalamic nucleus subpopulation plays a critical role in appetite suppression</a></h4>

              
                Food intake behavior is regulated by a network of appetite-inducing and appetite-suppressing neuronal populations throughout the brain. The parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a relatively unexplored population of neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, has been hypothesized to regulate appetite due to its connectivity with other anorexigenic neuronal populations and because these neurons express Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, following a meal. However, the individual cell types that make up the PSTN are not well characterized, nor are their functional roles in food intake behavior. Here we identify and distinguish between two discrete PSTN subpopulations, those that express tachykinin-1 (PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons) and those that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons), and use a panel of genetically encoded tools in mice to show that PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons play an important role in appetite suppression. Both subpopulations increase activity following a meal and in response to administration of the anorexigenic hormones amylin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup>, but not PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons, reduces the appetite-suppressing effects of these hormones. Consistently, optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons, but not PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons, reduces food intake in hungry mice. PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> and PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons project to distinct downstream brain regions, and stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> projections to individual anorexigenic populations reduces food consumption. Taken together, these results reveal the functional properties and projection patterns of distinct PSTN cell types and demonstrate an anorexigenic role for PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons in the hormonal and central regulation of appetite.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intrinsic excitability mechanisms of neuronal ensemble formation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal ensembles are coactive groups of cortical neurons, found in spontaneous and evoked activity, that can mediate perception and behavior. To understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of ensembles, we co-activated layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mouse visual cortex, in animals of both sexes, replicating <i>in vitro</i> an optogenetic protocol to generate ensembles <i>in vivo</i>. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp pair recordings we find that, after optogenetic or electrical stimulation, coactivated neurons increase their correlated activity, a hallmark of ensemble formation. Coactivated neurons showed small biphasic changes in presynaptic plasticity, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation after a recovery period. Optogenetic and electrical stimulation also induced significant increases in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs, even after single-cell stimulation. In addition, we observed unexpected strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, with increases in membrane resistance and reductions in spike threshold. A pharmacological agent that blocks changes in membrane resistance can revert this effect. These significant increases in excitability may partly generate the observed biphasic synaptic plasticity. We propose that cell-intrinsic changes in excitability are involved in the formation of neuronal ensembles. We propose an 'iceberg' model, by which increased neuronal excitability makes subthreshold connections suprathreshold, enhancing the effect of already existing synapses, and generating a new neuronal ensemble.

We examined peripheral blood of male F344 rats ranging from three to twenty-seven months of age and found significant age-associated changes with distinct leukocyte population shifts. We report CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> population frequency is a strong predictor of healthy aging, generate a model using blood parameters, and find rats with blood profiles that diverge from chronologic age indicate debility; thus, assessments of blood composition may be useful for non-lethal disease profiling or as a surrogate measure for efficacy of aging interventions. Importantly, blood parameters and DNA methylation alterations, defined distinct juncture points during aging, supporting a non-linear aging process. Our results suggest these inflection points are important considerations for aging interventions. Overall, we present rat blood aging metrics that can serve as a resource to evaluate health and the effects of interventions in a model system physiologically more reflective of humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">De novo-designed transmembrane domains tune engineered receptor functions</a></h4>

              
                De novo-designed receptor transmembrane domains (TMDs) present opportunities for precise control of cellular receptor functions. We developed a de novo design strategy for generating programmed membrane proteins (proMPs): single-pass α-helical TMDs that self-assemble through computationally defined and crystallographically validated interfaces. We used these proMPs to program specific oligomeric interactions into a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that we expressed in mouse primary T cells and found that both in vitro CAR T cell cytokine release and in vivo antitumor activity scaled linearly with the oligomeric state encoded by the receptor TMD, from monomers up to tetramers. All programmed CARs stimulated substantially lower T cell cytokine release relative to the commonly used CD28 TMD, which we show elevated cytokine release through lateral recruitment of the endogenous T cell costimulatory receptor CD28. Precise design using orthogonal and modular TMDs thus provides a new way to program receptor structure and predictably tune activity for basic or applied synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Role of oxidation of excitation-contraction coupling machinery in age-dependent loss of muscle function in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Age-dependent loss of body wall muscle function and impaired locomotion occur within 2 weeks in <i>C. elegans</i>; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In humans, age-dependent loss of muscle function occurs at about 80 years of age and has been linked to dysfunction of ryanodine receptor (RyR)/intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) release channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Mammalian skeletal muscle RyR1 channels undergo age-related remodeling due to oxidative overload, leading to loss of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the channel macromolecular complex. This destabilizes the closed state of the channel resulting in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, reduced muscle function, and impaired exercise capacity. We now show that the <i>C. elegans</i> RyR homolog, <i>UNC-68</i>, exhibits a remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation with mammalian RyR channels and similar age-dependent dysfunction. Like RyR1 in mammals <i>UNC-</i>68 encodes a protein that comprises a macromolecular complex which includes the calstabin1 homolog FKB-2 and is immunoreactive with antibodies raised against the RyR1 complex. Further, as in aged mammals, <i>UNC-68</i> is oxidized and depleted of FKB-2 in an age-dependent manner, resulting in 'leaky' channels, depleted SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, reduced body wall muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and age-dependent muscle weakness. FKB-2 <i>(ok3007)-</i>deficient worms exhibit reduced exercise capacity. Pharmacologically induced oxidization of <i>UNC-68</i> and depletion of FKB-2 from the channel independently caused reduced body wall muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Preventing FKB-2 depletion from the <i>UNC-68</i> macromolecular complex using the Rycal drug S107 improved muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and function. Taken together, these data suggest that <i>UNC-68</i> oxidation plays a role in age-dependent loss of muscle function. Remarkably, this age-dependent loss of muscle function induced by oxidative overload, which takes ~2 years in mice and ~80 years in humans, occurs in less than 2-3 weeks in <i>C. elegans</i>, suggesting that reduced antioxidant capacity may contribute to the differences in life span amongst species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Short senolytic or senostatic interventions rescue progression of radiation-induced frailty and premature ageing in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cancer survivors suffer from progressive frailty, multimorbidity and premature morbidity. We hypothesize that therapy-induced senescence and senescence progression via bystander effects is a significant cause of this premature ageing phenotype. Accordingly, the study addresses the question whether a short anti-senescence intervention is able to block progression of radiation-induced frailty and disability in a pre-clinical setting. Male mice were sub-lethally irradiated at 5 months of age and treated (or not) with either a senolytic drug (Navitoclax or dasatinib + quercetin) for 10 days or with the senostatic metformin for 10 weeks. Follow up was for one year. Treatments commencing within a month after irradiation effectively reduced frailty progression (p&lt;0.05) and improved muscle (p&lt;0.01) and liver (p&lt;0.05) function as well as short-term memory (p&lt;0.05) until advanced age with no need for repeated interventions. Senolytic interventions that started late, after radiation-induced premature frailty was manifest, still had beneficial effects on frailty (p&lt;0.05) and short-term memory (p&lt;0.05). Metformin was similarly effective as senolytics. At therapeutically achievable concentrations metformin acted as a senostatic neither via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, nor via improvement of mitophagy or mitochondrial function, but by reducing non-mitochondrial ROS production via NOX4 inhibition in senescent cells. Our study suggests that the progression of adverse long-term health and quality-of-life effects of radiation exposure, as experienced by cancer survivors, might be rescued by short-term adjuvant anti-senescence interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Generation of vascularized brain organoids to study neurovascular interactions</a></h4>

              
                Brain organoids have been used to recapitulate the processes of brain development and related diseases. However, the lack of vasculatures, which regulate neurogenesis and brain disorders, limits the utility of brain organoids. In this study, we induced vessel and brain organoids respectively, and then fused two types of organoids together to obtain vascularized brain organoids. The fused brain organoids were engrafted with robust vascular network-like structures, and exhibited increased number of neural progenitors, in line with the possibility that vessels regulate neural development. Fusion organoids also contained functional blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-like structures, as well as microglial cells, a specific population of immune cells in the brain. The incorporated microglia responded actively to immune stimuli to the fused brain organoids and showed ability of engulfing synapses. Thus, the fusion organoids established in this study allow modeling interactions between the neuronal and non-neuronal components <i>in vitro</i>, in particular the vasculature and microglia niche.

                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity adjusts the strength of synapses to restrain neuronal activity within a physiological range. Postsynaptic GKAP controls the bidirectional synaptic scaling of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) however how chronic activity triggers postsynaptic protein remodeling to downscale synaptic transmission is barely understood. Here we report that the microtubule-dependent kinesin motor KIF21B interacts with GKAP and likewise enters dendritic spines in a myosin Va- and activity-dependent manner. We observed that under conditions of chronic activity KIF21B regulates actin dynamics in spines, triggers spine removal of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, and mediates homeostatic synaptic downscaling of AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC amplitudes. Our data highlight a myosin-kinesin interaction that enables the entry of the microtubule-dependent motor KIF21B into actin-rich spine compartments. A slow actin turnover rate might be beneficial for efficient protein removal from excitatory synapses, suggesting a functional role of KIF21B in a GKAP- and AMPA receptor-dependent mechanism, underlying homeostatic downscaling of neuronal firing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multivariate Analysis of PET Pharmacokinetic Parameters</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: In positron emission tomography (PET) quantification, multiple pharmacokinetic parameters are typically estimated from each time activity curve. Conventionally, all but the parameter of interest are discarded before performing subsequent statistical analysis. However, we assert that these discarded parameters also contain relevant information which can be exploited to improve the precision and power of statistical analyses on the parameter of interest. Properly taking this into account can thereby draw more informative conclusions without collecting more data. Methods: By applying a hierarchical multifactor multivariate Bayesian approach, all estimated parameters from all regions can be analysed at once. We refer to this method as PuMBA (Parameters undergoing Multivariate Bayesian Analysis). We simulated patient-control studies with different radioligands, varying sample sizes and measurement error to explore its performance, comparing the precision, statistical power, false positive rate and bias of estimated group differences relative to univariate analysis methods. Results: We show that PuMBA improves the statistical power for all examined applications relative to univariate methods without increasing the false positive rate. PuMBA improves the precision of effect size estimation, and reduces the variation of these estimates between simulated samples. Furthermore, we show that PuMBA yields performance improvements even in the presence of substantial measurement error. Remarkably, owing to its ability to leverage information shared between pharmacokinetic parameters, PuMBA even shows greater power than conventional univariate analysis of the true binding values from which the parameters were simulated. Across all applications, PuMBA exhibited a small degree of bias in the estimated outcomes, however this was small relative to the variation in estimated outcomes between simulated datasets. Conclusion: PuMBA improves the precision and power of statistical analysis of PET data without requiring the collection of additional measurements. This makes it possible to study new research questions in both new and previously collected data. PuMBA therefore holds great promise for the field of PET imaging.

                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a non-Hebbian synaptic mechanism that adjusts synaptic strength to maintain network stability while achieving optimal information processing. Among the molecular mediators shown to regulate this form of plasticity, synaptic signaling through retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor, RAR, has been shown to be critically involved in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic transmission in both hippocampus and sensory cortices. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism through which postsynaptic RA and RAR regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release during prolonged synaptic inactivity at excitatory synapses. We show that RAR binds to a subset of dendritically sorted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA splice isoforms and represses their translation. The RA-mediated translational de-repression of postsynaptic BDNF results in the retrograde activation of presynaptic Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors, facilitating presynaptic homeostatic compensation through enhanced presynaptic release. Together, our study illustrates a RA-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling pathway through which postsynaptic protein synthesis during synaptic inactivity drives compensatory changes at presynaptic site.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A pro-oxidant combination of resveratrol and copper down-regulates multiple biological hallmarks of ageing and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Several hundred billion to a trillion cells die in the body every day, and cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) that are released from them enter into the extracellular compartments of the body, including into the circulation. We have earlier reported that cfChPs can readily enter into healthy cells to damage their DNA, activate apoptotic pathways and induce inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that repeated lifelong assault on healthy cells by cfChPs is the underlying cause of ageing, and that the ageing process could be retarded by deactivating cfChPs. The latter can be effected by oxygen radicals that are generated upon admixing the nutraceuticals resveratrol (R) and copper (Cu). Using confocal microscopy and antibodies against DNA and histone we detected copious presence of extra-cellular cfChPs in brain of ageing mice, and observed that these were eradicated following prolong oral administration of small quantities of R-Cu. Eradication of cfChPs was associated with down-regulation of several biological hallmarks of ageing in brain cells which included reduction in: 1) telomere attrition, 2) amyloid deposition, 3) DNA damage, 4) apoptosis, 5) inflammation, 6) senescence, 7) aneuploidy and 8) mitochondrial dysfunction. At a systemic level, R-Cu treatment led to significant reduction in blood levels of glucose, cholesterol and C-reactive protein. These results suggest that cfChPs may be global instigators of ageing and neurodegeneration, and that therapeutic use of R-Cu may help to retard the process of ageing.

                This study was designed to develop and validate a reliable biomarker to predict the progression speed reflecting immune function of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). After establishing the induced microglia model (iMGs) derived from peripheral blood monocytes, comparative studies to find factors related to phagocytic differences between iMGs of patients with rapidly progressive ALS [ALS(R)-iMGs, n = 15] and those of patients with slowly progressive ALS [ALS(S)-iMGs, n = 14] were conducted in the discovery cohort. To validate discovered candidate and whether it could be used as a reliable biomarker predicting the progression speed of ALS, we recruited 132 patients with ALS and 30 age-matched healthy controls as the validation cohort. ALS(R)-iMGs showed impaired phagocytic function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the perturbed phagocytosis in ALS(R)-iMGs was related to the decreased expression of NCKAP1 (NCK-associated protein 1) and NCKAP1 overexpression rescued the impaired phagocytic function. miRNA-214-3p targeting NCKAP1 in ALS-iMGs was correlated with progression speed in the discovery cohort. The validation cohort revealed that plasma miRNA-214-3p levels were significantly increased in ALS patients (p < 0.0001, AUC = 0.839), correlated with disease progression speed (p = 0.0005), and distinguished the rapidly progressive subgroup (Q1) from the slowly progressive (Q4, p = 0.029), respectively. Plasma miRNA-214-3p can predict the progression speed in ALS. Plasma miRNA-214-3p could be used as a simple and easily accessible biomarker for predicting the future progression speed related to phagocytic dysfunction in ALS patients.

In contrast, little is known regarding the expression of GDNF receptors in the formation of the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and its innervation of the larynx during embryogenesis. Differences may suggest therapeutic targets after nerve injury. Study Design: Laboratory experiment. Methods: Rat brainstems at E14, E16, E18, E20, adult (4 animals/timepoint) were sectioned and stained for GDNF receptors: GFR-1, GFR-2, GFR-3, and Ret. Islet1 and ChAT were used as markers for motoneuron cell bodies. Sections were observed using Zeiss Axio Imager M2 Microscope and quantified using Image J. Results: Expression of all four GDNF receptors was identified within the nucleus ambiguus, as well as hypoglossal and facial nuclei of the adult rat brainstem. During rat development, GFR-3 and Ret exhibited upregulation within the nucleus ambiguus at E14 whereas GFR-1 began showing upregulation at E20. GFR-2 exhibited no upregulation at embryonic timepoints. Conclusion: Upregulation of the GDNF receptors within the nucleus ambiguus occur after laryngeal muscles innervation during development and may associated with maturation and maintenance of the neuromuscular synapses of the larynx before and after birth. No differences among ambiguus, hypoglossal, and facial nuclei was observed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task prioritization modulates low frequency EEG dynamics reflecting proactive cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Most neuroscientific studies investigating mental effort apply unspecific effort allocation paradigms. In contrast, the present EEG study targets specific effort allocation during task prioritization. Twenty-eight participants performed a cued number classification task during the retention interval of a working memory task including retrospective cues. One of two possible number classifications was done per trial. Each trial started with a cue indicating which of the two tasks would be more important in the upcoming trial. Subjects were told to engage in both tasks, but to concentrate on the important one. Feedback given at the end of each trial was calculated based on task performance, with scores obtained from the relevant task being tripled. Participants performed significantly better in either task when it was important compared to when not. Task prioritization modulates theta, alpha and beta oscillations, predominantly during task preparation. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that the exact type of the two possible number classifications was decodable, however, decoding accuracy did not depend on task importance. Hemispheric alpha power asymmetries indicating attentional orienting between working memory representations also did not depend on task importance. The findings suggest that task prioritization primarily affects proactive cognitive control on a superordinate level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A potent and selective inhibitor for the modulation of MAGL activity in the neurovasculature</a></h4>

              
                Chronic inflammation and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are key pathological hallmarks of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. Major drivers of these pathologies include pro-inflammatory stimuli such as prostaglandins, which are produced in the central nervous system by the oxidation of arachidonic acid in a reaction catalyzed by the cyclooxygenases COX1 and COX2. Monoacylglycerol lipase hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid signaling lipid 2-arachidonyl glycerol, enhancing local pools of arachidonic acid in the brain and leading to cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin production and neuroinflammation. Monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitors were recently shown to act as effective anti-inflammatory modulators, increasing 2-arachidonyl glycerol levels while reducing levels of arachidonic acid and prostaglandins, including PGE2 and PGD2. In this study, we characterized a novel, highly selective, potent and reversible monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor (MAGLi 432) in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced blood-brain barrier permeability and in both human and mouse cells of the neurovascular unit: brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes. We confirmed the expression of monoacylglycerol lipase in specific neurovascular unit cells in vitro, with pericytes showing the highest expression level and activity. However, MAGLi 432 did not ameliorate lipopolysaccharide-induced blood-brain barrier permeability in vivo or reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Our data confirm monoacylglycerol lipase expression in mouse and human cells of the neurovascular unit and provide the basis for further cell-specific analysis of MAGLi 432 in the context of blood-brain barrier dysfunction caused by inflammatory insults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hybrid offspring of C57BL/6J mice exhibit improved properties for neurobehavioral research</a></h4>

              
                C57BL/6 is the most commonly used mouse strain in neurobehavioral research, serving as a background for multiple transgenic lines. However, C57BL/6 exhibit behavioral and sensorimotor disadvantages that worsen with age. We bred FVB/NJ females and C57BL/6J males to generate first-generation hybrid offspring, (FVB/NJ x C57BL/6J)F1. The hybrid mice exhibit reduced anxiety-like behavior, improved learning, and enhanced long-term spatial memory. In contrast to both progenitors, older hybrids maintain sensorimotor performance and exhibit improved long-term memory. The hybrids are larger than C57BL/6J, exhibiting enhanced running behavior on a linear track during freely-moving electrophysiological recordings. Hybrids exhibit typical rate and phase coding of space by CA1 pyramidal cells. Hybrids generated by crossing FVB/NJ females with transgenic males of a C57BL/6 background support optogenetic neuronal control in neocortex and hippocampus. The hybrid mice pro-vide an improved model for neurobehavioral studies combining complex behavior, electrophysiology, and genetic tools readily available in C57BL/6 mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced cognitive interference during visuomotor tasks may cause eye-hand dyscoordination</a></h4>

              
                In complex visuomotor tasks, such as cooking, people make many saccades to continuously search for items before and during reaching movements. These tasks require use of short-term memory and task-switching (e.g., switching search between vegetables and spices). Cognitive load may affect visuomotor performance by increasing the demands on mental processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex, but mechanisms remain unclear. It is also unclear how patients with neurological injuries, e.g., stroke survivors, manage greater cognitive loads during visuomotor tasks. Using the Trail-Making Test, we have previously shown that stroke survivors make many more saccades, which are associated limb movements that are less smooth and slower. In this test, participants search for and make reaching movements towards twenty-five numbers and letters. It has a simple variant (Trails-A), and a cognitively challenging variant (Trails-B) that requires alphanumeric switching. The switching makes the task gradually harder as the Trails-B trial progresses (greater cognitive load). Here, we show that stroke survivors and healthy controls made many more saccades and had longer fixations as the Trails-B trial progressed. In addition, reaching speed slowed down for controls in Trails-B. We propose a mechanism where enhanced cognitive load may reduce inhibition from the prefrontal cortex and disinhibit the ocular motor system into making more saccades. These additional saccades may subsequently slow down motor function by disrupting the visual feedback loops used to control limb movements. These findings augment our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin cognitive interference dynamics when visual, ocular, and limb motor systems interact in visuocognitive motor tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single trial variability in neural activity during a working memory task: A window into multiple distinct information processing sequences</a></h4>

              
                Successful encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of information stored in working memory requires persistent coordination of activity among multiple brain regions. It is generally assumed that the pattern of such coordinated activity remains constant for a given task, and therefore to account for noisy data, multiple trials of the same task are performed, and the neural response is averaged across trials to generate an event-related potential (ERP). However, here we show that from trial to trial, the neuronal activity recorded with electroencephalogram (EEG) is actually spatially and temporally diverse, conflicting with the assumption of a single pattern of coordinated response for a given task. We develop a data-driven classification method based on community detection to identify trials with unique spatial and temporal activity and establish that variability in neuronal activity among single time-locked trials arises from the presence of distinct forms of stimulus dependent synchronized activity (i.e., ERPs). The patterns of neuronal activity among trials are limited to a few distinct clusters, or subtypes, that are spatially and temporally distinct and associated with differences in decision-making processes. These results demonstrate that differences in the patterns of neural activity during working memory tasks represent fluctuations in the engagement of distinct brain regions and cognitive processes, suggesting that the brain can choose from multiple mechanisms to perform a given task.

                Brain activity as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) gives the illusion of intractably high dimensionality, rife with collection and biological noise. Nonlinear dimensionality reductions like UMAP, tSNE, and PHATE have proven useful for high-throughput biomedical data, but have not been extensively used in fMRI, which is known to reflect the redundancy and co-modulation of neural population activity. Here we take the manifold-geometry preserving method PHATE and extend it for use in brain activity timeseries data in a method we call temporal PHATE (T-PHATE). We observe that in addition to the intrinsically lower dimensionality of fMRI data, it also has significant autocorrelative structure that we can exploit to faithfully denoise the signal and learn brain activation manifolds. We empirically validate T-PHATE on three fMRI tasks and show that T-PHATE manifolds improve visualization fidelity, stimulus feature classification, and neural event segmentation. T-PHATE demonstrates impressive improvements over previous cutting-edge approaches to understanding the nature of cognition from fMRI and bodes potential applications broadly for high-dimensional datasets of temporally-diffuse processes.

                Exploration of genome organization and function in the HIV infected brain is critical to aid in the development of treatments for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and HIV cure strategies. Here, we generated a resource comprised of single nuclei transcriptomics, complemented by cell-type-specific Hi-C chromosomal conformation (3D genome) and viral integration site sequencing (IS-seq) in frontal brain tissues from individuals with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), HIV-infected people without encephalitis (HIV+), and HIV uninfected (HIV-) controls. We observed profound 3D genomic reorganization of open/repressive (A/B) compartment structures encompassing 6.4% of the HIVE microglial genome that was associated with transcriptomic reprogramming, including down-regulation of homeostasis and synapse-related functions and robust activation of interferon signaling and cell migratory pathways. HIV RNA was detected in 0.003% of all nuclei in HIVE brain, predominantly in the most activated microglia where it ranked as the second most highly expressed transcript. Microglia from HIV+ brains showed, to a lesser extent, similar transcriptional alterations. IS-seq recovered 1,221 insertion events in glial nuclei that were enriched for chromosomal domains newly mobilized into a permissive chromatin environment in HIVE microglia. Brain and peripheral myeloid cell integration revealed a preference overall for transcription-permissive chromatin, but robust differences in the frequency of recurrent insertions, intergenic integration, and enrichment for pre-integration complex-associated factors at integration sites. Our resource highlights critical differences in the genomic patterns of HIV infection in brain versus blood and points to a dynamic interrelationship between inflammation-associated 3D genome remodeling and successful integration in brain.

                Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the gene encoding the huntingtin (Htt) protein, with mutant Htt protein subsequently forming aggregates within the brain. Mutant Htt is a current target for novel therapeutic strategies for HD, however, the lack of translation from preclinical research to disease-modifying treatments highlights the need to improve our understanding of the role of Htt protein in the human brain. This study aims to undertake a high-throughput screen of 12 candidate antibodies against various sequences along the Htt protein to characterize Htt distribution and expression in post-mortem human brain tissue microarrays (TMAs). Immunohistochemistry was performed on middle temporal gyrus TMAs comprising of up to 28 HD and 27 age-matched control cases, using 12 antibodies specific to various sequences along the Htt protein. From this study, six antibodies directed to the Htt N-terminus successfully immunolabelled human brain tissue. The Htt aggregates and Htt protein expression levels for the six successful antibodies were subsequently quantified with high-throughput analysis. Htt aggregates were detected in HD cases using antibodies MAB5374, MW1, and EPR5526, despite no change in overall Htt protein expression compared to control cases, suggesting a redistribution of Htt into aggregates in HD. Significant associations were found between the number of Htt aggregates and both age of disease onset, and CAG repeat length in HD. However, the number of Htt aggregates did not correlate with the degree of striatal degeneration or the degree of cortical neuron loss. Together, these results suggest that longer CAG repeat lengths correlate with Htt aggregation in the HD human brain, and Htt cortical aggregate deposition is associated with the onset of clinical symptoms. This study also reinforces that antibodies MAB5492, MW8, and 2B7 which have been utilized to characterize Htt in animal models of HD are not specific for Htt in human brain tissue, thereby highlighting the need for validated means of Htt detection to support drug development for HD.

                Network analysis provides new and important insights into the function of complex systems such as the brain by examining structural and functional networks constructed from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and Electro/Magnetoencephalography (E/MEG) data. Although network models can shed light on cognition and pathology, questions remain regarding the importance of these findings, due in part to the reproducibility of the core measurements and subsequent modeling strategies. In order to ensure that results are reproducible, we need a better understanding of within- and between-subject variability over long periods of time. Here, we analyze a longitudinal, 8 session, multi-modal (dMRI, and simultaneous EEG-fMRI), and multiple task imaging data set. We first investigate the reproducibility of individual brain connections and network measures and find that across all modalities, within-subject reproducibility is higher than between-subject reproducibility, reaffirming the ability to detect individual differences in network structure in both structural and functional human brain networks. We see high variability in the reproducibility of pairwise connections between brain regions, but observe that in EEG-derived networks, during both rest and task, alpha-band connectivity is consistently more reproducible than networks derived from other frequency bands. Further, reproducible connections correspond to strong connections. Structural networks show a higher reliability in network statistics than functional networks, and certain measures such as synchronizability and eigenvector centrality are consistently less reliable than other network measures across all modalities. Finally, we find that structural dMRI networks outperform functional networks in their ability to identify individuals using a fingerprinting analysis. Our results highlight that functional networks likely reflect state-dependent variability not present in structural networks, and that the analysis of either structural or functional networks to study individual differences should depend on whether or not one wants to take into account state dependencies of the observed networks.

                Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the Transcription Factor 4 gene (TCF4). One pathobiological process caused by Tcf4 mutation is a cell autonomous reduction in oligodendrocytes (OLs) and myelination. In this study, we show that clemastine is effective at restoring myelination defects in a PTHS mouse model. In vitro, clemastine treatment reduced excess oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and normalized OL density. In vivo, two-week intraperitoneal administration of clemastine also normalized OPC and OL density in the cortex of Tcf4 mutant mice and appeared to increase the number of axons undergoing myelination, as EM imaging of the corpus callosum showed a significant increase in uncompacted myelin. Importantly, this treatment paradigm resulted in functional rescue by improving electrophysiology and behavior. Together, these results provide preclinical evidence that remyelination therapies may be beneficial in PTHS and potentially other neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by demyelination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single cell transcriptomic profiling of tauopathy in a novel 3D neuron-astrocyte coculture model</a></h4>

              
                The use of iPSC derived brain organoid models to study neurodegenerative disease has been hampered by a lack of systems that accurately and expeditiously recapitulate pathogenesis in the context of neuron-glial interactions. Here we report development of a system, termed AstTau, which propagates toxic human tau oligomers in iPSC derived neuron-astrocyte spheroids. The AstTau system develops much of the neuronal and astrocytic pathology observed in tauopathies including misfolded, phosphorylated, oligomeric, and fibrillar tau, strong neurodegeneration, and reactive astrogliosis. Single cell transcriptomic profiling combined with immunochemistry characterizes a model system that can more closely recapitulate late-stage changes in adult neurodegeneration. The transcriptomic studies demonstrate striking changes in neuroinflammatory and heat shock protein (HSP) chaperone systems in the disease process. Treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor PU-H71 was used to address the putative dysfunctional HSP epichaperome and produced a strong reduction of pathology and neurodegeneration, highlighting the potential of AstTau as a rapid and reproducible tool for drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Right inferior frontal cortex damage impairs the initiation of inhibitory control, but not its implementation</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory control is one of the most important control functions in the human brain. Much of our understanding of its neural basis comes from seminal work showing that lesions to the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) increase stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), a latent variable that expresses the speed of inhibitory control. However, recent work has identified substantial limitations of the SSRT method. Notably, SSRT is confounded by trigger failures: stop-signal trials in which inhibitory control was never initiated. Such trials inflate SSRT, but are typically indicative of attentional, rather than inhibitory deficits. Here, we used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to identify stop-signal trigger failures in human rIFC lesion patients, non-rIFC lesion patients, and healthy comparisons. Furthermore, we measured scalp-EEG to detect {beta}-bursts, a neurophysiological index of inhibitory control. rIFC lesion patients showed a more than five-fold increase in trigger failure trials and did not exhibit the typical increase of stop-related frontal {beta}-bursts. However, on trials in which such {beta}-bursts did occur, rIFC patients showed the typical subsequent upregulation of {beta} over sensorimotor areas, indicating that their ability to implement inhibitory control, once triggered, is intact. These findings suggest that the role of rIFC in inhibitory control has to be fundamentally reinterpreted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurotransmitter content heterogeneity within an interneuron class shapes inhibitory transmission at a central synapse</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter content is deemed the most basic defining criterion for neuronal classes, contrasting with the intercellular heterogeneity of many other molecular and functional features. Here we show, in the adult mouse brain, that neurotransmitter content variegation within a neuronal class is a component of its functional heterogeneity. Most Golgi cells (GoCs), the well-defined class of cerebellar interneurons inhibiting granule cells (GrCs), contain cytosolic glycine, accumulated by the neuronal transporter GlyT2, and GABA in various proportions. To assess the functional consequence of this neurotransmitter variation, we paired GrCs recordings with optogenetic stimulations of single GoCs, which preserve the intracellular transmitter mixture. We show that the strength and decay kinetics of GrCs IPSCs, which are entirely mediated by GABAA receptors are negatively correlated to the presynaptic expression of GlyT2 by GoCs. We isolate a slow spillover component of GrCs inhibition that is also affected by the expression of GlyT2, leading to a 56 % decrease in relative charge. Acute manipulations of cytosolic GABA and glycine supply recapitulate the modulation of IPSC charge, supporting the hypothesis that presynaptic loading of glycine negatively impact the GABAergic transmission in mixed interneurons through a competition for vesicular filling. Our results suggest that heterogeneity of neurotransmitter supply within the GoC class may provide a presynaptic mechanism to tune the gain of the stereotypic granular layer microcircuit, thereby expanding the realm of possible dynamic behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multifaceted role of RIMBP2 in promoting hearing in murine cochlear hair cells</a></h4>

              
                In peripheral, the mammalian cochlea is a remarkable sensory apparatus, owning to its outer and inner hair cells (OHCs and IHCs) that amplify and transmit auditory signals to the brain, respectively. Rab3-interacting molecular (RIM) binding protein 2 (RIMBP2) is widely expressed in receptor cells and neurons, specifically in the active zones for exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs), but its exact functions in the cochlea are not very well understood. We therefore generated a Rimbp2 knockout mouse model (Rimbp2-/-), which exhibited severely impaired hearing with not only elevated hearing thresholds but also increased latencies and reduced amplitudes in the Wave I of their auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Consistent with the threshold elevation, we found significant loss of OHCs, likely through apoptosis, in the Rimbp2-/- cochlea. Consistent with changes observed in the ABR Wave I, we found greatly reduced exocytosis, both spontaneously and upon stimulation, in Rimbp2-/- IHCs. Specifically, our patch-clamp analysis on IHCs and postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) revealed not only reduced readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs but also reduced sustained release rate, along with complete blockade of fast endocytosis, in Rimbp2-/- IHCs. Lastly, with immunostaining of whole-mounted cochleae, we found that while the number of ribbon synapses in Rimbp2-/- IHCs was unchanged, their localization moved subtly but significantly towards the basal pole of IHCs. Taken together, we uncovered an unexpected role of RIMBP2 for OHC survival and a more extensive role in promoting IHC exocytosis than previously believed.

                Lifelong social impairments are common in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), and preclinical studies have identified gestational day (G)12 as a vulnerable timepoint for producing social deficits following binge-level PAE. While moderate (m)PAE also produces social impairments, the long-term neuroadaptations underlying them are poorly understood. Activity of the projection from the basolateral amygdala to the prelimbic cortex (BLA[-&gt;]PL) leads to social avoidance, and the PL alone is implicated in negative social behaviors, making each of these potential candidates for the neuroadaptations underlying mPAE-induced social impairments. To examine this, we first established that G12 mPAE produced sex-specific social impairments lasting into adulthood. We then chemogenetically inhibited the BLA[-&gt;]PL using Clozapine N-Oxide (CNO) during adult social testing. This revealed that CNO reduced social investigation in control males, but had no effect on mPAE males or females of either exposure, indicating that mPAE attenuated the role of this projection in regulating male social behavior and highlighting one potential mechanism by which mPAE affects male social behavior more severely. Using whole-cell electrophysiology, we also examined mPAE-induced changes to PL pyramidal cell physiology and determined that mPAE reduced the excitability of these cells, likely due to increased suppression by inhibitory interneurons. Overall, this work identified two mPAE-induced neuroadaptations that last into adulthood and which may underlie the sex-specific vulnerability to mPAE-induced social impairments. Future research is necessary to expand upon how these circuits modulate both normal and pathological social behavior, and to identify sex-specific mechanisms leading to differential vulnerability in males and females.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing ketamine-induced dissociation using human intracranial neurophysiology: brain dynamics, network activity, and interactions with propofol</a></h4>

              
                Subanesthetic doses of ketamine produce rapid and sustained anti-depressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Unfortunately, the usefulness of ketamine as a treatment is limited by its potential for abuse because of psychotropic side effects such as dissociation. Understanding the brain dynamics and the neural circuits involved in ketamine's effects could lend insight into improved therapies for depression with fewer adverse effects. It is believed that ketamine acts via NMDA receptor and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels to produce changes in oscillatory brain dynamics. Here we show, in humans, a detailed description of the principal oscillatory changes in cortical and subcortical structures by administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Using recordings from intracranial electrodes, we found that ketamine increased gamma oscillations within prefrontal cortical areas and the hippocampus--structures previously implicated in ketamine's antidepressant effects. Furthermore, our studies provide direct evidence of a ketamine-induced 3 Hz oscillation in posteromedial cortex that has been proposed as a mechanism for its dissociative effects. By analyzing changes in neural oscillations after the addition of propofol, whose GABAergic activity antagonizes ketamine's NMDA-mediated disinhibition alongside a shared HCN1 inhibitory effect, we identified brain dynamics that could be attributed to NMDA-mediated disinhibition versus HCN1 inhibition. Overall, our results imply that ketamine engages different neural circuits in distinct frequency-dependent patterns of activity to produce its antidepressant and dissociative sensory effects. These insights may help guide the development of novel brain dynamic biomarkers and therapeutics for depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cardiac interoception is enhanced in blind individuals</a></h4>

              
                Blind individuals have superior abilities to perform perceptual tasks that rely on exteroceptive information, since visual deprivation is associated with massive cross-modal plasticity. However, it is unknown whether neuroplasticity after visual loss also affects interoception, i.e., the sensations arising from one's inner organs that convey information about the physiological state of the body. Herein, we examine the influence of blindness on cardiac interoception, which is an interoceptive submodality that has important links to emotional processing and bodily self-awareness. We tested 36 blind and 36 age- and sex-matched sighted volunteers and examined their cardiac interoceptive ability using a well-established heartbeat counting task. The results showed that blind individuals had significantly higher accuracy in perceiving their heartbeat than did individuals in a matched sighted control group. In contrast, there were no significant differences between the groups in the metacognitive dimensions of cardiac interception or the purely physiological measurement of heart rate, thereby underscoring that the improved accuracy likely reflects a superior perceptual sensitivity to cardiac interoceptive signals in blind individuals. We conclude that visual deprivation leads to enhanced interoception, which has important implications for the study of the extent of massive cross-modal plasticity after visual loss, understanding emotional processing in blind individuals, and learning how bodily self-awareness can develop and be sustained in the absence of visual experience.

	<p>Childhood is a period of extensive cortical and neural development. Among other things, axons in the brain gradually become more myelinated, promoting the propagation of electrical signals between different parts of the brain, which in turn may facilitate skill development. Myelin is difficult to assess in vivo, and measurement techniques are only just beginning to make their way into standard imaging protocols in human cognitive neuroscience. An approach that has been proposed as an indirect measure of cortical myelin is the T1w/T2w ratio, a contrast that is based on the intensities of two standard structural magnetic resonance images. Although not initially intended as such, researchers have recently started to use the T1w/T2w contrast for between-subject comparisons of cortical data with various behavioral and cognitive indices. As a complement to these earlier findings, we computed individual cortical T1w/T2w maps using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (N = 960; 449 females; aged 8.9 to 11.0 years) and related the T1w/T2w maps to indices of cognitive ability; in contrast to previous work, we did not find significant relationships between T1w/T2w values and cognitive performance after correcting for multiple testing. These findings reinforce existent skepticism about the applicability of T1w/T2w ratio for inter-individual comparisons.</p>

	<p>Although children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) show impaired precision grip control due to a sensory-motor integration deficit, their spatial instability (such as changes in force direction and object roll during a precision grip task) is unclear. Herein, we investigated the spatial instability in the precision grip force control of children with poor manual dexterity. We divided 66 school-aged children who performed a precision gripping and lifting of heavy- or lightweight objects into those with low manual dexterity (n = 11) and those with high manual dexterity (n = 55) as revealed by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (2nd edition). The group and weight effects were then determined. The results revealed that the total trajectory lengths of the center of pressure (COP) were longer in the lightweight object data of the children in the low-manual-dexterity group and were related to the children&amp;amp;rsquo;s grip force. The low-manual-dexterity group also showed a shifted COP position from the center of the object in the medial&amp;amp;ndash;lateral direction and in the object roll regardless of the object&amp;amp;rsquo;s weight; these were closely related in both weights&amp;amp;rsquo; tests. These results demonstrated that children with poor manual dexterity show spatial instability and different adaptations to the weight of objects during a precision grip task. Further studies are needed to determine whether these findings would be replicated in children with a diagnosis of DCD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Understanding the long-term effects of stress on brain function is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of depression. The BALB/c mouse strain has high susceptibility to stress and is thus an effective model for depression. The long-term effects of repeated social defeat stress (SDS) on BALB/c mice, however, are not clear. Here, we investigated the effects of repeated SDS in male BALB/c mice over the subsequent two weeks. Some defeated mice immediately exhibited social avoidance, whereas anxiety-like behavior was only evident at later periods. Furthermore, defeated mice segregated into two groups based on the level of social avoidance, namely, avoidant and nonavoidant mice. The characteristic of avoidance or nonavoidance in each individual was not fixed over the two weeks. In addition, we developed a semi-automated method for analyzing c-Fos expression in the mouse brain to investigate the effect of repeated SDS on brain activity more than two weeks after the end of the stress exposure. Following social interaction, c-Fos expression was reduced in several brain regions in the defeated mice compared with control mice. The correlation of c-Fos expression among these brain areas, with exception of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and central amygdala (CeA), was increased in defeated mice, suggesting increased synchrony. Notably, c-Fos expression in the lateral habenula (LHb) was different between mice that exhibited social avoidance from immediately after the repeated SDS and those that exhibited social avoidance only at later periods. These observations provide insight into the long-term effects of social stress on behavior and brain activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">SMART: An Open-Source Extension of WholeBrain for Intact Mouse Brain Registration and Segmentation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mapping immediate early gene (IEG) expression across intact mouse brains allows for unbiased identification of brain-wide activity patterns underlying complex behaviors. Accurate registration of sample brains to a common anatomic reference is critical for precise assignment of IEG-positive ("active") neurons to known brain regions of interest (ROIs). While existing automated voxel-based registration methods provide a high-throughput solution, they require substantial computing power, can be difficult to implement and fail when brains are damaged or only partially imaged. Additionally, it is challenging to cross-validate these approaches or compare them to any preexisting literature based on serial coronal sectioning. Here, we present the open-source R package SMART (Semi-Manual Alignment to Reference Templates) that extends the WholeBrain R package framework to automated segmentation and semi-automated registration of intact mouse brain light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) datasets. The SMART package was created for novice programmers and introduces a streamlined pipeline for aligning, registering, and segmenting LSFM volumetric datasets across the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, using a simple "choice game" and interactive menus. SMART provides the flexibility to register whole brains, partial brains or discrete user-chosen images, and is fully compatible with traditional sectioned coronal slice-based analyses. We demonstrate SMART&rsquo;s core functions using example datasets and provide step-by-step video tutorials for installation and implementation of the package. We also present a modified iDISCO+ tissue clearing procedure for uniform immunohistochemical labeling of the activity marker Fos across intact mouse brains. The SMART pipeline, in conjunction with the modified iDISCO+ Fos procedure, is ideally suited for examination and orthogonal cross-validation of brain-wide neuronal activation datasets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Shifting the water paradigm from social good to economic good and the state’s role in fulfilling the right to water [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The problem currently faced is the availability of water to meet human needs, which is decreasing in number. On the one hand, there is a view that water is a commodity (economic good) while on the other hand says that water is a social good. These different approaches influence state policies in water management on how the state regulates and manages water in fulfilling the right to water for their citizens. The right to water implies that everyone should have access to water without discrimination. Methods: This study uses a normative approach, which reviewing water as social economic issues and adjusting by the legal rules relating to water and human rights. Results: Changing the paradigm of water from social goods to economic goods, this change is also based on water scarcity faced not only by one country but has become a global issue. Economic issues are the main topic in the global conversation, by reducing water in a social perspective, which should be the responsibility of the state as Article 33 paragraph (3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia 1945. This legal basis has logical consequences for the state to keep water as a social commodity oriented to the public interest. Conclusions: The pattern of economic approaches through privatization in the management of water resources has resulted in co-opting water as a collective source of life. Water is forced in commercial motivation rather than as a constitutive element that regulates water for the "sustainability of collective life" and "to the maximum extent possible for the prosperity of society." The fulfillment of the right to water by the state certainly cannot be directly fulfilled, the important thing is that there are progressive efforts to fulfill it, with community involvement in the management of water resources, especially local communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Establishment of diagnostic reference level and radiation dose variation in head & neck and pelvis treatment planning in radiation therapy computed tomography [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This observational study aims to establish a discrepancy in the radiation dose distributed for head & neck and pelvis localization in Computed Tomography (CT) imaging in radiation therapy. The objective and need of the current study are to establish Diagnostic Reference Level (DRL) for head & neck and pelvic CT protocols in Radiation Therapy planning and compare them with other regional, national and international DRL. The established DRL will be used to find further optimized DRL for Radiation Therapy Computed Tomography (RTCT). Methods: A total of 120 patients with Head & Neck cancers and 90 patients with pelvic cancers to be treated with radiotherapy prescribed for the RTCT with ages above 18 years old and above were included in the current study. The advanced Philips 16 slice big bore CT acquired all the CT simulation images. Results: Third quartile standards of Dose Length Product and effective dose for Head & Neck, and pelvis were 790.65mGy.cm, 2.45179 mSv, and 999.7 mGy.cm, 15.48mSv respectively. The third quartile CTDIvol value for the same order of procedure is 17.6 mGy. Tube voltage of 120kVp and 300mAs and used for radiotherapy planning. Conclusion: The first regional Radiation therapy Computed tomography simulation Diagnostic reference levels have been projected and deliver a platform for dose evaluation and optimization due to the limited number of papers on radiation therapy, computed tomography, and diagnostic reference levels. Comparison with previously available RT CT diagnostic reference levels indicated some radiation dose variation, so exposure parameters should be revised and improved.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">‘Comparison and correlation of the maxillary sinus dimensions in various craniofacial patterns: A CBCT Study’ [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND  To compare and correlate the maxillary sinus dimensions and basal bone height among various facial patterns using CBCT for advanced diagnosis and treatment planning in Orthodontics. METHODS 66 CBCT images within age group of 18-30 years were divided into horizontal (Group 1), average (Group 2) and vertical (Group 3) facial growth patterns. Maxillary sinus dimensions were compared and correlated in all three groups. The sinus height and basal bone height were recorded at 3 locations-between 1st premolar and 2nd premolar (PM1-PM2), between 2nd premolar and 1st Molar (PM2-M1) and between 1st and 2nd molar (M1-M2). RESULTS Overall reduction in sinus height and significantly reduced sinus volume was seen in Group-1. Longest maxillary sinus height in M1-M2 region and shortest in PM1-PM2 region was seen in Group-3. The basal bone height in PM1-PM2 region was significantly longer in Group-3 than in Group-1(p<.05).Shortest basal bone height in M1-M2 region was seen in Group-3. A significant negative correlation was seen between the maxillary sinus height and the basal bone height in Group-1 and Group-3(p<.05). CONCLUSION There is a correlation between the maxillary sinus height and basal bone height with that of facial pattern which needs to be considered during orthodontic treatment planning and while carrying out facial growth modification procedures in younger patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Translation, validity and reliability of the Danish version of the Adolescent Insomnia Questionnaire [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Adolescent Insomnia Questionnaire (AIQ), English version, is the only validated screening measure developed specifically to identify insomnia symptoms in adolescents. To date, no specific screening tool for adolescent insomnia is present in Danish language. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the AIQ in a sample of Danish adolescents. Methods: The AIQ underwent a process of forward-backward translation and pilot testing. Subsequently, data were collected at baseline and two-week follow-up from adolescents aged 11-19, who completed both the AIQ and an available adult measure of insomnia (the Athens Insomnia Scale, AIS). The internal consistency, test-retest reliability and convergent validity were assessed. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify the latent factors underlying the questionnaire. Results: At baseline 185 adolescents (18% males and 82% females, mean age 16.0 years) and 102 (55.1%) at two-week follow-up completed the questionnaires. The AIQ showed excellent internal consistency for the total score (Cronbach's a: 0.88) and good convergent validity with the AIS total score (Pearson’s correlation value= 0.86, P<0.001). The test-retest reliability at two weeks was very satisfactory (ICC coefficient = 0.89; 95% CI 0.84, 0.92). Results from the exploratory factor analysis identified a three-model solution corresponding to the same three-model solution identified within the original development sample. Conclusions: The Danish version of the AIQ demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency, test-retest reliability and validity, which supports its use as a screening tool for the identification of insomnia symptoms in adolescents, including Danish-speaking adolescents.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Buprenorphine-precipitated fentanyl withdrawal treated with high-dose buprenorphine [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the mu-opioid receptor, is an increasingly prescribed medication for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder. When this medication is taken in the context of active opioid use, precipitated withdrawal can occur, leading to acute onset of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Fentanyl complicates use of buprenorphine, as it slowly releases from body stores and can lead to higher risk of precipitated withdrawal. Objectives: Describe the successful management of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal from fentanyl with high doses of buprenorphine. We seek to highlight how no adverse effects occurred in this patient and illustrate his stable transition to outpatient treatment. Case report: We present the case of a patient with severe opioid use disorder who presented in moderately severe opioid withdrawal after taking non-prescribed buprenorphine-naloxone which precipitated opioid withdrawal from daily fentanyl use. He was treated with high doses of buprenorphine, 148 mg over the first 48 hours, averaging 63 mg per day over four days. The patient reported rapid improvement in withdrawal symptoms without noted side effects and was able to successfully taper to 16 mg twice daily by discharge. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine at high doses for treatment of precipitated withdrawal. While other options include symptomatic withdrawal management, initiating methadone or less researched options like ketamine, utilizing buprenorphine can preserve or re-establish confidence in this life-saving medication. This case also increases the previously documented upper boundary on buprenorphine dosing for withdrawal and should provide additional confidence in its use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Module intervention to improve involvement and practices of fathers towards infant and young child feeding (IYCF) in Coastal South India - a randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Overall child health depends on nutrition and its related practices. At the family level, responsibility of child feeding lies with both parents. There is no uniform and systematic way to determine and assess the practices of fathers in infant and young child feeding (IYCF). Also, there is a paucity of evidence related to interventions for fathers in improving their practices and involvement in the feeding of their infant or young child (aged less than two years). Methods: This was a community-based randomized control trial, conducted among 120 fathers with infants and/or young children in Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka. Fathers with poor level of involvement and practices towards IYCF, during the initial assessment, were included as the study participants. For the intervention, a module in the flipchart format was developed. Simple randomization technique was used to allot the participants into two groups - intervention and control. Participants in the intervention group received module intervention, in addition to the care which they received routinely, and the control group received only routine care. The participants in the intervention group were paid a monthly visit to implement the module, for six months. The post-intervention assessment was done at the end of 6 months. Results: A total of 117 participants provided post-intervention data. The mean age was 34.7 (+/- 5.48) years in the intervention group and 34.36 years (+/- 5.26) in the control group. The intervention group had a significant improvement in knowledge, attitude, and practice components at 6 months. We noted higher change scores for the intervention group (p<0.05). Conclusions: The extent of increase in practice and involvement in child feeding was clearly higher among the intervention group. The module developed was successful in improving the practices of fathers in feeding their infants and young children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">How did the US and UK markets react to the COVID-19 vaccines’ announcements? A preliminary assessment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major public health and economic disruption. At the same time, a pandemic allows researchers to assess market efficiency; namely, whether, to what extent, and how swiftly stock markets incorporated information related to COVID-19. Soon after the outbreak of the pandemic, research on this front was conducted, with a particular focus on the United States of America (US) market. However, new major events linked to the pandemic have unfolded: a number of vaccines were announced and authorized. The research available in relation to market efficiency relative to vaccine availability is scant. The aim of this study was to assess market efficiency hypotheses with regards to the US and United Kingdom (UK) markets, investigating the impact of the promising news of the vaccines’ successful trials and, subsequently, their authorization. Methods: This work considered data from the S&P500 for the US market and the FTSE100 for the UK market. The time interval considered ranged from the date positive results of vaccines’ trials were first announced, 18 November 2020, until up to two months after the vaccines’ authorization that happened later in December 2020. For both markets, we analyzed the daily returns, cumulative returns, standard deviation and average returns. Results: In both the US and the UK, there was a positive effect of the vaccines’ announcements in terms of increase in the daily returns. However, the standard deviation was not found to increase substantially, notwithstanding the increase in the COVID-19 cases worldwide and the potential lockdown in several countries, as well as the fear from new coronavirus strains that the new vaccines might not be protect against. Conclusions: Whilst both markets displayed an increase in the average return following the vaccines’ announcements, the UK market seemed to reflect vaccines’ announcements faster than the US market.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Potential impact of great lockdown on students’ knowledge, attitude and practices towards the COVID-19 outbreak [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite variation in the types of COVID-19 vaccines and genetic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, using preventive measures remains the first choice to reduce risks associated with COVID-19 infection. Methods: This cross-sectional study highlights students’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward SARS-CoV-2 infection during the lockdown. The study was conducted at the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Data was collected from 43 male preparatory students via an online self-structured questionnaire. Knowledge level was determined using mean scores, while chi-square and t-tests were performed to detect significant differences between groups. Results: Males aged 17–20 displayed better knowledge regarding COVID-19 than other groups (t = 2.03, p = 0.049). Most participants recognized the typical symptoms and transmission routes; 93% indicated they viewed social distancing as a crucial preventive measure. Following lockdown, a 1.7-fold increase in the number of participants who believed that mask-wearing was an effective preventive measure was observed; however, 37.2% did not trust this practice. There was a 2.2-fold increase in the number of participants who took part in awareness programs during lockdown. Students’ knowledge increased from 73.2% to 81.5% following the lockdown. Specifically, mean knowledge regarding the role of contaminated tools in disease transmission increased from 33.7% to 75.5%. After lockdown, 58.1% of participants were anxious and afraid of having contact with their colleagues, while 39.5% missed their classes due to anxiety. Two sources of information impacted students’ knowledge following the lockdown: university studies (t = 2.149, p = 0.038) and friends (t = 2.6, p = 0.013). Conclusions: The findings suggest that IAU preparatory-year students have acceptable knowledge, awareness, and attitudes towards COVID-19 infection. This reflects the impact of media on the improvement in preventive measure uptake. Knowledge of the pandemic may increase if health education programs are designed to target students.

                Background: Herbal medicines are gaining a greater degree of popularity as complementary and alternative medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, there is a lack of data concerning the rationale for and factors influencing their use. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based online study involving 1,621 participants was conducted to explore the effects of magical health beliefs, holistic health beliefs, knowledge, and pro- complementary alternative medicine (CAM) attitudes on herbal medicine use in the Indonesian population. Results: Logistic regression findings showed that knowledge about herbal medicines was independently and positively associated with herbal medicine use to a greater extent than herbal medicine non-use (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval; CI = 1.16 to 1.24). The participants who used herbal medicines had a greater magical health belief score than herbal medicine non-users, with AOR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.06. Moreover, holistic health beliefs and pro-CAM attitudes were also found to be independently associated with herbal medicine use. Conclusion: These findings alert nurses to assess the roles of magical health beliefs, holistic health belief, knowledge, and attitudes toward herbal medicine use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Research in child and adolescent anxiety and depression: treatment uncertainties prioritised by youth and professionals [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A starting point for evaluating the effectiveness of treatments should be to identify evidence gaps. Furthermore, such evaluations should consider the perspectives of patients, clinicians and carers to ensure relevance and potentially influence future research initiatives. Methods: Our approach, inspired by the James Lind Alliance methods, involved three steps. First, we performed a document analysis by identifying interventions and outcomes in two recently published overviews of systematic reviews, which summarised the effects of interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. Second, we surveyed children and adolescents with personal experiences of depression or anxiety as well as clinicians, and asked them to suggest treatments and outcomes associated with uncertainty. Finally, we facilitated a consensus process where clinicians and youth mental health patient representatives were invited to prioritise research uncertainties in separate consensus processes. Results: The survey included 674 respondents who reported a total of 1267 uncertainties. Independent coding by four investigators revealed 134 suggestions for treatments of anxiety, 90 suggestions for treatments of depression, 84 for outcomes of interventions for anxiety and 71 suggestions for outcomes of interventions for depression. Two separate priority setting workshops with eight clinicians and ten youth resulted in four independent top ten priority lists. Conclusion: Top ten lists of treatments and outcome domains of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents was identified by youth and clinicians. The results may influence the research agenda, and ultimately benefit patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smokeless tobacco use and reproductive outcomes among women: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Both smoked and smokeless tobacco use have deleterious effects on most major organ systems including the reproductive system. We conducted a systematic review on smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and reproductive outcomes among women. Methods: We searched Pubmed, ProQuest, Cochrane, Wiley and Emerald databases for studies involving smokeless tobacco use in women with any or a combination of three conditions: infertility, menstrual disorders and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Eligibility criteria included English language publications from 1st January 1990 - 31st October 2020. CADIMA software used for filtering the studies and modified SIGN checklist for the quality assessment. The findings are reported as per the PRISMA guidelines. The AXIS and ROBIN E tool were used for assessment of risk of bias. Results: In total, three studies addressed our research question. Two studies addressed infertility (prospective cohort: n=501, cross sectional: n=192) of which, the cross-sectional study compared the mean cotinine levels between those with infertility, menstrual disorders and PID. This study also explored the association between SLT and PID. PID was the most common gynecological complaint. Women with PID had significantly higher urinary cotinine levels = 24.95±12.259) ng/ ml (p=0.0144). Mean urinary cotinine in women with menstrual complaints was 19.32±10.29 ng/ml.  The other study used population-based sampling of 501 couples who attempted pregnancy (enrolled in the LIFE Study).  Results showed that 9% and 2% (n=28) of men used snuff and chewed tobacco respectively. and  few of the women used smokeless tobacco.  Time to pregnancy was shorter among smokeless tobacco users relative to smokers. Conclusions: Available studies exploring associations between SLT and reproductive outcomes are inconclusive due to limitations in the study methodologies. More studies with robust study designs are required from low- and middle-income countries with high prevalence of SLT use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A pilot study assessing the similarity between core outcome sets and outcomes included in health technology assessments [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Core outcome sets (COS) are an agreed standardised collection of outcomes created with representation from all key stakeholders (such as patients, clinicians, researchers), which should be reported as a minimum for all trials in that corresponding clinical area. There has been little research investigating the use of core outcomes in Health technology assessments (HTAs) and none in non-oncology HTAs. This study aimed to assess the similarity between COS and HTA outcomes. Methods: Ten COS published between 2015 and 2019 were selected, with patient participation taken as a proxy measure for a high quality COS. The INAHTA database was used as a source to identify relevant HTAs, which were accessed through the hyperlinks provided. Outcomes selected for these assessments were categorised as either a specific, partial or no match compared to the COS. An additional cohort of non-oncology HTAs published between 2019 and 2021 were identified from the NICE website and compared against a relevant COS. Results: Six hundred and fifty-one HTAs were matched to the ten COS areas, of which 119 were reviewed. Of a possible 1318 core outcome matches, there were 562 (43%) matches, 413 (31%) specific and 149 (11%) partial. NICE HTA matches against corresponding COS ranged from 44% to 100%, with a total of 78% (73/94) matches, 57 (61%) specific and 16 (17%) partial. Conclusion: Further work is required to promote the awareness and implementation of COS within HTAs. The degree of matching between COS and NICE HTA outcomes is encouraging, demonstrating acceptance of COS by HTA producers.

                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and has been a global public health concern. We report coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 H1N1 Influenza strain in a French patient with pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome.  The patient also had a medical history of pulmonary sarcoidosis with a restrictive ventilatory syndrome and obesity, which would be a supplementary risk to develop a poor outcomes. This case highlights the possible coinfection of two severe SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H1N1 viruses in comorbid patient, which presents a higher risk to extend the care duration. The overlapping clinical features of the two respiratory syndromes is a challenge, and awareness is required to recommend an early differential diagnosis and it’s necessary to adopt the vigilant preventive measures and therapeutic strategies to prevent a deleterious impacts in patients with comorbid factors.

                How LPS attains cytosolic access in vivo is unclear. Vasudevan et al. define a TLR4-independent role for CD14 in the cytosolic localization of LPS, triggering noncanonical inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in vivo. This finding positions CD14 as an integral component of both extracellular and intracellular LPS surveillance pathways.

The resulting cleaved AMPK-α1 accumulates in the nucleus and protects cells against cytotoxicity induced by anticancer agents.

                Instead of eIF4E-regulated ribosome loading, Thompson et al. show capped mRNA translation in HCMV-infected cells becomes reliant upon eIF3d. Depleting eIF3d inhibits HCMV replication, reduces polyribosomes, and restricts virus late gene and host chronic ER stress-induced gene expression. Thus, switching to eIF3d-responsive translation tunes gene expression to support virus replication.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">An extended amygdala-midbrain circuit controlling cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety and reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                Tian et al. show that an elevation of BNSTGABA→midbrain cell activity is related to withdrawal anxiety that manifests after a single cocaine exposure. Inhibition or activation of the BNSTGABA→VTADA→amygdala pathway bidirectionally controls cocaine-induced withdrawal anxiety. Activation of VTADA→amygdala cells is also sufficient to drive robust reinstatement of cocaine-induced place preference.

                Amyloids are protein aggregates associated with age-related diseases. Herod et al. demonstrate that yeast 14-3-3 proteins play critical roles in the clearance of functional amyloid-like assemblies. Additionally, 14-3-3 proteins contribute to global protein aggregate homeostasis. Based on these findings, they propose that 14-3-3 proteins may protect against pathological protein aggregates.
