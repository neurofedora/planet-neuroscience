              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17293">The Sex-Dependent Effects of Psychedelics on Myelination in APOE4 Mice</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several studies have linked myelin abnormalities with neuropsychiatric disorders; others have implicated psychedelics as a potential therapeutic for such conditions. One risk factor for these demyelinating disorders is a mutation in the Apolipoprotein E gene known as APOE4. This variant impedes the cholesterol regulation of oligodendrocytes responsible for the myelination, or insulation, of neurons when compared to the wild-type phenotype. In this work, I advance knowledge of cellular pathways involved in the progression of APOE4-related diseases and elucidate the effects of psychedelics on the brain. Myelin sheaths are vital for maintaining neural pathways, and healthy oligodendrocytes serve as a prerequisite for axonal integrity. Further, the Kaufer Lab has observed significant behavioral differences between male and female APOE4 mice following psychedelic treatment with 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, or DOI, a serotonin receptor ligand. The sex-dependent mechanisms influencing symptom differences and treatment outcomes in AD are unclear, and could be key to developing successful therapeutics for myelin-related issues. I hypothesize that administration of DOI will increase the myelination activity of oligodendrocytes in female APOE4 mice compared with their male counterparts or controls. Preliminary results show a significant increase in MBP in the CA1, or short-term, and CA2, or long term, areas in only female APOE4 mice post-introduction of DOI to the system. This aligns with behavioral data indicating fewer anxiety-related behaviors in female APOE4 mice after DOI administration. These findings reveal distinct biological mechanisms in male and female brain degeneration and suggest potential for sex-specific therapeutics.

Abstract: A long-term goal of Artificial Intelligence is to build a language understanding system that allows a human to collaborate with a physical robot using language that is natural to the human. In this paper we highlight some of the challenges in doing this, and propose a solution that integrates the abilities of a cognitive agent capable of interactive task learning in a physical robot with the linguistic abilities of a large language model. We also point the way to an initial implementation of this approach.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17424">Sequence-to-Sequence Models with Attention Mechanistically Map to the Architecture of Human Memory Search</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past work has long recognized the important role of context in guiding how humans search their memory. While context-based memory models can explain many memory phenomena, it remains unclear why humans develop such architectures over possible alternatives in the first place. In this work, we demonstrate that foundational architectures in neural machine translation -- specifically, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention -- exhibit mechanisms that directly correspond to those specified in the Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model of human memory. Since neural machine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their convergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the functional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to model human memory. Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine translation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both interpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning. We show that our model accounts for both averaged and optimal human behavioral patterns as effectively as context-based memory models. Further, we demonstrate additional strengths of the proposed model by evaluating how memory search performance emerges from the interaction of different model components.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17970">The Relationship between Cognition and Computation: "Global-first" Cognition versus Local-first Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What fundamental research questions are essential for advancing toward brain-like AI or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) capable of performing any intellectual task a human can? Should it be something like the Turing machine (1936), which answers the question "What is computation?" and lays the foundation for the entire field of computer science? Or should it be something like Shannon's mathematical theory of communication (1948), which answers the question "What is information?" and forms the basis for modern communication technology? We believe the key question today is the relationship between cognition and computation (RCC). For example, the widely discussed question "Will artificial intelligence replace the human mind?" is, in essence and in scientific terms, an issue concerning RCC. We have chosen to classify RCC into four categories: 1. The relationship between the primitives of cognition and the primitives of computation. 2. The relationship between the anatomical structure of neural representation of cognition and the computational architecture of artificial intelligence. 3. The relationship between emergents in cognition and emergents in computation. 4. The relationship between the mathematical foundations of cognition and computation.

                arXiv:2506.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptual multistability, observed across species and sensory modalities, offers valuable insights into numerous cognitive functions and dysfunctions. For instance, differences in temporal dynamics and information integration during percept formation often distinguish clinical from non-clinical populations. Computational psychiatry can elucidate these variations, through two primary approaches: (i) Bayesian modeling, which treats perception as an unconscious inference, and (ii) an active, information-seeking perspective (e.g., reinforcement learning) framing perceptual switches as internal actions. Our synthesis aims to leverage multistability to bridge these computational psychiatry subfields, linking human and animal studies as well as connecting behavior to underlying neural mechanisms. Perceptual multistability emerges as a promising non-invasive tool for clinical applications, facilitating translational research and enhancing our mechanistic understanding of cognitive processes and their impairments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17461">Projected Normal Distribution: Moment Approximations and Generalizations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The projected normal distribution, also known as the angular Gaussian distribution, is obtained by dividing a multivariate normal random variable $\mathbf{x}$ by its norm $\sqrt{\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{x}}$. The resulting random variable follows a distribution on the unit sphere. No closed-form formulas for the moments of the projected normal distribution are known, which can limit its use in some applications. In this work, we derive analytic approximations to the first and second moments of the projected normal distribution using Taylor expansions and using results from the theory of quadratic forms of Gaussian random variables. Then, motivated by applications in systems neuroscience, we present generalizations of the projected normal distribution that divide the variable $\mathbf{x}$ by a denominator of the form $\sqrt{\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x} + c}$, where $\mathbf{B}$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix and $c$ is a non-negative number. We derive moment approximations as well as the density function for these other projected distributions. We show that the moments approximations are accurate for a wide range of dimensionalities and distribution parameters. Furthermore, we show that the moments approximations can be used to fit these distributions to data through moment matching. These moment matching methods should be useful for analyzing data across a range of applications where the projected normal distribution is used, and for applying the projected normal distribution and its generalizations to model data in neuroscience.

                arXiv:2506.18314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and data-intensive. We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.

                arXiv:2409.06843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does the human brain encode complex visual information? While previous research has characterized individual dimensions of visual representation in cortex, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how visual information is organized across the full range of neural population activity. Here, analyzing fMRI responses to natural scenes across multiple individuals, we discover that neural representations in human visual cortex follow a remarkably consistent scale-free organization -- their variance systematically decays as a power law, detected across four orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. This scale-free structure appears consistently across multiple visual regions and across individuals, suggesting it reflects a fundamental organizing principle of visual processing. Critically, when we align neural responses across individuals using hyperalignment, we find that these representational dimensions are largely shared between people, revealing a universal high-dimensional spectrum of visual information that emerges despite individual differences in brain anatomy and visual experience. Traditional analysis approaches in cognitive neuroscience have focused primarily on a small number of high-variance dimensions, potentially missing crucial aspects of visual representation. Our results demonstrate that visual information is distributed across the full dimensionality of cortical activity in a systematic way, suggesting we need to move beyond low-dimensional characterizations to fully understand how the brain represents the visual world. This work reveals a new fundamental principle of neural coding in human visual cortex and highlights the importance of examining neural representations across their full dimensionality.

                arXiv:2405.15539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.

                arXiv:2506.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network (FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states, addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests. This work pioneers brain-inspired LLM optimization and is complementary to other works. Besides, it can be generalized to any model and enhance their long-context performance and interpretability without structural overhauls.

                arXiv:2407.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified framework in which consciousness emerges as a cycle-consistent, affectively anchored inference process, recursively structured by the interaction of emotion and cognition. Drawing from information theory, optimal transport, and the Bayesian brain hypothesis, we formalize emotion as a low-dimensional structural prior and cognition as a specificity-instantiating update. This emotion-cognition cycle minimizes joint uncertainty by aligning emotionally weighted priors with context-sensitive cognitive appraisals. Subjective experience thus arises as the informational footprint of temporally extended, affect-modulated simulation. We introduce the Exchangeable Integration Theory of Consciousness (EITC), modeling conscious episodes as conditionally exchangeable samples drawn from a latent affective self-model. This latent variable supports integration, via a unified cause-effect structure with nonzero irreducibility, and differentiation, by preserving contextual specificity across episodes. We connect this architecture to the Bayesian theory of consciousness through Rao-Blackwellized inference, which stabilizes inference by marginalizing latent self-structure while enabling adaptive updates. This mechanism ensures coherence, prevents inference collapse, and supports goal-directed simulation. The formal framework builds on De Finetti's exchangeability theorem, integrated information theory, and KL-regularized optimal transport. Overall, consciousness is reframed as a recursive inference process, shaped by emotion, refined by cognition, stabilized through exchangeability, and unified through a latent self-model that integrates experience across time.

                arXiv:2506.17261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of deep learning applications has intensified the demand for electronic hardware with low energy consumption and fast computing speed. Neuromorphic photonics have emerged as a viable alternative to directly process high-throughput information at the physical space. However, the simultaneous attainment of high linear and nonlinear expressivity posse a considerable challenge due to the power efficiency and impaired manipulability in conventional nonlinear materials and optoelectronic conversion. Here we introduce a parallel nonlinear neuromorphic processor that enables arbitrary superposition of information states in multi-dimensional channels, only by leveraging the temporal encoding of spatiotemporal metasurfaces to map the input data and trainable weights. The proposed temporal encoding nonlinearity is theoretically proved to flexibly customize the nonlinearity, while preserving quasi-static linear transformation capability within each time partition. We experimentally demonstrated the concept based on distributed spatiotemporal metasurfaces, showcasing robust performance in multi-label recognition and multi-task parallelism with asynchronous modulation. Remarkably, our nonlinear processor demonstrates dynamic memory capability in autonomous planning tasks and real-time responsiveness to canonical maze-solving problem. Our work opens up a flexible avenue for a variety of temporally-modulated neuromorphic processors tailored for complex scenarios.

                arXiv:2506.17747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies, porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over 19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74, FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA 0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling (Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science initiatives.

                arXiv:2506.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish" can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the "gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more effective LLM prompting.

                arXiv:2404.12746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in the field of mathematical runtime analysis of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), the performance of MOEAs on discrete many-objective problems is little understood. In particular, the few existing performance guarantees for classic MOEAs on classic benchmarks are all roughly quadratic in the size of the Pareto front.
  In this work, we consider a large class of MOEAs including the (global) SEMO, SMS-EMOA, balanced NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and SPEA2. For these, we prove near-tight runtime guarantees for the four most common benchmark problems OneMinMax, CountingOnesCountingZeros, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump, and this for arbitrary numbers of objectives. Most of our bounds depend only linearly on the size of the largest incomparable set, showing that MOEAs on these benchmarks cope much better with many objectives than what previous works suggested. Most of our bounds are tight apart from small polynomial factors in the number of objectives and length of bitstrings. This is the first time that such tight bounds are proven for many-objective uses of MOEAs. For the runtime of the SEMO on the LOTZ benchmark in $m \ge 6$ objectives, our runtime guarantees are even smaller than the size of the largest incomparable set. This is again the first time that such runtime guarantees are proven.

                arXiv:2410.14031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, predictive modeling of neural responses in the primate visual system has advanced significantly, largely driven by various DNN approaches. These include models optimized directly for visual recognition, cross-modal alignment through contrastive objectives, neural response prediction from scratch, and large language model embeddings.Likewise, different readout mechanisms, ranging from fully linear to spatial-feature factorized methods have been explored for mapping network activations to neural responses. Despite the diversity of these approaches, it remains unclear which method performs best across different visual regions. In this study, we systematically compare these approaches for modeling the human visual system and investigate alternative strategies to improve response predictions. Our findings reveal that for early to mid-level visual areas, response-optimized models with visual inputs offer superior prediction accuracy, while for higher visual regions, embeddings from LLMs based on detailed contextual descriptions of images and task-optimized models pretrained on large vision datasets provide the best fit. Through comparative analysis of these modeling approaches, we identified three distinct regions in the visual cortex: one sensitive primarily to perceptual features of the input that are not captured by linguistic descriptions, another attuned to fine-grained visual details representing semantic information, and a third responsive to abstract, global meanings aligned with linguistic content. We also highlight the critical role of readout mechanisms, proposing a novel scheme that modulates receptive fields and feature maps based on semantic content, resulting in an accuracy boost of 3-23% over existing SOTAs for all models and brain regions. Together, these findings offer key insights into building more precise models of the visual system.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes and present as a promising route towards Physical AI. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This work examines PINNs for the first time in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are gradient-free evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Another exciting track is to cast evolutionary as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models. To substantiate these proposed avenues, we further highlight results from recent literature to showcase the early success of such approaches in addressing the aforementioned challenges in PINN optimization and generalization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12221">Bridging Quantized Artificial Neural Networks and Neuromorphic Hardware</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic hardware aims to leverage distributed computing and event-driven circuit design to achieve an energy-efficient AI system. The name "neuromorphic" is derived from its spiking and local computing nature, which mimics the fundamental activity of an animal's nervous system. In neuromorphic hardware, neurons, i.e., computing cores use single-bit, event-driven data (called spikes) for inter-communication, which differs substantially from conventional hardware. To leverage the advantages of neuromorphic hardware and implement a computing model, the conventional approach is to build spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs replace the nonlinearity part of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the realm of deep learning with spiking neurons, where the spiking neuron mimics the basic behavior of bio-neurons. However, there is still a performance gap between SNNs and their ANN counterparts. In this paper, we explore a new way to map computing models onto neuromorphic hardware. We propose a Spiking-Driven ANN (SDANN) framework that directly implements quantized ANN on hardware, eliminating the need for tuning the trainable parameters or any performance degradation. With the power of quantized ANN, our SDANN ensures a lower bound of implementation performance on neuromorphic hardware. To address the limitation of bit width support on hardware, we propose bias calibration and scaled integration methods. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate that our SDANN achieves exactly the same accuracy as the quantized ANN. Beyond toy examples and software implementation, we successfully deployed and validated our spiking models on real neuromorphic hardware, demonstrating the feasibility of the SDANN framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06236">Zero-Shot NAS via the Suppression of Local Entropy Decrease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.06236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary dynamics.

                arXiv:2506.15121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.

                Understanding the complex three-dimensional structure of cells is crucial across many disciplines in biology and especially in neuroscience. Here, we introduce a set of models including a 3D transformer (SwinUNetR) and a novel 3D self-supervised learning method (WNet3D) designed to address the inherent complexity of generating 3D ground truth data and quantifying nuclei in 3D volumes. We developed a Python package called CellSeg3D that provides access to these models in Jupyter Notebooks and in a napari GUI plugin. Recognizing the scarcity of high-quality 3D ground truth data, we created a fully human-annotated mesoSPIM dataset to advance evaluation and benchmarking in the field. To assess model performance, we benchmarked our approach across four diverse datasets: the newly developed mesoSPIM dataset, a 3D platynereis-ISH-Nuclei confocal dataset, a separate 3D Platynereis-Nuclei light-sheet dataset, and a challenging and densely packed Mouse-Skull-Nuclei confocal dataset. We demonstrate that our self-supervised model, WNet3D – trained without any ground truth labels – achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods, paving the way for broader applications in label-scarce biological contexts.

">Lie Detectors for Face Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Lie detection is important for government law enforcement. Current lie detection methods such as the polygraph test have been found to be unreliable (Meijer et al. 2017). New lie detection technology is currently arising that is based on fMRI; however, single subject tests have only been successful in detecting lies 88% of the time (Langleben et al., 2005; Wild, 2005). One of the main problems with most fMRI-based approaches is that they assume that various acts of deception involve common brain regions, (Ganis et al., 2003). In this work I propose a much more accurate fMRI lie detection method that does not make this assumption and is domain based. In my investigation, rather than trying to localize brain regions that are indicative of lying in general, I localize brain regions that indicate lying specifically about face recognition. In criminal investigations one frequently needs to establish familiar relations between a suspect, victim and/or witness. This type of information can be used as circumstantial evidence in a crime. In this work I propose to use fMRI to detect whether a suspect has any familiarity with an individual face. I find that activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus was a reliable discriminator for face familiarity.

">High-resolution whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in youth at risk for psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Recent developments in acquisition and reconstruction of 3-dimensional magnetic-resonance spectroscopic imaging (3D-MRSI) enable the high-resolution mapping of multiple neurometabolites in the whole-brain, in vivo. Leveraging this capability, we created a voxel-based pipeline that corrects and spatially normalizes whole-brain maps of total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), myo-inositol (Ins), choline compounds, glutamate + glutamine, and creatine + phosphocreatine. We examined a clinical cohort of adolescents and young adults at risk for psychosis (n= 21) (meeting DSM-5 criteria for Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (APS) or Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SCZT)) and age-/sex-matched healthy controls (n =13), as well as an independent non-clinical sample of adolescents (n = 61). We first aimed at assessing the reproducibility of MRSI measures across datasets and scanning sites, then validate the feasibility of a whole-brain voxel-based analyses on 3D-MRSI data and eventually test the sensitivity of this approach. Metabolite distributions showed reproducible regional variation in standard space between the two independent samples and scanning sites (r ranging from 0.82 to 0.99). Relative to controls, at-risk participants exhibited higher tNAA in frontal grey matter; the SCZT subgroup additionally displayed widespread cortical and subcortical Ins elevations compared with both APS and controls. Voxel-based analyses of structural (i.e., gray and white matter volumes or densities) and diffusion (i.e., generalized fractional anisotropy) parameters yielded no significant differences between risk participants and controls. These findings suggest the sensitivity of high-resolution 3D-MRSI for detecting subtle neurometabolic alterations at the group level in the early stages of psychotic disorders. Detailed brain metabolic mapping has the potential to help with early identification of young people at risk for psychosis or other mental disorders.

">Abnormal Elevated Connectivity During Language Processing is Associated with Poor Cognitive Performance in Children with Self-limited Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes</a></h4>

              
                Self-Limited Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (SeLECTS) is associated with language impairments despite seizures originating in the motor cortex, suggesting aberrant cross-network interactions. Here we tested whether functional connectivity in SeLECTS during language tasks predicts language performance. We recorded high-density EEG from right-handed children with SeLECTS (n=31) and age-matched controls (n=32) during verb generation, repetition, and resting tasks. Phonological awareness was assessed using the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing-2. Connectivity between bilateral motor cortices and language regions (the left inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices and their right hemisphere homologues) was measured using weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI). Children with SeLECTS demonstrated significantly elevated connectivity between motor and language regions during language processing. Motor-to-frontal connectivity was higher in SeLECTS during both verb generation and repetition tasks. Frontal-to-temporal connectivity was elevated specifically during verb generation. Higher interhemispheric connectivity (between the left and right hemispheres) during language tasks strongly predicted worse phonological awareness in children with SeLECTS ({beta} = -40 to -61, all p<0.005), but not controls. Together, we found that children with SeLECTS exhibited pathologically elevated connectivity between motor and language networks that was strongly associated with impaired phonological awareness. These findings identify aberrant interhemispheric connectivity as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying language dysfunction and establish EEG-based connectivity measures as a potential biomarker for guiding targeted neuromodulation therapies to treat cognitive impairments in pediatric epilepsy.

     alt="Loss of Postnatal Retinal Input Perturbs Cortical Lamination in the Developing Ferret Visual Cortex"/>
<p>Early loss of visual input results in thickened visual cortex. This study of bilaterally enucleated ferrets localizes thickness differences to deep cortical layers 5/6, and finds they are detectable during the growth phase of cortical development. The thickness difference does not appear to be attributable to differential interneuron numbers.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neuroanatomical development of the visual system is influenced by activity-dependent processes. Removal of retinal input early in development in animal model experiments reproduces several structural characteristics of the primary visual cortex in humans who have been blinded early in life. Yet, many questions regarding how the loss of retinal activity affects the organization and cellular composition of the visual cortex remain to be answered. Here, we report alterations to primary visual cortex development in ferrets over the postnatal day 20 (P20) to P38 age range that arise following bilateral enucleation on P7. Most notably, during this age range, V1 is observed to become thicker in P7 enucleates than in control animals. While this effect recapitulates observations of abnormally thick visual cortex in early blind humans, the observation that the thickness difference is observable by P32, while the cortex is still developing, has implications that run counter to prevailing interpretations of the V1 thickness difference. In order to further characterize the cytoarchitectural development of V1, we quantify the number and distribution of the two largest populations of inhibitory neurons through postnatal development, illustrating how the emergence of visual input–dependent organization displays a unique time course in both controls and enucleates. We observe perturbations to macroscopic anatomical development with only minor effects on the number and distribution of interneurons present throughout late corticogenesis following binocular enucleation. Our results demonstrate that postnatal enucleation can produce substantial and durable alterations to the mature organization of the visual cortex, likely mirroring those occurring in human patients who lose sight early in life. Our findings identify specific cellular and molecular alterations and highlight challenges that will need to be addressed in the design and development of restorative therapeutics.</p>

                <p>Recent research shows that the intention to act on an object alters its neural representation in ways as afforded by underlying sensorimotor processes. For example, the intention to grasp and pick up an object results in representations of the object's weight. But these representations become grasp-specific only immediately before object lift if weight information is relayed through object material. This feature triggers earlier representations regardless of intention probably because material&ndash;weight contingencies are overlearned. In contrast, recently learned weight cues should be recalled deliberately during grasp planning resulting in early grasp-specific representations. Here, we examined how action intentions affect the representation of newly acquired color&ndash;weight contingencies. We recorded electroencephalography while human participants grasped or reached for objects that varied in shape and density as indicated by their color. Multivariate analyses revealed a grasp-specific reactivation of color during planning that was mirrored in beta band. This suggests that task relevancy influences the representation of color such that previously encoded color&ndash;weight contingencies may be reactivated as required for grasping, mediated top-down via working memory. Grasp-specific representations of shape and color were also present in theta band, perhaps reflecting attentional activity. These results provide novel insights into the interplay between cognition and motor planning processes.</p>

                <p>The genetic role and specific effects of primary familial cerebral calcification (PFBC) are still unclear. We aim to analyze bibliometric features in studies related to PFBC, investigate variant detection rates in patients with brain calcifications, and examine the phenotypic characteristics of PFBC patients. A comprehensive search of studies on the genetic effects of PFBC up until December 31, 2024, was conducted across Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. A random-effects meta-analysis combined variant detection rates for genes <I>SLC20A2</I>, <I>PDGFRB</I>, <I>PDGFB</I>, <I>XPR1</I>, <I>MYORG</I>, <I>JAM2</I>, <I>CMPK2</I>, and <I>NAA60</I>. Data on total calcification scores (TCS), age of onset, and the prevalence of various phenotypes in PFBC patients were also aggregated. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's linear regression, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed. Of 1,267 records, 224 were included in the bibliometric analysis. Keywords "primary familial brain calcification" and "<I>SLC20A2</I>" were most prominent. Eighteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, revealing higher variant rates for <I>SLC20A2</I> (16.7%, 95% CI: 10.0&ndash;24.6) and <I>MYORG</I> (16.8%, 95% CI: 0.0&ndash;54.0), which were associated with higher TCS. The average age of onset was 43.69&nbsp;years (95% CI: 36.17&ndash;51.21). Cognitive impairment (45.3%, 95% CI: 35.7&ndash;55.1) and psychiatric symptoms (30.8%, 95% CI: 17.2&ndash;46.2) had relatively higher prevalence rates. No significant publication bias was found (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05), and the sensitivity analysis confirmed the results&rsquo; robustness. <I>SLC20A2</I> and <I>MYORG</I> variants had higher detection rates, with cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms being common in PFBC patients.

                <p>&alpha;-Synuclein is a synaptic protein that accumulates primarily in synucleinopathies and secondarily in certain lysosomal storage disorders. However, its physiological roles in health and disease are not fully understood. In part, this has been hampered by the inability to visualize &alpha;-synuclein and its cellular localization, due to the lack of specific antibodies and faithful reporters. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to generate human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines in which the &alpha;-synuclein (<I>SNCA</I>) gene has been tagged with the short HA peptide either at the N-terminus or C-terminus or with the fluorescent protein mCherry at the C-terminus of the protein. These diverse strategies revealed the C-terminus HA-tag as the best option. C-Terminus HA-tagged &alpha;-synuclein had unchanged protein expression and did not generate degradation by-products. Importantly, we show that following differentiation to neurons, the C-terminus HA-tagged iPSC line had unaffected electrophysiological properties and could be used to visualize accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein upon inhibition of lysosomal function and under physiological protein levels. It is our expectation that this line and tagging approach will be very useful in further studies examining &alpha;-synuclein aggregation and its role in cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</p>

                Background UAV-based power line inspections offer a safer, more efficient alternative to traditional methods, but insulator detection presents key challenges: multiscale object detection and intra-class variance. Insulators vary in size due to UAV altitude and perspective changes, while their visual similarities across types (e.g., glass, porcelain, composite) complicate classification. Methods To address these issues, we introduce APF-YOLO, an enhanced YOLOv8-based model integrating the Adaptive Path Fusion (APF) neck and the Adaptive Feature Alignment Module (AFAM). AFAM balances fine-grained detail extraction for small objects with semantic context for larger ones through local and global pathways by integrating advanced attention mechanisms. This work also introduces the Merged Public Insulator Dataset (MPID), a comprehensive dataset designed for insulator detection, representing diverse real-world conditions such as occlusions, varying scales, and environmental challenges. Results Evaluations on MPID demonstrate that APF-YOLO surpasses state-of-the-art models with different neck configurations, achieving at least a +2.71% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.9 and a +1.24% increase in recall, while maintaining real-time performance in server-grade environments. Although APF-YOLO adds computational requirements, these remain within acceptable limits for real-world applications. Future work will optimize APF-YOLO for edge devices through techniques such as model pruning and lightweight feature extractors, enhancing its adaptability and efficiency. Conclusion Combined with MPID, APF-YOLO establishes a strong foundation for advancing UAV-based insulator detection, contributing to safer and more effective power line monitoring.

Prognostic Score [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aimed to determine the preoperative factors that may contribute to the occurrence of residual stones after X-ray-free ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (XFUS PCNL) and to develop a user-friendly prognostic tool for daily practice. Methods This study developed a scoring system to identify patients with a higher risk of residual stones after XFUS PCNL. A prospective cohort study of patients with XFUS PCNL in an Indonesian tertiary referral hospital was conducted between November 2019 and November 2023. Potential factors were analyzed using (chi-square test), and significant variables were further analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Risk scores were calculated for each patient in the cohort, model discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and model calibration was performed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. Multiple logistic regression analyses with bootstrapped standard errors were used to compare the odds of residual stones. Results This study included a consecutive cohort of 162 patients. The P.O.N.C.O. prognostic score, consisting of five independent risk factors (p-value<0.05), namely, proportion/size, obstruction status, number of stones, contour, and obesity, was then established and calculated for each patient scoring 3.51 ± 2.2 with an average. The scoring model showed excellent discrimination with an AUCs of 0.924 (95%CI 0.87-0.97; P-value<0.001). The model also had good calibration with a non-significant Hosmer–Lemeshow chi-square of P = 0.95. Conclusion This study presents the first prognostic scoring tool for residual stones in XFUS PCNL with good discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility using five easily accessible predictive factors in daily practice

                Despite the increasing exploitation of nanomaterials (NMs) in an array of consumer products, there are uncertainties regarding their potential adverse impact on human health. Investigation of whether NMs activate a pro-inflammatory response is routinely used to assess their toxicity in in vitro and in vivo (rodent) studies. The use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate inflammatory responses to chemicals, pathogens and injury has increased considerably over recent years. Zebrafish have also been used to investigate the role of inflammation in disease pathogenesis and for drug discovery. Availability of transgenic strains which express fluorescent proteins in immune cells (e.g. macrophages and neutrophils) enables the visualization and quantification of immune cell accumulation in the target site(s) of interest. We therefore propose that non protected life stages of transgenic zebrafish have great utility for screening the toxicity of NMs via investigation of inflammatory responses. Indeed, we have successfully used non-protected life stages of transgenic zebrafish with fluorescent neutrophils (TgBAC(mpx:GFP)i114) to investigate inflammatory responses to NMs. The more widespread use of transgenic zebrafish in nanotoxicology could reduce the reliance placed on rodents and thereby promote implementation of the 3Rs principles. As zebrafish continue to grow in popularity it is timely to offer guidance to new users on their use. Here we will reflect on: exposure routes that can adopted  to mimic human/rodent exposure, what transgenic strains and life stages are best suited to investigate inflammatory responses, selection criteria for zebrafish embryos/larvae, the inclusion of appropriate controls, the importance of dose selection and sample size, and how the (inflammatory) response can be quantified. It is hoped that our recommendations will support the development of standard protocols that can be used to assess whether NMs activate inflammatory responses. Importantly, the themes discussed are not restricted to NMs but relevant also to zebrafish application in ecotoxicology or human health focused studies.

                Background Exercise therapy is recommended for patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA) who are candidates for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). How this patient group perceives and experiences a simplified approach to pre-surgical exercise (non-surgical care) with a systematic re-assessment of the need for surgery (surgical care) after exercise has not been well explored. The aim of this study was to explore perceived (before) and experienced (after) facilitators and barriers (determinants) towards 12 weeks of home-based exercise therapy using a simple 1-exercise program in patients with severe knee OA who were eligible for TKA. Methods A qualitative design was employed from 2018 to 2019, involving 10 patients recruited through purposive sampling for semi-structured interviews conducted before and after a 12-week exercise therapy program. The collected data were categorized through inductive content analysis. Results Through abstraction, the data material was condensed into three interrelated categories: 1) Less-is-more unless it is too “less”, 2) Feedback-loops to motivation and adherence, and 3) Comprehensive re-assessment and universal healthcare-support empowers patient-centered care; and six sub-categories. These three categories reflect the complex interplay of barriers and facilitators that impacts the success of home-based exercise programs, highlighting the importance of personalized patient-centered care in this context. Conclusion The determinants of exercise adherence differed among participants, with some determinants serving as facilitators for some but barriers to others. These differences in perceptions and experiences suggest that adherence to the 1-exercise program could be enhanced by accommodating individual preferences. The participants had positive perceptions and experiences of the coordination of non-surgical and surgical care. Knowing that their need for surgery was systematically re-assessed after non-surgical care provided a sense of security and safety. QUADX-1 trial registration identifier: NCT02931058.

                Background Postoperative immobilizatiton for patients with lower extremity fractures causes constipation, which usually affects 50–70% of patients. When it comes to nursing interventions for postoperative constipation, Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy are two possible options. Aim The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage on constipation scores on post-operative lower extremity fractures. Methods A quasi-experimental pre-posttest design without control group design was applied. 30 respondents used simple random sampling technique. The Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) questionnaire was used to assess the patient’s constipation levels before and after the intervention. The data analysis used independent t-test. Results The mean score of constipation of drinking water group after the intervention was 4.60 while abdominal Swedish massage was 3.56. Although both significantly reduced the constipation score, the p-value was 0.00. Conclusion The protocol of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage immediately after waking up effectively reduced constipation scores on postoperative lower extremity fracture patients and can be use to adjuvant therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate postoperative constipation patients with immobility and the use of strong analgetics.

                <p>by Alexander C. Murph, G. Casey Gibson, Elizabeth B. Amona, Lauren J. Beesley, Lauren A. Castro, Sara Y. Del Valle, Dave Osthus</p>

The Method of Analogues (MOA) has gained popularity in the past decade for infectious disease forecasting due to its non-parametric nature. In MOA, the local behavior observed in a time series is matched to the local behaviors of several historical time series. The known values that directly follow the historical time series that best match the observed time series are used to calculate a forecast. This non-parametric approach leverages historical trends to produce forecasts without extensive parameterization, making it highly adaptable. However, MOA is limited in scenarios where historical data is sparse. This limitation was particularly evident during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the emerging global epidemic had little-to-no historical data. In this work, we propose a new method inspired by MOA, called the <i>Synthetic Method of Analogues</i> (sMOA). sMOA replaces historical disease data with a library of <i>synthetic</i> data that describe a broad range of <i>possible</i> disease trends. This model circumvents the need to estimate explicit parameter values by instead matching segments of ongoing time series data to a comprehensive library of synthetically generated segments of time series data. We demonstrate that sMOA has competitive performance with state-of-the-art infectious disease forecasting models, out-performing 78% of models from the COVID-19 Forecasting Hub in terms of averaged Mean Absolute Error and 76% of models from the COVID-19 Forecasting Hub in terms of averaged Weighted Interval Score. Additionally, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification methodology designed for the onset of emerging epidemics. Developing versatile approaches that do not rely on historical data and can maintain high accuracy in the face of novel pandemics is critical for enhancing public health decision-making and strengthening preparedness for future outbreaks.

                <p>by Xuexin Yu, Jing Hu, Yuhao Tan, Mingyao Pan, Hongyi Zhang, Bo Li</p>

Mitochondrial (MT) mutations serve as natural genetic markers for inferring clonal relationships using single cell sequencing data. However, the fundamental challenge of MT mutation-based lineage tracing is automated identification of informative MT mutations. Here, we introduced an open-source computational algorithm called “MitoTracer”, which accurately identified clonally informative MT mutations and inferred evolutionary lineage from scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq samples. We benchmarked MitoTracer using the ground-truth experimental lineage sequencing data and demonstrated its superior performance over the existing methods measured by high sensitivity and specificity. MitoTracer is compatible with multiple single cell sequencing platforms. Its application to a cancer evolution dataset revealed the genes related to primary BRAF-inhibitor resistance from scRNA-seq data of BRAF-mutated cancer cells. Overall, our work provided a valuable tool for capturing real informative MT mutations and tracing the lineages among cells.

                <p>by Janis Keck, Caswell Barry, Christian F. Doeller, Jürgen Jost</p>

In spatial cognition, the Successor Representation (SR) from reinforcement learning provides a compelling candidate of how predictive representations are used to encode space. In particular, hippocampal place cells are hypothesized to encode the SR. Here, we investigate how varying the temporal symmetry in learning rules influences those representations. To this end, we use a simple local learning rule which can be made insensitive to the temporal order. We analytically find that a symmetric learning rule results in a successor representation under a symmetrized version of the experienced transition structure. We then apply this rule to a two-layer neural network model loosely resembling hippocampal subfields CA3 - with a symmetric learning rule and recurrent weights - and CA1 - with an asymmetric learning rule and no recurrent weights. Here, when exposed repeatedly to a linear track, neurons in our model in CA3 show less shift of the centre of mass than those in CA1, in line with existing empirical findings. Investigating the functional benefits of such symmetry, we employ a simple reinforcement learning agent which may learn symmetric or classical successor representations. Here, we find that using a symmetric learning rule yields representations which afford better generalization, when the agent is probed to navigate to a new target without relearning the SR. This effect is reversed when the state space is not symmetric anymore. Thus, our results hint at a potential benefit of the inductive bias afforded by symmetric learning rules in areas employed in spatial navigation, where there naturally is a symmetry in the state space.

                <p>by Giulio Filippi, James Knight, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

Many insects use memories of their visual environment to adaptively drive spatial behaviours. In ants, visual memories are fundamental for navigation, whereby foragers follow long visually guided routes to foraging sites and return to the location of their nest. Whilst we understand the basic visual pathway to the memory centres (Optic Lobes to Mushroom Bodies) involved in the storage of visual information, it is still largely unknown what type of representation of visual scenes underpins view-based navigation in ants. Several experimental studies have suggested ants use “higher-order” visual information – that is features extracted across the whole extent of a visual scene – which raises the question as to how these features might be computed. One such experimental study showed that ants can use the proportion of a shape experienced left of their visual centre to learn and recapitulate a route, a feature referred to as “fractional position of mass” (FPM). In this work, we use a simple model constrained by the known neuroanatomy and information processing properties of the Mushroom Bodies to explore whether the apparent use of the FPM could be a resulting factor of the bilateral organisation of the insect brain, all the whilst assuming a simple “retinotopic” view representation. We demonstrate that such bilaterally organised memory models can implicitly encode the FPM learned during training. We find that balancing the “quality” of the memory match across left and right hemispheres allows a trained model to retrieve the FPM defined direction, even when the model is tested with novel shapes, as demonstrated by ants. The result is shown to be largely independent of model parameter values, therefore suggesting that some aspects of higher-order processing of a visual scene may be emergent from the structure of the neural circuits, rather than computed in discrete processing modules.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003255">Non-human primates can flexibly learn serial sequences and reorder context-dependent object sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xuan Wen, Adam Neumann, Seema Dhungana, Thilo Womelsdorf</p>

Intelligent behavior involves mentally arranging learned information in novel ways and is particularly well developed in humans. While nonhuman primates (NHP) will learn to arrange new items in serial order and re-arrange neighboring items within that order, it has remained contentious whether they are capable to re-assign items more flexibly to non-adjacent serial positions. Such mental re-indexing is facilitated by inferring the sequential structure of experiences as opposed to learning serial chains of item-item associations. Here, we tested the ability for flexible mental re-indexing in rhesus macaques. Subjects learned to choose five objects in a predetermined sequential order. A change of the background context indicated when the object order changed, probing the subjects to mentally re-arrange objects to non-adjacent positions of the learned serial structure. Subjects successfully used the context cue to pro-actively re-index items to new, non-adjacent positions. Mental re-indexing was more likely when the initial order had been learned at a higher level, improved with more experience of the re-indexing rule and correlated with working memory performance in a delayed match-to-sample task. These findings suggest that NHPs inferred the sequential structure of experiences beyond a chaining of item-item associations and mentally re-arrange items within that structure. The pattern of results indicates that NHPs form non-spatial cognitive maps of their experiences, which is a hallmark for flexible mental operations in many serially ordered behaviors including communication, counting or foraging.

                <p>by Tong Zhang, Amarender R. Bogadhi, Ziad M. Hafed</p>

Across saccades, neurons in retinotopically organized visual representations experience drastically different images, but visual percepts remain stable. Here we investigated whether such stability can be mediated, in part, via prediction-error signaling by neurons processing post-saccadic visual images. We specifically recorded from foveal superior colliculus (SC) neurons when a visual image only overlapped with their response fields (RF’s) after foveating saccades but not pre-saccadically. When we rapidly changed the target features intra-saccadically, the foveal neurons’ post-saccadic visual reafferent responses were elevated, even though the neurons did not directly sample the pre-saccadic extrafoveal target features. This effect did not occur in the absence of saccades, and it also scaled with the extent of the introduced intra-saccadic image feature discrepancies. These results suggest that foveal SC neurons may signal a trans-saccadic prediction error when the foveated image stimulating them is inconsistent with that expected from pre-saccadic extrafoveal representations, a potential perceptual stability mechanism.

                <p>by Craig R. McClain</p>

STEM is profoundly shaped by wealth, yet financial privilege is rarely acknowledged in discussions of diversity and inclusion. Wealth influences participation, persistence, and recognition in science, affecting not just who enters the pipeline but also who can afford to stay.

From student to researcher, a career in science can come with a high price tag. This Perspective explores how persistent financial barriers limit who can succeed in science, revealing how wealth shapes opportunity in STEM, and proposes structural changes to support equity and inclusion.

                <p>by Jianting Han, Meinai Song, Yijia Cheng, Wei Gong, Fei Zhang, Qin Cao</p>

Glycoprotein 2 (GP2) and Uromodulin (UMOD) are considered as paralogs that share high sequence similarity and have similar antibacterial functions. UMOD are abundant as filaments in the urinary tract, and a high-mannose N-glycosylation site located on the N-terminal region protruding from UMOD filament core (referred to as branch) acts as an adhesion antagonist against pathogenic bacterial infections. The antibacterial function of UMOD can be eliminated by proteases, as the UMOD branch is susceptible to proteolytic activity. GP2 is expressed in the pancreas and secreted into the digestive tract. Whether GP2 executes its function in filament form and how it remains functional in the protease-enriched digestive tract is unclear. In this study, we extract GP2 filaments from surgically excised human pancreas and determined their cryo-EM structure. Our structure analysis unveiled that GP2 forms filaments with its ZP modules, composing the ZPN and ZPC domains along with a linker that connects these two domains. The N-terminal region (branch) of GP2 does not constitute the filament core and appears flexible in the cryo-EM structure. Our biochemical experiments suggested that although the GP2 branch is also protease-susceptible, additional high-mannose N-glycans were identified on the protease-resistant GP2 filament core. Consequently, the branch-free GP2 filaments retain their binding ability to the bacterial adhesin FimH, ensuring GP2’s antibacterial function unaffected in the proteolytic environment. Our study provides the first experimental evidence of GP2 filament formation and reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying GP2’s adaptation to a different environment compared to UMOD.

                <p>by Aubrey Converse, Madeline J. Perry, Shweta S. Dipali, Jose V. V. Isola, Emmett B. Kelly, Joseph M. Varberg, Mary B. Zelinski, Michael B. Stout, Michele T. Pritchard, Francesca E. Duncan</p>

The ovary is one of the first organs to exhibit signs of aging, characterized by reduced tissue function, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis. Multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs), formed by macrophage fusion, typically occur in chronic immune pathologies, including infectious and non-infectious granulomas and the foreign body response, but are also observed in the aging ovary. The function and consequence of ovarian MNGCs remain unknown as their biological activity is highly context-dependent, and their large size has limited their isolation and analysis through technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing. In this study, we define ovarian MNGCs through a deep analysis of their presence across age and species using advanced imaging technologies as well as their unique transcriptome using laser capture microdissection. MNGCs form complex interconnected networks that increase with age in both mouse and nonhuman primate ovaries. MNGCs are characterized by high <i>Gpnmb</i> expression, a putative marker of ovarian and non-ovarian MNGCs. Pathway analysis highlighted functions in apoptotic cell clearance, lipid metabolism, proteolysis, immune processes, and increased oxidative phosphorylation and antioxidant activity. Thus, MNGCs have signatures related to degradative processes, immune function, and high metabolic activity. These processes were enriched in MNGCs compared to primary ovarian macrophages, suggesting discrete functionality. MNGCs express CD4 and colocalize with T-cells, which were enriched in regions of MNGCs, indicative of a close interaction between these immune cell types. These findings implicate MNGCs in modulation of the ovarian immune landscape during aging given their high penetrance and unique molecular signature that supports degradative and immune functions.

                Background Periodontitis (PD) is a persistent infectious inflammatory condition that affects the tissues supporting teeth and results in a progressive deterioration of the alveolar bone. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune ailment that has been linked with raised periodontal disease severity. This study aimed to assess the clinical and immunological characteristics of PD in individuals with and without RA and to compare these characteristics with a healthy control group. Methods The study included three groups; thirty patients with PD, thirty patients with PD and RA, and twenty healthy control participants. Clinical periodontal parameters [plaque Index (PLI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)] were assessed. Salivary biomarkers, including human leukocyte antigen-DR4 (HLA-DR4), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the microbial load of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results The current findings showed that salivary level of HLA-DR4 was decreased in patients’ groups as compared to healthy control group. Whilst, salivary levels of MMP-8 and ACPA were elevated in patients’ groups in comparison to control group, with no substantial differences found across both patient groups. On the other hand, microbial load was significantly higher in the PD with and without RA groups than that in controls, with a positive correlation between microbial load and CAL in the PD-RA group.

<p>This illustration demonstrates how resveratrol reduces cerebral aneurysm growth by activating SIRT1. Activation of SIRT1 suppresses NFKB1 inflammatory gene transcription through p65 unit deacetylation, which ultimately decreases the expression of inflammatory cells in the aneurysm wall.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Resveratrol is a polyphenol and potent antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory effects in conditions such as atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, we investigated whether resveratrol exerts anti-inflammatory effects and protects against intracranial aneurysm formation and rupture in male mice. Intracranial aneurysms were induced in mice using a combination of elastase injection into the cerebrospinal fluid and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt)-induced hypertension. Male mice were divided into two groups: a resveratrol diet group and a normal diet group. The dietary intervention lasted for 6 weeks, starting 3 weeks prior to elastase injection. The overall incidence of aneurysms did not differ significantly between the normal diet and resveratrol diet groups (71% vs. 59%, <i>p</i> = 0.497). However, resveratrol significantly reduced the rate of aneurysmal rupture compared with that in the normal diet group (88% vs. 40%, <i>p</i> = 0.026). Furthermore, resveratrol supplementation increased the mRNA levels of Sirtuin 1 (<i>Sirt1</i>) and decreased the mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (<i>Nfkb1</i>) and Tumor necrosis factor (<i>Tnf</i>). Our findings demonstrate that resveratrol reduces intracranial aneurysm rupture in a mouse model, indicating its therapeutic potential in this condition.</p>

                Hengen and Shew propose that criticality—a state with scale-invariant dynamics—is a universal computational setpoint of healthy brains. Their meta-analysis of two decades of research reconciles contradictory findings. They present eight predictions that emerge when criticality is understood as an optimization principle that maximizes the brain’s computational power.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99986">Brain-derived exosomal hemoglobin transfer contributes to neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis under hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia is an important physiological stress causing nerve injuries and several brain diseases. However, the mechanism of brain response to hypoxia remains unclear, thus limiting the development of interventional strategies. This study conducted combined analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome sequencing and extracellular vesicle transcriptome sequencing on hypoxic mouse brains, described cell–cell communication in the brain under hypoxia from intercellular and extracellular dimensions, confirmed that hemoglobin mRNA was transferred from non-neuronal cells to neurons, and eventually expressed. Then we further explored the role of exosomal hemoglobin transfer in vitro, using human-derived cell lines, and clarified that hypoxia promoted the transfer and expression of exosomal hemoglobin between endothelial cells and neurons. We found the vital function of exosomal hemoglobin to protect against neurological injury by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons. In conclusion, this study identified a novel mechanism of ‘mutual aid’ in hypoxia responses in the brain, involving exosomal hemoglobin transfer, clarified the important role of exosomal communication in the process of brain stress response, and provided a novel interventional perspective for hypoxia-related brain diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104475">Cognitive control of behavior and hippocampal information processing without medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control tasks require using one class of information while ignoring competing classes of information. The central role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in cognitive control is well established in the primate literature and largely accepted in the rodent literature because mPFC damage causes deficits in tasks that may require cognitive control, as inferred, typically from the task design. In prior work, we used an active place avoidance task where a rat or mouse on a rotating arena is required to avoid the stationary task-relevant locations of a mild shock and ignore the rotating task-irrelevant locations of those shocks. The task is impaired by hippocampal manipulations, and the discharge of hippocampal place cell populations judiciously alternates between representing stationary locations near the shock zone and rotating locations far from the shock zone, demonstrating cognitive control concurrently in behavior and the hippocampal representation of spatial information. Here, we test whether rat mPFC lesion impairs the active place avoidance task to evaluate two competing hypotheses, a ‘central-computation’ hypothesis that the mPFC is essential for the computations required for cognitive control and an alternative ‘local-computation’ hypothesis that other brain areas can perform the computations required for cognitive control, independent of mPFC. Ibotenic acid lesion of the mPFC was effective, damaging the cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices. The lesion also altered the normal coordination of metabolic activity across remaining structures. The lesion did not impair learning to avoid the initial location of shock or long-term place avoidance memory, but impaired avoidance after the shock was relocated. The lesion also did not impair the alternation between task-relevant and task-irrelevant hippocampal representations of place information. These findings support the local-computation hypothesis that computations required for cognitive control can occur locally in brain networks independently of the mPFC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104609">Synaptic connectivity of sensorimotor circuits for vocal imitation in the songbird</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor computations for learning and behavior rely on precise patterns of synaptic connectivity. Yet, we typically lack the synaptic wiring diagrams for long-range connections between sensory and motor circuits in the brain. Here, we provide the synaptic wiring diagram for sensorimotor circuits involved in learning and production of male zebra finch song, a natural and ethologically relevant behavior. We examined the functional synaptic connectivity from the 4 main sensory afferent pathways onto the three known classes of projection neurons of the song premotor cortical region HVC. Recordings from hundreds of identified projection neurons reveal rules for monosynaptic connectivity and the existence of polysynaptic ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in HVC. Circuit tracing further identifies novel connections between HVC’s presynaptic partners. Our results indicate a modular organization of ensemble-like networks for integrating long-range input with local circuits, providing important context for information flow and computations for learned vocal behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101760">Regulative synthesis of capsular polysaccharides in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Streptococcus suis</i> (<i>S. suis</i>) is an important zoonotic pathogen causing substantial economic losses in the swine industry. <i>S. suis</i> serotype 2 (SS2) is often isolated from the diseased. <i>S. suis</i> expresses capsular polysaccharide (CPS), a virulence factor crucial for their survival in the blood. However, the role of CPS in the pathogenesis of <i>S. suis</i> is incomplete. Here, we showed that thin CPS or no CPS was associated with efficient binding of an SS2 strain, 05ZYH33, to respiratory epithelial cells, while thick CPS increased resistance of 05ZYH33 to blood clearance. In a mouse infection model, 05ZYH33 was detected in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as early as 30 min after intranasal inoculation without bacteremia. Histological analysis revealed that 05ZYH33 in the nasal cavity invaded the olfactory epithelium, resulting in early brain inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy showed that 05ZYH33 isolated from NALT and CSF at early infection time had a thin layer of CPS, and those detected in the blood 5 hr post-inoculation showed a much thicker CPS. In addition, adoptive transfer of anti-CPS restricted 05ZYH33 in the blood but not in NALT or CSF. However, an antiserum directed to multiple non-CPS virulence factors (anti-V5) efficiently inhibited 05ZYH33 in NALT, CSF, and blood. Thus, 05ZYH33 colonizes NALT more efficiently without CPS and subsequently invades the meninges through the olfactory nerve system. These findings provide valuable information for the treatment of <i>S. suis</i> infection and the development of vaccines across serotypes of <i>S. suis</i> by targeting CPS-independent immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103403">PDZ-directed substrate recruitment is the primary determinant of specific 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation by PP1-Neurabin</a></h4>

              
                Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1) relies on association with PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs) to generate substrate-specific PIP/PP1 holoenzymes, but the lack of well-defined substrates has hindered elucidation of the mechanisms involved. We previously demonstrated that the Phactr1 PIP confers sequence specificity on the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. Phactr1 defines a group of ‘RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W’ PIPs that all interact with PP1 in a similar fashion. Here, we use a PP1-PIP fusion approach to address sequence specificity and identify substrates of the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W family PIPs. We show that the four Phactr proteins confer identical sequence specificities on their holoenzymes. We identify the 4E-BP and p70 S6K translational regulators as substrates for the Neurabin/Spinophilin PIPs, implicated in neuronal plasticity, pointing to a role for their holoenzymes in mTORC1-dependent translational control. Biochemical and structural experiments show that in contrast to the Phactrs, substrate recruitment and catalytic efficiency of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions is primarily determined by substrate interaction with the PDZ domain adjoining their RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W motifs, rather than by recognition of the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove. Thus, even PIPs that interact with PP1 in a similar manner use different mechanisms to ensure substrate selectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99478">A direct neural signature of serial dependence in working memory</a></h4>

              
                Serial dependence describes the phenomenon that current object representations are attracted to previously encoded and reported representations. While attractive biases have been observed reliably in behavior, a direct neural correlate has not been established. Previous studies have either shown a reactivation of past information without observing a neural signal related to the bias of the current information, or a repulsive distortion of current neural representations contrasting the behavioral bias. The present study recorded neural signals with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a working memory task to identify neural correlates of serial dependence. Participants encoded and memorized two sequentially presented motion directions per trial, one of which was later retro-cued for report. Multivariate analyses provided reliable reconstructions of both motion directions. Importantly, the reconstructed directions in the current trial were attractively shifted toward the target direction of the previous trial. This neural bias mirrored the behavioral attractive bias, thus reflecting a direct neural signature of serial dependence. The use of a retro-cue task in combination with MEG allowed us to determine that this neural bias emerged at later, post-encoding time points. This timing suggests that serial dependence in working memory affects memorized information during read-out and reactivation processes that happen after the initial encoding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100666">The geometry and dimensionality of brain-wide activity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neural activity organization is vital for deciphering brain function. By recording whole-brain calcium activity in larval zebrafish during hunting and spontaneous behaviors, we find that the shape of the neural activity space, described by the neural covariance spectrum, is scale-invariant: a smaller, <i>randomly sampled</i> cell assembly resembles the entire brain. This phenomenon can be explained by Euclidean Random Matrix theory, where neurons are reorganized from anatomical to functional positions based on their correlations. Three factors contribute to the observed scale invariance: slow neural correlation decay, higher functional space dimension, and neural activity heterogeneity. In addition to matching data from zebrafish and mice, our theory and analysis demonstrate how the geometry of neural activity space evolves with population sizes and sampling methods, thus revealing an organizing principle of brain-wide activity.

">Fundamental Sex Differences in Cocaine-Induced Plasticity of D1R- and D2R-MSNs in the Mouse Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that cocaine-induced changes in nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) differ based on dopamine receptor subtype expression, the sex of the animal, and for females, phase of the estrous cycle. These findings highlight the need to account for both sex and estrous cycle when studying drug-mediated alterations in neurophysiology. Whether MSNs of the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), which serve different aspects of addiction, will exhibit similar sex and estrous cycle effects with cocaine administration was investigated. METHODS: Mice underwent a 5-day locomotor sensitization paradigm via daily cocaine administration (15 mg/kg, s.c.) followed by a 1- to 4-day drug-free abstinence period. We examined NAcC MSN excitability by obtaining ex vivo whole-cell recordings from differentially labeled dopamine D1-receptor expressing MSNs (D1R-MSNs) and dopamine D2-receptor expressing MSNs (D2R-MSNs) obtained from male mice or female mice that were either in estrus or diestrus. RESULTS: In this genetic background of mice, both male and female mice sensitized to cocaine in a similar manner. In males, there were no cocaine-induced changes in D1R-MSN or D2R-MSN excitability, with D2R-MSNs exhibiting greater excitability. In saline-treated females, D1R-MSN excitability fluctuated across the estrous cycle with increased excitability during estrus. Following cocaine, estrous cycle-dependent D1R-MSN excitability was arrested, fixed at an intermediate value between estrus and diestrus when compared to saline controls. D2R-MSNs did not change either across the estrous cycle or following cocaine. When comparing MSN subtypes, in diestrus, D2R-MSNs were more excitable under saline conditions, but indistinguishable from D1R-MSNs following cocaine. In contrast, during estrus, D1R- and D2R-MSN excitability was similar in saline treated animals, but with cocaine, D2R-MSNs displayed heightened excitability. CONCLUSIONS: There are fundamental sex differences in cocaine-induced changes to the excitability of D1R-MSNs in the NAcC. After cocaine exposure, female mice in diestrus exhibited a significant main effect change in MSN excitability, an inversion of what had previously been demonstrated in the NAcSh where no cocaine-induced changes were observed. These data suggest that there are distinct differences in the neuropharmacological effect of cocaine in males versus females that are shell and core specific.

">Heterosynaptic interactions between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in individual medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens ventromedial shell</a></h4>

              
                Establishing learned associations between rewarding stimuli and the context under which those rewards are encountered is critical for survival. Hippocampal input to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key connection involved in integrating environmental information and reward processing to facilitate goal-directed behaviors. This connection consists of two independent pathways originating from the dorsal (dHipp) or ventral (vHipp) hippocampus, which have previously been considered functionally and anatomically distinct. Here, we show overlap in dHipp and vHipp terminal fields in the NAc, which led us to reconsider this view and raise new questions regarding the potential interactions between dHipp and vHipp pathways in the NAc. Using optogenetics, electrophysiology, and transsynaptic labeling in adult male and female mice, we investigated anatomical and functional convergence of dHipp and vHipp in the NAc. We identified a subpopulation of dually innervated cells in the NAc medial shell where dHipp and vHipp inputs are located near one another along dendritic branches. We independently manipulated dHipp and vHipp inputs via two-color optogenetic manipulation during whole-cell electrophysiology recordings to confirm functional dual innervation of individual neurons and revealed heterosynaptic interactions between the two pathways. Altogether, these results demonstrate that dHipp and vHipp dually innervate a subset of neurons in the NAc, suggesting integration of these inputs at the level of individual neurons. Exploring the physiological and behavioral implications of this convergence will offer new insights into how individual neurons incorporate information from distinct inputs and how this integration may shape learning.

">Dendritic Polyglycerol Amine Substrate Extends the Viability of Mixed Glial Cultures for Repeated Isolation of Immature Oligodendrocyte Lineage Cells</a></h4>

              
                Primary mixed glial cultures are key tools to isolate and study astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes. Cell-substrate adhesion is critical for neural cell survival and differentiation. Cationic polymers like poly-D-lysine (PDL) are widely used to promote cell adhesion to cell culture substrates, however, PDL is not stable long-term, with cultured cells often detaching (peeling) after 2-3 weeks. Dendritic polyglycerol amine (dPGA) is a synthetic polycationic non-protein polymer biomimetic of poly-lysine that is highly resistant to degradation by cellular proteases. Substrates coated with dPGA promote cell adhesion and improve survival in long-term neuronal cultures. Here we assessed dPGA as a substrate coating to provide long-term support for mixed glial cultures. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were isolated weekly by differential adhesion from cultures grown in T75 flasks with PDL or dPGA-coated substrates. Following two shake-off isolations, the cell layer in most PDL-coated flasks fully detached, rendering these flasks unusable for further culture. In contrast, dPGA-coated flasks consistently yielded cells for six or more sequential isolations over seven weeks in culture. dPGA-coated flasks produced more cells, a greater percentage of O4+ cells, and maintained similar proportions of OPCs and MBP-positive cells as when isolated from a PDL-coated substrate. dPGA is cyto-compatible, functionally superior, easy to use, low cost and a stable alternative to conventional cell substrate coatings. The enhanced long-term stability of mixed glial cultures grown on a dPGA substrate has the capacity to increase cellular yield, reduce animal use, and facilitate studies of oligodendrocyte cell biology.

">Predicting Brain Volumes from Anthropometric and Demographic Features: Insights from UK Biobank Neuroimaging Data</a></h4>

              
                Brain size measures are well-studied and often treated as a confound in volumetric neuroimaging analyses. Yet their relationship with body anthropometric measures and demographics remains underexplored. In this study, we examined those relationships alongside age- and sex related differences in global brain volumes. Using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy participants in the UK Biobank, we derived global measures of brain morphometry, including total intracranial volume (TIV), total brain volume (TBV), gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We extracted these measures using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) and FreeSurfer. Our analyses were structured in three approaches: across-sex analysis, sexspecific analysis, and impact of age analysis. Employing machine learning (ML), we found that TIV was strongly predicted by sex (across-sex  = 0.68), reflecting sexual dimorphism. On the other hand, TBV, GMV, WMV, and CSF were more sensitive to age, with higher prediction accuracy when age was included as a feature, highlighting age-related changes in the brain structure, such as fluid expansion. Sex-specific models showed reduced TIV prediction ( {approx} 0.25) but improved TBV accuracy ( {approx} 0.44), underscoring sex-specific body-brain relationships. Anthropometrics enhanced prediction but only subsidiary to age and sex. These findings advance our understanding of brain-body scaling relationships and underscore the necessity of accounting for age and sex in neuroimaging studies of brain morphology.

">Dynamic encoding of valence by the anterior cingulate cortex in mice</a></h4>

              
                Fear is a double-edged sword: it supports survival based on learned associations between environmental cues and potential threats, but its dysregulation can lead to anxiety disorders and PTSD. Many studies have addressed the roles of the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala in the storage of the fear engram, but the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), especially during and immediately after fear acquisition, remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we longitudinally recorded ACC neuronal activity using single-photon calcium imaging in freely behaving adult male mice subjected to fear conditioning. Subjects acquired a conditioned freezing response to a tone cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) paired with light foot shocks (unconditioned stimulus, US), and ACC activity was monitored during cue pre-exposure, fear acquisition, fear recall, and fear extinction. Consistent with known functions of the ACC, neuronal responses were modulated by the US and by the novelty of the CS and US. Critically, both the number of CS-responsive neurons and the CS-associated population activity rose during acquisition, peaked during recall, and decreased throughout extinction. Neuronal populations responsive to the CS overlapped at a rate consistent with chance, suggesting that the ACC operates as a flexible integrative hub rather than containing stable engrams. Together, these findings indicate that ACC neuronal populations, but not engrams, represent novelty, pain, and the dynamic valence of a CS. Our findings are consistent with a model in which the ACC plays a role in threat appraisal and provides a learning signal that dynamically updates fear representations in other regions.

">The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 maleate reprograms metabolism to promote RGC differentiation and regeneration in retino-visual centers</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic collapse of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) onsets glaucoma, yet no approved drug directly protects these neurons. Through a live-cell mitochondrial screen in human stem-cell-derived hRGCs we uncovered WAY-100635 (WAY), a clinically tested 5-HT1A antagonist, as a systemic neuroprotectant. WAY triggers a reversible cyclic-AMP surge that activates PGC-1-driven reversible mitochondrial biogenesis and suppresses apoptosis. In glaucoma associated OPTN-E50K hRGCs, it restores mitochondrial fitness, dampens excitotoxicity, and redirects mature neurons toward aerobic glycolysis, while in progenitors it instead boosts mitochondrial cristae maturation, oxidative phosphorylation, and cell-cycle exit to accelerate RGC specification. Daily oral dosing preserves RGC bodies after optic-nerve crush or chronic ocular hypertension and promotes axon regeneration into the optic nerve, tract, and lateral geniculate nucleus, sustaining visual acuity. As the first non-invasive metabolism-reprogramming therapy with a human safety profile, WAY addresses a critical gap in glaucoma care and offers a template for treating mitochondrial neurodegenerations.

">Late onset of striatal projection neuron hyperexcitability in Fmr1-/y mice</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), results from silencing of the FMR1 gene and consequent loss of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP deficiency disrupts neural development, leading to behavioral and motor deficits associated with striatal dysfunction. While structural and functional abnormalities in striatal projection neurons (SPNs) have been observed in adult Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, their developmental onset and contribution to early FXS pathophysiology remain unknown. In this study, we examined the postnatal maturation of SPN in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of Fmr1 KO mice, assessing glutamatergic synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability. During postnatal development, Fmr1 deficient SPNs in DMS display normal synaptic and intrinsic properties, consistent with typical maturation. In contrast, by P60, SPNs of mice exhibit pronounced hyperexcitability, characterized by increased membrane resistance, reduced rheobase, and slower action potential kinetics. These perturbations affect both Dopamine 1 receptor-expressing (D1-SPN) and D2 receptor-expressing (D2-SPN) SPNs, though some action potential dynamics are selectively impaired in D1-SPNs. Chronic aripiprazole treatment, a widely prescribed therapy for FXS-related symptoms, fails to normalize SPN excitability, highlighting its limited efficacy in addressing core SPN dysfunction. Our findings reveal a late-onset hyperexcitability in DMS SPNs of Fmr1 KO mice, suggesting a progressive emergence of striatal neuron abnormalities over development. These results underscore the importance of developmental timing in FXS pathophysiology and emphasize the need for targeted interventions to address striatal circuit dysfunction.

">Climbing fibers selectively recruit disinhibitory interneurons to enhance dendritic calcium signaling in cerebellar Purkinje cells</a></h4>

              
                Climbing fiber (CF) inputs to Purkinje cells (PCs) instruct plasticity and learning in the cerebellum. Paradoxically, CFs also excite molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), a cell-type that inhibits PCs and can restrict plasticity and learning. However, two types of MLIs with opposing influences have recently been identified: MLI1s inhibit PCs, reduce dendritic calcium signals, and suppress plasticity of granule cell to PC synapses, whereas MLI2s inhibit MLI1s and disinhibit PCs. To determine how CFs can activate MLIs without also suppressing the PC calcium signals necessary for plasticity and learning, we investigated the specificity of CF inputs onto MLIs. Serial EM reconstructions indicate that CFs contact both MLI subtypes without making conventional synapses, but more CFs contact each MLI2 via more sites with larger contact areas. Slice experiments indicate that CFs preferentially excite MLI2s via glutamate spillover. In agreement with these anatomical and slice experiments, in vivo Neuropixels recordings show that spontaneous CF activity excites MLI2s, inhibits MLI1s, and disinhibits PCs. In contrast, learning-related sensory stimulation produced more complex responses, driving convergent CF and granule cell inputs that could either activate or suppress MLI1s. This balance was robustly shifted toward MLI1 suppression when CFs were synchronously active, in turn elevating the PC dendritic calcium signals necessary for LTD. These data provide mechanistic insight into why CF synchrony can be highly effective at inducing cerebellar learning by revealing a critical disinhibitory circuit that allows CFs to act through MLIs to enhance PC dendritic calcium signals necessary for plasticity.

">The neural processes underpinning flexible semantic retrieval in visual and auditory modalities</a></h4>

              
                Contemporary accounts of semantic cognition propose that conceptual knowledge is supported by a heteromodal conceptual store and controlled retrieval processes. However, it remains unclear how the neural basis of semantic control varies across modalities. Recent models of cortical organization suggest that control networks are distributed along a unimodal-to-heteromodal cortical gradient, with the semantic control network (SCN) located in more heteromodal cortex than the domain-general multiple demand network (MDN). We used fMRI to examine how these networks respond to semantic control demands in visual and auditory tasks. Participants judged the semantic relatedness of spoken and written word pairs. On half of the trials, a task cue specified the semantic feature to guide retrieval; on the remaining trials, no such cue was given. The SCN showed greater activation when task knowledge was available, consistent with a role in the top-down control of semantic retrieval across modalities. In contrast, the MDN showed greater activation for spoken words, likely reflecting increased demands in speech perception. These findings demonstrate a dissociation between control networks, with SCN involvement modulated by task structure and MDN activity influenced by input modality.

">Optimal inhibitory-to-excitatory ratio governs slow and fast oscillations for enhanced neural communication</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations at distinct frequency bands facilitate communication within and between neural populations. While single-frequency oscillations are well-characterized, the simultaneous emergence of slow (beta) and fast (gamma) oscillations within the same network remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that multi-frequency oscillations naturally arise when the ratio of inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic strength falls within a specific regime using a biologically plausible Izhikevich model. We show that this regime maximizes both information capacity and transmission efficiency, suggesting an optimal balance for neural communication. Deviations from this range lead to single-frequency oscillations and reduced communication efficiency, mirroring disruptions observed in neurological disorders. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how the brain leverages multiple oscillatory frequencies for efficient information processing and suggest a potential biomarker for impaired neural communication.

">Asymmetric distribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ regulators specifies compartment-specific mitochondrial function and neuronal development</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal polarization is essential for functional compartmentalization, enabling dendritic synaptic integration and axonal action potential generation. While structural differences in mitochondria across compartments have been identified, their functional distinctions remain unclear. Here, we uncovered compartment-specific mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics and their molecular determinants. In axonal mitochondria, Ca2+ uptake through MCU occurs independently of ER-stored Ca2+ release, with faster matrix Ca2+ clearance than dendritic mitochondria, where Ca2+ uptake predominantly originates from ER Ca2+. The ER-independent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in axonal mitochondria is mediated by enriched MCU-regulating proteins, MICU1 and MICU2, while higher NCLX expression facilitates rapid Ca2+ clearance. Moreover, NCLX knockdown, which functionally mimics a mental retardation-associated mutation, caused more significant axonal branching defects compared to dendrites in vivo, aligning with its enrichment in axons. These findings highlight fundamental Ca2+-modulating features and developmental importance of neuronal mitochondria in a compartment-specific manner and reveal the key underlying molecular mechanisms.

">Nuclear Receptor Transcription factors promote axon regeneration in the Adult Corticospinal Tract</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factors are potent levers for neural repair, but systematic pipelines to uncover factors that unlock adult corticospinal regeneration are lacking. By intersecting developmental RNA-seq with ATAC-seq footprints, we pinpointed two nuclear-receptor transcription factors NR2F1 and NR2F6, neither previously linked to CNS axon growth as top candidates. Forced expression of either factor doubled neurite length in culture, and each proved highly effective in vivo: after unilateral pyramidotomy they drove robust midline sprouting, while after complete thoracic crush they supported long-tract CST regeneration that restored hip lift, partial swing trajectories and grip strength. Multi-omics dissection revealed complementary mechanisms: NR2F1 re-engaged chromatin-remodeling and cytoskeletal networks, whereas NR2F6, via a conserved corepressor domain, imposed a broad translational down-shift, bound predominantly to distal enhancers and re-packaged chromatin into new topologically associating domains that cluster growth genes with freshly activated regulatory hubs. These discoveries establish NR2F1 and NR2F6 as novel pro-regenerative TFs, demonstrate their potency across lesion types, and expose repression-driven translational control and enhancer-TAD reconfiguration as previously unrecognized axes of CNS repair.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>One of the hallmark features of neocortical anatomy is the presence of extensive top-down projections into primary sensory areas. It is hypothesized that one of the roles of these top-down projections is to carry contextual information that helps animals to resolve ambiguities in sensory data. One proposed mechanism of contextual integration is a combination of input streams at distinct apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Computationally, however, it is yet to be demonstrated how such an architecture could leverage distinct compartments for flexible contextual integration and sensory processing. Here, we implement a deep neural network with distinct apical and basal compartments that integrates (a) contextual information from top-down projections to apical compartments and (b) sensory representations driven by bottom-up projections to basal compartments. In addition, we develop a new contextual integration task using generative modeling. The performance of deep neural networks augmented with our “apical prior” exceeds that of single-compartment networks. We find that a sparse subset of neurons of the context-relevant categories receive the largest top-down signals. We further show that this sparse gain modulation is necessary. Altogether, this suggests that the “apical prior” could be key for handling the ambiguities that animals encounter in the real world.</span>

">Reward impulsivity is linked to addictive-like behaviors towards sweet food and sugary drinks but not fatty food</a></h4>

              
                Overconsumption of hyperpalatable food is a worldwide problem. Although many previous studies have shown the link between monetary delay discounting and propensity to overconsume food, the studies did not focus on the link between delay discounting and various subcategories of palatable food. In the present study, we investigate the link between the individual propensity to choose smaller immediate rather than larger delayed reward and the degree of problematic eating behavior for five types of palatable food (sweets, sugary drinks, fatty food, salty snacks, and starchy food). The delay discounting task was used to measure propensity to choose immediate rather than delayed rewards, while the degree of addictive-like behavior was measured using the modified Yale food addiction scale (mYFAS) for each food category. Both model-free and model-based analysis showed that there is a significant correlation between the addiction score for sweet food and the tendency to choose smaller immediate rather than larger delayed rewards. A model-based analysis showed the same significant correlation for sugary drinks. However, no such correlation was observed for other food categories (fatty, salty, or starchy food), suggesting that reward impulsivity may play different roles in addictive-like behavior towards various food categories.

">Neurobiological and Chemical Characterization of the Cyanobacterial Metabolite Veraguamide E</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Natural products have long been recognized as a rich source of therapeutics, accounting for over 60% of currently approved small-molecule drugs and underscoring their pivotal role in drug discovery. Marine cyanobacteria produce structurally diverse secondary metabolites with a wide array of biological activities. Among these are the veraguamides, a family of depsipeptides that have shown promise as future therapeutics in our recent studies. This work presents a detailed biological and chemical characterization of veraguamide E (Ver E), isolated from a Panamanian marine cyanobacterial collection. The {sigma}2R/TMEM97 system has been identified as a promising target to address unmet need for non-opioid therapeutics which can modulate neuronal excitability in the context of chronic pain. Discovery and identification of novel compounds which modulate this system can help us better understand its function as well as allow us to develop future therapeutics targeting this pathway. Summary: Ver E's structure was validated by 1H NMR, HRMS, and molecular networking analyses. Computational docking and NMR titration confirmed direct, saturable, and tight binding of Ver E to the human Sigma-2 receptor/transmembrane protein 97 ({sigma}2R/TMEM97). Functional calcium imaging in primary mouse sensory neurons revealed that Ver E increases intracellular Ca2+ levels without modulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Multi-well microelectrode array experiments using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived nociceptors showed that Ver E significantly reduced neuronal activity at physiological temperatures, but not under heat-stress conditions. Ver E exhibited no cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 30 M in HEK293 cells, and immunocytochemistry confirmed that it does not alter phosphorylated eIF2 (p-eIF2) expression, indicating a mechanism distinct from integrated stress response modulators. Collectively, these findings position Ver E as a non-toxic compound capable of selectively modulating neuronal excitability, thereby advancing the development of novel therapeutics for pain management.

                This study aims to investigate gene expression changes in different brain regions of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients using transcriptomics and bioinformatics approaches. Through differential expression gene (DEG) analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we aimed to identify key genes, pathways, and co-expression modules associated with MDD, with particular emphasis on the role of neuroinflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways in MDD pathology and their region-specific characteristics. The findings of this study will provide novel insights into the complex molecular mechanisms of MDD and lay the foundation for the future development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

">Post Adversity Changes in Nigro-Striatal Dopamine: a Mechanism for Anxiety Induced Exacerbated Innate Repetitive Behaviors.</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety exacerbates symptoms in various psychiatric disorders. In conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or Tourette syndrome, anxiety intensifies stereotypic and repetitive behaviors. Rodent self-grooming, a structured, repetitive innate behavior, serves as an effective rodent platform for studying these behaviors in neuropsychiatric research. Anxiety is also linked to altered functioning of the dopamine (DA) system, particularly within the substantia-nigra pars compacta (SNc), the main DA source to the dorsal striatum through the nigro-striatal pathway. Striatal modulation by DA signal also plays a complex role in repetitive behaviors and OCD-like symptoms, suggesting this system as linking anxiety to the induced exacerbation of repetitive behavior. In the present study, we observed several long-term effects of anxiety inducing foot shock on grooming behavior. Recordings single unit neuronal activity in the SNc revealed distinct response patterns related to grooming behavior with changes in the magnitude and timing following the shock treatment. Notably, DA neurons of different nigro-striatal pathways demonstrated different changes in different response pattern type units. DA neurons projecting to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) showed increase, while those targeting the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) exhibited decrease in transient activity -suggesting a shift in cortico-striatal circuitry of behavioral control. These neural changes were correlated with the observed behavioral alterations following adversity. Furthermore, targeted stimulation of DLS-projecting DA neurons rescued the anxiety-induced behavioral effects, highlighting the critical role of the nigro-striatal pathway to the DLS in mediating the interaction between anxiety and repetitive behaviors, thus offering future direction for mitigation of relevant psychiatric symptoms.

">Dynamic cholinergic signaling differentially desynchronizes cortical microcircuits dependent on modulation rate and network topology</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine (ACh) affects both the intrinsic properties of individual neurons and the oscillatory tendencies of neuronal microcircuits by modulating the muscarinic-receptor gated m-current. However, despite contemporary experimental evidence of ACh concentrations changing at millisecond timescales, computational studies traditionally model ACh solely as a tonic neuromodulator. How time-varying, dynamic cholinergic modulation of the m-current affects the dynamics of neuronal microcircuits therefore remains an open question. Using a new implementation of a time-varying cholinergic signal in computational excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) spiking neuronal networks, we here delineate how the interaction between dynamic cholinergic modulation and network topology influences the oscillatory tendencies of these systems. While the dynamics of networks with dominant inter-connectivity (strong E-to-I and I-to-E synaptic weights) are minimally affected, networks with dominant intra-connectivity (strong E-to-E and I-to-I synaptic weights) exhibit dynamics heavily dependent upon dynamic cholinergic signaling. Further investigation of these latter type of networks reveals that their firing patterns are sensitive to the timecourse of cholinergic modulation and that relatively minor changes to the E-I connectivity strength promote distinct desynchronization mechanisms. Our results indicate that network topology plays a paramount role in dictating the modulatory effects of time-varying cholinergic signals, a finding of broad relevance to our understanding of cholinergic modulation and potentially impactful in the design of neurostimulation therapies believed to act through cholinergic pathways.

Author summaryAcetylcholine (ACh) is a chemical messenger that alters the intrinsic properties of neurons and in turn regulates brain activity related to cognitive functions such as sensory processing, memory formation, and attention. Although mounting experimental evidence shows that ACh concentrations in the brain can change dynamically at rapid timescales, computational studies conventionally consider ACh concentrations as constant across time. This motivated us to create a computational model of a neuronal microcircuit in which cellular properties are affected by ACh concentrations varying at millisecond-level timescales. The oscillatory dynamics of this microcircuit differ in important ways from similar systems with constant ACh levels, with the influence of dynamically changing ACh critically dependent upon the connectivity of the neurons in the modeled brain region. These results describe novel mechanisms by which ACh controls microcircuit activity overlooked in existing models in which ACh varies only over long timescales, an understanding which may be vital for the refinement of neurostimulation therapies believed to act through transient alterations to ACh activity.

">Projection-Specific Intersectional Optogenetics for Precise Excitation and Inhibition in the Marmoset Brain</a></h4>

              
                The primate cerebral cortex relies on long-range connections to integrate information between functionally specialized areas. Investigating these processes requires tools that can selectively modulate specific projection pathways. While cell-class-specific optogenetics can modulate local circuits, these approaches often lack pathway specificity. Projection-specific optogenetics offers greater precision, especially in primates, where cortical areas are spatially and functionally well-separated. To address challenges in translating this approach from rodents to primates, we developed a mouse-to-marmoset pipeline. We first validated that optogenetic targeting of inhibitory neurons (AAV9-Dlx-ChR2) effectively silenced local cortical areas in marmosets. We then tested selective excitation and inhibition of defined projection pathways. By intersecting retrogradely delivered Cre-recombinase (AAVretro-Cre) with locally injected Cre-dependent opsins (AAV8-FLEx-ChR2 or Jaws), we achieved efficient, direction-specific labeling of both callosal and longitudinal projections. This intersectional strategy enabled precise excitatory and inhibitory control of cortical activity using distinct light wavelengths, advancing projection-specific optogenetics for investigating primate brain circuit function.

">EEG-based Decoding of Auditory Attention to Conversations with Turn-taking Speakers</a></h4>

              
                ObjectivesAuditory attention decoding (AAD) refers to the process of identifying which sound source a listener is attending to, based on neural recordings, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Most AAD studies use a competing speaker paradigm where two continuously active speech signals are simultaneously presented, in which the participant is instructed to attend to one speaker and ignore the other speaker. However, such a competing two-speaker scenario is uncommon in real life, as speakers typically take turns rather than speaking simultaneously. In this paper, we argue that decoding attention to conversations (rather than individual speakers) is a more relevant paradigm for testing AAD algorithms. In such a conversation-tracking paradigm, the AAD algorithm focusses on switching between entire conversations, resulting in less frequent attention shifts (ignoring turn-taking within conversations), thereby allowing for more relaxed constraints on the decision time.

DesignTo test AAD performance in such a conversation-tracking paradigm, we simulated a challenging restaurant scenario with three simultaneous two-speaker conversations, which were podcasts presented in front of the listener and in the back left and back right of the room. We conducted an EEG experiment on 20 normal-hearing participants to compare the performance of AAD in the commonly used competing speaker paradigm with two speakers versus the conversation tracking paradigm with 2 or 3 conversations, each containing two turn-taking speakers.

ResultsWe found that AAD, using stimulus decoding, worked well under all experimental conditions, and that the accuracy was not influenced by the direction of attention, the proximity to the target conversation, or the presence of within-trial attention switches (versus a condition with sustained attention). Given the challenging scenario, we probed for the participants listening experience and found a correlation between the neural decoding performance and the perceived listening effort and self-reported speech intelligibility. To gain insight into the speech intelligibility of the participants in our setup, they performed a speech-in-noise test (Flemish matrix sentence test), but we did not find a correlation between the speech intelligibility performance and the AAD performance.

">Nicotinic Modulation of Fast-spiking Neurons in Rat Somatosensory Cortex Across Development</a></h4>

              
                Signaling at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) is vital for normal development of cerebral cortical circuits. These developing circuits are also shaped by fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory cortical neurons. While nicotinic dysfunction in FS neurons is implicated in a number of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, FS neurons are thought to not have nicotinic responses in adults. Here, we establish a timeline of FS neuron response to nicotine pre- and postsynaptically in primary somatosensory cortex in male and female rats. We found that nicotine increases the frequency of spontaneous synaptic inputs to FS neurons during the second postnatal week, and this effect persisted through development. In contrast, FS neurons in S1 had no postsynaptic responses to nicotine from as early as they can be reliably identified. This was not attributable to receptor desensitization, and we further revealed that FS neurons express abundant mRNA for several nAChR subunits, beginning early in development. To determine why FS neurons do not respond to nicotine, despite expressing these receptors, we probed for the expression of lynx1, a negative nicotinic modulator. Lynx1 mRNA was expressed in FS neurons from early development, with expression increasing dramatically during the second postnatal week.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSignaling at nicotinic receptors is critical for development of cortical circuits. These circuits are also shaped by fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. We reveal how these developmental processes interact, by establishing a timeline of nicotinic effects on FS neurons in rats. We find that nicotine presynaptically regulates inputs to FS neurons from early development. However, FS neurons at all ages lack postsynaptic responses to nicotine, despite expressing nicotinic receptor mRNA. This might be due to the expression of lynx1, a negative nicotinic receptor modulator, which we identify in FS neurons as early as the first postnatal week. This work reveals novel aspects of development, relevant to both normal cortical development and the neuropsychiatric pathologies associated with abnormal FS neurons and nicotinic development.

">Hierarchical microstructural tissue growth of the gray and white matter of human visual cortex during the first year of life</a></h4>

              
                Development of gray and white matter tissue microstructure is critical for the emergence of sensory and cognitive functions. However, it is unknown how microstructural tissue properties of the human visual system develop in the first year of human life. Here, we use tissue relaxation rate (R1) obtained using quantitative MRI to measure the longitudinal development of gray and white matter in brain areas spanning three visual processing streams: dorsal, lateral, and ventral, during the first year of life. R1 in gray and white matter of all visual regions in the three processing streams increases postnatally, indicating microstructural tissue growth. R1 increases faster between 0-6 months than 6-12 months, and faster in white matter than gray matter, with white matter R1 surpassing that of gray matter after two months of age. Strikingly, this microstructural growth is hierarchical: across all streams, early visual areas are more mature at birth than higher-level areas but develop more slowly postnatally than higher-level areas. The exception is TO1 (MT) which is similar to V1: it is microstructurally more mature at birth and develops slower than neighboring areas. Overall, our findings provide the first comprehensive measurement of microstructural tissue growth in infancy across three visual processing streams and propose a new hypothesis that functional development of the visual cortex may be coupled with microstructural development and follows a similar hierarchical trajectory.

">Non-cell autonomous control of presynaptic remodeling by the hypothalamic autophagy/NPY axis</a></h4>

              
                Macroautophagy/autophagy, a critical cellular degradation pathway essential for maintaining neuronal proteostasis, declines with age and has been increasingly implicated in the regulation of synaptic integrity and circuit resilience. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), the most abundantly expressed neuropeptide in the mammalian brain, has emerged as a key modulator of both autophagy and aging-related processes. In Drosophila, the NPY-family peptide short Neuropeptide F (sNPF) has been shown to causally influence aging-associated changes in synaptic architecture and function, particularly at the presynaptic active zone (AZ), via non-cell autonomous mechanisms.

Extending this concept to mammals, we investigated whether NPY and autophagy interact within NPY-secreting neurons to regulate age-related AZ remodeling. Our results indicate that hypothalamic NPY/AgRP neurons may exert geroprotective effects through the release of NPY and potentially other signaling molecules, thereby influencing both metabolic homeostasis and brain-wide synaptic function. These data suggest a conserved role for autophagy in maintaining presynaptic organization and resilience during aging.

">Visual Working Memory Guides Attention Rhythmically</a></h4>

              
                How does internal representation held in visual working memory (VWM), known as the attentional template, guide attention? A longstanding debate concerns whether only one (Single-Item-Template theory) or multiple (Multiple-Item-Template theory) items serve as attentional templates simultaneously. Here we propose a Rhythmic-Item-Template hypothesis, successfully reconciling these seemingly contradictory theories. Using the classical VWM-guided attention task, we found that two VWM items alternately dominate behavioral guidance in theta-rhythmic (4-8 Hz), with anti-correlated activation states in time, and more importantly, this rhythmic oscillation was not driven by the retro-cue processing. Neural recordings revealed that occipital alpha-oscillation (8-14 Hz) governed item-specific prioritization and its amplitude closely tracked subjects behavioral guidance, while frontal theta-oscillations phase-led and coupled with occipital alpha-oscillations during the item transition. Our Rhythmic-Item-Template results not only resolve previous Single-Item-Template versus Multiple-Item-Template debate but also advance our understanding of how distributed brain rhythms coordinate flexible resource allocation in multi-item memory systems.

">Functional Specialization of Angular Gyrus and Precuneus Subregions for Perspective-Guided Autobiographical Memory Retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval involves goal-directed and reconstructive processes that unfold over time. A key feature of this process is the visual perspective adopted during remembering, which shapes subjective memory experience. Using fMRI, we cued participants to retrieve AMs from an own-eyes, observer, or natural perspective followed by an event probe. Our design dissociates preparatory (cue phase) and reconstructive (probe phase) mechanisms to isolate the neural signatures of retrieval orientation, the strategic use of cues to optimize retrieval. Whole-brain and ROI analyses revealed that the angular gyrus (AG) and precuneus support perspective-guided retrieval in distinct ways. During the cue phase, PGp showed greater activity for instructed perspectives than natural retrieval, consistent with preparatory perspective selection. During the probe phase, observer-perspective retrieval elicited greater activity in PGp and precuneus (7P), supporting sustained perspective maintenance. Brain-behavior models linked PGp and 7P activity to greater vividness and perspective stability, while precuneus (7M) activity was negatively associated with emotional intensity, especially in the observer condition. These findings reveal phase- and subregion-specific contributions of posterior parietal cortex to the subjective qualities of memory. AG subregions support goal-directed perspective selection and implementation, while precuneus subregions flexibly modulate phenomenological features during memory reconstruction.

">Combined Auditory, Tactile, and Visual fMRI Reveals Sensory-Biased and Supramodal Working Memory Regions in Human Frontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual vs. auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform N-back WM judgements in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula and pre-supplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual- and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUsing within-subject fMRI analyses of three different sensory modalities, we identify the fine-scale architecture of sensory-biased and supramodal working memory structures within human frontal cortex. Sixteen bilateral frontal lobe regions are identified: five auditory-biased, four visual-biased, two tactile-biased, and five multiple-demand / supramodal regions. These parcels are largely distinct with the notable exception that the visual-biased regions each partially overlap with supramodal regions, suggesting a tight link between visual and supramodal working memory representations. Sensory-biased frontal lobe regions form modality-specific networks with traditionally-identified posterior sensory cortical regions. The findings demonstrate a pervasive role for sensory modality in the functional organization of frontal cortex and offer a fine-scale parcellation of the human frontal lobe regions supporting working memory.

">Schizophrenia-associated 22q11.2 deletion elevates striatal acetylcholine and disrupts thalamostriatal projections to produce amotivation in mice</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, hallucinations, and negative symptoms such as amotivation. Negative symptoms are largely resistant to current antipsychotic treatments, and the neural circuits underlying amotivational states remain poorly defined. Here, using a mouse model of schizophrenia-associated 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), we report amotivation and weakened glutamatergic synaptic transmission between the thalamic parafascicular nucleus (Pf) and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Thalamostriatal disruption is attributed to hyperactivity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CHIs), which is associated with enhanced Trpc3 and Pex51 (Trip8b) gene expression. Elevated acetylcholine levels in the DMS act on presynaptic M2 muscarinic receptors to weaken Pf-DMS glutamatergic transmission. Importantly, disruption of Pf-DMS synaptic transmission or hyperactivation of CHIs are each sufficient to cause amotivation in wild-type mice. These results identify a striatal hypercholinergic state and subsequent thalamostriatal disruption as core pathogenic events causing amotivation in 22q11DS, providing potential therapeutic targets.

">Twinfilin-1 phosphorylation in reelin signaling regulates actin dynamics and spine development</a></h4>

              
                Reelin is an extracellular glycoprotein essential for neuronal migration, spine development, and synaptic plasticity. Impaired reelin signaling is linked to neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. While reelin mutant (reeler) mice exhibit behavioral deficits associated with impaired spine formation, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identified Twinfilin-1 (Twf1) as a downstream effector of reelin signaling via phosphoproteomic analysis, based on its reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in reeler mice. We found that Src regulated Twf1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 309, and reelin stimulation increased Twf1 phosphorylation in neurons, an effect blocked by the Src inhibitor PP2. A phospho-resistant Twf1 mutant (Twf1 Y309F) showed reduced capping protein binding and a lower F/G-actin ratio. Twf1Y309F mice exhibited cognitive deficits, reduced spine density, smaller spine head size, and a decreased F/G-actin ratio in synaptosomes. These findings highlight Twf1 phosphorylation as a key component of reelin signaling involved in actin remodeling and spine development.

Data were retrieved from the Web of Science database, encompassing 5,020 publications focusing on AI in clinical neurology and neuroimaging. Among these, 2,687 were original research articles, predominantly published in English, with an average of 19.44 citations per article and an H-index of 90. Our analysis reveals a significant increase in publication activity, particularly after 2019, with the annual count peaking at 607 articles in 2024. The United States and China emerged as the leading contributors, and a strong positive correlation was found between publication productivity and both gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP purchasing power parity. However, no significant relationship was observed with the Human Development Index. Key research areas include radiology, psychiatry, and surgery, with machine learning and deep learning dominating the field. Regression models predict continued growth in AI-related research, underscoring its expanding role in advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

Furthermore, we found new (ie independent) genetic and environmental influences on brain activity at wave 2, again with regional patterns.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is associated with severe cognitive deficits. The condition involves impaired inhibitory control, and whether music therapy can be effective against it is unclear. Here we analyzed various pathophysiological markers of impaired inhibitory control and identified some that improved after music therapy. We assessed cognitive function in 41 patients with SHE in the Go/NoGo task and electroencephalographic activity before and after a single exposure to Mozart’s K. 448. The same assessments were performed in two types of controls, 41 patients with nocturnal epilepsy and 40 healthy individuals. SHE showed significantly longer reaction time, lower accuracy, later onset of theta bursts in the mid-frontal region. Severity of them correlated positively with reaction time. During music exposure, theta activity synchronized with the rhythm. Music significantly shortened reaction time and increased accuracy in patients with SHE, while also shortening the interval until the onset of theta bursts. Our results suggest that SHE involves frontal network damage affecting inhibitory control, and that music therapy can mitigate this damage by facilitating onset of theta bursts. It also indicates that theta bursts may be useful for assessing therapeutic efficacy and for exploring ways to mitigate cognitive deficits in epilepsy patients with frontal network deficits.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Vicarious decision-making is a fundamental to social interactions. Growing evidence suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying such decisions may vary according to interpersonal relationship types. However, the specific modulatory effects of romantic love on vicarious risk assessment and outcome evaluation during dynamic decision-making remain unclear. Against this background, we employed a computerized gambling task combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neurophysiological correlates of romantic love's influence on vicarious decision processes in romantically involved young adults (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 40) while also investigating comparative effects of maternal love. Our results showed relationship-specific risk cues and outcome processing patterns during vicarious decision-making. In detail, we found enhanced N100 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for romantic partner at the cue phase but increased P300 amplitudes to wins and attenuated LPP amplitudes to losses for mother at the feedback phase. Additionally, oscillatory analysis revealed reduced alpha band oscillation for self versus strangers and attenuated theta band oscillation for partners relative to mothers during low-risk conditions. Together, these findings demonstrate that vicarious risk and outcome processing are fundamentally shaped by interpersonal relationships, with romantic partners and mothers eliciting qualitatively distinct neural response patterns in romantically involved individuals.</span>

                <p>Dmrta2 (also designated Dmrt5) is a transcriptional regulator expressed in cortical progenitors in a caudomedial<sup>high</sup>/rostrolateral<sup>low</sup> gradient with important roles at different steps of cortical development. Dmrta2 has been suggested to act in cortex development mainly by differential suppression of <I>Pax6</I> and other homeobox transcription factors such as the ventral telencephalic regulator <I>Gsx2</I>, which remains to be fully demonstrated. Here we have addressed the epistatic relation between Pax6 and Dmrta2 by comparing phenotypes in mutant embryos or embryos overexpressing both genes in various allelic combinations. We show that Dmrta2 cooperates with Pax6 in the maintenance of cortical identity in dorsal telencephalic progenitors and that it acts as a transcriptional repressor of <I>Pax6</I> to control cortical patterning. Mechanistically, we show that in P19 cells, Dmrta2 acts as a DNA binding-dependent repressor on the <I>Pax6 E60</I> enhancer and that a point mutation that affects its DNA binding properties identified in a consanguineous family leads to agenesis of the corpus callosum, pachygyria, and the absence of the cingulate gyrus. Finally, we provide evidence that Dmrta2 binds components of the NuRD repressor complex and interacts with zinc finger proteins such as Zfp423. Together, our results highlight the importance and conserved function of Dmrta2 in cortical development and provide novel insights into its mechanism of action.</p>

                Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common oral cancers with a high mortality rate. The biodiversity source in Indonesia makes areca nut a potential antioxidant in treating disease. Objective The study aimed to evaluate the effect of areca nut extract on 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO)-tumor-induced rats. Methods Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 served as the control group, group 2 was 4NQO-induced rats without treatment, and groups 3 and 4 were given 4NQO-tumor inducer with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract, respectively. The rats in groups 2,3, and 4 received 30 ppm of 4NQO tumor inducer in drinking water for 12 weeks. In the end, all rats were euthanized, and the tongue was removed. The body, liver, kidney, heart, and lung weights were measured. Tongue tumor volume and dysplasia lesions were analyzed. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor and stromal areas were scored semi-quantitatively associating the infiltrate grade (0-3) and analyzed histologically. Results There were significant differences in body weight loss between the initial and final phases in groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The areca nut at 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW significantly reduced the tumor size compared with groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The incidence of OSCC in rats with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract after 22 weeks was 0%, but the dysplasia lesions were observed at 28.57% and 85.71%, respectively. The highest mean of stromal TILs was in group 3 and there were significant differences in stromal TILs between groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Conclusion Areca nut extract induced infiltrating lymphocytes in the stromal tumor area on the OSCC lesion of the tongue in 4NQO-induced rats.

                Background: After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it spread to 213 countries in 2020. In Indonesia there were 6,812,127 cases, which ranked 20th worldwide in the year 2024. In response, Indonesia issued a policy mandating mask use. This study aims to investigate the association between risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19 with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Methods This was an online study conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, during the first wave of COVID-19. Participants were provided written informed consent prior to agreeing or declining to voluntarily participate in the questionnaire-based study. A total of 1,153 respondents were selected. The dependent variable was consistent mask-wearing outside the home, while the independent variables were risk perception regarding COVID-19, sociodemographic factors (location, age, gender, education, occupation, family income, family members, social health scheme), and knowledge of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results The risk perception of COVID-19 as a viral disease that can cause death (aOR: 2.502; 95% CI: 1.601-3.912) was positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Regarding sociodemographic factor, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years (aOR: 0.486; 95% CI: 0.254-0.932) were 49% less likely to consistently use masks. Knowledge of the need to change cloth masks every 4-6 hours (aOR: 1.697; 95% CI: 1.118-2.576); the transmission (aOR: 1.974; 95%CI: 1.040-3.746), knowledge of severe symptoms of COVID-19 (aOR: 1.981; 95%CI: 1.175-3.342); and awareness of the confirmed diagnosis by PCR (aOR: 2.238; 95%CI: 1.215-4.120) were positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Conclusions The risk perception of COVID-19 as potentially fatal and knowledge regarding proper mask-changing intervals, the transmission, severe symptoms, and PCR-based diagnosis were positively associated with mask-wearing outside the home. However, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years were less likely to wear mask consistently. These findings underscore the importance of targeted public health interventions that address risk perception and enhance knowledge to promote mask use as effective COVID-19 prevention measures.

                <p>by Ryan J. Rowekamp, Tatyana O. Sharpee</p>

Biological visual systems are celebrated for their ability to reliably and precisely recognize objects. However, the specific neural mechanisms responsible for this capability remain largely elusive. In this study, we investigate neural responses in the visual areas V1, V2, and V4 of the brain to natural stimuli using a framework that includes quadratic computations in order to capture local recurrent interactions, both excitatory and suppressive. We find that these quadratic computations and specific coordination between their elements strongly increase both the predictive power of the model and the neural selectivity to natural stimuli. Particularly important were (i) coordination between excitatory and suppressive features to represent mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding incoming stimuli, such as orthogonal orientations or opposing motion directions in area V4, (ii) balance in the contribution of excitatory and suppressive components and its maintenance at similar levels across stages of processing, and (iii) refinement of feature selectivity between stages, with earlier stages representing broader category of inputs. Overall, this work describes how the brain could use multiple nonlinear mechanisms to increase selectivity of neural responses to natural stimuli.

T stem cell-like memory cells (T<sub>SCM</sub> cells) are considered to be essential for the maintenance of immune memory. The T<sub>SCM</sub> population has been shown to have the key properties of a stem cell population: multipotency, self-renewal and clonal longevity. Here we show that no single population has all these stem cell properties, instead the properties are distributed. We show that the human T<sub>SCM</sub> population consists of two distinct cell subpopulations which can be distinguished by the level of their CD95 expression (CD95int and CD95hi). Crucially, using long-term <i>in vivo</i> labelling of human volunteers, we establish that these are distinct populations rather than transient states of the same population. These two subpopulations have different functional profiles <i>ex vivo</i>, different transcriptional patterns, and different tissue distributions. They also have significantly different TREC content indicating different division histories and we find that the frequency of CD95hi T<sub>SCM</sub> increases with age. Most importantly, CD95hi and CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub> cells also have very different dynamics <i>in vivo</i> with CD95hi cells showing considerably higher proliferation but significantly reduced clonal longevity compared with CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub>. While both T<sub>SCM</sub> subpopulations exhibit considerable multipotency, no single population of T<sub>SCM</sub> cells has both the properties of self-renewal and clonal longevity. Instead, the “stemness” of the T<sub>SCM</sub> population is generated by the complementary dynamic properties of the two subpopulations: CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub> which have the property of clonal longevity and CD95hi T<sub>SCM</sub> which have the properties of expansion and self-renewal. We suggest that together, these two populations function as a stem cell population.

                Background The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a pressing need for exploring new natural compounds with innovative mechanisms to replace existing antibiotics. Bacteriocins offer promising alternatives for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies in livestock, aquaculture, and human health. Specifically, those produced by LAB are recognized as GRAS and QPS. This study aims to develop a deep learning model specifically designed to classify bacteriocins by their LAB origin, using interpretable k-mer features and embedding vectors to enable applications in antimicrobial discover. Methods We developed a deep learning neural network for binary classification of bacteriocin amino acid sequences (BacLAB vs. Non-BacLAB). Features were extracted using k-mers (k=3,5,7,15,20) and vector embeddings (EV). Ten feature combinations were tested (e.g., EV, EV+5-mers+7-mers). Sequences were filtered by length (50–2000 AA) to ensure uniformity, and class balance was maintained (24,964 BacLAB vs. 25,000 Non-BacLAB). The model was trained on Google Colab, demonstrating computational accessibility without specialized hardware. Results The ‘5-mers+7-mers+EV’ group achieved the best performance, with k-fold cross-validation (k=30) showing: 9.90% loss, 90.14% accuracy, 90.30% precision, 90.10% recall and F1 score. Folder 22 stood out with 8.50% loss, 91.47% accuracy, and 91.00% precision, recall, and F1 score. Five sets of 100 LAB-specific k-mers were identified, revealing conserved motifs. Despite high accuracy, sequence length variation (50–2000 AA) may bias k-mer representation, favoring longer sequences. Additionally, experimental validation is required to confirm the biological activity of predicted bacteriocins. These aspects highlight directions for future research. Conclusions The model developed in this study achieved consistent results with those seen in the reviewed literature. It outperformed some studies by 3-10%. Its implementation in resource-limited settings is feasible via cloud platforms like Google Colab. The identified k-mers could guide the design of synthetic antimicrobials, pending further in vitro validation.

<p>Patients with suspected RPD were enrolled and followed at Mayo Clinic (Jacksonville, FL; January 2020 to October 2023) and Washington University (Saint Louis, MO; June 2016 to December 2019). Two dementia specialists independently reviewed clinical data and assigned diagnoses. Patients were diagnosed with RPD if they developed dementia within 1 year or incapacitation within 2 years of symptom onset. The associations between clinical features and causes and outcomes were explored via univariate and multivariate comparisons.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 248 patients with suspected RPD, 185 (74.6%) met criteria for RPD. Patients with RPD were older (62.6 ± 14.5 vs 55.2 ± 18.1 years; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.40, 7.31) or Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.38, 15.75). Visual agnosia (15/183; 8.2%), substantial brain atrophy (27/182; 14.8%), and periodic epileptiform discharges (11/151; 7.3%) were exclusively detected in patients with RPD. After controlling for age, intensive care unit admission (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.61, 14.12), lack of seizures (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.15, 5.31), abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (OR 2.01, 95% CI 0.997, 4.05), and cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count ≤5 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.60, 6.82) were also independently associated with RPD. Patients with RPD were more likely to die or develop severe dementia (mean time to outcome, 36.1 months; 95% CI 31.2–41.0).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Selected clinical features may identify patients with suspected RPD who are likely to continue to decline. Early recognition of these features may improve diagnostic accuracy and inform prognosis. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                There is a recognised need to further understand potential harms from the use of e-cigarettes and other non-tobacco oral nicotine products (ONPs), particularly among children and young people. This protocol describes a programme of work that aims to continually identify and classify the evolving international evidence base on the effects of these products on human health, trends in their use, and related interventions. In terms of its methods, we will produce and maintain a living evidence map, available in an online interactive format, and updated continually over the planned duration of the project (~5 years from registration). A wide range of electronic databases will be searched, with eligible articles including a focus on the use of e-cigarettes or ONPs in humans. Should satisfactory levels of machine performance be reached (by reference to human performance benchmarks), we intend to automate the bulk screening of articles for inclusion using Large Language Model (LLM) decisions. A similar approach will be applied to the automated coding of a range of characteristics of included articles, including their type of research, and the nature of harms and products being examined. In conjunction with the production of the living evidence map, we will produce regular descriptive surveillance reports (research digests) that will summarise the current contents of the map. Ongoing production and maintenance of this living evidence map and linked outputs will enable potential users – including across research, policy, and charitable sectors – to more efficiently establish an overview of the landscape of relevant research and surveil key developments.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prognostication in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs) remains challenging because of heterogeneous etiologies, pathophysiologies and, consequently, highly variable electroencephalograms (EEGs). Here, we use EEG patterns that are well-characterizable to create a latent map that positions novel EEGs along a continuum. We asses this map as a generalizable tool to extract prognostically valuable information from long-term EEG, by predicting outcome post-cardiac arrest as a first use case.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Categorizable EEGs across the health-disease continuum (wake [W], sleep [rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM (N1, N2, N3)], ictal-interictal-continuum [lateralized and generalized periodic discharges (LPD, GPD) and lateralized and generalized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA, GRDA)], seizures [SZ], burst suppression [BS]; 20,043 patients, 288,986 EEG segments) are arranged meaningfully in a low-dimensional space via a deep neural network, resulting in a universal map of EEG (UM-EEG). We assess prognostication after cardiac arrest (576 patients, recovery or death) based on long-term EEGs represented as trajectories in this continuous embedding space.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Classification of out-of-sample EEG match state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms while extending it to the currently largest set of classes across the health-disease continuum (mean area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUROCs] 1-vs-all classification: W, 0.94; REM, 0.92; N1, 0.85; N2, 0.91; N3, 0.98; GRDA, 0.97; LRDA, 0.97; SZ, 0.87; GPD, 0.99; LPD, 0.97; BS, 0.94). UM-EEG enables outcome prediction after cardiac arrest with an AUROC of 0.86 and identifies interpretable factors governing prognosis such as the distance to healthy states over time.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>UM-EEG presents a novel and physiologically meaningful representation to characterize brain states along the health-disease continuum. It offers new opportunities for personalized, long-term monitoring and prognostication. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27300?af=R">The FindMNDBiomarker Program: Protein Changes in Motor Neuron Disease/Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Postmortem Tissue and Biofluids</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Biomarkers of disease pathogenesis are critically needed for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to facilitate diagnosis and patient stratification into appropriate therapeutic trials. Proteomic studies offer significant potential to advance this, but reproducibility across laboratories is a key component toward identifying protein changes that can be translated into clinical applications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A combined analysis of 25 proteomic studies in human ALS biospecimens was performed to identify proteins consistently altered in ALS postmortem tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, or blood, as well as across primary regions of ALS pathology and peripheral biofluids. We consolidated these datasets into a user-friendly database “FindMND Biomarker,” which is an accessible search tool that allows users to quickly determine how often, and in which biospecimen types, their proteins of interest are dysregulated in patients with ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our combined analysis identified 1,458 altered proteins in ALS, and revealed consistent dysregulation in mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and RNA binding proteins in primary and later affected regions of ALS pathology. Remarkable consistency in the direction and dysregulation of chitinases and gelsolin proteins were observed across ALS biofluids. Comparisons of postmortem tissue and biofluids reinforce several known protein changes, and highlighted novel proteins of interest that may drive disease pathogenesis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The biospecimen type in which protein dysregulation is most consistently identified provides important insight into disease, and whether these represent potential measures of disease pathogenesis or systemic changes. By streamlining proteins by reproducibility and biospecimen type, FindMNDBiomarker is a useful resource that provides new mechanistic insights, and facilitates the prioritization of ALS-associated proteins for further validation and investigation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the timing of change of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) from six different assay platforms, alongside established AD biomarkers, using amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET)-based AD progression timelines.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 784 individuals with longitudinal amyloid PET and 359 with longitudinal tau PET, were analyzed to estimate the age at amyloid and tau PET positivity, respectively. Longitudinal plasma biomarker measurements were available from 190 individuals with an estimated amyloid PET positivity age and from 70 individuals with an estimated tau PET positivity age. In a subset of 17 clinical progressors, age at tau PET positivity strongly predicted symptom onset, allowing for estimation of symptom onset age. Biomarker trajectories based on time from amyloid or tau PET positivity or symptom onset were modelled using Generalized Additive Mixed models. Time intervals of significant biomarker change and the earliest timepoints at which biomarkers exceeded predefined abnormality thresholds were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All plasma biomarkers except NfL became abnormal prior to established thresholds for amyloid and tau PET positivity. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 became abnormal very early in both amyloid PET and tau PET timelines, while plasma GFAP became abnormal early in the tau PET timeline. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels plateaued, whereas plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL levels increased throughout the modeled disease progression. Some variations in the timing of these changes were observed across different biomarker assays.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 may be useful in identifying individuals with very low levels of amyloid pathology, whereas p-tau, GFAP, and NfL may be useful in staging disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective was to evaluate the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in an international cohort of patients with <i>VPS16</i>-related dystonia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational study collected preoperative and postoperative demographic, clinical, stimulation, genetic, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological data of medically refractory DYT-<i>VPS16</i> patients with implanted DBS in 10 international centers. Motor symptoms and disability outcomes were assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale Motor (BFMDRS-M) and Disability (BFMDRS-D) scales. A cut-off threshold for considering response to DBS was set at 25% of BFMDRS-M improvement at the last follow-up (FU) compared to baseline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cohort consisted of 26 participants (17 men, 65.4%). Age at dystonia onset and surgery was 17.8 ± 10.9 and 35.3 ± 14.8 years, respectively. At the last FU, 102.5 ± 57.3 months (range, 2–216), the mean BFMDRS-M improvement was 41.6 ± 37.3% (26/26 patients) and 34.8 ± 42.6% for the BFMDRS-D (23/26 patients). Most patients (19/26, 73%) were considered responders. Higher motor improvement was associated with stimulation of the ventroposterior portion of the internal globus pallidus. A significant inverse relationship was observed between improvement in BFMDRS-M at last FU, and the presence of spasticity (<i>p</i> = 0.027) and fixed skeletal deformities (<i>p</i> = 0.001) before surgery. Non-responders had a younger age at disease onset and at implantation, shorter disease duration at DBS surgery, and higher baseline BFMDRS scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DBS was an effective treatment for three-quarters of patients with pathogenic <i>VPS16</i> variants in our cohort. Mean motor improvement was most pronounced at the 1-year FU, but persisted at the last FU despite disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Long-read RNA sequencing technologies can produce complete or near-complete transcript sequences. Recently introduced methods for direct RNA and cDNA sequencing can provide a high-throughput strategy for the discovery of novel and rare gene isoforms. However, the high error rates in ONT sequences limit the ability to exactly pinpoint splice site boundaries when aligning reads to the genome. Methods In this paper, we present a novel tool called NIFFLR (Novel IsoForm Finder using Long Reads) that identifies and quantifies both known and novel isoforms using long-read RNA sequencing data. NIFFLR recovers known transcripts and assembles novel transcripts present in the data by aligning exons from a reference annotation to the long reads. Results NIFFLR effectively recovers correct transcripts from simulated reads based on known transcript annotations, achieving higher sensitivity and precision compared to several previously-published tools. On real data, NIFFLR shows the high accuracy as measured by concordance of isoform counts to the counts computed from Illumina data for the same sample. We applied NIFFLR to a set of 92 GTEx long-read samples and produced transcript counts for both novel and known isoforms. In total, we identified and quantified 121,155 isoforms present in the RefSeq annotation of GRCh38 and 106,667 high-confidence novel isoforms across 32,875 genes present in two or more samples in these data, more than previous studies identified in this data set. Conclusions NIFFLR is an effective tool aimed at assembly and quantification of transcripts present in the long high error transcriptome reads. NIFFLR is released under an open-source license (GPL 3.0) and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/alguoo314/NIFFLR/releases.

                Background Long Covid is defined as conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection more than 3 months. This study aimed to analyze the point prevalence and predictors of long Covid in the Omicron variant dominant epidemic at 3 and 6 months in Thailand. Methods Prospective cohort study on the COVID-19 cohort at Thammasat University Hospital (TUH) and Thammasat Field Hospital (TFH) during the Omicron variant dominant epidemic was performed. The phone interview for long Covid symptoms was performed among 1,388 patients at 3 months and 917 patients at 6 months after the infection. Clinical characteristics of all participants were retrieved from the database of the hospital. Results The point prevalence of long Covid was 52.59% at 3 months and 28.57% at 6 months. The most prevalent symptom group at both time points was fatigue and weakness, affecting 31.70% of patients at 3 months and 15.81% at 6 months. Three significant predictors of long Covid were identified at both 3 and 6 months: severe-to-critical illness during the acute phase, female sex, and healthcare worker occupation. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for severe-to-critical illness were 4.50 [95% CI, 1.59–12.75] at 3 months and 9.15 [95% CI, 1.35–62.10] at 6 months. Female sex was associated with aORs of 2.04 [95% CI, 1.61–2.58] at 3 months and 2.41 [95% CI, 1.71–3.34] at 6 months. Healthcare workers had aORs of 1.96 [95% CI, 1.39–2.78] at 3 months and 3.12 [95% CI, 1.85–5.27] at 6 months. Obesity was a significant predictor of long Covid only at 3 months. Conclusions The prevalence of long Covid remains substantial following the Omicron variant-dominant epidemic. Key predictors of long Covid at both 3 and 6 months include severe-to-critical illness during the acute phase, female sex, and healthcare worker occupation.

                Background DataSHIELD is a mature, R-based federated learning platform that enables multi-site analysis without sharing individual participant data. While DataSHIELD includes many packages for data analysis, it lacks user-friendly data manipulation tools. Methods To address this gap, we developed dsTidyverse, an implementation of selected functions from the popular Tidyverse package within the DataSHIELD client-server architecture. Disclosure checks were implemented to prevent individual-level data leakage. Results This package provides functionality for selecting, renaming, and creating columns; conditional recoding; combining data frames by rows or columns; filtering and arranging rows; grouping and ungrouping data; and converting data frames to tibbles. Through examples, we demonstrate how dsTidyverse simplifies common data manipulation tasks within DataSHIELD. Conclusions By providing additional data manipulation functionality, dsTidyverse improves the user experience and analytical efficiency within DataSHIELD. The package is open-source and freely available on CRAN and GitHub, and welcomes further development: https://github.com/molgenis/ds-tidyverse.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-605/v1?src=rss">Imbalances in the Content of Sleep and Pain Assessments in Patients with Chronic Pain: A Scoping Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sleep disturbances frequently occur in concomitance with chronic pain, exacerbating its detrimental effects and diminishing patients’ quality of life. Although various studies have explored the relationship between chronic pain and sleep disturbances, comprehensive evidence on detailed assessment methods and their bidirectional interactions remains limited. This scoping review aimed to examine the characteristics and prevalence of assessment methods for sleep and pain-related outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. Methods A comprehensive search of nine databases identified observational and interventional studies examining the relationship between sleep disturbances/disorders and chronic pain in adults. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) as well as gray literature sources, Open Grey. In addition, the following trial registries were searched for ongoing or unpublished trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Results This review included 81 of 3,513 studies. Approximately 90.1% of studies relied on self-report sleep assessments, whereas only 9.9% incorporated objective measures. Additionally, 7.4% of studies used a combination of self-report and objective sleep assessments. The visual analog and numeric rating scales were the most frequently used methods for assessing pain-related outcomes (58.0%). Despite extensive research on sleep and chronic pain, critical gaps persist, particularly in the integration of multidimensional assessment tools. Conclusions This scoping review discovered imbalances in the content of both sleep and pain assessments. Future studies should integrate both objective and self-report assessment tools to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this interaction.

                Background Malnutrition impairs immune function and vaccine responses, particularly in low-income settings. This can lead to reduced seroconversion rates and compromised herd immunity in children. Nutritional interventions have been proposed to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, yet evidence remains scattered and context specific. Objective This systematic review assesses the impact of nutritional interventions—especially vitamin A, zinc supplementation, and protein-energy rehabilitation—on serological responses to routine childhood vaccines among malnourished children in low- and middle-income countries. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Health Library for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews reporting on nutritional supplementation and vaccine seroconversion outcomes in malnourished children. Results From 3,245 records, 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A supplementation improved measles vaccine seroconversion by 35%, especially among deficient children. Zinc enhanced responses to oral vaccines by 20%. Protein-energy rehabilitation significantly increased seroconversion rates for BCG and measles vaccines, particularly in children recovering from severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion Nutritional interventions improve vaccine immunogenicity among malnourished children. Integrated strategies combining immunization and nutrition services should be prioritized to address immunity gaps in vulnerable populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1388/v2?src=rss">Traditional opal mining practice in Ethiopia, challenges and its economic impact on rural households: the case of wollo opal mining [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The discovery spurred further exploration, leading to the expansion of opal mining into neighboring districts. Numerous cooperative groups, composed of small-scale miners, traditionally explore, develop, and extract significant amounts of rough opal gemstones. This study tries to investigate the challenges and economic impacts of traditional opal mining practice in wollo province of Ethiopia. Methods The study used in this study is primary data collected from rural households, which are living in five districts of north wollo zone, in Amhara regional state. The data was collected using field observation, focus grouped discussion, interview, and questionnaire from sampled households. The study uses both descriptive and econometric methods of data analysis to achieve its objective. Results Among the challenges of traditional opal mining, primitive way of exploring and extraction, limited access to market and low institutional support in terms of training and finance are identified. The probit model reveals that, increased education, access to training, and access to credit positively influence the likelihood of engaging in opal mining. The ESR model shows that, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) indicates that participating in opal mining increases monthly income by 31,380 ETB, while the average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU) shows a potential income increase of 31,625 ETB for non-miners if they engaged in mining. Conclusion The study identifies three main categories of challenges faced by traditional opal miners: exploration and extraction issues, market limitations, and regulatory and institutional shortcomings. Exploration and extraction challenges include the lack of modern mining tools and knowledge, as well as difficult terrain, leading to inefficient and hazardous mining practices. Market-related challenges involve limited access to broader markets and lack of value addition, resulting in miners selling raw opals at significantly lower prices compared to polished ones.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-444/v2?src=rss">Region-wise landmarks-based feature extraction employing SIFT, SURF, and ORB feature descriptors to recognize Monozygotic twins from 2D/3D Facial Images [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background In computer vision and image processing, face recognition is increasingly popular field of research that identifies similar faces in a picture and assigns a suitable label. It is one of the desired detection techniques employed in forensics for criminal identification. Methods This study explores face recognition system for monozygotic twins utilizing three widely recognized feature descriptor algorithms: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)—with region-specific facial landmarks. These landmarks were extracted from 468 points detected through the MediaPipe framework, which enables simultaneous recognition of multiple faces. Quantitative similarity metrics t served as inputs for four classification methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM), and Nearest Centroid (NC). The effectiveness of these algorithms was tested and validated using challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets, the most difficult data sets for 2D and 3D face recognition research at Notre Dame University. Results Testing with Notre Dame University’s challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets revealed significant performance differences. Results demonstrated that 2D facial images achieved notably higher recognition accuracy than 3D images. The 2D images produced accuracy of 88% (SVM), 83% (LGBM), 83% (XGBoost), and 79% (NC). In contrast, the 3D TEC dataset yielded a lower accuracy r of 74%, 72%, 72%, and 70%, with the same classifiers. Conclusion The hybrid feature extraction approach proved most effective, with maximum accuracy rates reaching 88% for 2D facial images and 74% for 3D facial images. This work contributes significantly to forensic science by enhancing the reliability of facial recognition systems when confronted with indistinguishable facial characteristics of monozygotic twins.

                A specific neuronal population in the brain encoding D-glucose, the brain’s main fuel, has been proposed but not yet identified. Kim et al. discovered a circuit involving CRFPVN neurons, fasting-activated PBNdl neurons, and lumbar spinal neurons that together encode the identity of D-glucose, revealing a potential glucose-sensing neural pathway.

                Two co-resident temperate archaeal viruses, SNJ1 and SNJ2, and their shared host establish a mutualistic relationship, where SNJ2-encoded type IV pilins assemble into T4P filaments important for host biofilm formation and motility and are used by SNJ1 as a primary receptor. Reciprocally, SNJ1 strongly enhances SNJ2 replication efficiency.
