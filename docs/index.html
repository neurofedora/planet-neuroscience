                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00315">KLHL1 Controls CaV3.2 Expression in DRG Neurons and Mechanical Sensitivity to Pain</a></h4>

<p>Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons process pain signaling through specialized nociceptors located in their peripheral endings. It has long been established low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 calcium channels control neuronal excitability during sensory perception in these neurons. Silencing Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 activity with antisense RNA or genetic ablation results in anti-nociceptive, anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effects. Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 channels are regulated by many proteins (Weiss and Zamponi, 2017), including KLHL1, a neuronal actin-binding protein that stabilizes channel activity by recycling it back to the plasma membrane through the recycling endosome. We explored whether manipulation of KLHL1 levels and thereby function as a Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 modifier can modulate DRG excitability and mechanical pain transmission or sensitivity to pain. We first assessed the mechanical sensitivity threshold and DRG properties in the KLHL1 KO mouse model. KO DRG neurons exhibited smaller T-type current density compared to WT without significant changes in voltage dependence, as expected in the absence of its modulator. Western blot analysis confirmed Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 but not Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1, or Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 protein levels were significantly decreased; and reduced neuron excitability and decreased pain sensitivity were also found in the KLHL1 KO model. Analogously, transient down-regulation of KLHL1 levels in WT mice with viral delivery of anti-KLHL1 shRNA also resulted in decreased pain sensitivity. These two experimental approaches confirm KLHL1 as a physiological modulator of excitability and pain sensitivity, providing a novel target to control peripheral pain.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01381">Vesicular Dysfunction and the Pathogenesis of Parkinson’s Disease: Clues From Genetic Studies</a></h4>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder with disabling motor symptoms and no available disease modifying treatment. The majority of the PD cases are of unknown etiology, with both genetics and environment playing important roles. Over the past 25 years, however, genetic analysis of patients with familial history of Parkinson’s and, latterly, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided significant advances in our understanding of the causes of the disease. These genetic insights have uncovered pathways that are affected in both genetic and sporadic forms of PD. These pathways involve oxidative stress, abnormal protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal defects. In addition, newly identified PD genes and GWAS nominated genes point toward synaptic changes involving vesicles. This review will highlight the genes that contribute PD risk relating to intracellular vesicle trafficking and their functional consequences. There is still much to investigate on this newly identified and converging pathway of vesicular dynamics and PD, which will aid in better understanding and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for PD patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01348">A Comparison of Functional Networks Derived From Representational Similarity, Functional Connectivity, and Univariate Analyses</a></h4>

<p>The invention of representational similarity analysis [RSA, following multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA)] has allowed cognitive neuroscientists to identify the representational structure of multiple brain regions, moving beyond functional localization. By comparing these structures, cognitive neuroscientists can characterize how brain areas form functional networks. Univariate analysis (UNIVAR) and functional connectivity analysis (FCA) are two other popular methods to identify functional networks. Despite their popularity, few studies have examined the relationship between networks from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA. Thus, the aim of the current study is to examine the similarities between neural networks derived from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA to explore how these methods relate to each other. We analyzed the data of a previously published study with the three methods and compared the results by performing (partial) correlation and multiple regression analysis. Our findings reveal that neural networks resulting from RSA, UNIVAR, and FCA methods are highly similar to each other even after ruling out the effect of anatomical proximity between the network nodes. Nevertheless, the neural network from each method shows unique organization that cannot be explained by any of the other methods. Thus, we conclude that the RSA, UNIVAR and FCA methods provide similar but not identical information on how brain regions are organized in functional networks.</p>

<p>Pentraxins are a superfamily of evolutionarily conserved proteins that are characterized by their multimeric architecture and their calcium-dependent binding. They can be broadly grouped into two subfamilies: short pentraxins and long pentraxins. Pentraxins regulate many processes in the brain as well as the periphery. Neuronal pentraxin 2 (NP2/NPTX2), also known as neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (Narp), is an immediate-early gene that has been shown to play a critical role in guiding synaptic plasticity. NP2 has been previously linked to excitatory neurotransmission, based on its ability to aggregate excitatory receptors in the central nervous system. The mechanisms mediating the effects of NP2 on excitatory neurotransmission remain unclear and warrants further investigation. This review article focuses on the biological features of NP2 and discusses the literature supporting a role for NP2 and other pentraxins in glutamatergic signaling. An analysis of evidence around the role of pentraxins in neuropathology is also reviewed.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder in the central nervous system (CNS), in which remyelination failure results in persistent neurologic impairment. Ginkgolide B (GB), a major terpene lactone and active component of Ginkgo biloba, has neuroprotective effects in several models of neurological diseases. Here, our results show, by using an in vivo cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model, administration of GB improved behavior abnormalities, promoted myelin generation, and significantly regulated the dynamic balance of microglia and astrocytes by inhibiting the expression of TLR4, NF-κB and iNOS as well as IL-1β and TNF-α, and up-regulating the expression of Arg-1 and neurotrophic factors. GB treatment also induced the generation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). In vitro cell experiments yielded the results similar to those of the in vivo model. The dynamic balance by decreasing microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and promoting astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factors should contribute to endogenous remyelination. Despite GB treatment may represent a novel strategy for promoting myelin recovery, the precise mechanism of GB targeting microglia and astrocytes remains to be further explored.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00568">Activation of Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response in SHSY5Y Expressing APP Cells and APP/PS1 Mice</a></h4>

<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) deposition is a major neuropathologic feature of AD. When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in mitochondria, the unfolded protein responses (UPRmt) is initiated. Numerous lines of evidence show that AD pathogenesis involves mitochondrial dysfunction. However little is known about whether the UPRmt is engaged in the process of AD development. In this study, we investigated the UPRmt in mouse and cell models of AD. We found that UPRmt was activated in the brain of 3 and 9 months old APP/PS1 mice, and in the SHSY5Y cells after exposure to Aβ<sub>25–35</sub>, Aβ<sub>25–35</sub> triggered UPRmt in SHSY5Y cells could be attenuated upon administration of simvastatin or siRNA for HMGCS-1 to inhibit the mevalonate pathway, and or upon knocking down Serine palmitoyltransferase long chain subunit 1 (SPTLC-1) to lower sphingolipid biosynthesis. We observed that inhibition of UPRmt aggravated cytotoxic effects of Aβ<sub>25–35</sub> in SHSY5Y cells. Our research suggests that the UPRmt activation and two pathways necessary for this response, and further provides evidence for the cytoprotective effect of UPRmt during the AD process.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00564">Social Stress-Induced Postsynaptic Hyporesponsiveness in Glutamatergic Synapses Is Mediated by PSD-Zip70-Rap2 Pathway and Relates to Anxiety-Like Behaviors</a></h4>

<p>PSD-Zip70 is a postsynaptic protein that regulates glutamatergic synapse formation and maturation by modulation of Rap2 activity. PSD-Zip70 knockout (PSD-Zip70KO) mice exhibit defective glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with aberrant Rap2 activation. As prefrontal dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-induced psychiatric diseases, we examined PSD-Zip70KO mice in a social defeat (SD) stress-induced mouse model of depression to investigate stress-induced alterations in synaptic function. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, PSD-Zip70KO mice exhibited almost normal responses to SD stress in depression-related behaviors such as social activity, anhedonia, and depressive behavior. However, PSD-Zip70KO mice showed enhanced anxiety-like behavior irrespective of stress conditions. The density and size of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons were reduced in the medial PFC (mPFC) in mice exposed to SD stress. Phosphorylation levels of the AMPA–type glutamate receptor (AMPA-R) GluA2 subunit at Ser880 were prominently elevated in mice exposed to SD stress, indicating internalization of surface-expressed AMPA-Rs and decreased postsynaptic responsiveness. Structural and functional impairments in postsynaptic responsiveness were associated with Rap2 GTPase activation in response to SD stress. Social stress-induced Rap2 activation was regulated by a PSD-Zip70-dependent pathway via interaction with SPAR/PDZ-GEF1. Notably, features such as Rap2 activation, dendritic spine shrinkage, and increased GluA2 phosphorylation were observed in the mPFC of PSD-Zip70KO mice even without SD stress. Together with our previous results, the present findings suggest that SD stress-induced postsynaptic hyporesponsiveness in glutamatergic synapses is mediated by PSD-Zip70-Rap2 signaling pathway and closely relates to anxiety-like behaviors.</p>

<p>Reelin is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein secreted by several neuronal populations in a specific manner in both the developing and the adult central nervous system. The extent of Reelin protein distribution and its functional role in the adult neocortex is well documented in different mammal models. However, its role in the adult spinal cord has not been well characterized and its distribution in the rodent spinal cord is fragmentary and has not been investigated in carnivores or primates as of yet. To gain insight into which neuronal populations and specific circuits may be influenced by Reelin in the adult spinal cord, we have conducted light and confocal microscopy study analysis of Reelin-immunoreactive cell types in the adult spinal cord. Here, we describe and compare Reelin immunoreactive cell type and distribution in the spinal cord of adult non-human primate (macaque monkeys, Macaca mulatta), carnivore (ferret, Mustela putorius) and rodent (rat, Rattus norvegicus). Our results show that in all three species studied, Reelin-immunoreactive neurons are present in the intermediate gray matter, ventricular zone and superficial dorsal horn and intermedio-lateral nucleus, while positive cells in the Clarke nucleus are only found in rats and primates. In addition, Reelin intermediolateral neurons colocalize with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) only in macaque whilst motor neurons also colocalize Reelin and ChAT in macaque, ferret and rat spinal cord. The different expression patterns might reflect a differential role for Reelin in the pathways involved in the coordination of locomotor activity in the fore- and hind limbs.</p>

<p>Age-related brain changes likely contribute to mobility impairments, but the specific mechanisms are poorly understood. Current brain measurement approaches (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), PET) are limited by inability to measure activity from the whole brain during walking. The Mind in Motion Study will use cutting edge, mobile, high-density electroencephalography (EEG). This approach relies upon innovative hardware and software to deliver three-dimensional localization of active cortical and subcortical regions with good spatial and temporal resolution during walking. Our overarching objective is to determine age-related changes in the central neural control of walking and correlate these findings with a comprehensive set of mobility outcomes (clinic-based, complex walking, and community mobility measures). Our hypothesis is that age-related walking deficits are explained in part by the Compensation Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH). CRUNCH is a well-supported model that describes the over-recruitment of brain regions exhibited by older adults in comparison to young adults, even at low levels of task complexity. CRUNCH also describes the limited brain reserve resources available with aging. These factors cause older adults to quickly reach a ceiling in brain resources when performing tasks of increasing complexity, leading to poor performance. Two hundred older adults and twenty young adults will undergo extensive baseline neuroimaging and walking assessments. Older adults will subsequently be followed for up to 3 years. Aim 1 will evaluate whether brain activity during actual walking explains mobility decline. Cross sectional and longitudinal designs will be used to study whether poorer walking performance and steeper trajectories of decline are associated with CRUNCH indices. Aim 2 is to harmonize high-density EEG during walking with fNIRS (during actual and imagined walking) and fMRI (during imagined walking). This will allow integration of CRUNCH-related hallmarks of brain activity across neuroimaging modalities, which is expected to lead to more widespread application of study findings. Aim 3 will study central and peripheral mechanisms (e.g., cerebral blood flow, brain regional volumes, and connectivity, sensory function) to explain differences in CRUNCH indices during walking. Research performed in the Mind in Motion Study will comprehensively characterize the aging brain during walking for developing new intervention targets.</p>

<p>With the aging population, dementia is becoming one of the most serious and troublesome global public health issues. Numerous studies have been seeking for effective strategies to delay or block its progression, but with little success. In recent years, adiponectin (APN) as one of the most abundant and multifunctional adipocytokines related to anti-inflammation, regulating glycogen metabolism and inhibiting insulin resistance (IR) and anti-atherosclerosis, has attracted widespread attention. In this article, we summarize recent studies that have contributed to a better understanding of the extent to which APN influences the risks of developing dementia as well as its pathophysiological progression. In addition, some controversial results interlinked with its effects on cognitive dysfunction diseases will be critically discussed. Ultimately, we aim to gain a novel insight into the pleiotropic effects of APN levels in circulation and suggest potential therapeutic target and future research strategies.</p>

<p>Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and Z-drugs are compounds widely prescribed in medical practice due to their anxiolytic, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. Yet, their chronic use is associated with cases of abuse, dependence, and relapse in many patients. Furthermore, elderly people are susceptible to alterations in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics as well as to drug interaction due to polypharmacy. These situations increase the risk for the appearance of cognitive affectations and the development of pathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present work, there is a summary of some clinical studies that have evaluated the effect of BZDs and Z-drugs in the adult population with and without AD, focusing on the relationship between their use and the loss of cognitive function. Additionally, there is an assessment of preclinical studies focused on finding molecular proof on the pathways by which these drugs could be involved in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, available data (1990–2019) on BZD and Z-drug use among elderly patients, with and without AD, was compiled in this work. Finally, the relationship between the use of BZD and Z-drugs for the treatment of insomnia and the appearance of AD biomarkers was analyzed. Results pointed to a vicious circle that would worsen the condition of patients over time. Likewise, it put into relevance the need for close monitoring of those patients using BZDs that also suffer from AD. Consequently, future studies should focus on optimizing strategies for insomnia treatment in the elderly by using other substances like melatonin agonists, which is described to have a much more significant safety profile.</p>

<p>by Jeremy M. Chacón, Allison K. Shaw, William R. Harcombe</p>

The rate at which a species responds to natural selection is a central predictor of the species’ ability to adapt to environmental change. It is well-known that spatially-structured environments slow the rate of adaptation due to increased intra-genotype competition. Here, we show that this effect magnifies over time as a species becomes better adapted and grows faster. Using a reaction-diffusion model, we demonstrate that growth rates are inextricably coupled with effective spatial scales, such that higher growth rates cause more localized competition. This has two effects: selection requires more generations for beneficial mutations to fix, and spatially-caused genetic drift increases. Together, these effects diminish the value of additional growth rate mutations in structured environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1zrHuqOWGnQ" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is among a growing family of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques being developed to treat multiple neurocognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although small clinical trials in AD have reported positive effects on cognitive outcome measures, significant knowledge gaps remain, and little attention has been directed at examining the potential influence of TMS on AD pathogenesis. Our review briefly outlines some of the proposed neurobiological mechanisms of TMS benefits in AD, with particular emphasis on the modulatory effects on excitatory/inhibitory balance. On the basis of converging evidence from multiple fields, we caution that TMS therapeutic protocols established in young adults may have unexpected detrimental effects in older individuals or in the brain compromised by AD pathology. Our review surveys clinical studies of TMS in AD alongside basic research as a guide for moving this important area of work forward toward effective treatment development.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25664?af=R">Restoration of Somatosensory Function by Pairing Vagus Nerve Stimulation with Tactile Rehabilitation</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sensory dysfunction is a common consequence of many forms of neurological injury, including stroke and nerve damage. Rehabilitative paradigms that incorporate sensory retraining can provide modest benefits, but the majority of patients are left with lasting sensory loss. We have developed a novel strategy that uses closed‐loop vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with tactile rehabilitation to enhance synaptic plasticity and facilitate recovery of sensory function.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A clinical case report provides initial evidence that a similar implementation of closed‐loop VNS paired with a tactile rehabilitation regimen could improve recovery of somatosensory function. Here, we sought to build on these promising initial clinical data and rigorously evaluate the ability of VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation to improve recovery in an animal model of chronic sensory loss. The study design, including planned sample size, assessments, and statistical comparisons, was preregistered prior to beginning data collection (<a href="https://osf.io/xsnj5/" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">https://osf.io/xsnj5/</a>).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation resulted in a significant and nearly complete recovery of mechanosensory withdrawal thresholds. Equivalent tactile rehabilitation without VNS failed to improve sensory function. This VNS‐dependent restoration of sensory thresholds was maintained for several months after the cessation of stimulation, illustrating long‐term benefits. Moreover, VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation resulted in significant generalized improvements in other measures of sensorimotor forepaw function.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Given the safety and tolerability of VNS therapy, these findings suggest that incorporating VNS paired with sensory retraining into rehabilitative regimens may represent a fundamentally new method to increase recovery of sensory function after neurological injury. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52775">Nucleotide inhibition of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel explored with patch-clamp fluorometry</a></h4>

Pancreatic ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>ATP</sub>) comprise four inward rectifier subunits (Kir6.2), each associated with a sulphonylurea receptor (SUR1). ATP/ADP binding to Kir6.2 shuts K<sub>ATP</sub>. Mg-nucleotide binding to SUR1 stimulates K<sub>ATP</sub>. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, SUR1 increases the apparent affinity for nucleotide inhibition at Kir6.2 by an unknown mechanism. We simultaneously measured channel currents and nucleotide binding to Kir6.2. Fits to combined data sets suggest that K<sub>ATP</sub> closes with only one nucleotide molecule bound. A Kir6.2 mutation  (C166S) that increases channel activity did not affect nucleotide binding, but greatly perturbed the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit K<sub>ATP</sub>. Mutations at position K205 in SUR1 affected both nucleotide affinity and the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit K<sub>ATP</sub>. This suggests a dual role for SUR1 in K<sub>ATP</sub> inhibition, both in directly contributing to nucleotide binding and in stabilising the nucleotide-bound closed state.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52474">The GTPase Nog1 co-ordinates assembly, maturation and quality control of distant ribosomal functional centers</a></h4>

Eukaryotic ribosome precursors acquire translation competence in the cytoplasm through stepwise release of bound assembly factors, and proofreading of their functional centers. In case of the pre-60S, these steps include removal of placeholders Rlp24, Arx1 and Mrt4 that prevent premature loading of the ribosomal protein eL24, the protein-folding machinery at the polypeptide exit tunnel (PET), and the ribosomal stalk, respectively. Here, we reveal that sequential ATPase and GTPase activities license release factors Rei1 and Yvh1 to trigger Arx1 and Mrt4 removal. Drg1-ATPase activity removes Rlp24 from the GTPase Nog1 on the pre-60S; consequently, the C-terminal tail of Nog1 is extracted from the PET. These events enable Rei1 to probe PET integrity, and catalyze Arx1 release. Concomitantly, Nog1 eviction from the pre-60S permits peptidyl transferase center maturation, and Yvh1 to mediate Mrt4 release for stalk assembly. Thus, Nog1 co-ordinates assembly, maturation and quality control of distant functional centers during ribosome formation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52063">The genetic basis of aneuploidy tolerance in wild yeast</a></h4>

Aneuploidy is highly detrimental during development yet common in cancers and pathogenic fungi – what gives rise to differences in aneuploidy tolerance remains unclear. We previously showed that wild isolates of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> tolerate chromosome amplification while laboratory strains used as a model for aneuploid syndromes do not. Here, we mapped the genetic basis to Ssd1, an RNA-binding translational regulator that is functional in wild aneuploids but defective in laboratory strain W303. Loss of <i>SSD1</i> recapitulates myriad aneuploidy signatures previously taken as eukaryotic responses. We show that aneuploidy tolerance is enabled via a role for Ssd1 in mitochondrial physiology, including binding and regulating nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, coupled with a role in mitigating proteostasis stress. Recapitulating <i>ssd1</i><i>D</i> defects with combinatorial drug treatment selectively blocked proliferation of wild-type aneuploids compared to euploids. Our work adds to elegant studies in the sensitized laboratory strain to present a mechanistic understanding of eukaryotic aneuploidy tolerance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51822">Vangl2 acts at the interface between actin and N-cadherin to modulate mammalian neuronal outgrowth</a></h4>

Dynamic mechanical interactions between adhesion complexes and the cytoskeleton are essential for axon outgrowth and guidance. Whether planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins, which regulate cytoskeleton dynamics and appear necessary for some axon guidance, also mediate interactions with membrane adhesion is still unclear. Here we show that Vangl2 controls growth cone velocity by regulating the internal retrograde actin flow in an N-cadherin-dependent fashion. Single molecule tracking experiments show that the loss of <i>Vangl2</i> decreased fast-diffusing N-cadherin membrane molecules and increased confined N-cadherin trajectories. Using optically manipulated N-cadherin-coated microspheres, we correlated this behavior to a stronger mechanical coupling of N-cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton. Lastly, we show that the spatial distribution of Vangl2 within the growth cone is selectively affected by an N-cadherin-coated substrate. Altogether, our data show that Vangl2 acts as a negative regulator of axonal outgrowth by regulating the strength of the molecular clutch between N-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51810">Attacks on genetic privacy via uploads to genealogical databases</a></h4>

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetics services are increasingly popular, with tens of millions of customers. Several DTC genealogy services allow users to upload genetic data to search for relatives, identified as people with genomes that share identical by state (IBS) regions. Here, we describe methods by which an adversary can learn database genotypes by uploading multiple datasets. For example, an adversary who uploads approximately 900 genomes could recover at least one allele at SNP sites across up to 82% of the genome of a median person of European ancestries. In databases that detect IBS segments using unphased genotypes, approximately 100 falsified uploads can reveal enough genetic information to allow genome-wide genetic imputation. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration in the GEDmatch database, and we suggest countermeasures that will prevent the exploits we describe.

Reduced copy number of ribosomal protein (<i>Rp</i>) genes adversely affects both flies and mammals. <i>Xrp1</i> encodes a reportedly <i>Drosophila</i>-specific AT-hook, bZIP protein responsible for many of the effects including the elimination of <i>Rp</i> mutant cells by competition with wild type cells. Irbp18, an evolutionarily conserved bZIP gene, heterodimerizes with Xrp1 and with another bZip protein, dATF4. We show that Irbp18 is required for the effects of Xrp1, whereas dATF4 does not share the same phenotype, indicating that Xrp1/Irbp18 is the complex active in <i>Rp</i> mutant cells, independently of other complexes that share Irbp18. Xrp1 and Irbp18 transcripts and proteins are upregulated in <i>Rp</i> mutant cells by auto-regulatory expression that depends on the Xrp1 DNA binding domains and is necessary for cell competition. We show that Xrp1 is conserved beyond <i>Drosophila</i>, although under positive selection for rapid evolution, and that at least one human bZip protein can similarly affect <i>Drosophila</i> development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49988">Compartmentalized <i>oskar</i> degradation in the germ plasm safeguards germline development</a></h4>

Partitioning of mRNAs into ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules supports diverse regulatory programs within the crowded cytoplasm. At least two types of RNP granules populate the germ plasm, a cytoplasmic domain at the posterior of the <i>Drosophila</i> oocyte and embryo. Germ granules deliver mRNAs required for germline development to pole cells, the germ cell progenitors. A second type of RNP granule, here named founder granules, contains <i>oskar</i> mRNA, which encodes the germ plasm organizer. Whereas <i>oskar</i> mRNA is essential for germ plasm assembly during oogenesis, we show that it is toxic to pole cells. Founder granules mediate compartmentalized degradation of <i>oskar</i> during embryogenesis to minimize its inheritance by pole cells. Degradation of <i>oskar</i> in founder granules is temporally and mechanistically distinct from degradation of <i>oskar</i> and other mRNAs during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Our results show how compartmentalization in RNP granules differentially controls fates of mRNAs localized within the same cytoplasmic domain.

Using measurements from three cohorts--the Union Army Veterans of the Civil War (N = 23,710; measurement years 1860–1940), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I (N = 15,301; 1971–1975), and the Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (N = 150,280; 2007–2017)--we determined that mean body temperature in men and women, after adjusting for age, height, weight and, in some models date and time of day, has decreased monotonically by 0.03°C per birth decade. A similar decline within the Union Army cohort as between cohorts, makes measurement error an unlikely explanation. This substantive and continuing shift in body temperature—a marker for metabolic rate—provides a framework for understanding changes in human health and longevity over 157 years.

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol motivational properties are still not fully understood, however, the mu-opioid receptors (MORs) have been evidenced as central elements in the manifestation of the alcohol reinforcing properties. Drug-associated environmental stimuli can trigger alcohol relapse and promote alcohol consumption whereby N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a pivotal role. Here we sought to demonstrate, for the first time, that ethanol induces conditioned place preference or aversion (CPP or CPA) when administered locally into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the associated role of MORs. We further analyzed the changes in the expression and mRNA levels of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits in designated brain areas. The expression of CPP or CPA was characterized following intra-VTA ethanol administration and we showed that either reinforcing (CPP) or aversive (CPA) properties are dependent on the dose administered (ranging here from 35 to 300 nmol). Furthermore, the critical contribution of local MORs in the acquisition of CPP was revealed by a selective antagonist, namely {beta}-Funaltrexamine. Finally, modifications of the expression of NMDA receptor subunits in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) and Hippocampus after ethanol-induced CPP were analyzed at the proteomic and transcriptomic levels by western blot and In Situ Hybridation RNAscope techniques, respectively. Results showed that the mRNA levels of GluN2A but not GluN1 in NAc are higher after ethanol CPP. These novel results pave the way for further characterisation of the mechanisms by which ethanol motivational properties are associated with learned environmental cues.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) drives circadian rhythms in locomotion through coupled, single-cell oscillations. Global genetic deletion of the neuropeptide, Vip or its receptor Vipr2, results in profound deficits in daily synchrony among SCN cells and daily rhythms in locomotor behavior and glucocorticoid secretion. To test whether this phenotype depends on VIP neurons in the SCN, we ablated VIP SCN neurons in vivo in adult mice through Caspase3-mediated induction of the apoptotic pathway in cre-expressing VIP neurons. We found that ablation of VIP SCN neurons in adult mice caused a phenotype distinct from Vip- and Vipr2- null mice. Mice lacking VIP neurons retained rhythmic locomotor activity with a shortened circadian period, more variable onsets and decreased duration of daily activity. Circadian hormonal outputs, specifically corticosterone rhythms were severely dampened. In contrast, deletion of neonatal SCN VIP neurons dramatically reduced circadian gene expression in the cultured SCN, mimicking the effects of global deletion of Vip or Vipr2. These results suggest that SCN VIP neurons play a role in lengthening circadian period and stimulating the daily surge in glucocorticoids in adults and in synchronizing and sustaining daily rhythms among cells in the developing SCN.

In adult rodents, a principal neuron in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid (MNTB) is generally contacted by a single, giant axosomatic terminal called the calyx of Held, but how this one-on-one relation is established is still unknown. Anatomical evidence suggests that during development principal neurons are innervated by multiple calyces, which may indicate calyceal competition, but in vivo electrophysiological recordings from principal neurons have indicated that only a single strong synaptic connection forms per cell. To test whether a mismatch between synaptic strength and terminal size exists, we compared strength of synaptic inputs during early postnatal development with the morphology of the synaptic terminals. In vivo whole-cell recordings of the MNTB neurons from newborn rats of either sex were made while stimulating their afferent axons, allowing us to identify multiple inputs. The strength of the strongest input increased to calyceal levels in a few days across cells, while the strength of the second strongest input was stable. Cells were subsequently immunolabeled for vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluT) to reveal axosomatic terminals. Synaptic strength of the strongest input was correlated with the contact area of the largest VGluT cluster at the soma. No clear mismatch was observed between structure and strength. Together, our data agree with a developmental scheme in which one input strengthens and becomes the calyx of Held, but not with multi-calyceal competition.

Very little is known about the role of effective cognitive therapy in reversing imbalances in brain activity after trauma. We hypothesised that exaggerated threat perception characteristic of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and subsequent recovery from this disorder, are underpinned by changes in the dynamics of large-scale brain networks. Here, we use a novel data-driven approach with high temporal precision to find recurring brain networks from fMRI data and estimate when these networks become active during exposure to either trauma reminders or neutral pictures. We found that PTSD patients spend less time in two default mode sub-networks in contrast to trauma-exposed healthy controls, and that PTSD symptom severity correlates positively with time spent in the salience network during exposure to trauma reminders. The former are important for different aspects of self-referential processing and the latter for detection of threat. Importantly, the decreased time in the default mode sub-networks is rebalanced after successful cognitive therapy for PTSD. Our results show that remittance of PTSD through trauma-focused cognitive therapy is associated with the successful reinstatement of a healthy balance in self-referential and threat detection brain networks.

Multimodal integration provides an ideal framework for investigating top-down influences in perceptual integration. Here, we investigate mechanisms and functional networks participating in face-voice multimodal integration during gender perception by using complementary behavioral (Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement) and brain imaging (Dynamic Causal Modeling of fMRI data) techniques. Thirty-six subjects were instructed to judge pairs of face-voice stimuli either according to the gender of the face (face task), the voice (voice task) or the stimulus (stimulus task; no specific modality instruction given). Face and voice contributions to the tasks were not independent, as both modalities significantly contributed to all tasks. The top-down influences in each task could be modeled as a differential weighting of the contributions of each modality with an asymmetry in favor of the auditory modality in terms of magnitude of the effect. Additionally, we observed two independent interaction effects in the decision process that reflect both the coherence of the gender information across modalities and the magnitude of the gender difference from neutral. In a second experiment we investigated with functional MRI the modulation of effective connectivity between the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and the Temporal Voice Area (TVA), two cortical areas implicated in face and voice processing. Twelve participants were presented with multimodal face-voice stimuli and instructed to attend either to face, voice or any gender information. We found specific changes in effective connectivity between these areas in the same conditions that generated behavioral interactions. Taken together, we interpret these results as converging evidence supporting the existence of multiple parallel hierarchical systems in multi-modal integration.

A fundamental open question is vision science is why humans can make accurate guesses about stimuli they report not consciously seeing. We show that the objective accuracy of discriminating the location of a subliminal stimulus can be predicted in trial-by-trial manner from low frequency (1-15 Hz) electroencephalographic activity present before the stimulus. Accurate discrimination of subliminal stimulus location was supported by prestimulus neural activity that optimally suppressed non-relevant ipsilateral cortical signals or increased the excitability of contralateral visual cortex to weak stimuli. The effect was present up to 1 second before the stimulus was presented. Signal detection analyses indicated that this subliminal perceptual capacity lied on the same continuum as conscious vision. The results demonstrate that subliminal perception is not a distinct capacity, but relies on the same top-down mechanisms as conscious vision.

When people can successfully recall a studied word, they should be able to recognize it as having been studied. In cued recall paradigms, however, participants sometimes correctly recall words in the presence of strong semantic cues but then fail to recognize those words as actually having been studied. Although the conditions necessary to produce this unusual effect are known, the underlying neural correlates have not been investigated. Across two experiments, involving both behavioral and electrophysiological methods (EEG), we investigated the cognitive and neural processes that underlie recognition failures. Experiments 1A and 1B showed that, in cued recall paradigms, presuming that recalled items can be recognized is a flawed assumption: Recognition failures occur in the presence of cues, regardless of whether those failures are measured. Experiment 2 showed that successfully recalled words that are recognized are driven by recollection at recall and by a combination of recollection and familiarity at recognition; in contrast, recognition failures are driven by semantic priming at recall and followed by negative-going ERP effects consistent with implicit processes such as repetition fluency and context familiarity at recognition. These results demonstrate that recall (long characterized as predominantly reflecting recollection-based processing in episodic memory) can at times also be served by a confluence of implicit cognitive processes.

Learned associations between stimuli allow us to model the world and make predictions, crucial for efficient behavior; e.g., hearing a siren, we expect to see an ambulance and quickly make way. While theoretical and computational frameworks for prediction exist, circuit and receptor-level mechanisms are unclear. Using high density EEG and Bayesian modeling, we show that trial history and frontal alpha activity account for reaction times (a proxy for predictions) on a trial by trial basis in an audio visual prediction task. Low dose ketamine, a NMDA receptor blocker, but not the control drug dexmedetomidine perturbed predictions, their representation in frontal cortex, and feedback to posterior cortex. This study suggests predictions depend on frontal alpha activity and NMDA receptors, and ketamine blocks access to learned predictive information.

Decoding is a powerful approach for measuring the information contained in the activity of neural populations. As a result, decoding analyses are now used across a wide range of model organisms and experimental paradigms. However, typical analyses employ general purpose decoding algorithms that do not explicitly take advantage of the structure of neural variability, which is often low-dimensional and can thus be effectively characterized using latent variables. Here we propose a new decoding framework that exploits the low-dimensional structure of neural population variability by removing correlated variability that is unrelated to the decoded variable, then decoding the resulting denoised activity. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework using simulated data, where the true upper bounds for decoding performance are known. A linear version of our decoder provides an estimator for the decoded variable that can be more efficient than other commonly used linear estimators such as linear discriminant analysis. In addition, our proposed decoding framework admits a simple extension to nonlinear decoding that compares favorably to standard feed-forward neural networks. By explicitly modeling shared population variability, the success of the resulting linear and nonlinear decoders also offers a new perspective on the relationship between shared variability and information contained in large neural populations.

Sustained attention is a limited resource which declines during daily tasks. Such decay is exacerbated in clinical and aging populations. Low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) has potential to upregulate neural activity within the attention network, evidenced by increased activation and functional communication. Attributed to functional compensation for the inhibited node, this boost outlasts the stimulation for tens of minutes. Despite the neural change, no behavioral effect has been found in healthy subjects, a necessary direct evidence of functional compensation. To understand the functional significance of neuromodulatory induced fluctuations on sustained attention, we sought to boost the impact of LF-rTMS through controlling neural excitability prior to LF-rTMS, with the goal to impact behavior. Brain state was controlled using high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (HF-tRNS), based on the evidence that HF-tRNS increases and stabilizes neuronal excitability. In male and female human participants, we tested several fMRI-guided stimulation protocols combining HF-tRNS and LF-rTMS. Sustained attention was recorded post-stimulation via a multiple object tracking task (MOT). Whilst attention deteriorated across time in the control condition, HF-tRNS followed by LF-rTMS maintained attention performance up to 94 minutes, doubling the length of successful sustained attention. These results suggest controlling brain state can increase the impact of LF-rTMS in bilateral sustained attention. Used in a cognitive domain dependent on network-wide neural activity, this tool may be effective in causing neural compensation important for clinical rehabilitation.

The mammalian visual system has been the focus of countless experimental and theoretical studies designed to elucidate principles of sensory coding. Most theoretical work has focused on networks intended to reflect developing or mature neural circuitry, in both health and disease. Few computational studies have attempted to model changes that occur in neural circuitry as an organism ages non-pathologically. In this work we contribute to closing this gap, studying how physiological changes correlated with advanced age impact the computational performance of a spiking network model of primary visual cortex (V1). Our results demonstrate that deterioration of homeostatic regulation of excitatory firing, coupled with long-term synaptic plasticity, is a sufficient mechanism to reproduce features of observed physiological and functional changes in neural activity data, specifically declines in inhibition and in selectivity to oriented stimuli. This suggests a potential causality between dysregulation of neuron firing and age-induced changes in brain physiology and performance. While this does not rule out deeper underlying causes or other mechanisms that could give rise to these changes, our approach opens new avenues for exploring these underlying mechanisms in greater depth and making predictions for future experiments.

Parkinson s disease (PD) is a common incurable neurodegenerative disease. The identification of genetic variants via genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has considerably advanced our understanding of the PD genetic risk. Understanding the functional significance of the risk loci is now a critical step towards translating these genetic advances into an enhanced biological understanding of the disease. Impaired mitophagy is a key causative pathway in familial PD, but its relevance to idiopathic PD is unclear. We used a mitophagy screening assay to evaluate the functional significance of risk genes identified through GWAS. We identified two new regulators of PINK1-mitophagy, KAT8 and KANSL1, previously shown to modulate lysine acetylation. These findings establish PINK1-mitophagy as a contributing factor to idiopathic PD. KANSL1 is located on chromosome 17q21 where the risk associated gene has long been considered to be MAPT. Our data provide evidence that this assignment is likely to be incorrect and that variability at KANSL1 underpins this association. Finally, these results enrich our understanding of physiological events regulating mitophagy and establish a novel pathway for drug targeting in neurodegeneration.

Efficiently controlling the movement of our hand requires coordinating the motion of multiple joints of the arm. Although it is widely assumed that this type of efficient control is implemented by processing that occurs in the cerebral cortex and brain stem, recent work has shown that spinal circuits can generate efficient motor output that supports keeping the hand in a static location. Here, we show that a spinal pathway can also efficiently control the hand during reaching. In our first experiment we applied multi-joint mechanical perturbations to participant's elbow and wrist as they began reaching towards a target. We found that spinal stretch reflexes evoked in elbow muscles were not proportional to how much the elbow muscles were stretched but instead were efficiently scaled to the hand's distance from the target. In our second experiment we applied the same elbow and wrist perturbations but had participants change how they grasped the manipulandum, diametrically altering how the same wrist perturbation moved the hand relative to the reach target. We found that changing the arm's orientation diametrically altered how spinal reflexes in the elbow muscles were evoked, and in such a way that were again efficiently scaled to the hand's distance from the target. These findings demonstrate that spinal circuits can help efficiently control the hand during dynamic reaching actions, and show that efficient and flexible motor control is not exclusively dependent on processing that occurs within supraspinal regions of the nervous system.

Objective: Hippocampal volume is a sensitive marker of neurodegeneration and a well-established predictor of age-related cognitive impairment. Recently, free-water (FW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown associations with pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is still unclear whether these metrics are associated with measures of cognitive impairment. Here, we investigate whether FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAT) within medial temporal lobe white matter tracts (cingulum, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and tapetum) provides meaningful contribution to cognition and cognitive decline beyond hippocampal volume. Participants and Methods: Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project participants (n=319, 73{+/-}7 years, 59% male) with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (40% of cohort) underwent baseline brain MRI, including structural MRI to quantify hippocampal volume, diffusion MRI to quantify medial temporal lobe white matter tract FW and FAT, and longitudinal neuropsychological assessment with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Linear regressions were conducted to determine how hippocampal volume and white matter tract FW and FAT interact with baseline memory and executive function performances. Competitive model analyses determined the unique variance provided by white matter tract FW and FAT beyond that of hippocampal volume and other comorbidities. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted to determine how baseline hippocampal volume and white matter tract FW and FAT interact to explain longitudinal change in memory and executive function performances. Results: FW in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus, and cingulum were robustly associated with baseline memory and executive function. Further, competitive model analysis showed that tract FW contributed unique variance beyond other comorbidities and hippocampal volume for memory ({Delta}Radj2 range: 0.82-2.00%) and executive function ({Delta}Radj2 range: 0.88-1.87%). Longitudinal analyses demonstrated significant interactions of hippocampal volume and FAT in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p=0.02), tapetum (p=0.02), uncinate fasciculus (p=0.02), and cingulum (p=0.002) with decline in memory. For decline in executive function, we found significant interactions of hippocampal volume and FAT in inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p=0.03), tapetum (p=0.02), uncinate fasciculus (p=0.02), and fornix (p=0.02), as well as cingulum (p=0.02) and fornix (p=0.02) FW. Conclusions: Our results highlight novel associations between FW and FAT measures of medial temporal lobe tract microstructure and cognitive performance such that individuals with smaller hippocampal volumes and lower tract microstructure experience greater cognitive decline. These results suggest that white matter has a unique role in cognitive decline and, therefore, could be used to provide better disease staging, allowing for more precise disease monitoring in AD.

Because of the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, identifying a statistical test that is both valid and maximally sensitive is an important challenge. Here, we present a combination of two approaches for fMRI data analysis that together result in substantial improvements of the sensitivity of cluster-based statistics. The first approach is to create novel cluster definitions that are sensitive to physiologically plausible effect patterns. The second is to adopt a new approach to combine test statistics with different sensitivity profiles, which we call the min(p) method. These innovations are made possible by using the randomization inference framework. In this paper, we report on a set of simulations that demonstrate (1) that the proposed methods control the false-alarm rate, (2) that the sensitivity profiles of cluster-based test statistics vary depending on the cluster defining thresholds and cluster definitions, and (3) that the min(p) method for combining these test statistics results in a drastic increase of sensitivity (up to five-fold), compared to existing fMRI analysis methods. This increase in sensitivity is not at the expense of the spatial specificity of the inference.

Learning to associate the context in which a stimulus occurs is an important aspect of animal learning. We propose that the association of an olfactory stimulus with its multisensory context is mediated by projections from ventral hippocampal networks (vHC) to the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). Using a contextually-cued olfactory discrimination task, rats were trained to associate two olfactory stimuli with different responses depending on visuo-spatial context. Temporary lesions of the AON or vHC impaired performance on this task. In contrast, such lesions did not impair performance on a non-contextual olfactory discrimination task. Moreover, vHC lesions also impaired performance on an analogous contextually-cued texture discrimination task, whereas AON lesions affected only olfactory contextual associations. We describe a distinct role for the AON in olfactory processing, and conclude that early olfactory networks such as the olfactory bulb and AON function as multimodal integration networks rather than processing olfactory signals exclusively.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.01.06.895912v1?rss=1">Sensory gating precedes motor command in evolution of the corticospinal tract</a></h4>

Throughout mammals evolution, the contribution of the corticospinal tract (CST) to motor control progressively increases, culminating in primates with tight control of skilled movements such as independent finger dexterity. Although cortico-motoneuronal connections have been shown to be absent or very rare in rodents, it is generally assumed by analogy with primates that the main function of the CST is to convey motor commands. Yet the CST has been shown to have other functions, such as sensory gating. By differentially filtering out sensory signals at their entry point in the spinal cord, sensory gating is thought to have evolved to increase the gain of relevant feedback information during voluntary movement to improve execution of skilled movements. Here we show that, unexpectedly, sensory gating is the essential function of the lumbar CST in mice while lumbar motor command mainly involves non-CST pathways. By sequentially investigating each stage of the corticofugal pathways for motor command and sensory gating, we found that they both originate in the same cortical area but follow segregated paths. The hindlimb motor command is mainly relayed through subcortical supraspinal motor centers, and is only anecdotally encoded by the CST, requiring a propiospinal relay in the upper cord. In contrast, corticospinal neurons are essential for sensory gating, and act directly through a population of lumbar interneurons. Our results reveal that the original function of the CST in mammals, still prominent in rodents, is sensory gating, not motor control. This pathway appears to have been later selected through evolution to serve other functions, such as refined motor commands, eventually yielding direct CST-to-motoneuron connection in primates. The rodent lumbar CST thus serves as a prototypical paradigm to study, in isolation, the primary role of CST in sensory gating.

A method for simultaneous electrochemical detection of brain tissue PO2 (PtO2) and pH changes together with neuronal activity using a modified form of fast cyclic voltammetry with carbon fiber electrodes is described. This technique has been developed for in vivo applications and recordings from discrete brain nuclei in experimental animals. The small size of the carbon fiber electrode (7m, length &lt;100m) ensures minimal disruption of the brain tissue and allows recordings from small brain areas. Sample rate (up to 4 Hz) is sufficient to resolve rapid changes in PtO2 and pH that follow changes in neuronal activity and metabolism. Rapid switching between current and voltage recordings allows combined electrochemical detection and monitoring of extracellular action potentials. For simultaneous electrochemical detection of PtO2 and pH, two consecutive trapezoidal voltage ramps are applied with double differential-subtraction of the background current. This enables changes in current caused by protons and oxygen to be detected separately with minimal interference between the two. The profile of PtO2 changes evoked by increases in local neuronal activity recorded using the described technique was similar to that of blood oxygen level dependent responses recorded using fMRI. This voltammetric technique can be combined with fMRI and brain vessel imaging to study the metabolic mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling response with much greater spatial and temporal resolution than is currently possible.

Accumulating evidence shows that auditory cortex (AC) of humans, and other primates, is involved in more complex cognitive processes than feature segregation only, which are shaped by experience-dependent plasticity and thus likely show substantial individual variability. However, thus far, individual variability of ACs has been considered a methodological impediment rather than a phenomenon of theoretical importance. Here, we examined the variability of ACs using intrinsic functional connectivity patterns in humans and macaques. Our results demonstrate that in humans, functional variability is 1) greater near the non-primary than primary ACs, 2) greater in ACs than comparable visual areas, and 3) greater in the left than right ACs. Remarkably similar modality differences and lateralization of variability were observed in macaques. These connectivity-based findings are consistent with a confirmatory task-based fMRI analysis. The quantitative proof of the exceptional variability of ACs has implications for understanding the evolution of advanced auditory functions in humans.

Background: No treatment exists for the most common dominantly inherited ataxia Machado-Joseph disease, or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Successful evaluation of candidate therapeutics will be facilitated by validated noninvasive biomarkers of aspects of disease pathology recapitulated by animal models. Objective: We sought to identify shared neurochemical signatures in two mouse models of SCA3 that reflect aspects of the human disease pathology. Methods: Cerebellar neurochemical concentrations in homozygous YACMJD84.2 (Q84/Q84) and hemizygous CMVMJD135 (Q135) mice were measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 9.4 tesla. Motivated by the shared neurochemical abnormalities in the two models, we determined the levels of neurofilament medium (NFL, indicator of neuroaxonal integrity) and myelin basic protein (MBP, indicator of myelination) in cerebellar lysates from a subset of mice and from patients with SCA3. Finally, NFL and MBP levels were measured in cerebellar extracts of Q84/Q84 mice upon sustained silencing of the mutant ATXN3 gene from 6-8 weeks-of-age until death. Results: Both Q84/Q84 and Q135 mice displayed lower N-acetylaspartate than wild-type littermates, indicating neuroaxonal loss/dysfunction, and lower myo-inositol and total choline, indicating disturbances in phospholipid membrane metabolism and demyelination. Cerebellar NFL and MBP levels were accordingly lower in both models as well as in the cerebellar cortex of patients with SCA3 than controls. Furthermore, long-term sustained RNAi-mediated reduction of ATXN3 levels increased NFL and MBP in Q84/Q84 cerebella. Conclusions: N-acetylaspartate, myo-inositol and total choline levels in the cerebellum are candidate biomarkers of neuroaxonal and oligodendrocyte pathology in SCA3, which are reversible by reduction of mutant ATXN3 levels.

<p>by Filip Melinscak, Dominik R. Bach</p>

With computational biology striving to provide more accurate theoretical accounts of biological systems, use of increasingly complex computational models seems inevitable. However, this trend engenders a challenge of optimal experimental design: due to the flexibility of complex models, it is difficult to intuitively design experiments that will efficiently expose differences between candidate models or allow accurate estimation of their parameters. This challenge is well exemplified in associative learning research. Associative learning theory has a rich tradition of computational modeling, resulting in a growing space of increasingly complex models, which in turn renders manual design of informative experiments difficult. Here we propose a novel method for computational optimization of associative learning experiments. We first formalize associative learning experiments using a low number of tunable design variables, to make optimization tractable. Next, we combine simulation-based Bayesian experimental design with Bayesian optimization to arrive at a flexible method of tuning design variables. Finally, we validate the proposed method through extensive simulations covering both the objectives of accurate parameter estimation and model selection. The validation results show that computationally optimized experimental designs have the potential to substantially improve upon manual designs drawn from the literature, even when prior information guiding the optimization is scarce. Computational optimization of experiments may help address recent concerns over reproducibility by increasing the expected utility of studies, and it may even incentivize practices such as study pre-registration, since optimization requires a pre-specified analysis plan. Moreover, design optimization has the potential not only to improve basic research in domains such as associative learning, but also to play an important role in translational research. For example, design of behavioral and physiological diagnostic tests in the nascent field of computational psychiatry could benefit from an optimization-based approach, similar to the one presented here.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q9Jb5i8z1Zk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Y0QdDx2PQss/article">Interpreting neural decoding models using grouped model reliance</a></h4>

<p>by Simon Valentin, Maximilian Harkotte, Tzvetan Popov</p>

Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly popular for decoding psychological constructs based on neural data. However, as a step towards bridging the gap between theory-driven cognitive neuroscience and data-driven decoding approaches, there is a need for methods that allow to interpret trained decoding models. The present study demonstrates <i>grouped model reliance</i> as a model-agnostic permutation-based approach to this problem. Grouped model reliance indicates the extent to which a trained model relies on conceptually related groups of variables, such as frequency bands or regions of interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. As a case study to demonstrate the method, random forest and support vector machine models were trained on within-participant single-trial EEG data from a Sternberg working memory task. Participants were asked to memorize a sequence of digits (0–9), varying randomly in length between one, four and seven digits, where EEG recordings for working memory load estimation were taken from a 3-second retention interval. The present results confirm previous findings insofar as both random forest and support vector machine models relied on alpha-band activity in most subjects. However, as revealed by further analyses, patterns in frequency and topography varied considerably between individuals, pointing to more pronounced inter-individual differences than previously reported.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y0QdDx2PQss" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is suppressed by high-fat (HF) diet and metabolic disease, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Deficits in AHN may contribute to cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia and mood disorders, which have higher prevalence in women. However, sex differences in the effects of HF diet/metabolic disease on AHN have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Herein, male and female C57BL/6J mice were fed an HF or control (CON) diet from ~2 to 6 months of age. After 3 months on the diet, mice were injected with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) then killed 4 weeks later. Cell proliferation, differentiation/maturation, and survival of new neurons in the dentate gyrus were assessed with immunofluorescence for EdU, Ki67, doublecortin (DCX), and NeuN. CON females had more proliferating cells (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) and neuroblasts/immature neurons (DCX<sup>+</sup>) compared with CON males; however, HF diet reduced these cells in females to the levels of males. Diet did not affect neurogenesis in males. Further, the numbers of proliferating cells and immature neurons were inversely correlated with both weight gain and glucose intolerance in females only. These effects were robust in the dorsal hippocampus, which supports cognitive processes. Assessment of microglia in the dentate gyrus using immunofluorescence for Iba1 and CD68 uncovered sex-specific effects of diet, which may contribute to observed differences in neurogenesis. These findings demonstrate sex-specific effects of HF diet/metabolic disease on AHN, and highlight the potential for targeting neurogenic deficits to treat cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia associated with these conditions, particularly in females.</p>

Abstract
<p>Blue wavelength light is used as an optical actuator in numerous optogenetic technologies employed in neuronal systems. However, the potential side effects of blue light in neurons has not been thoroughly explored, and recent reports suggest that neuronal exposure to blue light can induce transcriptional alterations <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we examined the effects of blue wavelength light in cultured primary rat cortical cells. Exposure to blue light (470 nm) resulted in upregulation of several immediate early genes (IEGs) traditionally used as markers of neuronal activity, including <i>Fos</i> and <i>Fosb</i>, but did not alter the expression of circadian clock genes <i>Bmal1</i>, <i>Cry1</i>, <i>Cry2</i>, <i>Clock</i>, or <i>Per2</i>. IEG expression was increased following 4 h of 5% duty cycle light exposure, and IEG induction was not dependent on light pulse width. Elevated levels of blue light exposure induced a loss of cell viability <i>in vitro</i>, suggestive of overt phototoxicity. Induction of IEGs by blue light was maintained in cortical cultures treated with AraC to block glial proliferation, indicating that induction occurred selectively in postmitotic neurons. Importantly, changes in gene expression induced by blue wavelength light were prevented when cultures were maintained in a photoinert media supplemented with a photostable neuronal supplement instead of commonly utilized neuronal culture media and supplements. Together, these findings suggest that light-induced gene expression alterations observed <i>in vitro</i> stem from a phototoxic interaction between commonly used media and neurons, and offer a solution to prevent this toxicity when using photoactivatable technology <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

Abstract
<p>Chronic stress compromises cognition, including executive function mediated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To investigate mechanisms underlying these processes, we use chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), which reduces activity in the mPFC and impairs cognitive set-shifting, a measure of cognitive flexibility in laboratory rats. It has been shown that CUS attenuates the local electrical field potential response evoked in the mPFC by stimulation of the ascending excitatory afferent from the mediodorsal thalamus (MDT). Thus, in this study, to investigate the role that such changes in afferent-evoked responsivity of the mPFC might play in the cognitive deficits induced by CUS, we used optogenetics to directly induce plastic changes in the thalamic-mPFC afferent pathway. Glutamatergic neurons in the MDT were virally-induced to express the ChETA variant of channelrhodopsin. Then, to first validate the optogenetic induction of plasticity, long-term depression (LTD) or long-term potentiation (LTP) were induced by laser stimulation of ChETA-expressing terminals in the mPFC of anesthetized rats. In subsequent experiments, induction of opto-LTD in awake animals produced set-shifting deficits similar to those induced by CUS. By contrast, inducing opto-LTP in rats that had received prior CUS treatment corrected the stress-induced deficit in set-shifting. These results suggest that stress-induced plasticity in the thalamic-mPFC pathway is sufficient to produce stress-induced cognitive deficits, and may represent a novel target for effective therapeutic intervention to correct cognitive impairment in stress-related psychiatric disorders.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The study of brain circuits depends on a clear understanding of the role played by different neuronal populations. Therefore, the unambiguous identification of different cell types is essential for the correct interpretation of experimental data. Here, we emphasize to the broader neuroscience community the importance of recognizing the persistent presence of Cajal-Retzius cells in the molecular layers of the postnatal hippocampus, and then we suggest a variety of criteria for distinguishing Cajal-Retzius cells from other neurons of the hippocampal molecular layers, such as GABAergic interneurons and semilunar granule cells. The toolbox of criteria that we have investigated (in male and female mice) can be useful both for anatomical and functional experiments, and relies on the quantitative study of neuronal somatic/nuclear morphology, location and developmental profile, expression of specific molecular markers (GAD67, reelin, COUP-TFII, calretinin and p73), single cell anatomy, and electrophysiological properties.</p><p>We conclude that Cajal-Retzius cells are small, non-GABAergic neurons that are tightly associated with the hippocampal fissure, and that, within this area of interest, selectively express the proteins p73 and calretinin. We highlight the dangers of using markers such as reelin or COUP-TFII to identify Cajal-Retzius cells or GABAergic interneurons because of their poor specificity. Lastly, we examine neurons of the postnatal hippocampal molecular layers and show cell type-specific differences in their dendritic/axonal morphologies and density distributions, as well as in their membrane properties and spontaneous synaptic inputs. These parameters can be used to distinguish biocytin-filled and/or electrophysiologically recorded neurons and should be considered to avoid interpretational mistakes.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The unambiguous identification of specific neuronal types in brain circuits is critical for a correct interpretation of experimental data. Cajal-Retzius cells of the molecular layers of the postnatal hippocampus are intermingled with other neurons, such as GABAergic interneurons and semilunar granule cells. Although the presence of Cajal-Retzius cells in the hippocampus is commonly acknowledged at early developmental stages, it is often overlooked at later points of maturation. This lack of attention may increase the risk of misclassification of Cajal-Retzius cells for GABAergic interneurons or other cell types and may lead to interpretative mistakes. Here, we provide a set of simple cell type-specific criteria for their unambiguous identification. Lastly, we also warn against equivocal criteria that may lead to erroneous classifications.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>2-photon fluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to probe the structure and functions of cells in living biological tissue. 2-photon excitation generates fluorescence from the focal plane, but also from outside the focal plane, with out-of-focus fluorescence increasing as the focus is pushed deeper into tissue. It has been postulated that the 2-photon depth limit, beyond which results become inaccurate, is where in- and out-of-focus fluorescence are equal, which we term the balance depth. Calculations suggest that the balance depth should be at ~600 µm in mouse cortex. Neither the 2-photon depth limit nor the balance depth have been measured in brain tissue. We found the depth limit and balance depth of 2-photon excitation in mice with GCaMP6 indicator expression in all layers of visual cortex, by comparing near-simultaneous 2- and 3-photon excitation. 2- and 3-photon results from superficial locations were almost identical. 2-photon results were inaccurate beyond the balance depth, consistent with the depth limit matching the balance depth for 2-photon excitation. However, the 2-photon depth limit and balance depth were at 450 µm, shallower than predicted by calculations. Our results were from tissue with a largely homogenous distribution of fluorophores. The expected balance depth is deeper in tissue with fewer fluorophores outside the focal plane and our results therefore establish a superficial bound on the 2-photon depth limit in mouse visual cortex.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study measures the maximum depth in the mouse brain to which it is possible to obtain quantitatively accurate results with 2-photon microscopy, a form of non-linear fluorescence microscopy.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Weight loss has been identified as a negative prognostic factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but there is no evidence regarding whether a high‐caloric diet increases survival. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of a high‐caloric fatty diet (HCFD) for increasing survival.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A 1:1 randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, double‐blinded trial (LIPCAL‐ALS study) was conducted between February 2015 and September 2018. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months after randomization. The study was performed at 12 sites of the clinical and scientific network of German motor neuron disease centers (ALS/MND‐NET). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either HCFD (405kcal/day, 100% fat) or placebo in addition to riluzole (100mg/day). The primary endpoint was survival time, defined as time to death or time to study cutoff date.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two hundred one patients (80 female, 121 male, age = 62.4 ± 10.8 years) were included. The confirmatory analysis of the primary outcome survival showed a survival probability of 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27–0.51) in the placebo group and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.25–0.49) in the HCFD group, both after 28 months (point in time of the last event). The hazard ratio was 0.97, 1‐sided 97.5% CI = −∞ to 1.44, <i>p</i> = 0.44.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results provide no evidence for a life‐prolonging effect of HCFD for the whole amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population. However, post hoc analysis revealed a significant survival benefit for the subgroup of fast‐progressing patients. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe morphological changes associated with degeneration and regeneration of large fibers in the skin using a model of chronic compression of the median nerve.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied cutaneous innervation in 30 patients with chronic compression of the median nerve at the wrist. Before surgery, we assessed the symptom severity and performed neurography, quantitative sensory testing, and analysis of nerve morphology and morphometry in skin biopsies from the third digit fingertip. Fifteen patients repeated all tests 12 months after the surgery. Thirty age‐ and sex‐matched healthy subjects were included in the study.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Clinical and neurophysiological basal assessment showed a moderate involvement of the median nerve. Quantitative sensory testing showed abnormal findings. The density of intraepidermal nerve fibers and intrapapillary myelinated endings was reduced. Myelinated fibers showed caliber reduction and nodal elongation. Meissner corpuscles had normal density but were located deeper in the dermis and their capsule appeared partially empty. During follow‐up, patients exhibited a positive clinical and neurophysiological outcome. Quantitative sensory testing improved. Intraepidermal nerve fibers and intrapapillary myelinated endings remained unchanged, but the caliber of intrapapillary myelinated endings was increased. The neural component of the Meissner corpuscle filled the capsule of the mechanoreceptors that remained deeper in the dermis. The position of vasoactive intestinal peptide–immunoreactive fibers was more superficial compared to the basal assessment and controls.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We recognized and quantified the pathological changes associated with nerve degeneration and regeneration in skin and proposed new parameters that may increase the diagnostic yield of skin biopsy in clinical practice. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>The applications of Electroencephalogram (EEG) have been extended to out of
laboratory and clinics recently due to the advancements in the technical
capabilities. There are various advantageous of EEG, making it a preferable
method for a wide range of applications; it is a noninvasive method, it is
portable, it offers good time resolution and sufficient spatial resolution,
besides there are low cost EEG systems available for a commercial use. Since
the early uses of EEG, mainly as monitoring of diseases and pathologies, sleep
staging and event related potential researches, it has been intertwined with
undesired signal types which we call as artifacts. These pose great challenges
in the practice of EEG based methods such as averaging for monitoring and
diagnosis of diseases, and single-trial signal analysis for a relatively recent
application in brain-computer interfaces. However, many techniques have been
developed and under study for better detection and mitigation of these adverse
events. The main artifact types and their handling are discussed in this brief
summary.

<p>An unresolved question in network neuroscience is the quantification of
reconfiguration in functional networks in response to varying cognitive
demands. We propose that a mesoscopic generalizable framework would be most apt
to investigate the breadth of functional (re-)configurations. We propose a 2D
network morphospace using novel mesoscopic metrics, Trapping Efficiency (TE)
and Exit Entropy (EE), that characterize the topology of mesoscopic structures
and the flow of information within and between them. This framework captures
the behavior of a reference set of functional networks (FNs) with changing
mental states. We show that this morphospace is sensitive to different FNs,
cognitive tasks and subjects. We propose that functional connectivity changes
in FNs may be categorized into three different types of reconfigurations: i)
Network Configural Breadth, ii) Task-to-Task transitional reconfiguration, and
iii) Within-Task reconfiguration; and quantify the Network Configural Breadth
across different tasks. In essence, we put forth a framework that can be used
to explore the cognitive space in a comprehensive manner, for each individual
separately, and at different levels of granularity; a tool that can also
quantify the changes that result from such an exploration, as the brain
switches between mental states.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52990">Cell-specific non-canonical amino acid labelling identifies changes in the de novo proteome during memory formation</a></h4>

The formation of spatial long-term memory (LTM) requires the de novo synthesis of distinct sets of proteins; however, a non-biased examination of the de novo proteome in this process is lacking. Here, we generated a novel mouse strain, which enables cell-type-specific labelling of newly synthesised proteins with non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs) by genetically restricting the expression of the mutant tRNA synthetase, NLL-MetRS, to hippocampal neurons. By combining this labelling technique with an accelerated version of the active place avoidance task and bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) followed by SWATH quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified 156 proteins that were altered in synthesis in hippocampal neurons during spatial memory formation. In addition to observing increased synthesis of known proteins important in memory-related processes, such as glutamate receptor recycling, we also identified altered synthesis of proteins associated with mRNA splicing as a potential mechanism involved in spatial LTM formation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52291">Misfolded proteins bind and activate death receptor 5 to induce apoptosis during unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress</a></h4>

Disruption of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the unfolded protein response (UPR)—a signaling network that ultimately determines cell fate. Initially, UPR signaling aims at cytoprotection and restoration of ER homeostasis; that failing, it drives apoptotic cell death. ER stress initiates apoptosis through intracellular activation of death receptor 5 (DR5) independent of its canonical extracellular ligand TRAIL; however, the mechanism underlying DR5 activation is unknown. In cultured human cells, we find that misfolded proteins can directly engage with DR5 in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, where DR5 assembles pro-apoptotic caspase 8-activating complexes. Moreover, peptides used as a proxy for exposed misfolded protein chains selectively bind to the purified DR5 ectodomain and induce its oligomerization. These findings indicate that misfolded proteins can act as ligands to activate DR5 intracellularly and promote apoptosis. We propose a model in which cells use DR5 as a terminal protein-folding checkpoint before committing to a terminal apoptotic fate.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52024"><i>In vivo</i> single-cell lineage tracing in zebrafish using high-resolution infrared laser-mediated gene induction microscopy</a></h4>

Heterogeneity broadly exists in various cell types both during development and at homeostasis. Investigating heterogeneity is crucial for comprehensively understanding the complexity of ontogeny, dynamics, and function of specific cell types. Traditional bulk-labeling techniques are incompetent to dissect heterogeneity within cell population, while the new single-cell lineage tracing methodologies invented in the last decade can hardly achieve high-fidelity single-cell labeling and long-term <i>in-vivo</i> observation simultaneously. In this work, we developed a high-precision infrared laser-evoked gene operator heat-shock system, which uses laser-induced CreER<sup>T2</sup> combined with loxP-DsRedx-loxP-GFP reporter to achieve precise single-cell labeling and tracing. <i>In</i> <i>vivo</i> study indicated that this system can precisely label single cell in brain, muscle and hematopoietic system in zebrafish embryo. Using this system, we traced the hematopoietic potential of hemogenic endothelium (HE) in the posterior blood island (PBI) of zebrafish embryo and found that HEs in the PBI are heterogeneous, which contains at least myeloid unipotent and myeloid-lymphoid bipotent subtypes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51998">Class-A penicillin binding proteins do not contribute to cell shape but repair cell-wall defects</a></h4>

Cell shape and cell-envelope integrity of bacteria are determined by the peptidoglycan cell wall. In rod-shaped <i>Escherichia coli</i>, two conserved sets of machinery are essential for cell-wall insertion in the cylindrical part of the cell: the Rod complex and the class-A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs). While the Rod complex governs rod-like cell shape, aPBP function is less well understood. aPBPs were previously hypothesized to either work in concert with the Rod complex or to independently repair cell-wall defects. First, we demonstrate through modulation of enzyme levels that aPBPs do not contribute to rod-like cell shape but are required for mechanical stability, supporting their independent activity. By combining measurements of cell-wall stiffness, cell-wall insertion, and PBP1b motion at the single-molecule level we then present evidence that PBP1b, the major aPBP, contributes to cell-wall integrity by repairing cell wall defects.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51605">Perturbation of base excision repair sensitizes breast cancer cells to APOBEC3 deaminase-mediated mutations</a></h4>

Abundant APOBEC3 (A3) deaminase-mediated mutations can dominate the mutational landscape ('mutator phenotype') of some cancers, however the basis of this sporadic vulnerability is unknown. We show here that elevated expression of the bifunctional DNA glycosylase, NEIL2, sensitizes breast cancer cells to A3B-mediated mutations and double strand breaks (DSBs) by perturbing canonical base excision repair (BER). NEIL2 usurps the canonical lyase, APE1, at abasic sites in a purified BER system, rendering them poor substrates for polymerase b. However, the nicked NEIL2 product can serve as an entry site for Exo1 <i>in vitro</i> to generate single-stranded DNA, which would be susceptible to both A3B and DSBs. As NEIL2 or Exo1 depletion mitigates the DNA damage caused by A3B expression, we suggest that aberrant NEIL2 expression can explain certain instances of A3B-mediated mutations.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leucine‐rich glioma‐inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis is the second most common autoimmune encephalopathy, but insight into the intrathecal B cell autoimmune response including clonal relationships, isotype distribution, frequency and pathogenic effects of single LGI1 antibodies has remain limited.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We cloned, expressed and tested antibodies from 90 antibody‐secreting cells (ASCs) and B cells from the CSF of several patients with LGI1 encephalitis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>84% of the ASCs and 21% of the memory B cells encoded LGI1‐reactive antibodies, while reactivities to other brain epitopes were rare. All LGI1 antibodies were of IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 isotype and had undergone affinity maturation. Seven of the overall 26 LGI1 antibodies efficiently blocked the interaction of LGI1 with its receptor ADAM22 <i>in vitro</i> and their mean LGI1 signal on mouse brain sections was weak as compared to the remaining, non‐ADAM22‐competing antibodies. Nevertheless, both types of LGI1 antibodies increased the intrinsic cellular excitability and glutamatergic synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA3 neurons in slice cultures.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data show that the patients’ intrathecal B cell autoimmune response is dominated by LGI1 antibodies and that LGI1 antibodies alone are sufficient to promote neuronal excitability, a basis of seizure generation. Fundamental differences in target specificity and antibody hypermutations compared to the CSF autoantibody repertoire in NMDA receptor encephalitis underline the clinical concept that autoimmune encephalitides are very distinct entities.</p>

Abstract
<p>Gaze saccades, rapid shifts of the eyes and head toward a goal, have provided fundamental insights into the neural control of movement. For example, it has been shown that the superior colliculus (SC) transforms a visual target (T) code to future gaze (G) location commands after a memory delay. However, this transformation has not been observed in "reactive" saccades made directly to a stimulus, so its contribution to normal gaze behavior is unclear. Here, we tested this using a quantitative measure of the intermediate codes between T and G, based on variable errors in gaze endpoints. We demonstrate that a rapid spatial transformation occurs within the primate’s SC (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) during reactive saccades, involving a shift in coding from T, through intermediate codes, to G. This spatial shift progressed continuously both across and within cell populations [visual, visuomotor (VM), motor], rather than relaying discretely between populations with fixed spatial codes. These results suggest that the SC produces a rapid, noisy, and distributed transformation that contributes to variable errors in reactive gaze shifts.</p>

Abstract
<p>Once thought to simply reflect passive cortical idling, recent studies have demonstrated that α oscillations play a causal role in cognition and perception. However, whether and how cognitive or sensory processes modulate various components of the α rhythm is poorly understood. Sensory input and resting states were manipulated in human subjects while electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded in three conditions: eyes-open fixating on a visual stimulus, eyes-open without visual input (darkness), and eyes-closed without visual input (darkness). We show that α power and peak frequency increase when visual input is reduced compared to the eyes open, fixating condition. These results suggest that increases in α power reflect a shift from an exteroceptive to interoceptive state and that increases in peak frequency following restricted visual input (darkness) may reflect increased sampling of the external environment in order to detect stimuli. They further demonstrate how sensory information modulates α and the importance of selecting an appropriate resting condition in studies of α.</p>

Abstract
<p>Damage in biological neuronal networks triggers a complex functional reorganization whose mechanisms are still poorly understood. To delineate this reorganization process, here we investigate the functional alterations of <i>in vitro</i> rat cortical circuits following localized laser ablation. The analysis of the functional network configuration before and after ablation allowed us to quantify the extent of functional alterations and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales along recovery. We observed that damage precipitated a fast rerouting of information flow that restored network’s communicability in about 15 min. Functional restoration was led by the immediate neighbors around trauma but was orchestrated by the entire network. Our <i>in vitro</i> setup exposes the ability of neuronal circuits to articulate fast responses to acute damage, and may serve as a proxy to devise recovery strategies in actual brain circuits. Moreover, this biological setup can become a benchmark to empirically test network theories about the spontaneous recovery in dynamical networks.</p>

Abstract
<p>Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy are considered as pathologic alterations of sleep spindles; however, their network-level relationship has never been convincingly revealed. In order to observe the development and generalization of the thalamocortical SWDs and the concomitant alterations of sleep related oscillations, we performed local field potential (LFP) and single unit recordings in rats for three months during their maturation. We found that while SWDs and spindles look similar in young, they become different with maturation and shift to appear in different brain states. Thus, despite being generated by the same network, they are likely two distinct manifestations of the thalamocortical activity. We show that while spindles are already mainly global oscillations, SWDs appear mainly only focally in young. They become capable to generalize later with maturation, when the out-of-focus brain regions develop a decreased inhibitory/excitatory balance. These results suggest that a hyperexcitable focus is not sufficient alone to drive generalized absence seizures. Importantly, we also found the gradual age dependent disappearance of sleep spindles coinciding with the simultaneous gradual emergence of spike and waves, which both could be reversed by the proper dosing of ethosuximide (ETX). Based on these observations we conclude that the absence seizure development might be a multi-step process, which might involve the functional impairment of cortical interneurons and network-level changes that negatively affect sleep quality.</p>

Abstract
<p>Several recently developed Channelrhodopsin (ChR) variants are characterized by rapid kinetics and reduced desensitization in comparison to the widely used ChR2. However, little is known about how varying opsin properties may regulate their interaction with local network dynamics. We compared evoked cortical activity in mice expressing three ChR variants with distinct temporal profiles under the CamKII promoter: Chronos, Chrimson, and ChR2. We assessed overall neural activation by measuring the amplitude and temporal progression of evoked spiking. Using -range (30–80 Hz) local field potential (LFP) power as an assay for local network engagement, we examined the recruitment of cortical network activity by each tool. All variants caused light-evoked increases in firing <i>in vivo</i>, but each demonstrated different temporal patterning of evoked activity. In addition, the three ChRs had distinct effects on cortical -band activity. Our findings suggest the properties of optogenetic tools can substantially affect their efficacy <i>in vivo</i>, as well their engagement of circuit resonance.</p>

Abstract
<p>We discovered a new type of dendritic spine. It is found on space-specific neurons in the barn owl inferior colliculus, a site of experience-dependent plasticity. Connectomic analysis revealed dendritic protrusions of unusual morphology including topological holes, hence termed "toric" spines (<i>n</i> = 76). More significantly, presynaptic terminals converging onto individual toric spines displayed numerous active zones (up to 49) derived from multiple axons (up to 11) with incoming trajectories distributed widely throughout 3D space. This arrangement is suited to integrate input sources. Dense reconstruction of two toric spines revealed that they were unconnected with the majority (~84%) of intertwined axons, implying a high capacity for information storage. We developed an <i>ex vivo</i> slice preparation and provide the first published data on space-specific neuron intrinsic properties, including cellular subtypes with and without toric-like spines. We propose that toric spines are a cellular locus of sensory integration and behavioral learning.</p>

<p>To characterize the rat as a potential model of frontal-parietal auditory processing during sustained attention, target detection, and response inhibition, we recorded field potentials (FPs) at multiple sites in medial-dorsal frontal and posterior parietal cortex simultaneously while rats performed an equiprobable auditory go/no-go discrimination task. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated by averaging tone-triggered FPs across hit, miss, false alarm (FA), and correct rejection (CR) trials separately for each recording session, and five peak amplitudes (termed N1, P2, N2, P3E, and P3L) were extracted from the individual-session ERPs. Comparing peak amplitudes across different trials types indicated a statistically significant amplification of the P2 peak on hit trials that accompanies detection of the target tone prior to the behavioral go response. This result appears analogous to human ERP phenomena during auditory target discrimination. Conversely, the rat P3 responses were not associated with target detection as in the human ERP literature. Likewise, we did not observe the "no-go N2" or "no-go P3" responses reported in the human literature in association with response inhibition, which might reflect differences in task context or a difference in auditory processing between rats and humans. We also present analyses of stimulus-induced spectral power and interarea coherence to characterize oscillatory synchronization which may contribute to ERPs, and discuss possible error-related processing at the N2, P3E, and P3L peaks.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bridging the gap between experimental stroke and patients by ischemic blood probing during the hyperacute stage of vascular occlusion is crucial to assess the role of inflammation in human stroke and for the development of adjunct treatments beyond recanalization.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We prospectively observed 151 consecutive ischemic stroke patients with embolic large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation who underwent mechanical thrombectomy. In all these patients, we attempted microcatheter aspiration of three different arterial blood samples 1) within the core of the occluded vascular compartment, controlled by 2) carotid and 3) femoral samples obtained under physiological flow conditions. Subsequent laboratory analyses comprised leukocyte counting and differentiation, platelet counting, and the quantification of 13 proinflammatory human chemokines/cytokines.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>40 patients meeting all clinical, imaging, interventional and laboratory inclusion criteria could be analyzed, showing that: (1) The total number of leukocytes significantly increased under the occlusion condition. (2) This increase was predominantly driven by neutrophils. Significant increases were also apparent for (3) lymphocytes and (4) monocytes, accompanied by locally elevated plasma levels of the (5) T‐cell chemoattractant CXCL‐11. Finally, we found evidence that (6) short‐term clinical outcome (NIHSS at 72h) was negatively associated with neutrophil accumulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We provide the first direct human evidence that neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes, accompanied by specific chemokine upregulation, accumulate in the ischemic vasculature during hyperacute stroke and may affect outcome. These findings strongly support experimental evidence that immune cells contribute to acute ischemic brain damage and indicate that ischemic inflammation initiates already during vascular occlusion.</p>

<p>Conventional and current wisdom assumes that the brain represents probability
as a continuous number to many decimal places. This assumption seems
implausible given finite and scarce resources in the brain. Quantization is an
information encoding process whereby a continuous quantity is systematically
divided into a finite number of possible categories. Rounding is a simple
example of quantization. We apply this information theoretic concept to develop
a novel quantized (i.e., discrete) probability distortion function. We develop
three conjunction probability gambling tasks to look for evidence of quantized
probability representations in the brain. We hypothesize that certain ranges of
probability will be lumped together in the same indifferent category if a
quantized representation exists. For example, two distinct probabilities such
as 0.57 and 0.585 may be treated indifferently. Our extensive data analysis has
found strong evidence to support such a quantized representation: 59/76
participants (i.e., 78%) demonstrated a best fit to 4-bit quantized models
instead of continuous models. This observation is the major development and
novelty of the present work. The brain is very likely to be employing a
quantized representation of probability. This discovery demonstrates a major
precision limitation of the brain's representational and decision-making
ability.

<p>Using results from neurobiology on perceptual decision making and value-based
decision making, the problem of decision making between lotteries is
reformulated in an abstract space where uncertain prospects are mapped to
corresponding active neuronal representations. This mapping allows us to
maximize non-extensive entropy in the new space with some constraints instead
of a utility function. To achieve good agreements with behavioral data, the
constraints must include at least constraints on the weighted average of the
stimulus and on its variance. Both constraints are supported by the
adaptability of neuronal responses to an external stimulus. By analogy with
thermodynamic and information engines, we discuss the dynamics of choice
between two lotteries as they are being processed simultaneously in the brain
by rate equations that describe the transfer of attention between lotteries and
within the various prospects of each lottery. This model is able to give new
insights on risk aversion and on behavioral anomalies not accounted for by
Prospect Theory.

<p>Acquisition of bimanual motor skills, critical in several applications
ranging from robotic teleoperations to surgery, is associated with a protracted
learning curve. Brain connectivity based on functional Near Infrared
Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data has shown promising results in distinguishing experts
from novice surgeons. However, it is less well understood how expertise-related
disparity in brain connectivity is modulated by dynamic temporal demands
experienced during a surgical task. In this study, we use fNIRS to examine the
interplay between frontal and motor brain regions in a cohort of surgical
residents of varying expertise performing a laparoscopic surgical task under
temporal demand. The results demonstrate that prefrontal-motor connectivity in
senior residents is more resilient to time pressure. Furthermore, certain
global characteristics of brain connectomes, such as the small-world index, may
be used to detect the presence of an underlying stressor.

<p>The core idea in an XR (VR/MR/AR) application is to digitally stimulate one
or more sensory systems (e.g. visual, auditory, olfactory) of the human user in
an interactive way to achieve an immersive experience. Since the early 2000s
biologists have been using Virtual Environments (VE) to investigate the
mechanisms of behavior in non-human animals including insect, fish, and
mammals. VEs have become reliable tools for studying vision, cognition, and
sensory-motor control in animals. In turn, the knowledge gained from studying
such behaviors can be harnessed by researchers designing biologically inspired
robots, smart sensors, and multi-agent artificial intelligence. VE for animals
is becoming a widely used application of XR technology but such applications
have not previously been reported in the technical literature related to XR.
Biologists and computer scientists can benefit greatly from deepening
interdisciplinary research in this emerging field and together we can develop
new methods for conducting fundamental research in behavioral sciences and
engineering. To support our argument we present this review which provides an
overview of animal behavior experiments conducted in virtual environments.

<p>The question of continuous-versus-discrete information representation in the
brain is a fundamental yet unresolved question. Historically, most analyses
assume a continuous representation without considering the discrete
alternative. Our work explores the plausibility of both, answering the question
from a communications systems engineering perspective. Using Shannon's
communications theory, we posit that information in the brain is represented in
discrete form. We address this hypothesis using 2 approaches. First, we
identify the fundamental communication requirements of the brain. Second, we
estimate the symbol error probability and channel capacity for a continuous
information representation. Our work concludes that information cannot be
communicated and represented reliably in the brain using a continuous
representation - it has to be in a discrete form. This is a major demarcation
from conventional and current wisdom. We apply this discrete result to the 4
major neural coding hypotheses, and illustrate the use of discrete ISI neural
coding in analyzing electrophysiology experimental data. We further posit and
illustrate a plausible direct link between Weber's Law and discrete neural
coding. We end by outlining a number of key research questions on discrete
neural coding.

<p>What is the role of real-time control and learning in the formation of social
conventions? To answer this question, we propose a computational model that
matches human behavioral data in a social decision-making game that was
analyzed both in discrete-time and continuous-time setups. Furthermore, unlike
previous approaches, our model takes into account the role of sensorimotor
control loops in embodied decision-making scenarios. For this purpose, we
introduce the Control-based Reinforcement Learning (CRL) model. CRL is grounded
in the Distributed Adaptive Control (DAC) theory of mind and brain, where
low-level sensorimotor control is modulated through perceptual and behavioral
learning in a layered structure. CRL follows these principles by implementing a
feedback control loop handling the agent's reactive behaviors (pre-wired
reflexes), along with an adaptive layer that uses reinforcement learning to
maximize long-term reward. We test our model in a multi-agent game-theoretic
task in which coordination must be achieved to find an optimal solution. We
show that CRL is able to reach human-level performance on standard
game-theoretic metrics such as efficiency in acquiring rewards and fairness in
reward distribution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52712">Hair follicle stem cells regulate retinoid metabolism to maintain the self-renewal niche for melanocyte stem cells</a></h4>

Metabolites are major biological parameters sensed by many cell types <i>in vivo</i>, whether they function as signaling mediators of SC and niche cross talk to regulate tissue regeneration is largely unknown. We show here that deletion of the Notch pathway co-factor RBP-J specifically in mouse HFSCs triggers adjacent McSCs to precociously differentiate in their shared niche. Transcriptome screen and <i>in vivo</i> functional studies revealed that the elevated level of retinoic acid (RA) caused by de-repression of RA metabolic process genes as a result of RBP-J deletion in HFSCs triggers ectopic McSCs differentiation in the niche. Mechanistically the increased level of RA sensitizes McSCs to differentiation signal KIT-ligand by increasing its c-Kit receptor protein level <i>in vivo</i>. Using genetic approach, we further pinpointed HFSCs as the source of KIT-ligand in the niche. We discover that HFSCs regulate the metabolite RA level <i>in vivo</i> to allow self-renewal of neighboring McSCs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50065">A terminal selector prevents a Hox transcriptional switch to safeguard motor neuron identity throughout life</a></h4>

To become and remain functional, individual neuron types must select during development and maintain throughout life their distinct terminal identity features, such as expression of specific neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels and neuropeptides. Here, we report a molecular mechanism that enables cholinergic motor neurons (MNs) in the <i>C. elegans</i> ventral nerve cord to select and maintain their unique terminal identity. This mechanism relies on the dual function of the conserved terminal selector UNC-3 (Collier/Ebf). UNC-3 synergizes with LIN-39 (Scr/Dfd/Hox4-5) to directly co-activate multiple terminal identity traits specific to cholinergic MNs, but also antagonizes LIN-39’s ability to activate terminal features of alternative neuronal identities. Loss of <i>unc-3</i> causes a switch in the transcriptional targets of LIN-39, thereby alternative, not cholinergic MN-specific, terminal features become activated and locomotion defects occur. The strategy of a terminal selector preventing a transcriptional switch may constitute a general principle for safeguarding neuronal identity throughout life.

The lack of diversity among faculty at universities and medical schools in the United States is a matter of growing concern. However, the factors that influence the career choices of underrepresented minority and female postdoctoral researchers have received relatively little attention. Here we report the results of a survey of 1284 postdocs working in the biomedical sciences in the US. Our findings highlight possible reasons why some underrepresented minority and female postdocs choose not to pursue careers in academic research, and suggest interventions that could be taken in the early stages of postdoctoral training to prevent this attrition of underrepresented groups.

<p>by Anand Pathak, Nivedita Chatterjee, Sitabhra Sinha</p>

A central problem of neuroscience involves uncovering the principles governing the organization of nervous systems which ensure robustness in brain development. The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> provides us with a model organism for studying this question. In this paper, we focus on the invariant connection structure and spatial arrangement of the neurons comprising the somatic neuronal network of this organism to understand the key developmental constraints underlying its design. We observe that neurons with certain shared characteristics—such as, neural process lengths, birth time cohort, lineage and bilateral symmetry—exhibit a preference for connecting to each other. Recognizing the existence of such homophily and their relative degree of importance in determining connection probability within neurons (for example, in synapses, symmetric pairing is the most dominant factor followed by birth time cohort, process length and lineage) helps in connecting specific neuronal attributes to the topological organization of the network. Further, the functional identities of neurons appear to dictate the temporal hierarchy of their appearance during the course of development. Providing crucial insights into principles that may be common across many organisms, our study shows how the trajectory in the developmental landscape constrains the structural organization of a nervous system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-eC5eJfZ40s" width="1" />

<p>Imagine you were asked to investigate the workings of an engine, but to do so without ever opening the hood. Now imagine the engine fueled the human mind. This is the challenge faced by cognitive neuroscientists worldwide aiming to understand the neural bases of our psychological functions. Luckily, human ingenuity comes to the rescue. Around the same time as the Society for Neuroscience was being established in the 1960s, the first tools for measuring the human brain at work were becoming available. Noninvasive human brain imaging and neurophysiology have continued developing at a relentless pace ever since. In this 50 year anniversary, we reflect on how these methods have been changing our understanding of how brain supports mind.</p>

<p>Without question, molecular biology drives modern neuroscience. The past 50 years has been nothing short of revolutionary as key findings have moved the field from correlation toward causation. Most obvious are the discoveries and strategies that have been used to build tools for visualizing circuits, measuring activity, and regulating behavior. Less flashy, but arguably as important are the myriad investigations uncovering the actions of single molecules, macromolecular structures, and integrated machines that serve as the basis for constructing cellular and signaling pathways identified in wide-scale gene or RNA studies and for feeding data into informational networks used in systems biology. This review follows the pathways that were opened in neuroscience by major discoveries and set the stage for the next 50 years.</p>

<p>Phoenix et al. (1959) reported that treating pregnant guinea pigs with testosterone had enduring effects on the sex-related behavior of their female offspring. Since then, similar enduring effects of early testosterone exposure have been found in other species, including humans, and for other behaviors that show average sex differences. In humans, the affected outcomes include gender identity, sexual orientation, and children's sex-typical play behavior. The evidence linking early testosterone exposure to sex-typed play is particularly robust, and sex-typed play is also influenced by many other factors, including socialization by parents and peers and self-socialization, based on cognitive understanding of gender. In addition to influencing behavior, testosterone and hormones produced from testosterone affect mammalian brain structure. Studies using human autopsy material have found some sex differences in the human brain similar to those seen in other species, and have reported that some brain sex differences correlate with sexual orientation or gender identity, although the causes of these brain/behavior relationships are unclear. Studies that have imaged the living human brain have found only a small number of sex differences, and these differences are generally small in magnitude. In addition, they have not been linked to robust psychological or behavioral sex differences. Future research might benefit from improved imaging technology, and attention to other brain characteristics. In addition, it might usefully explore how different types of factors, such as early testosterone exposure and parental socialization, work together in the developmental system that produces sex/gender differences in human brain and behavior.</p>

<p>The operation of our multiple and distinct sensory systems has long captured the interest of researchers from multiple disciplines. When the Society was founded 50 years ago to bring neuroscience research under a common banner, sensory research was largely divided along modality-specific lines. At the time, there were only a few physiological and anatomical observations of the multisensory interactions that powerfully influence our everyday perception. Since then, the neuroscientific study of multisensory integration has increased exponentially in both volume and diversity. From initial studies identifying the overlapping receptive fields of multisensory neurons, to subsequent studies of the spatial and temporal principles that govern the integration of multiple sensory cues, our understanding of this phenomenon at the single-neuron level has expanded to include a variety of dimensions. We now can appreciate how multisensory integration can alter patterns of neural activity in time, and even coordinate activity among populations of neurons across different brain areas. There is now a growing battery of sophisticated empirical and computational techniques that are being used to study this process in a number of models. These advancements have not only enhanced our understanding of this remarkable process in the normal adult brain, but also its underlying circuitry, requirements for development, susceptibility to malfunction, and how its principles may be used to mitigate malfunction.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disability that demonstrates impaired social interactions, communication deficits, and restrictive and repetitive behaviors. ASD has a strong genetic basis and many ASD-associated genes have been discovered thus far. Our previous work has shown that loss of expression of the X-linked gene <i>NEXMIF/KIDLIA</i> is implicated in patients with autistic features and intellectual disability (ID). To further determine the causal role of the gene in the disorder, and to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology, we have generated a NEXMIF knock-out (KO) mouse. We find that male NEXMIF KO mice demonstrate reduced sociability and communication, elevated repetitive grooming behavior, and deficits in learning and memory. Loss of <i>NEXMIF/KIDLIA</i> expression results in a significant decrease in synapse density and synaptic protein expression. Consistently, male KO animals show aberrant synaptic function as measured by excitatory miniatures and postsynaptic currents in the hippocampus. These findings indicate that NEXMIF KO mice recapitulate the phenotypes of the human disorder. The NEXMIF KO mouse model will be a valuable tool for studying the complex mechanisms involved in ASD and for the development of novel therapeutics for this disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral phenotypes. Based on our previous work, which indicated the loss of NEXMIF/KIDLIA was associated with ASD, we generated NEXMIF knock-out (KO) mice. The NEXMIF KO mice demonstrate autism-like behaviors including deficits in social interaction, increased repetitive self-grooming, and impairments in communication and in learning and memory. The KO neurons show reduced synapse density and a suppression in synaptic transmission, indicating a role for NEXMIF in regulating synapse development and function. The NEXMIF KO mouse faithfully recapitulates the human disorder, and thus serves as an animal model for future investigation of the NEXMIF-dependent neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/1/220?rss=1">Developmental Pathogenicity of 4-Repeat Human Tau Is Lost with the P301L Mutation in Genetically Matched Tau-Transgenic Mice</a></h4>

<p>Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that becomes dysregulated in a group of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Differential tau isoforms, expression levels, promoters, and disruption of endogenous genes in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the biological role of tau in these models. We addressed this shortcoming by characterizing the molecular and cognitive phenotypes associated with the pathogenic P301L tau mutation (rT2 mice) in relation to a genetically matched transgenic mouse overexpressing nonmutant (NM) 4-repeat (4R) human tau (rT1 mice). Both male and female mice were included in this study. Unexpectedly, we found that 4R NM human tau (hTau) exhibited abnormal dynamics in young mice that were lost with the P301L mutation, including elevated protein stability and hyperphosphorylation, which were associated with cognitive impairment in 5-month-old rT1 mice. Hyperphosphorylation of NM hTau was observed as early as 4 weeks of age, and transgene suppression for the first 4 or 12 weeks of life prevented abnormal molecular and cognitive phenotypes in rT1, demonstrating that NM hTau pathogenicity is specific to postnatal development. We also show that NM hTau exhibits stronger binding to microtubules than P301L hTau, and is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. Overall, our genetically matched mice have revealed that 4R NM hTau overexpression is pathogenic in a manner distinct from classical aging-related tauopathy, underlining the importance of assaying the effects of transgenic disease-related proteins at appropriate stages in life.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Due to differences in creation of transgenic lines, the pathological properties of the P301L mutation confers to the tau protein <i>in vivo</i> have remained elusive, perhaps contributing to the lack of disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies. In an attempt to characterize P301L-specific effects on tau biology and cognition in novel genetically matched transgenic mouse models, we surprisingly found that nonmutant human tau has development-specific pathogenic properties of its own. Our findings indicate that overexpression of 4-repeat human tau during postnatal development is associated with excessive microtubule binding, which may disrupt important cellular processes, such as mitochondrial dynamics, leading to elevated stability and hyperphosphorylation of tau, and eventual cognitive impairments.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/1/22?rss=1">Generation, Coordination, and Evolution of Neural Circuits for Vocal Communication</a></h4>

<p>In many species, vocal communication is essential for coordinating social behaviors including courtship, mating, parenting, rivalry, and alarm signaling. Effective communication requires accurate production, detection, and classification of signals, as well as selection of socially appropriate responses. Understanding how signals are generated and how acoustic signals are perceived is key to understanding the neurobiology of social behaviors. Here we review our long-standing research program focused on <i>Xenopus</i>, a frog genus which has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms and evolution of vertebrate social behaviors. In <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, vocal signals differ between the sexes, through development, and across the genus, reflecting evolutionary divergence in sensory and motor circuits that can be interrogated mechanistically. Using two <i>ex vivo</i> preparations, the isolated brain and vocal organ, we have identified essential components of the vocal production system: the sexually differentiated larynx at the periphery, and the hindbrain vocal central pattern generator (CPG) centrally, that produce sex- and species-characteristic sound pulse frequencies and temporal patterns, respectively. Within the hindbrain, we have described how intrinsic membrane properties of neurons in the vocal CPG generate species-specific vocal patterns, how vocal nuclei are connected to generate vocal patterns, as well as the roles of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in activating the circuit. For sensorimotor integration, we identified a key forebrain node that links auditory and vocal production circuits to match socially appropriate vocal responses to acoustic features of male and female calls. The availability of a well supported phylogeny as well as reference genomes from several species now support analysis of the genetic architecture and the evolutionary divergence of neural circuits for vocal communication. <i>Xenopus</i> thus provides a vertebrate model in which to study vocal communication at many levels, from physiology, to behavior, and from development to evolution. As one of the most comprehensively studied phylogenetic groups within vertebrate vocal communication systems, <i>Xenopus</i> provides insights that can inform social communication across phyla.</p>

<p>The lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) plays a crucial role in the cognitive processes known as executive functions, which are necessary for the planning of goal-directed behavior in complex and constantly changing environments. To adapt to such environments, the lPFC must use its neuronal resources in a flexible manner. To investigate the mechanism by which lPFC neurons code directional information flexibly, the present study explored the tuning properties and time development of lPFC neurons in male Japanese monkeys during a path-planning task, which required them to move a cursor to a final goal in a stepwise manner within a checkerboard-like maze. We identified "axis-tuned" cells that preferred two opposing directions of immediate goals (i.e., vertical and horizontal directions). Among them, a considerable number of these axis-tuned cells dynamically transformed from vector tuning to a single final-goal direction. We also found that the activities of axis-tuned cells, especially pyramidal neurons, were also modulated by the abstract sequence patterns that the animals were to execute. These findings suggest that the axis-tuned cells change what they code (the type of behavioral goal) as well as how they code (their tuning shapes) so that the lPFC can represent a large number of possible actions or sequences with limited neuronal resources. The dynamic axis-tuned cells must reflect the flexible coding of behaviorally relevant information at the single neuron level by the lPFC to adapt to uncertain environments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lateral PFC (lPFC) plays a crucial role in the planning of goal-directed behavior in uncertain environments. To adapt to such situations, the lPFC must flexibly encode behaviorally relevant information. Here, we investigated the goal-tuning properties of neuronal firing in the monkey lPFC during a path-planning task. We identified axis-tuned cells that preferred "up-down" or "left-right" immediate goals, and found that many were dynamically transformed from vector tuning to a final-goal direction. The activities of neurons, especially pyramidal neurons, were also modulated by the abstract sequence patterns. Our findings suggest that PFC neurons can alter not only what they code (behavioral goal) but also how they code (tuning shape) when coping with unpredictable environments with limited neuronal resources.</p>

<p>Humans can rapidly and seemingly implicitly learn to predict typical locations of relevant items when those items are encountered in familiar spatial contexts. Two important questions remain, however, concerning this type of learning: (1) which neural structures and mechanisms are involved in acquiring and exploiting such contextual knowledge? (2) Is this type of learning truly implicit and unconscious? We now answer both these questions after closely examining behavior and recording neural activity using MEG while observers (male and female) were acquiring and exploiting statistical regularities. Computational modeling of behavioral data suggested that, after repeated exposures to a spatial context, participants' behavior was marked by an abrupt switch to an exploitation strategy of the learnt regularities. MEG recordings showed that hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were involved in the task and furthermore revealed a striking dissociation: only the initial learning phase was associated with hippocampal theta band activity, while the subsequent exploitation phase showed a shift in theta band activity to the PFC. Intriguingly, the behavioral benefit of repeated exposures to certain scenes was inversely related to explicit awareness of such repeats, demonstrating the implicit nature of the expectations acquired. Together, these findings demonstrate that (1a) hippocampus and PFC play complementary roles in the implicit, unconscious learning and exploitation of spatial statistical regularities; (1b) these mechanisms are implemented in the theta frequency band; and (2) contextual knowledge can indeed be acquired unconsciously, and awareness of such knowledge can even interfere with the exploitation thereof.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Human visual perception is determined not just by the light that strikes our eyes, but also strongly by our prior knowledge and expectations. Such expectations, particularly about where to expect certain objects given scene context, might be learned implicitly and unconsciously, although this is hotly debated. Furthermore, it is unknown which brain mechanisms underpin this type of learning. We now show that, indeed, spatial prior expectations can be learned without awareness; in fact, strikingly, awareness seems to hinder the exploitation of the relevant knowledge. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one brain mechanism (hippocampal theta-band activity) is responsible for learning in these settings, whereas another mechanism (prefrontal theta-band activity) is involved in exploiting the learned associations.</p>

<p>Origin and functions of intermittent transitions among sleep stages, including brief awakenings and arousals, constitute a challenge to the current homeostatic framework for sleep regulation, focusing on factors modulating sleep over large time scales. Here we propose that the complex micro-architecture characterizing sleep on scales of seconds and minutes results from intrinsic non-equilibrium critical dynamics. We investigate - and -wave dynamics in control rats and in rats where the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) is lesioned (male Sprague-Dawley rats). We demonstrate that bursts in  and  cortical rhythms exhibit complex temporal organization, with long-range correlations and robust duality of power-law (-bursts, active phase) and exponential-like (-bursts, quiescent phase) duration distributions, features typical of non-equilibrium systems self-organizing at criticality. We show that such non-equilibrium behavior relates to anti-correlated coupling between - and -bursts, persists across a range of time scales, and is independent of the dominant physiologic state; indications of a basic principle in sleep regulation. Further, we find that VLPO lesions lead to a modulation of cortical dynamics resulting in altered dynamical parameters of - and -bursts and significant reduction in – coupling. Our empirical findings and model simulations demonstrate that – coupling is essential for the emerging non-equilibrium critical dynamics observed across the sleep–wake cycle, and indicate that VLPO neurons may have dual role for both sleep and arousal/brief wake activation. The uncovered critical behavior in sleep- and wake-related cortical rhythms indicates a mechanism essential for the micro-architecture of spontaneous sleep-stage and arousal transitions within a novel, non-homeostatic paradigm of sleep regulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that the complex micro-architecture of sleep-stage/arousal transitions arises from intrinsic non-equilibrium critical dynamics, connecting the temporal organization of dominant cortical rhythms with empirical observations across scales. We link such behavior to sleep-promoting neuronal population, and demonstrate that VLPO lesion (model of insomnia) alters dynamical features of  and  rhythms, and leads to significant reduction in – coupling. This indicates that VLPO neurons may have dual role for both sleep and arousal/brief wake control. The reported empirical findings and modeling simulations constitute first evidences of a neurophysiological fingerprint of self-organization and criticality in sleep- and wake-related cortical rhythms; a mechanism essential for spontaneous sleep-stage and arousal transitions that lays the bases for a novel, non-homeostatic paradigm of sleep regulation.</p>

<p>The cerebellum drives motor coordination and sequencing of actions at the millisecond timescale through adaptive control of cerebellar nuclear output. Cerebellar nuclei integrate high-frequency information from both the cerebellar cortex and the two main excitatory inputs of the cerebellum: the mossy fibers and the climbing fiber collaterals. However, how nuclear cells process rate and timing of inputs carried by these inputs is still debated. Here, we investigate the influence of the cerebellar cortical output, the Purkinje cells, on identified cerebellar nuclei neurons <i>in vivo</i> in male mice. Using transgenic mice expressing Channelrhodopsin2 specifically in Purkinje cells and tetrode recordings in the medial nucleus, we identified two main groups of neurons based on the waveform of their action potentials. These two groups of neurons coincide with glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons identified by optotagging after Chrimson expression in <i>VGLUT2-cre</i> and <i>GAD-cre</i> mice, respectively. The glutamatergic-like neurons fire at high rate and respond to both rate and timing of Purkinje cell population inputs, whereas GABAergic-like neurons only respond to the mean population firing rate of Purkinje cells at high frequencies. Moreover, synchronous activation of Purkinje cells can entrain the glutamatergic-like, but not the GABAergic-like, cells over a wide range of frequencies. Our results suggest that the downstream effect of synchronous and rhythmic Purkinje cell discharges depends on the type of cerebellar nuclei neurons targeted.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor coordination and skilled movements are driven by the permanent discharge of neurons from the cerebellar nuclei that communicate cerebellar computation to other brain areas. Here, we set out to study how specific subtypes of cerebellar nuclear neurons of the medial nucleus are controlled by Purkinje cells, the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. We could isolate different subtypes of nuclear cell that differentially encode Purkinje cell inhibition. Purkinje cell stimulation entrains glutamatergic projection cells at their firing frequency, whereas GABAergic neurons are only inhibited. These differential coding strategies may favor temporal precision of cerebellar excitatory outputs associated with specific features of movement control while setting the global level of cerebellar activity through inhibition via rate coding mechanisms</p>

<p>Down syndrome cell adhesion molecules (<i>dscam</i> and <i>dscaml1</i>) are essential regulators of neural circuit assembly, but their roles in vertebrate neural circuit function are still mostly unexplored. We investigated the functional consequences of <i>dscaml1</i> deficiency in the larval zebrafish (sexually undifferentiated) oculomotor system, where behavior, circuit function, and neuronal activity can be precisely quantified. Genetic perturbation of <i>dscaml1</i> resulted in deficits in retinal patterning and light adaptation, consistent with its known roles in mammals. Oculomotor analyses revealed specific deficits related to the <i>dscaml1</i> mutation, including severe fatigue during gaze stabilization, reduced saccade amplitude and velocity in the light, greater disconjugacy, and impaired fixation. Two-photon calcium imaging of abducens neurons in control and <i>dscaml1</i> mutant animals confirmed deficits in saccade-command signals (indicative of an impairment in the saccadic premotor pathway), whereas abducens activation by the pretectum-vestibular pathway was not affected. Together, we show that loss of <i>dscaml1</i> resulted in impairments in specific oculomotor circuits, providing a new animal model to investigate the development of oculomotor premotor pathways and their associated human ocular disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <i>Dscaml1</i> is a neural developmental gene with unknown behavioral significance. Using the zebrafish model, this study shows that <i>dscaml1</i> mutants have a host of oculomotor (eye movement) deficits. Notably, the oculomotor phenotypes in <i>dscaml1</i> mutants are reminiscent of human ocular motor apraxia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by reduced saccade amplitude and gaze stabilization deficits. Population-level recording of neuronal activity further revealed potential subcircuit-specific requirements for <i>dscaml1</i> during oculomotor behavior. These findings underscore the importance of <i>dscaml1</i> in the development of visuomotor function and characterize a new model to investigate potential circuit deficits underlying human oculomotor disorders.</p>

<p>Cytoskeletal filaments such as microtubules (MTs) and filamentous actin (F-actin) dynamically support cell structure and functions. In central presynaptic terminals, F-actin is expressed along the release edge and reportedly plays diverse functional roles, but whether axonal MTs extend deep into terminals and play any physiological role remains controversial. At the calyx of Held in rats of either sex, confocal and high-resolution microscopy revealed that MTs enter deep into presynaptic terminal swellings and partially colocalize with a subset of synaptic vesicles (SVs). Electrophysiological analysis demonstrated that depolymerization of MTs specifically prolonged the slow-recovery time component of EPSCs from short-term depression induced by a train of high-frequency stimulation, whereas depolymerization of F-actin specifically prolonged the fast-recovery component. In simultaneous presynaptic and postsynaptic action potential recordings, depolymerization of MTs or F-actin significantly impaired the fidelity of high-frequency neurotransmission. We conclude that MTs and F-actin differentially contribute to slow and fast SV replenishment, thereby maintaining high-frequency neurotransmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The presence and functional role of MTs in the presynaptic terminal are controversial. Here, we demonstrate that MTs are present near SVs in calyceal presynaptic terminals and that MT depolymerization specifically prolongs the slow-recovery component of EPSCs from short-term depression. In contrast, F-actin depolymerization specifically prolongs fast-recovery component. Depolymerization of MT or F-actin has no direct effect on SV exocytosis/endocytosis or basal transmission, but significantly impairs the fidelity of high-frequency transmission, suggesting that presynaptic cytoskeletal filaments play essential roles in SV replenishment for the maintenance of high-frequency neurotransmission.</p>

<p>Over the last 50 years, the concept of stress has evolved significantly, and our understanding of the underlying neurobiology has expanded dramatically. Rather than consider stress biology to be relevant only under unusual and threatening conditions, we conceive of it as an ongoing, adaptive process of assessing the environment, coping with it, and enabling the individual to anticipate and deal with future challenges. Though much remains to be discovered, the fundamental neurocircuitry that underlies these processes has been broadly delineated, key molecular players have been identified, and the impact of this system on neuroplasticity has been well established. More recently, we have come to appreciate the critical interaction between the brain and the rest of the body as it pertains to stress responsiveness. Importantly, this system can become overloaded due to ongoing environmental demands on the individual, be they physical, physiological, or psychosocial. The impact of this overload is deleterious to brain health, and it results in vulnerability to a range of brain disorders, including major depression and cognitive deficits. Thus, stress biology is one of the best understood systems in affective neuroscience and is an ideal target for addressing the pathophysiology of many brain-related diseases. The story we present began with the discovery of glucocorticoid receptors in hippocampus and has extended to other brain regions in both animal models and the human brain with the further discovery of structural and functional adaptive plasticity in response to stressful and other experiences.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/1/107?rss=1">A Mutation in Hnrnph1 That Decreases Methamphetamine-Induced Reinforcement, Reward, and Dopamine Release and Increases Synaptosomal hnRNP H and Mitochondrial Proteins</a></h4>

<p>Individual variation in the addiction liability of amphetamines has a heritable genetic component. We previously identified <i>Hnrnph1</i> (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying decreased methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity in mice. Here, we showed that mice (both females and males) with a heterozygous mutation in the first coding exon of <i>Hnrnph1</i> (H1<sup>+/–</sup>) showed reduced methamphetamine reinforcement and intake and dose-dependent changes in methamphetamine reward as measured via conditioned place preference. Furthermore, H1<sup>+/–</sup> mice showed a robust decrease in methamphetamine-induced dopamine release in the NAc with no change in baseline extracellular dopamine, striatal whole-tissue dopamine, dopamine transporter protein, dopamine uptake, or striatal methamphetamine and amphetamine metabolite levels. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot staining of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their forebrain projections for TH did not reveal any major changes in staining intensity, cell number, or forebrain puncta counts. Surprisingly, there was a twofold increase in hnRNP H protein in the striatal synaptosome of H1<sup>+/–</sup> mice with no change in whole-tissue levels. To gain insight into the mechanisms linking increased synaptic hnRNP H with decreased methamphetamine-induced dopamine release and behaviors, synaptosomal proteomic analysis identified an increased baseline abundance of several mitochondrial complex I and V proteins that rapidly decreased at 30 min after methamphetamine administration in H1<sup>+/–</sup> mice. In contrast, the much lower level of basal synaptosomal mitochondrial proteins in WT mice showed a rapid increase. We conclude that H1<sup>+/–</sup> decreases methamphetamine-induced dopamine release, reward, and reinforcement and induces dynamic changes in basal and methamphetamine-induced synaptic mitochondrial function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Methamphetamine dependence is a significant public health concern with no FDA-approved treatment. We discovered a role for the RNA binding protein hnRNP H in methamphetamine reward and reinforcement. <i>Hnrnph1</i> mutation also blunted methamphetamine-induced dopamine release in the NAc, a key neurochemical event contributing to methamphetamine addiction liability. Finally, <i>Hnrnph1</i> mutants showed a marked increase in basal level of synaptosomal hnRNP H and mitochondrial proteins that decreased in response to methamphetamine, whereas WT mice showed a methamphetamine-induced increase in synaptosomal mitochondrial proteins. Thus, we identified a potential role for hnRNP H in basal and dynamic mitochondrial function that informs methamphetamine-induced cellular adaptations associated with reduced addiction liability.</p>

Abstract<p>Multi-electrode arrays (MEA) are being more widely used by researchers as an instrument platform for monitoring prolonged, non-destructive recordings of spontaneously firing neurons <i>in vitro</i> for applications in modeling Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, and many other diseases of the human central nervous system. With the more widespread use of these instruments, there is a need to examine the prior art of studies utilizing MEAs, and delineate best practices for data acquisition and analysis to avoid errors in interpretation of the resultant data. Using a dataset of recordings from primary rat <i>(Rattus norvegicus)</i> cortical cultures, methods and statistical power for discerning changes in neuronal activity on the array level are examined. Further, a method for unsupervised spike sorting is implemented, allowing for the resolution of action potential incidents down to the single neuron level. Following implementation of spike sorting, the dynamics of firing frequency across populations of individual neurons and networks are examined longitudinally. Finally, the ability to detect a frequency independent phenotype, the change in action potential amplitude, is demonstrated through the use of pore-forming neurotoxin treatments. Taken together, this study provides guidance and tools for users wishing to incorporate multi-well MEA usage into their studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Multi-electrode arrays (MEA) are an instrument platform being utilized by an increasing number of neuroscientist for the purpose of monitoring spontaneous firing of neurons in vitro over extended periods of time. Through an analysis of existing literature and empirically generated datasets, this study seeks to establish best practices for the use of these instruments for applications employing neuronal cultures. Elements of experimental design and analysis for assaying firing frequencies across arrays are discussed, with a focus on the use of multi-well MEAs. Additionally, methods for (i) resolving signal to individual neurons through unsupervised spike-sorting, (ii) assessing network dynamics, and (iii) quantifying changing in action potential amplitudes are reported.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52882">From behavior to circuit modeling of light-seeking navigation in zebrafish larvae</a></h4>

Bridging brain-scale circuit dynamics and organism-scale behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience. It requires the concurrent development of minimal behavioral and neural circuit models that can quantitatively capture basic sensorimotor operations. Here we focus on light-seeking navigation in zebrafish larvae. Using a virtual reality assay, we first characterize how motor and visual stimulation sequences govern the selection of discrete swim-bout events that subserve the fish navigation in the presence of a distant light source. These mechanisms are combined into a comprehensive Markov-chain model of navigation that quantitatively predict the stationary distribution of the fish's body orientation under any given illumination profile. We then map this behavioral description onto a neuronal model of the ARTR, a small neural circuit involved in the orientation-selection of swim bouts. We demonstrate that this visually-biased decision-making circuit can similarly capture the statistics of both spontaneous and contrast-driven navigation.

Cohesin has essential roles in chromosome structure, segregation and repair. Cohesin binding to chromosomes is catalyzed by the cohesin loader, Mis4 in fission yeast. How cells fine tune cohesin deposition is largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that Mis4 activity is regulated by phosphorylation of its cohesin substrate. A genetic screen for negative regulators of Mis4 yielded a CDK called Pef1, whose closest human homologue is CDK5. Inhibition of Pef1 kinase activity rescued cohesin loader deficiencies. In an otherwise wild-type background, Pef1 ablation stimulated cohesin binding to its regular sites along chromosomes while ablating Protein Phosphatase 4 had the opposite effect. Pef1 and PP4 control the phosphorylation state of the cohesin kleisin Rad21. The CDK phosphorylates Rad21 on Threonine 262. Pef1 ablation, non phosphorylatable Rad21-T262 or mutations within a Rad21 binding domain of Mis4 alleviated the effect of PP4 deficiency. Such a CDK/PP4 based regulation of cohesin loader activity could provide an efficient mechanism for translating cellular cues into a fast and accurate cohesin response.

<p>Many theories, based on neuroscientific and psychological empirical evidence
and on computational concepts, have been elaborated to explain the emergence of
consciousness in the central nervous system. These theories propose key
fundamental mechanisms to explain consciousness, but they only partially
connect such mechanisms to the possible functional and adaptive role of
consciousness. Recently, some cognitive and neuroscientific models try to solve
this gap by linking consciousness to various aspects of goal-directed
behaviour, the pivotal cognitive process that allows mammals to flexibly act in
challenging environments. Here we propose the Representation
Internal-Manipulation (RIM) theory of consciousness, a theory that links the
main elements of consciousness theories to components and functions of
goal-directed behaviour, ascribing a central role for consciousness to the
goal-directed manipulation of internal representations. This manipulation
relies on four specific computational operations to perform the flexible
internal adaptation of all key elements of goal-directed computation, from the
representations of objects to those of goals, actions, and plans. Finally, we
propose the concept of `manipulation agency' relating the sense of agency to
the internal manipulation of representations. This allows us to propose that
the subjective experience of consciousness is associated to the human capacity
to generate and control a simulated internal reality that is vividly perceived
and felt through the same perceptual and emotional mechanisms used to tackle
the external world.

<p>In neurons, neuropeptides are synthesized in the soma and are then
transported along the axon in dense core vesicles (DCVs). DCVs are captured in
varicosities located along the axon terminal called en passant boutons, which
are active terminal sites that accumulate and release neurotransmitters.
Recently developed experimental techniques allow for the estimation of the age
of DCVs in various locations in the axon terminal. Accurate simulation of the
mean age of DCVs in boutons requires the development of a model that would
account for both resident and transiting populations of DCVs. In this paper,
such a model is developed. The model is applied to simulating DCV transport in
Drosophila type II motoneurons. The model simulates DCV transport and capture
in the axon terminals and makes it possible to predict the age density
distribution of DCVs in en passant boutons as well as DCV's mean age in
boutons. The predicted prevalence of older organelles in distal boutons may
explain the "dying back" pattern of axonal degeneration observed in
dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.

<p>This paper predicts the ability to externally control the firing times of a
cortical neuron whose behavior follows the Izhikevich neuron model. The
Izhikevich neuron model provides an efficient and biologically plausible method
to track a cortical neuron's membrane potential and its firing times. The
external control is a simple optogenetic model represented by an illumination
source that stimulates a saturating or decaying membrane current. This paper
considers firing frequencies that are sufficiently low for the membrane
potential to return to its resting potential after it fires. The time required
for the neuron to charge and for the neuron to recover to the resting potential
are numerically fitted to functions of the Izhikevich neuron model parameters
and the peak input current. Results show that simple functions of the model
parameters and maximum input current can be used to predict the charging and
recovery times, even when there are deviations in the actual parameter values.
Furthermore, the predictions lead to lower bounds on the firing frequency that
can be achieved without significant distortion.

Abstract
<p>Electric fields (EFs) can direct cell migration and are crucial during development and tissue repair. We previously reported neural precursor cells (NPCs) are electrosensitive cells that can undergo rapid and directed migration towards the cathode using charge-balanced electrical stimulation <i>in vitro</i>. Here, we investigate the ability of electrical stimulation to direct neural precursor migration in mouse brains <i>in vivo</i>. To visualize migration, fluorescent adult murine neural precursors were transplanted onto the corpus callosum of adult male mice and intracortical platinum wire electrodes were implanted medial (cathode) and lateral (anode) to the injection site. We applied a charge-balanced biphasic monopolar stimulation waveform for three sessions per day, for 3 or 6 d. Irrespective of stimulation, the transplanted neural precursors had a propensity to migrate laterally along the corpus callosum, and applied stimulation affected that migration. Further investigation revealed an endogenous EF along the corpus callosum that correlated with the lateral migration, suggesting that the applied EF would need to overcome endogenous cues. There was no difference in transplanted cell differentiation and proliferation, or inflammatory cell numbers near the electrode leads and injection site comparing stimulated and implanted non-stimulated brains. Our results support that endogenous and applied EFs are important considerations for designing cell therapies for tissue repair <i>in vivo.</i>  </p>

ABSTRACT<p>The preBötzinger complex (preBötC) generates the rhythm and rudimentary motor pattern for inspiratory breathing movements. Here we test ‘burstlet’ theory (Kam et al., 2013a ), which posits that low amplitude burstlets, subthreshold from the standpoint of inspiratory bursts, reflect the fundamental oscillator of the preBötC. In turn, a discrete suprathreshold process transforms burstlets into full amplitude inspiratory bursts that drive motor output, measurable via hypoglossal nerve (XII) discharge <i>in vitro</i>. We recap observations by Kam &amp; Feldman in neonatal mouse slice preparations: field recordings from preBötC demonstrate bursts and concurrent XII motor output intermingled with lower amplitude burstlets that do not produce XII motor output. Manipulations of excitability affect the relative prevalence of bursts and burstlets and modulate their frequency. Whole-cell and photonic recordings of preBötC neurons suggest that burstlets involve inconstant subsets of rhythmogenic interneurons. We conclude that discrete rhythm- and pattern-generating mechanisms coexist in the preBötC and that burstlets reflect its fundamental rhythmogenic nature.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Breathing movements depend on a neural rhythm and rudimentary motor pattern. Microcircuits of the brainstem preBötzinger complex (preBötC) produce both, but by unknown mechanisms that prove refractory to canonical explanations. Inspired by an unconventional proposal that rhythm and motor pattern are separable processes (Kam et al., 2013a ), we replicated their findings that rhythmicity in local preBötC microcircuits can occur independently without obligatory neural bursts that generate motor output. The rhythm is voltage dependent and the constituent interneurons change from cycle to cycle. These results suggest that breathing rhythm is attributable to recurrent excitation among interneurons that discretely trigger neural bursts and motor output. The preBötC, previously considered uniquely rhythmogenic, contains rhythm- and pattern-generating microcircuits.</p>

Abstract<p>Optical imaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as a correlate of neuronal excitation represents a standard technique for visualizing spatiotemporal activity of neuronal networks. However, the information-processing properties of single neurons and neuronal circuits likewise involve inhibition of neuronal membrane potential. Here, we report spatially resolved optical imaging of odor-evoked inhibitory patterns in the olfactory circuitry of <i>Drosophila</i> using a genetically encoded fluorescent Cl<sup>-</sup> sensor. In combination with the excitatory component reflected by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, we present a comprehensive functional map of both odor-evoked neuronal activation and inhibition at different levels of olfactory processing. We demonstrate that odor-evoked inhibition carried by Cl<sup>-</sup> influx is present both in sensory neurons and second-order projection neurons, and is characterized by stereotypic, odor-specific patterns. Cl<sup>-</sup> mediated inhibition features distinct dynamics in different neuronal populations. Our data support a dual role of inhibitory neurons in the olfactory system: global gain control across the neuronal circuitry and glomerulus-specific inhibition to enhance neuronal information processing.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neural inhibition is evidently as important as excitation given it is present at every level of sensory processing. This study characterizes odor-evoked inhibitory patterns along different levels of olfactory processing of <i>Drosophila</i> using functional imaging via <i>Clomeleon</i>, a genetically encoded indicator for chloride ions, the main mediator of synaptic inhibition in mature neurons. In combination with the excitatory component reflected by intracellular calcium, we analyzed the interplay between odor-evoked excitation and inhibition. Our data provide both a more accurate and comprehensive characterization of the actual information content encoded by the olfactory circuitry, as well as elucidate network properties within the primary olfactory center of the fly.</p>

<p>Color Appearance Models are biological networks that consist of a cascade of
linear+nonlinear layers that modify the linear measurements at the retinal
photo-receptors leading to an internal (nonlinear) representation of color that
correlates with psychophysical experience. The basic layers of these networks
include: (1) chromatic adaptation (normalization of the mean and covariance of
the color manifold), (2) change to opponent color channels (PCA-like rotation
in the color space), and (3) saturating nonlinearities to get perceptually
Euclidean color representations (similar to dimensionwise equalization). The
Efficient Coding Hypothesis argues that these transforms should emerge from
information-theoretic goals. In case this hypothesis holds in color vision, the
question is, what is the coding gain due to the different layers of the color
appearance networks?
</p>
<p>In this work, a representative family of Color Appearance Models is analyzed
in terms of how the redundancy among the chromatic components is modified along
the network and how much information is transferred from the input data to the
noisy response. The proposed analysis is done using data and methods that were
not available before: (1) new colorimetrically calibrated scenes in different
CIE illuminations for proper evaluation of chromatic adaptation, and (2) new
statistical tools to estimate (multivariate) information-theoretic quantities
between multidimensional sets based on Gaussianization. Results confirm that
the Efficient Coding Hypothesis holds for current color vision models, and
identify the psychophysical mechanisms critically responsible for gains in
information transference: opponent channels and their nonlinear nature are more
important than chromatic adaptation at the retina.

<p>In computational neuroscience, as well as in machine learning, neuromorphic
devices promise an accelerated and scalable alternative to neural network
simulations. Their neural connectivity and synaptic capacity depends on their
specific design choices, but is always intrinsically limited. Here, we present
a strategy to achieve structural plasticity that optimizes resource allocation
under these constraints by constantly rewiring the pre- and postsynaptic
partners while keeping the neuronal fan-in constant and the connectome sparse.
In our implementation, the algorithm is executed on a custom embedded digital
processor that accompanies a mixed-signal substrate consisting of spiking
neurons and synapse circuits. We evaluated our proposed algorithm in a simple
supervised learning scenario, showing its ability to optimize the network
topology with respect to the nature of its training data, as well as its
overall computational efficiency.

<p>We present an optimized algorithm that performs automatic classification of
white matter fibers based on a multi-subject bundle atlas. We implemented a
parallel algorithm that improves upon its previous version in both execution
time and memory usage. Our new version uses the local memory of each processor,
which leads to a reduction in execution time. Hence, it allows the analysis of
bigger subject and/or atlas datasets. As a result, the segmentation of a
subject of 4,145,000 fibers is reduced from about 14 minutes in the previous
version to about 6 minutes, yielding an acceleration of 2.34. In addition, the
new algorithm reduces the memory consumption of the previous version by a
factor of 0.79.

<p>by Go Ashida, Helen T. Heinermann, Jutta Kretzberg</p>

Computations of acoustic information along the central auditory pathways start in the cochlear nucleus. Bushy cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, which innervate monaural and binaural stations in the superior olivary complex, process and transfer temporal cues relevant for sound localization. These cells are categorized into two groups: spherical and globular bushy cells (SBCs/GBCs). Spontaneous rates of GBCs innervated by multiple auditory nerve (AN) fibers are generally lower than those of SBCs that receive a small number of large AN synapses. In response to low-frequency tonal stimulation, both types of bushy cells show improved phase-locking and entrainment compared to AN fibers. When driven by high-frequency tones, GBCs show primary-like-with-notch or onset-L peristimulus time histograms and relatively irregular spiking. However, previous <i>in vivo</i> physiological studies of bushy cells also found considerable unit-to-unit variability in these response patterns. Here we present a population of models that can simulate the observed variation in GBCs. We used a simple coincidence detection model with an adaptive threshold and systematically varied its six parameters. Out of 567000 parameter combinations tested, 7520 primary-like-with-notch models and 4094 onset-L models were selected that satisfied a set of physiological criteria for a GBC unit. Analyses of the model parameters and output measures revealed that the parameters of the accepted model population are weakly correlated with each other to retain major GBC properties, and that the output spiking patterns of the model are affected by a combination of multiple parameters. Simulations of frequency-dependent temporal properties of the model GBCs showed a reasonable fit to empirical data, supporting the validity of our population modeling. The computational simplicity and efficiency of the model structure makes our approach suitable for future large-scale simulations of binaural information processing that may involve thousands of GBC units.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8w8z3LJ3dw8" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Epidemiological studies have found an increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders in populations prenatally exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Optical imaging provides a minimally invasive way to determine if perinatal SSRI exposure has long-term effects on cortical function. Herein we probed the functional neuroimaging effects of perinatal SSRI exposure in a fluoxetine (FLX)-exposed mouse model. While resting-state homotopic contralateral functional connectivity was unperturbed, the evoked cortical response to forepaw stimulation was altered in FLX mice. The stimulated cortex showed decreased activity for FLX versus controls, by both hemodynamic responses [oxyhemoglobin (HbO<sub>2</sub>)] and neuronal calcium responses (<i>Thy1</i>-GCaMP6f fluorescence). Significant alterations in both cortical HbO<sub>2</sub> and calcium response amplitude were seen in the cortex ipsilateral to the stimulated paw in FLX as compared to controls. The cortical regions of largest difference in activation between FLX and controls also were consistent between HbO<sub>2</sub> and calcium contrasts at the end of stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest a global loss of response signal amplitude in FLX versus controls. These findings indicate that perinatal SSRI exposure has long-term consequences on somatosensory cortical responses.</p>

Abstract<p>Whilst BDNF is receiving considerable attention for its role in synaptic plasticity and in nervous system dysfunction, identifying brain circuits involving BDNF-expressing neurons has been challenging. BDNF levels are very low in most brain areas, except for the large mossy fibre terminals in the hippocampus where BDNF accumulates at readily detectable levels. This report describes the generation of a mouse line allowing the detection of single brain cells synthesising BDNF. A bicistronic construct encoding BDNF tagged with a P2A sequence preceding GFP allows the translation of BDNF and GFP as separate proteins. Following its validation with transfected cells this construct was used to replace the endogenous <i>Bdnf</i> gene. Viable and fertile homozygote animals were generated, with the GFP signal marking neuronal cell bodies translating the <i>Bdnf</i> mRNA. Importantly, the distribution of immunoreactive BDNF remained unchanged as exemplified by its accumulation in mossy fibre terminals in the transgenic animals. GFP-labelled neurons could be readily visualised in distinct layers in the cerebral cortex where BDNF has been difficult to detect with currently available reagents. In the hippocampal formation, quantification of the GFP signal revealed that fewer than 10% of the neurons do not translate the <i>Bdnf</i> mRNA at detectable levels, with the highest proportion of strongly labelled neurons found in CA3.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> BDNF is a highly conserved growth factor known to be essential for the function of the nervous system. Its very low abundance in the brain has retarded the development of drugs targeting BDNF-expressing neurons in disease-relevant brain areas. The present report describes a novel approach allowing the localisation of single cells in the adult mouse brain actively translating <i>Bdnf</i> mRNAs using GFP as a surrogate marker. The availability of these transgenic animals will also help in understanding the action of drugs such as ketamine thought to act by increasing <i>Bdnf</i> translation.</p>

Abstract<p>Cholinergic transmission is essential for adaptive behavior and has been suggested to play a central role in the modulation of brain states by means of the modulation of thalamic neurons. Midbrain cholinergic neurons from the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) provide dense innervation of the thalamus, but a detailed connectivity mapping is missing. Using conditional tracing of midbrain cholinergic axons in the rat, together with a detailed segmentation of thalamic structures, we show that projections arising in PPN and LDT are topographically organized along the entire extent of the thalamus. PPN cholinergic neurons preferentially innervate thalamic relay structures, whereas LDT cholinergic neurons preferentially target thalamic limbic nuclei. Moreover, both PPN and LDT provide a dense innervation of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Notably, we observe a differential synaptic density that functionally dissociates between PPN and LDT innervation. Our results show that midbrain cholinergic neurons innervate virtually all thalamic structures and this innervation is functionally segregated.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The cholinergic midbrain provides dense innervation to the thalamus and modulates its activity across different behaviors. However, the magnitude of this projection and the precise distribution of these axons in relation to different functional thalamic regions remain poorly understood. Here, we selectively labeled cholinergic axons arising in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) using conditional viral tracing. We reveal that PPN and LDT cholinergic axons are topographically organized and provide a segregated innervation of thalamic structures. PPN neurons preferentially innervate relay thalamic nuclei, whereas LDT neurons preferentially innervate thalamic limbic nuclei. Our results suggest that neurons along the functional domains of the cholinergic midbrain have a differential impact on thalamic circuits.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recently, the ASC‐1 complex has been identified as a mechanistic link between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and 3 mutations of the ASC‐1 gene <i>TRIP4</i> have been associated with SMA or congenital myopathy. Our goal was to define ASC‐1 neuromuscular function and the phenotypical spectrum associated with <i>TRIP4</i> mutations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, molecular, histological, and magnetic resonance imaging studies were made in 5 families with 7 novel <i>TRIP4</i> mutations. Fluorescence activated cell sorting and Western blot were performed in patient‐derived fibroblasts and muscles and in <i>Trip4</i> knocked‐down C2C12 cells.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All mutations caused ASC‐1 protein depletion. The clinical phenotype was purely myopathic, ranging from lethal neonatal to mild ambulatory adult patients. It included early onset axial and proximal weakness, scoliosis, rigid spine, dysmorphic facies, cutaneous involvement, respiratory failure, and in the older cases, dilated cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies showed multiminicores, nemaline rods, cytoplasmic bodies, caps, central nuclei, rimmed fibers, and/or mild endomysial fibrosis. ASC‐1 depletion in C2C12 and in patient‐derived fibroblasts and muscles caused accelerated proliferation, altered expression of cell cycle proteins, and/or shortening of the G0/G1 cell cycle phase leading to cell size reduction.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results expand the phenotypical and molecular spectrum of <i>TRIP4</i>‐associated disease to include mild adult forms with or without cardiomyopathy, associate ASC‐1 depletion with isolated primary muscle involvement, and establish <i>TRIP4</i> as a causative gene for several congenital muscle diseases, including nemaline, core, centronuclear, and cytoplasmic‐body myopathies. They also identify ASC‐1 as a novel cell cycle regulator with a key role in cell proliferation, and underline transcriptional coregulation defects as a novel pathophysiological mechanism.

Households are important settings for the transmission of seasonal influenza. Previous studies found that the per-person risk of within-household transmission decreases with household size. However, more detailed heterogeneities driven by household composition and contact patterns have not been studied. We employed a mathematical model that accounts for infections both from outside and within the household. The model was applied to citywide primary school seasonal influenza surveillance and household surveys from 10,486 students during the 2014/15 season in Matsumoto city, Japan. We compared a range of models to estimate the structure of household transmission and found that familial relationship and household composition strongly influenced the transmission patterns of seasonal influenza in households. Children had a substantially high risk of infection from outside the household (up to 20%) compared with adults (1–3%). Intense transmission was observed within-generation (between children/parents/grandparents) and also between mother and child, with transmission risks typically ranging from 5–20% depending on the transmission route and household composition. Children were identified as the largest source of secondary transmission, with family structure influencing infection risk.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FTM26swp-0Y" width="1" />

<p>by Yongcui Wang, Shilong Chen, Luonan Chen, Yong Wang</p>

Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts have emerging impacts in cancer studies, which suggests their potential as novel therapeutic agents. However, the molecular mechanism behind their treatment effects is still unclear. Here, we designed a computational model to Associate LncRNAs with Anti-Cancer Drugs (ALACD) based on a bilevel optimization model, which optimized the gene signature overlap in the upper level and imputed the missing lncRNA-gene association in the lower level. ALACD predicts genes coexpressed with lncRNAs mean while matching drug’s gene signatures. This model allows us to borrow the target gene information of small molecules to understand the mechanisms of action of lncRNAs and their roles in cancer. The ALACD model was systematically applied to the 10 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that had matched lncRNA and mRNA expression data. Cancer type-specific lncRNAs and associated drugs were identified. These lncRNAs show significantly different expression levels in cancer patients. Follow-up functional and molecular pathway analysis suggest the gene signatures bridging drugs and lncRNAs are closely related to cancer development. Importantly, patient survival information and evidence from the literature suggest that the lncRNAs and drug-lncRNA associations identified by the ALACD model can provide an alternative choice for cancer targeting treatment and potential cancer pognostic biomarkers.

<p>by Haishan Zhang, Ximing Shao, Yin Peng, Yanning Teng, Konda Mani Saravanan, Huiling Zhang, Hongchang Li, Yanjie Wei</p>

Identification of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) progenitor cells, the iPS forming cells in early stage of reprogramming, could provide valuable information for studying the origin and underlying mechanism of iPS cells. However, it is very difficult to identify experimentally since there are no biomarkers known for early progenitor cells, and only about 6 days after reprogramming initiation, iPS cells can be experimentally determined via fluorescent probes. What is more, the ratio of progenitor cells during early reprograming period is below 5%, which is too low to capture experimentally in the early stage. In this paper, we propose a novel computational approach for the identification of iPS progenitor cells based on machine learning and microscopic image analysis. Firstly, we record the reprogramming process using a live cell imaging system after 48 hours of infection with retroviruses expressing Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4, later iPS progenitor cells and normal murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) within 3 to 5 days after infection are labeled by retrospectively tracing the time-lapse microscopic image. We then calculate 11 types of cell morphological and motion features such as area, speed, etc., and select best time windows for modeling and perform feature selection. Finally, a prediction model using XGBoost is built based on the selected six types of features and best time windows. Our model allows several missing values/frames in the sample datasets, thus it is applicable to a wide range of scenarios. Cross-validation, holdout validation and independent test experiments show that the minimum precision is above 52%, that is, the ratio of predicted progenitor cells within 3 to 5 days after viral infection is above 52%. The results also confirm that the morphology and motion pattern of iPS progenitor cells is different from that of normal MEFs, which helps with the machine learning methods for iPS progenitor cell identification.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JwYJDsm2krE" width="1" />

<p>In recent years, many molecular and environmental factors have been studied
to understand how synaptic plasticity is modulated. Sleep, as an evolutionary
conserved biological function, has shown to be a critical player for the
consolidation and filtering of synaptic circuitry underlying memory traces.
Although sleep disturbances do not alter normal memory consolidation, they may
reflect fundamental circuit malfunctions that can play a significant role in
exacerbating diseases, such as autism and Alzheimer's disease. Very recently,
scientists sought to answer part of this enigma and they identified p75
neurotrophic receptor (p75NTR) as a critical player in mediating impairments in
hippocampal-dependent associative plasticity upon sleep deprivation. This paper
will review the role of the p75NTR, critically discuss the impact and
implications of this research as the bridge for sleep research and neurological
diseases.

<p>For a biological agent operating under environmental pressure, energy
consumption and reaction times are of critical importance. Similarly,
engineered systems also strive for short time-to-solution and low
energy-to-solution characteristics. At the level of neuronal implementation,
this implies achieving the desired results with as few and as early spikes as
possible. In the time-to-first-spike coding framework, both of these goals are
inherently emerging features of learning. Here, we describe a rigorous
derivation of error-backpropagation-based learning for hierarchical networks of
leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We explicitly address two issues that are
relevant for both biological plausibility and applicability to neuromorphic
substrates by incorporating dynamics with finite time constants and by
optimizing the backward pass with respect to substrate variability. This
narrows the gap between previous models of first-spike-time learning and
biological neuronal dynamics, thereby also enabling fast and energy-efficient
inference on analog neuromorphic devices that inherit these dynamics from their
biological archetypes, which we demonstrate on two generations of the
BrainScaleS analog neuromorphic architecture.

<p>There are several protocols in the Electroencephalography (EEG) recording
scenarios which produce various types of event-related potentials (ERP). P300
pattern is a well-known ERP which produced by auditory and visual oddball
paradigm and BCI speller system. In this study, P300 and non-P300 separability
are investigated in two scenarios including image recognition paradigm and BCI
speller. Image recognition scenario is an experiment that examines the
participants, knowledge about an image that shown to them before by analyzing
the EEG signal recorded during the observing of that image as visual
stimulation. To do this, three types of famous classifiers (SVM, Bayes LDA, and
sparse logistic regression) were used to classify EEG recordings in six classes
problem. Filtered and down-sampled (temporal samples) of EEG recording were
considered as features in classification P300 pattern. Also, different sets of
EEG recording including 4, 8 and 16 channels and different trial numbers were
used to considering various situations in comparison. The accuracy was
increased by increasing the number of trials and channels. The results prove
that better accuracy is observed in the case of the image recognition scenario
for the different sets of channels and by using the different number of trials.
So it can be concluded that P300 pattern which produced in image recognition
paradigm is more separable than BCI (matrix speller).

<p>The hippocampal system contains neural populations that encode an animal's
position and velocity as it navigates through space. Here, we show that such
populations can embed two codes within their spike trains: a firing rate code
(R) conveyed by within-cell spike intervals, and a co-firing rate code (R')
conveyed by between-cell spike intervals. These two codes behave as conjugates
of one another, obeying an analog of the uncertainty principle from physics:
information conveyed in R comes at the expense of information in R', and vice
versa. An exception to this trade-off occurs when spike trains encode a pair of
conjugate variables, such as position and velocity, which do not compete for
capacity across R and R'. To illustrate this, we describe two biologically
inspired methods for decoding R and R', referred to as sigma and sigma-chi
decoding, respectively. Simulations of head direction (HD) and grid cells show
that if firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position
is recovered by sigma decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma-chi
decoding. Conversely, simulations of oscillatory interference among
theta-modulated "speed cells" show that if co-firing rates are tuned for
position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by sigma-chi decoding,
whereas velocity is recovered by sigma decoding. Between these two extremes,
information about both variables can be distributed across both channels, and
partially recovered by both decoders. These results suggest that neurons with
different spatial and temporal tuning properties-such as speed versus grid
cells-might not encode different information, but rather, distribute similar
information about position and velocity in different ways across R and R'.

<p>Objective. Recent advancements in electrode designs and micro-fabrication
technology has allowed existence of microelectrode arrays with hundreds of
channels for single-cell recordings. In such electrophysiological recordings,
each implanted micro-electrode can record the activities of more than one
neuron in its vicinity. Recording the activities of multiple neurons may also
be referred to as multiple unit activity. However, for any further analysis,
the main goal is to isolate the activity of each recorded neuron and thus
called single-unit activity. This process may also be referred to as spike
sorting or spike classification. Recent approaches to extract SUA are time
consuming, mainly due to the requirement of human intervention at various
stages of spike sorting pipeline. Lack of standardization is another drawback
of the current available approaches. Therefore, in this study we proposed a
standard spike sorter: SpikeDeep-Classifier, a fully automatic spike sorting
algorithm. Approach. We proposed a novel spike sorting pipeline, based on a set
of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. We used supervised, deep
learning-based algorithms for extracting meaningful channels and removing
background activities (noise) from the extracted channels. We also showed that
the process of clustering becomes straight-forward, once the noise/artifact is
completely removed from the data. Therefore, in the next stage, we applied a
simple clustering algorithm (K-mean) with predefined maximum number of
clusters. Lastly, we used a similarity-based criterion to keep distinct
clusters and merge similar-looking clusters. Main results. We evaluated our
algorithm on a dataset collected from two different species (humans and
non-human primates (NHPs)) without any retraining. We also validated our
algorithm on two publicly available labeled datasets.

<p>by Kirill E. Medvedev, Lisa N. Kinch, R. Dustin Schaeffer, Nick V. Grishin</p>

Rossmann folds are ancient, frequently diverged domains found in many biological reaction pathways where they have adapted for different functions. Consequently, discernment and classification of their homologous relations and function can be complicated. We define a minimal Rossmann-like structure motif (RLM) that corresponds for the common core of known Rossmann domains and use this motif to identify all RLM domains in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), thus finding they constitute about 20% of all known 3D structures. The Evolutionary Classification of protein structure Domains (ECOD) classifies RLM domains in a number of groups that lack evidence for homology (X-groups), which suggests that they could have evolved independently multiple times. Closely related, homologous RLM enzyme families can diverge to bind different ligands using similar binding sites and to catalyze different reactions. Conversely, non-homologous RLM domains can converge to catalyze the same reactions or to bind the same ligand with alternate binding modes. We discuss a special case of such convergent evolution that is relevant to the polypharmacology paradigm, wherein the same drug (methotrexate) binds to multiple non-homologous RLM drug targets with different topologies. Finally, assigning proteins with RLM domain to the Enzyme Commission classification suggest that RLM enzymes function mainly in metabolism (and comprise 38% of reference metabolic pathways) and are overrepresented in extant pathways that represent ancient biosynthetic routes such as nucleotide metabolism, energy metabolism, and metabolism of amino acids. In fact, RLM enzymes take part in five out of eight enzymatic reactions of the Wood-Ljungdahl metabolic pathway thought to be used by the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). The prevalence of RLM domains in this ancient metabolism might explain their wide distribution among enzymes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PPTgrroAzzo" width="1" />

<p>by Mengyun Yang, Huimin Luo, Yaohang Li, Fang-Xiang Wu, Jianxin Wang</p>

Identification of potential drug–associated indications is critical for either approved or novel drugs in drug repositioning. Current computational methods based on drug similarity and disease similarity have been developed to predict drug–disease associations. When more reliable drug- or disease-related information becomes available and is integrated, the prediction precision can be continuously improved. However, it is a challenging problem to effectively incorporate multiple types of prior information, representing different characteristics of drugs and diseases, to identify promising drug–disease associations. In this study, we propose an overlap matrix completion (OMC) for bilayer networks (OMC2) and tri-layer networks (OMC3) to predict potential drug-associated indications, respectively. OMC is able to efficiently exploit the underlying low-rank structures of the drug–disease association matrices. In OMC2, first of all, we construct one bilayer network from drug-side aspect and one from disease-side aspect, and then obtain their corresponding block adjacency matrices. We then propose the OMC2 algorithm to fill out the values of the missing entries in these two adjacency matrices, and predict the scores of unknown drug–disease pairs. Moreover, we further extend OMC2 to OMC3 to handle tri-layer networks. Computational experiments on various datasets indicate that our OMC methods can effectively predict the potential drug–disease associations. Compared with the other state-of-the-art approaches, our methods yield higher prediction accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation and <i>de novo</i> experiments. In addition, case studies also confirm the effectiveness of our methods in identifying promising indications for existing drugs in practical applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hbYFkvl1TP4" width="1" />

The lumenal <i>p</i>H of an organelle is one of its defining characteristics and central to its biological function. Experiments have elucidated many of the key <i>p</i>H regulatory elements and how they vary from compartment-to-compartment, and continuum mathematical models have played an important role in understanding how these elements (proton pumps, counter-ion fluxes, membrane potential, buffering capacity, etc.) work together to achieve specific <i>p</i>H setpoints. While continuum models have proven successful in describing ion regulation at the cellular length scale, it is unknown if they are valid at the subcellular level where volumes are small, ion numbers may fluctuate wildly, and biochemical heterogeneity is large. Here, we create a discrete, stochastic (DS) model of vesicular acidification to answer this question. We used this simplified model to analyze <i>p</i>H measurements of isolated vesicles containing single proton pumps and compared these results to solutions from a continuum, ordinary differential equations (ODE)-based model. Both models predict similar parameter estimates for the mean proton pumping rate, membrane permeability, etc., but, as expected, the ODE model fails to report on the fluctuations in the system. The stochastic model predicts that <i>p</i>H fluctuations decrease during acidification, but noise analysis of single-vesicle data confirms our finding that the experimental noise is dominated by the fluorescent dye, and it reveals no insight into the true noise in the proton fluctuations. Finally, we again use the reduced DS model explore the acidification of large, lysosome-like vesicles to determine how stochastic elements, such as variations in proton-pump copy number and cycling between on and off states, impact the <i>p</i>H setpoint and fluctuations around this setpoint.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_9oBBFRaD6Y" width="1" />

<p>by Razie Yousefi, Maga Rowicka</p>

Eukaryotic DNA replication is elaborately orchestrated to duplicate the genome timely and faithfully. Replication initiates at multiple origins from which replication forks emanate and travel bi-directionally. The complex spatio-temporal regulation of DNA replication remains incompletely understood. To study it, computational models of DNA replication have been developed in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. However, in spite of the experimental evidence of forks’ speed stochasticity, all models assumed that forks’ speeds are the same. Here, we present the first model of DNA replication assuming that speeds vary stochastically between forks. Utilizing data from both wild-type and hydroxyurea-treated yeast cells, we show that our model is more accurate than models assuming constant forks’ speed and reconstructs dynamics of DNA replication faithfully starting both from population-wide data and data reflecting fork movement in individual cells. Completion of replication in a timely manner is a challenge due to its stochasticity; we propose an empirically derived modification to replication speed based on the distance to the approaching fork, which promotes timely completion of replication. In summary, our work discovers a key role that stochasticity of the forks’ speed plays in the dynamics of DNA replication. We show that without including stochasticity of forks’ speed it is not possible to accurately reconstruct movement of individual replication forks, measured by DNA combing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/squVhLNYuOQ" width="1" />

<p>by Marina A. Ferreira, Evangeline Despin-Guitard, Fernando Duarte, Pierre Degond, Eric Theveneau</p>

Pseudostratified epithelia (PSE) are a common type of columnar epithelia found in a wealth of embryonic and adult tissues such as ectodermal placodes, the trachea, the ureter, the gut and the neuroepithelium. PSE are characterized by the choreographed displacement of cells’ nuclei along the apicobasal axis according to phases of their cell cycle. Such movements, called interkinetic movements (INM), have been proposed to influence tissue expansion and shape and suggested as culprit in several congenital diseases such as CAKUT (Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract) and esophageal atresia. INM rely on cytoskeleton dynamics just as adhesion, contractility and mitosis do. Therefore, long term impairment of INM without affecting proliferation and adhesion is currently technically unachievable. Here we bypassed this hurdle by generating a 2D agent-based model of a proliferating PSE and compared its output to the growth of the chick neuroepithelium to assess the interplay between INM and these other important cell processes during growth of a PSE. We found that INM directly generates apical expansion and apical nuclear crowding. In addition, our data strongly suggest that apicobasal elongation of cells is not an emerging property of a proliferative PSE but rather requires a specific elongation program. We then discuss how such program might functionally link INM, tissue growth and differentiation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3iGV3Jb0j_A" width="1" />

Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) accounts for up to 2 percent of all brain protein and is essential to memory function. CaMKII activity is known to regulate dynamic shifts in the size and signaling strength of neuronal connections, a process known as synaptic plasticity. Increasingly, computational models are used to explore synaptic plasticity and the mechanisms regulating CaMKII activity. Conventional modeling approaches may exclude biophysical detail due to the impractical number of state combinations that arise when explicitly monitoring the conformational changes, ligand binding, and phosphorylation events that occur on each of the CaMKII holoenzyme’s subunits. To manage the combinatorial explosion without necessitating bias or loss in biological accuracy, we use a specialized syntax in the software MCell to create a rule-based model of a twelve-subunit CaMKII holoenzyme. Here we validate the rule-based model against previous experimental measures of CaMKII activity and investigate molecular mechanisms of CaMKII regulation. Specifically, we explore how Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-binding may both stabilize CaMKII subunit activation and regulate maintenance of CaMKII autophosphorylation. Noting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and protein phosphatases bind CaMKII at nearby or overlapping sites, we compare model scenarios in which Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and protein phosphatase do or do not structurally exclude each other’s binding to CaMKII. Our results suggest a functional mechanism for the so-called “CaM trapping” phenomenon, wherein Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM may structurally exclude phosphatase binding and thereby prolong CaMKII autophosphorylation. We conclude that structural protection of autophosphorylated CaMKII by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM may be an important mechanism for regulation of synaptic plasticity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2FMw7B0eJZk" width="1" />

<p>by Matt Crum, Nikhil Ram-Mohan, Michelle M. Meyer</p>

In comparison to protein coding sequences, the impact of mutation and natural selection on the sequence and function of non-coding (ncRNA) genes is not well understood. Many ncRNA genes are narrowly distributed to only a few organisms, and appear to be rapidly evolving. Compared to protein coding sequences, there are many challenges associated with assessment of ncRNAs that are not well addressed by conventional phylogenetic approaches, including: short sequence length, lack of primary sequence conservation, and the importance of secondary structure for biological function. Riboswitches are structured ncRNAs that directly interact with small molecules to regulate gene expression in bacteria. They typically consist of a ligand-binding domain (aptamer) whose folding changes drive changes in gene expression. The glycine riboswitch is among the most well-studied due to the widespread occurrence of a tandem aptamer arrangement (tandem), wherein two homologous aptamers interact with glycine and each other to regulate gene expression. However, a significant proportion of glycine riboswitches are comprised of single aptamers (singleton). Here we use graph clustering to circumvent the limitations of traditional phylogenetic analysis when studying the relationship between the tandem and singleton glycine aptamers. Graph clustering enables a broader range of pairwise comparison measures to be used to assess aptamer similarity. Using this approach, we show that one aptamer of the tandem glycine riboswitch pair is typically much more highly conserved, and that which aptamer is conserved depends on the regulated gene. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals that singleton aptamers are more similar to either the first or second tandem aptamer, again based on the regulated gene. Taken together, our findings suggest that tandem glycine riboswitches degrade into functional singletons, with the regulated gene(s) dictating which glycine-binding aptamer is conserved.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/feC02vyOjUk" width="1" />

<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a main cause of human infection, can gain resistance to the antibiotic aztreonam through a mutation in NalD, a transcriptional repressor of cellular efflux. Here we combine computational analysis of clinical isolates, transcriptomics, metabolic modeling and experimental validation to find a strong association between NalD mutations and resistance to aztreonam—as well as resistance to other antibiotics—across <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> isolated from different patients. A detailed analysis of one patient’s timeline shows how this mutation can emerge <i>in vivo</i> and drive rapid evolution of resistance while the patient received cancer treatment, a bone marrow transplantation, and antibiotics up to the point of causing the patient’s death. Transcriptomics analysis confirmed the primary mechanism of NalD action—a loss-of-function mutation that caused constitutive overexpression of the MexAB-OprM efflux system—which lead to aztreonam resistance but, surprisingly, had no fitness cost in the absence of the antibiotic. We constrained a genome-scale metabolic model using the transcriptomics data to investigate changes beyond the primary mechanism of resistance, including adaptations in major metabolic pathways and membrane transport concurrent with aztreonam resistance, which may explain the lack of a fitness cost. We propose that metabolic adaptations may allow resistance mutations to endure in the absence of antibiotics and could be targeted by future therapies against antibiotic resistant pathogens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vkkv3kAY_do" width="1" />

Computational approaches have shown promise in contextualizing genes of interest with known molecular interactions. In this work, we evaluate seventeen previously published algorithms based on characteristics of their output and their performance in three tasks: cross validation, prediction of drug targets, and behavior with random input. Our work highlights strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and results in a recommendation of algorithms best suited for performing different tasks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yGWEJBAJU6U" width="1" />

<p>by Camilla Pierella, Maura Casadio, Ferdinando A. Mussa-Ivaldi, Sara A. Solla</p>

A medical student learning to perform a laparoscopic procedure or a recently paralyzed user of a powered wheelchair must learn to operate machinery via interfaces that translate their actions into commands for an external device. Since the user’s actions are selected from a number of alternatives that would result in the same effect in the control space of the external device, learning to use such interfaces involves dealing with redundancy. Subjects need to learn an externally chosen many-to-one map that transforms their actions into device commands. Mathematically, we describe this type of learning as a deterministic dynamical process, whose state is the evolving forward and inverse internal models of the interface. The forward model predicts the outcomes of actions, while the inverse model generates actions designed to attain desired outcomes. Both the mathematical analysis of the proposed model of learning dynamics and the learning performance observed in a group of subjects demonstrate a first-order exponential convergence of the learning process toward a particular state that depends only on the initial state of the inverse and forward models and on the sequence of targets supplied to the users. Noise is not only present but necessary for the convergence of learning through the minimization of the difference between actual and predicted outcomes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K41EADIc6B0" width="1" />

Based on recent findings in the fields of neuroscience, social psychology and cognitive psychology, this model posits the intrinsic costs related to a weakening of the connectivity of neural networks underpinning effortful control as the main cause of mental fatigue in long and high-demanding tasks. In this framework, effort reflects three different inter-related aspects of the same construct. First, effort is a mechanism comprising a limited number of interconnected processing units that integrate information regarding the task constraints and subject’s state. Second, effort is the main output of this mechanism, namely, the effort signal that modulates neuronal activity in brain regions involved in the current task to select pertinent information. Third, effort is a feeling that emerges in awareness during effortful tasks and reflects the costs associated with goal-directed behavior. Finally, the model opens new avenues for research investigating effortful control at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels.</p>

<p>Neuronal firing rate variability prior to movement onset contributes to trial-to-trial variability in primate behavior. However, in humans, whether similar mechanisms contribute to trial-to-trial behavioral variability remains unknown. We investigated the time-course of trial-to-trial variability in corticospinal excitability (CSE) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during a self-paced reach-to-grasp task. We hypothesized that CSE variability will be modulated prior to the initiation of reach and that such a modulation would explain trial-to-trial behavioral variability. Able-bodied individuals were visually cued to plan their grip force before exertion of either 30% or 5% of their maximum pinch force capacity on an object. TMS was delivered at six time points (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 s) following a visual cue that instructed the force level. We first modeled the relation between CSE magnitude and its variability at rest (n = 12) to study the component of CSE variability pertaining to the task but not related to changes in CSE magnitude (n = 12). We found an increase in CSE variability from 1.2 to 1.3 s following the visual cue at 30% but not at 5% of force. This effect was temporally dissociated from the decrease in CSE magnitude that was observed from 0.5 to 0.75 s following the cue. Importantly, the increase in CSE variability explained at least ∼40% of inter-individual differences in trial-to-trial variability in time to peak force rate. These results were found to be repeatable across studies and robust to different analysis methods. Our findings suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying modulation in CSE variability and CSE magnitude are distinct. Notably, the extent of modulation in variability in corticospinal system prior to grasp within individuals may explain their trial-to-trial behavioral variability.</p>

<p>Exposure to opioids reshapes future reward and motivated behaviors partially by altering the functional output of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens shell. Here, we investigated how morphine, a highly addictive opioid, alters synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability on dopamine D1-receptor (D1R) expressing and dopamine D2-receptor (D2R) expressing MSNs, the two main output neurons in the nucleus accumbens shell. Using whole-cell electrophysiology recordings, we show, that 24 h abstinence following repeated non-contingent administration of morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice reduces the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) frequency on D2R-MSNs, with concomitant increases in D2R-MSN intrinsic membrane excitability. We did not observe any changes in synaptic or intrinsic changes on D1R-MSNs. Last, in an attempt to determine the integrated effect of the synaptic and intrinsic alterations on the overall functional output of D2R-MSNs, we measured the input-output efficacy by measuring synaptically-driven action potential firing. We found that both D1R-MSN and D2R-MSN output was unchanged following morphine treatment.</p>

<p>The stria vascularis (SV) generates the endocochlear potential (EP) in the inner ear and is necessary for proper hair cell mechanotransduction and hearing. While channels belonging to SV cell types are known to play crucial roles in EP generation, relatively little is known about gene regulatory networks that underlie the ability of the SV to generate and maintain the EP. Using single cell and single nucleus RNA-sequencing, we identify and validate known and rare cell populations in the SV. Furthermore, we establish a basis for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying SV function by identifying potential gene regulatory networks as well as druggable gene targets. Finally, we associate known deafness genes with adult SV cell types. This work establishes a basis for dissecting the genetic mechanisms underlying the role of the SV in hearing and will serve as a basis for designing therapeutic approaches to hearing loss related to SV dysfunction.</p>

<p>Sickness behavior is a set of behavioral changes induced by infections and mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is characterized by fatigue, decreased appetite and weight loss, changes in sleep patterns, cognitive functions, and lost interest in social activity. It can expedite recovery by conserving energy to mount an immune response involving innate immunity. To provide insights into microglial implication in sickness behavior with special focus on cognitive and social impairment, we investigated changes in their ultrastructure and interactions with synapses using a toxemia mouse model. Adult mice were injected with 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline, and assayed for signs of sickness behavior. LPS treated mice displayed reduced activity in open-field tests 24 h post-injection, while social avoidance and weight gain/loss were not significantly different between treatment groups. Microglia were investigated using electron microscopy to describe changes in their structure and function at nanoscale resolution. Microglial cell bodies and processes were investigated in the hippocampus CA1, a region responsible for learning and memory that is often impacted after peripheral LPS administration. Microglia in LPS treated animals displayed larger cell bodies as well as less complex processes at the time point examined. Strikingly, microglial processes in LPS injected animals were also more likely to contact excitatory synapses and contained more phagocytic material compared with saline injected controls. We have identified at the ultrastructural level significant changes in microglia-synapse interactions shortly after LPS administration, which draws attention to studying the roles of microglia in synaptic rewiring after inflammatory stimuli.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that tool use affects the plasticity of the body schema. In other words, people will perceive the tool as a part of their body, and thus feel like they have “longer limbs” after using tools. However, it is unclear whether tool embodiment could spread to a limb that is not using the tool, and whether other limbs could utilize the proprioception of a limb. In Experiment 1, blindfolded participants were asked to search with a cane (Condition 1) or to walk with a cane (Condition 2). The results in Condition 1 illustrated that the tactile distance perception on the forearm was lengthened after tool use, while other body parts did not significantly change. In Condition 2, the tactile distance perception on the hand and forearm extended significantly after using tools. Additionally, tool-use training even induced an increased perception of the calf that was not using the tool. Possible interference from the difference between walking and standing was excluded in Experiment 2. These results demonstrate that the proprioception information of one limb could be exploited by another limb to extend the body schema even though that limb was not using a tool. It was also observed that the effect of direction was task-dependent in the tactile perception task.</p>

<p>Occupational activity represents a large percentage of people’s daily activity and thus likely is as impactful for people’s general and cognitive health as other lifestyle components such as leisure activity, sleep, diet, and exercise. Different occupations, however, require different skills, abilities, activities, credentials, work styles, etc., constituting a rich multidimensional formative exposure with likely consequences for brain development over the lifespan. In the current study, we were interested in how different occupations with their different attributes relate to five variables: structural brain health, duration of early-life education, gender, IQ, and age, although the main focus was the relationship to brain health. To this end, we used the Occupation Information Network (O<sup>∗</sup>NET), which provides quantification of occupations along 246 items. Occupational patterns with different loadings for these 246 items were derived from 277 community-dwelling adults, ranging in age from 40 to 80, based upon the five subject measures. We found significant patterns underlying four of our variables of interest, with gender and education predictably showing the most numerous and strongest associations, while brain health and intelligence showed weaker associations, and age did not manifest any associations. For the occupational pattern associated with brain health, we found mainly positive associations on items pertaining to rigorous problem-solving, leadership, responsibility, and information processing. We emphasize that the findings are correlational and cannot establish causation. Future extensions of this work will assess the influence of occupation on future cognitive brain status and cognitive performance.</p>

<p>One of the most important and early impairments in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the abnormal visual processing of human faces. This deficit has been associated with hypoactivation of the fusiform face area (FFA), one of the main hubs of the face-processing network. Neurofeedback based on real-time fMRI (rtfMRI-NF) is a technique that allows the self-regulation of circumscribed brain regions, leading to specific neural modulation and behavioral changes. The aim of the present study was to train participants with ASD to achieve up-regulation of the FFA using rtfMRI-NF, to investigate the neural effects of FFA up-regulation in ASD. For this purpose, three groups of volunteers with normal I.Q. and fluent language were recruited to participate in a rtfMRI-NF protocol of eight training runs in 2 days. Five subjects with ASD participated as part of the experimental group and received contingent feedback to up-regulate bilateral FFA. Two control groups, each one with three participants with typical development (TD), underwent the same protocol: one group with contingent feedback and the other with sham feedback. Whole-brain and functional connectivity analysis using each fusiform gyrus as independent seeds were carried out. The results show that individuals with TD and ASD can achieve FFA up-regulation with contingent feedback. RtfMRI-NF in ASD produced more numerous and stronger short-range connections among brain areas of the ventral visual stream and an absence of the long-range connections to insula and inferior frontal gyrus, as observed in TD subjects. Recruitment of inferior frontal gyrus was observed in both groups during FAA up-regulation. However, insula and caudate nucleus were only recruited in subjects with TD. These results could be explained from a neurodevelopment perspective as a lack of the normal specialization of visual processing areas, and a compensatory mechanism to process visual information of faces. RtfMRI-NF emerges as a potential tool to study visual processing network in ASD, and to explore its clinical potential.</p>

<p>The present study aimed to examine neural mechanisms underlying the ability to differentiate reality from fantasy. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we measured prefrontal activations in children and adults while they performed a reality judgment task. Participants’ task was to judge the reality status of events in fantastical and realistic videos. Behavioral data revealed that, although there was no accuracy difference, children showed significantly longer reaction times in making the judgments than did adults. The fNIRS data consistently revealed higher prefrontal activations in children than in adults when watching the videos and judging the reality of the events. These results suggest that when making judgments of event reality, children may require more cognitive resources and also mainly rely on their own personal experiences.</p>

Background<p>Factors of increased prevalence among individuals with Black racial identity (e.g., cardiovascular disease, CVD) may influence the association between exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) from American football and later-life neurological outcomes. Here, we tested the interaction between racial identity and RHI on neurobehavioral outcomes, brain volumetric measures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau<sub>181</sub>), and Aβ<sub>1</sub><sub>–</sub><sub>42</sub> in symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players.</p>Methods<p>68 symptomatic male former NFL players (ages 40–69; n = 27 Black, n = 41 White) underwent neuropsychological testing, structural MRI, and lumbar puncture. FreeSurfer derived estimated intracranial volume (eICV), gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), subcortical GMV, hippocampal volume, and white matter (WM) hypointensities. Multivariate generalized linear models examined the main effects of racial identity and its interaction with a cumulative head impact index (CHII) on all outcomes. Age, years of education, Wide Range Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WRAT-4) scores, CVD risk factors, and APOEε4 were included as covariates; eICV was included for MRI models. P-values were false discovery rate adjusted.</p>Results<p>Compared to White former NFL players, Black participants were 4 years younger (p = 0.04), had lower WRAT-4 scores (mean difference = 8.03, p = 0.002), and a higher BMI (mean difference = 3.09, p = 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (mean difference = 8.15, p = 0.03). With regards to group differences on the basis of racial identity, compared to White former NFL players, Black participants had lower GMV (mean adjusted difference = 45649.00, p = 0.001), lower right hippocampal volume (mean adjusted difference = 271.96, p = 0.02), and higher p-tau<sub>181</sub>/t-tau ratio (mean adjusted difference = −0.25, p = 0.01).

<p>Lexical cohort size is known to play an important role in the magnitude of semantic interference during picture naming in continuous and blocking naming tasks. Nevertheless, whether and how lexical cohort size influences semantic context effects in a picture–word interference (PWI) task remains unclear. To address this issue, participants were required to name pictures, which were paired with both semantically related and unrelated distractors, from both large and small lexical cohorts while electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded. Behavior results showed a semantic interference effect but no interaction between semantic relatedness and lexical cohort size in naming latencies. ERPs and correlation analyses revealed that semantic interference effects occurred at the lexical level in the time windows of 200–400 and 400–600 ms, and lexical cohort size effects occurred at the conceptual level in the time window of 100–200 ms and at the lexical level in the time windows of 200–400 ms. Critically, no interaction between two variables was found, reflecting that lexical cohort size is independent of semantic interference for categorical relations in the PWI. sLORETA results found stronger brain activations for large lexical cohorts at the left superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus in the time interval of 250–300 ms, which may relate to lexical selection and self-monitoring. Our findings provide evidence for the swinging lexical network rather than the response exclusion hypothesis in spoken production.</p>

<p>Limb apraxia is a syndrome often observed after stroke that affects the ability to perform skilled actions despite intact elementary motor and sensory systems. In a large cohort of unselected stroke patients with lesions to the left, right, and bilateral hemispheres, we used voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) on clinical CT head images to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of the impairment of performance in three tasks investigating praxis skills in patient populations. These included a meaningless gesture imitation task, a gesture production task involving pantomiming transitive and intransitive gestures, and a gesture recognition task involving recognition of these same categories of gestures. Neocortical lesions associated with poor performance in these tasks were all in the left hemisphere. They involved the pre-striate and medial temporal cortices, the superior temporal sulcus, inferior parietal area PGi, the superior longitudinal fasciculus underlying the primary motor cortex, and the uncinate fasciculus, subserving connections between temporal and frontal regions. No significant lesions were identified when language deficits, as indicated via a picture naming task, were controlled for. The implication of the superior temporal sulcus and the anatomically connected prestriate and inferior parietal regions challenges traditional models of the disorder. The network identified has been implicated in studies of action observation, which might share cognitive functions sub-serving praxis and language skills.</p>

<p>An important challenge in segmenting real-world biomedical imaging data is the presence of multiple disease processes within individual subjects. Most adults above age 60 exhibit a variable degree of small vessel ischemic disease, as well as chronic infarcts, which will manifest as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on brain MRIs. Subjects diagnosed with gliomas will also typically exhibit some degree of abnormal T2 signal due to WMH, rather than just due to tumor. We sought to develop a fully automated algorithm to distinguish and quantify these distinct disease processes within individual subjects’ brain MRIs. To address this multi-disease problem, we trained a 3D U-Net to distinguish between abnormal signal arising from tumors vs. WMH in the 3D multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI, i.e., native T1-weighted, T1-post-contrast, T2, T2-FLAIR) scans of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 dataset (n<sub>training</sub> = 285, n<sub>validation</sub> = 66). Our trained neuroradiologist manually annotated WMH on the BraTS training subjects, finding that 69% of subjects had WMH. Our 3D U-Net model had a 4-channel 3D input patch (80 × 80 × 80) from mpMRI, four encoding and decoding layers, and an output of either four [background, active tumor (AT), necrotic core (NCR), peritumoral edematous/infiltrated tissue (ED)] or five classes (adding WMH as the fifth class). For both the four- and five-class output models, the median Dice for whole tumor (WT) extent (i.e., union of AT, ED, NCR) was 0.92 in both training and validation sets. Notably, the five-class model achieved significantly (p = 0.002) lower/better Hausdorff distances for WT extent in the training subjects. There was strong positive correlation between manually segmented and predicted volumes for WT (r = 0.96) and WMH (r = 0.89). Larger lesion volumes were positively correlated with higher/better Dice scores for WT (r = 0.33), WMH (r = 0.34), and across all lesions (r = 0.89) on a log(10) transformed scale. While the median Dice for WMH was 0.42 across training subjects with WMH, the median Dice was 0.62 for those with at least 5 cm<sup>3</sup> of WMH. We anticipate the development of computational algorithms that are able to model multiple diseases within a single subject will be a critical step toward translating and integrating artificial intelligence systems into the heterogeneous real-world clinical workflow.</p>

<p>The processing of odor input in the brain begins in the olfactory bulb (OB), where odor information is represented by combinations of active glomeruli. Each glomerulus is associated with a specific odorant receptor type, of which there are ~1,000 in mice; thus different odors activate different subsets of glomeruli. Most receptor types have duplicate lateral and medial glomeruli in each of the left and right OBs. The two sets of glomeruli form separate but mirror-symmetric glomerular maps. It is not known whether the odor representations in these paired maps are exact copies of each other or potentially encode additional information. Previous studies of glomerular odor representations were mostly limited to the lateral map because the medial map is inaccessible with high-resolution activity mapping techniques, such as optical imaging. To address this, we developed a method for optical imaging of the medial bulb by replacing the contralateral bulb with a right-angle prism that has a mirror coating on the hypotenuse. With this method, we performed calcium imaging of corresponding subsets of glomeruli in the lateral map at the dorsal surface and the medial map at the medial wall. Thus, we demonstrate an experimental model system for comparing odor representations in these redundant sensory maps, enabling a better understanding of the role of paired maps and the neuronal coding of odor stimuli.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00567">Treatment With 2-BFI Attenuated Spinal Cord Injury by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and Neuronal Apoptosis via the Nrf2 Signaling Pathway</a></h4>

<p>Previous reports showed that 2-(-2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline (2-BFI) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects on neuroprotection in numerous disorders. However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. The nuclear factor c factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway plays an important and essential role in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses of the cell. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of 2-BFI in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and to determine whether its neuroprotective effects are associated with the activation of Nrf2. To test this hypothesis, we examined the potential roles of 2-BFI in SCI models which were established in rats using a clip-compression injury method. Our results showed that treatment with 2-BFI twice daily improved locomotion recovery from SCI, which increased Nrf2 expression in both neurons and astrocytes, meanwhile, the level of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) also significantly enhanced. In addition, after the treatment with 2-BFI increased levels of superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) indicated the antioxidant effect of the drug. Furthermore, the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax and caspase-3 implied antiapoptotic effects on neuroprotection of 2-BFI, which were verified by the Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining and TUNEL staining. Collectively, these results add to a growing body of evidence supporting that 2-BFI may attenuate SCI mediated by activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00566">Neuroprotective Effect of AM404 Against NMDA-Induced Hippocampal Excitotoxicity</a></h4>

<p>Different studies have demonstrated that inflammation and alterations in glutamate neurotransmission are two events contributing to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative or neurological disorders. There are evidences that N-arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404), a cannabinoid system modulator and paracetamol metabolite, modulates inflammation and exerts neuroprotective effects on Huntington’s (HD) and Parkinson’s diseases (PD), and ischemia. However, the effects of AM404 on the production of inflammatory mediators and excitotoxicity in brain tissue stimulated with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) are not elucidated. In this present study, we investigated the effects of AM404 on the production of inflammatory mediators and neuronal cell death induced by NMDA in organotypic hippocampal slices cultures (OHSC) using qPCR, western blot (WB), and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, to comprehend the mechanism of excitotoxicity, we evaluated the effects of AM404 on glutamate release in hippocampal synaptosomes and the NMDA-induced calcium responses in acute hippocampal slices. Our results showed that AM404 led to a significant decrease in cell death induced by NMDA, through a mechanism possibly involving the reduction of glutamate release and the calcium ions responses. Furthermore, it decreased the expression of the interleukin (IL)-1β. This study provides new significant insights about the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotection effects of AM404 on NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. To understand the effects of AM404 in these processes might contribute to the therapeutic potential of AM404 in diseases with involvement of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and might lead to a possible future treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Multiple pathomechanisms triggered by mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) underlie progressive degeneration of dopaminoceptive striatal neurons in Huntington’s disease (HD). The primary cilium is a membrane compartment that functions as a hub for various pathways that are dysregulated in HD, for example, dopamine (DA) receptor transmission and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The roles of primary cilia (PC) for the maintenance of striatal neurons and in HD progression remain unknown. Here, we investigated PC defects in vulnerable striatal neurons in a progressive model of HD, the mHTT-expressing knock-in zQ175 mice. We found that PC length is affected in striatal but not in cortical neurons, in association with the accumulation of mHTT. To explore the role of PC, we generated conditional mutant mice lacking IFT88, a component of the anterograde intraflagellar transport-B complex lacking PC in dopaminoceptive neurons. This mutation preserved the expression of the dopamine 1 receptor (D1R), and the survival of striatal neurons, but resulted in a mild increase of DA metabolites in the striatum, suggesting an imbalance of ciliary DA receptor transmission. Conditional loss of PC in zQ175 mice did not trigger astrogliosis, however, mTOR signaling was more active and resulted in a more pronounced accumulation of nuclear inclusions containing mHTT. Further studies will be required of aged mice to determine the role of aberrant ciliary function in more advanced stages of HD.</p>

<p>Outer Hair Cells (OHCs) in the mammalian cochlea display a unique type of voltage-induced mechanical movement termed electromotility, which amplifies auditory signals and contributes to the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing. Electromotility occurs in the OHC lateral wall, but it is not fully understood how the supramolecular architecture of the lateral wall enables this unique form of cellular motility. Employing electron tomography of high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted OHCs, we visualized the 3D structure and organization of the membrane and cytoskeletal components of the OHC lateral wall. The subsurface cisterna (SSC) is a highly prominent feature, and we report that the SSC membranes and lumen possess hexagonally ordered arrays of particles. We also find the SSC is tightly connected to adjacent actin filaments by short filamentous protein connections. Pillar proteins that join the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton appear as variable structures considerably thinner than actin filaments and significantly more flexible than actin-SSC links. The structurally rich organization and rigidity of the SSC coupled with apparently weaker mechanical connections between the plasma membrane (PM) and cytoskeleton reveal that the membrane-cytoskeletal architecture of the OHC lateral wall is more complex than previously appreciated. These observations are important for our understanding of OHC mechanics and need to be considered in computational models of OHC electromotility that incorporate subcellular features.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00100">Developmental Changes of Glutamate and GABA Receptor Densities in Wistar Rats</a></h4>

<p>Neurotransmitters and their receptors are key molecules of signal transduction and subject to various changes during pre- and postnatal development. Previous studies addressed ontogeny at the level of neurotransmitters and expression of neurotransmitter receptor subunits. However, developmental changes in receptor densities to this day are not well understood. Here, we analyzed developmental changes in excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in adjacent sections of the rat brain by means of quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Receptor densities of the ionotropic glutamatergic receptors α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) as well as of the ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> and metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were investigated using specific high-affinity ligands. For each receptor binding site, significant density differences were demonstrated in the investigated regions of interest [olfactory bulb, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum] and developmental stages [postnatal day (P) 0, 10, 20, 30 and 90]. In particular, we showed that the glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor densities were already present between P0 and P10 in all regions of interest, which may indicate the early relevance of these receptors for brain development. A transient increase of glutamatergic receptor densities in the hippocampus was found, indicating their possible involvement in synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated a decline of NMDA receptor densities in the striatum and hippocampus from P30 to P90, which could be due to synapse elimination, a process that redefines neuronal networks in postnatal brains. Furthermore, the highest increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor densities from P10 to P20 coincides with the developmental shift from excitatory to inhibitory GABA transmission. Moreover, the increase from P10 to P20 in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor densities in the cerebellum corresponds to a point in time when functional GABAergic synapses are formed. Taken together, the present data reveal differential changes in glutamate and GABA receptor densities during postnatal rat brain development, which may contribute to their specific functions during ontogenesis, thus providing a deeper understanding of brain ontogenesis and receptor function.</p>

<p>Introduction: Hearing and vision loss are highly prevalent in elderly adults, and thus frequently occur in conjunction with cognitive impairments. Studies have shown that hearing impairment is associated with a higher risk of dementia. However, evidence concerning the association between vision loss and dementia, as well as the co-occurrence of vision and hearing loss and dementia, has been inconclusive.</p><p>Objectives: To assess the association between: (i) either hearing or vision loss and the risk of dementia, as well as between; and (ii) the combination of both sensory impairments and the risk of dementia.</p><p>Methods: This case-control study was based on a 5-year data set that included patients aged 65 years and older who had initially been diagnosed with dementia diseases by one of 1,203 general practitioners in Germany between January 2013 and December 2017. In total, 61,354 identified dementia cases were matched to non-dementia controls, resulting in a sample size of 122,708 individuals. Hearing loss and vision loss were identified using the ICD-10 diagnoses documented in the general practitioners’ files prior to the initial dementia diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the associations between visual and/or hearing impairment and the risk of dementia and controlled for sociodemographic and clinical variables.</p><p>Results: Hearing impairment was documented in 11.2% of patients with a dementia diagnosis and 9.5% of patients without such a diagnosis. Some form of vision impairment was documented in 28.4% of patients diagnosed with dementia and 28.8% of controls. Visual impairment was not significantly associated with dementia (OR = 0.97, CI = 95% 0.97–1.02, p = 0.219). However, patients with hearing impairment were at a significantly higher risk of developing dementia (OR = 1.26, CI = 95% 1.15–1.38, p &lt; 0.001), a finding that very likely led to the observed significant association of the combination of both visual and hearing impairments and the risk of dementia (OR = 1.14, CI = 95% 1.04–1.24, p = 0.005).</p><p>Discussion: This analysis adds important evidence that contributes to the limited body of knowledge about the association between hearing and/or vision loss and dementia. It further demonstrates that, of the two, only hearing impairment affects patients’ cognition and thus contributes to dementia risk.</p>

<p>Mitochondria are linked with various radiation responses, including mitophagy, genomic instability, apoptosis, and the bystander effect. Mitochondria play an important role in preserving cellular homeostasis during stress responses, and dysfunction in mitochondrial contributes to aging, carcinogenesis and neurologic diseases. In this study, we have investigated the mitochondrial degeneration and autophagy in the hippocampal region of brains from mice administered with BBT-059, a long-acting interleukin-11 analog, or its formulation buffer 24 h prior to irradiation at different radiation doses collected at 6 and 12 months post-irradiation. The results demonstrated a higher number of degenerating mitochondria in 12 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 6 months and 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 12 months as compared to the age-matched naïve (non-irradiated control animals). Apg5l, Lc3b and Sqstm1 markers were used to analyze the autophagy in the brain, however only the Sqstm1 marker exhibited significantly reduced expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to naïve. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of Bcl2 also demonstrated a decrease in expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to other groups. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that higher doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can cause persistent upregulation of mitochondrial degeneration. Reduced levels of Sqstm1 and Bcl2 can lead to intensive autophagy which can lead to degradation of cellular structure.</p>

<p>by Peter K. Koo, Sean R. Eddy</p>

Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to a variety of computational genomics problems, there remains a large gap in our understanding of how they build representations of regulatory genomic sequences. Here we perform systematic experiments on synthetic sequences to reveal how CNN architecture, specifically convolutional filter size and max-pooling, influences the extent that sequence motif representations are learned by first layer filters. We find that CNNs designed to foster hierarchical representation learning of sequence motifs—assembling partial features into whole features in deeper layers—tend to learn <i>distributed</i> representations, <i>i.e</i>. partial motifs. On the other hand, CNNs that are designed to limit the ability to hierarchically build sequence motif representations in deeper layers tend to learn more interpretable <i>localist</i> representations, <i>i.e</i>. whole motifs. We then validate that this representation learning principle established from synthetic sequences generalizes to <i>in vivo</i> sequences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pJ8CdBCF2Y4" width="1" />

<p>by Carl Bou Mansour, Elijah Koreman, Jan Steckel, Herbert Peremans, Dieter Vanderelst</p>

Most objects and vegetation making up the habitats of echolocating bats return a multitude of overlapping echoes. Recent evidence suggests that the limited temporal and spatial resolution of bio-sonar prevents bats from separately perceiving the objects giving rise to these overlapping echoes. Therefore, bats often operate under conditions where their ability to localize obstacles is severely limited. Nevertheless, bats excel at avoiding complex obstacles. In this paper, we present a robotic model of bat obstacle avoidance using interaural level differences and distance to the nearest obstacle as the minimal set of cues. In contrast to previous robotic models of bats, the current robot does not attempt to localize obstacles. We evaluate two obstacle avoidance strategies. First, the Fixed Head Strategy keeps the acoustic gaze direction aligned with the direction of flight. Second, the Delayed Linear Adaptive Law (DLAL) Strategy uses acoustic gaze scanning, as observed in hunting bats. Acoustic gaze scanning has been suggested to aid the bat in hunting for prey. Here, we evaluate its adaptive value for obstacle avoidance when obstacles can not be localized. The robot’s obstacle avoidance performance is assessed in two environments mimicking (highly cluttered) experimental setups commonly used in behavioral experiments: a rectangular arena containing multiple complex cylindrical reflecting surfaces and a corridor lined with complex reflecting surfaces. The results indicate that distance to the nearest object and interaural level differences allows steering the robot clear of obstacles in environments that return non-localizable echoes. Furthermore, we found that using acoustic gaze scanning reduced performance, suggesting that gaze scanning might not be beneficial under conditions where the animal has limited access to angular information, which is in line with behavioral evidence.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y0nCHqYHbS0" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restless legs syndrome is a frequent neurological disorder with substantial burden on individual well‐being and public health. Genetic risk loci have been identified, but the causatives genes at these loci are largely unknown, so that functional investigation and clinical translation of molecular research data are still inhibited. To identify putatively causative genes, we searched for highly significant mutational burden in candidate genes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 84 candidate genes in 4,649 patients and 4,982 controls by next generation sequencing using molecular inversion probes that targeted mainly coding regions. The burden of low‐frequency and rare variants was assessed, and in addition, an algorithm (binomial performance deviation analysis) was established to estimate independently the sequence variation in the probe binding regions from the variation in sequencing depth.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Highly significant results (considering the number of genes in the genome) of the conventional burden test and the binomial performance deviation analysis overlapped significantly. Fourteen genes were highly significant by one method and confirmed with Bonferroni‐corrected significance by the other to show a differential burden of low‐frequency and rare variants in restless legs syndrome. Nine of them (<i>AAGAB</i>, <i>ATP2C1</i>, <i>CNTN4</i>, <i>COL6A6</i>, <i>CRBN</i>, <i>GLO1</i>, <i>NTNG1</i>, <i>STEAP4</i>, <i>VAV3</i>) resided in the vicinity of known restless legs syndrome loci, whereas 5 (<i>BBS7</i>, <i>CADM1</i>, <i>CREB5</i>, <i>NRG3</i>, <i>SUN1</i>) have not previously been associated with restless legs syndrome. Burden test and binomial performance deviation analysis also converged significantly in fine‐mapping potentially causative domains within these genes.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Differential burden with intragenic low‐frequency variants reveals putatively causative genes in restless legs syndrome. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>The application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) could influence the intrinsic brain activity in the sensorimotor network (SMN). However, how rTMS modulates the topological organization of the SMN remains unclear. In this study, we employed resting-state fMRI to investigate the topological alterations in the functional SMN after application of different frequency rTMS over the left M1. To accomplish this, we collected MRI data from 45 healthy participants who were randomly divided into three groups based on rTMS frequency (HF, high-frequency 3 Hz; LF, low-frequency 1 Hz; and SHAM). Individual large-scale functional SMN was constructed by correlating the mean time series among 29 regions of interest (ROI) in the SMN and was fed into graph-based network analyses at multiple levels of global organization and nodal centrality. Our results showed that compared with the network metrics before rTMS stimulation, the left paracentral lobule (PCL) exhibited reduced nodal degree and betweenness centrality in the LF group after rTMS, while the right supplementary motor area (SMA) exhibited reduced nodal betweenness centrality in the HF group after rTMS. Moreover, rTMS-related alterations in nodal metrics might have been attributable to the changes in connectivity patterns and local activity of the affected nodes. These findings reflected the potential of using rTMS over M1 as an effective intervention to promote motor function rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Tongue exercise programs are used clinically for dysphagia in aged individuals and have been shown to improve lingual strength. However, the neural mechanisms of age-related decline in swallowing function and its association with lingual strength are not well understood. Using an established rat model of aging and tongue exercise, we hypothesized that the motor cortex of aged rats would have a smaller lingual motor map area than young adult rats and would increase in size as a function of tongue exercise. Over 8 weeks, rats either underwent a progressive resistance tongue exercise program (TE), learned the task but did not exercise (trained controls, TC), or were naïve untrained controls (UC). Cortical motor map areas for tongue and jaw were determined using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). Rats in the TE and TC groups had a significantly larger motor cortex region for the tongue than the UC group. Lingual cortical motor area was not correlated with protrusive tongue force gains and did not differ significantly with age. These results suggest that learning a novel tongue force skill was sufficient to induce plasticity of the lingual motor cortex yet increasing tongue strength with progressive resistance exercise did not significantly expand the lingual motor area beyond the gains that occurred through the skilled learning component.</p>

<p>The ability to travel independently is crucial to an individual’s quality of life but compromised by visual impairment. Several navigational aids have been developed for blind people to address this limitation. These devices typically employ auditory instructions to guide users to desired waypoints. Unfortunately, auditory instructions may interfere with users’ awareness of environmental sounds that signal dangers or provide cues for spatial orientation. Accordingly, there is a need to explore the use of non-auditory modalities to convey information for safe and independent travel. Here, we explored the efficacy of a tactile navigational aid that provides turn signals via vibrations on a hip-worn belt. We compared the performance of 12 blind participants as they navigated a series of paths under the direction of the tactile belt or conventional auditory turn commands; furthermore, we assessed the effect of repeated testing, both in the presence and absence of simulated street sounds. A computer-controlled system triggered each turn command, measured participants’ time-to-path-completion, and detected major navigational errors. When participants navigated in a silent environment, they performed somewhat worse with the tactile belt than the auditory device, taking longer to complete each trial and committing more errors. When participants navigated in the presence of simulated street noises, the difference in completion time between auditory and tactile navigation diminished. These results suggest that tactile navigation holds promise as an effective method in everyday environments characterized by ambient noise such as street sounds.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00563">Impaired Expression of Neuregulin 1 and Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor β4 Subunit in Diverticular Disease</a></h4>

<p>Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) regulates the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is suggested to promote the survival and maintenance of the enteric nervous system (ENS), since deficiency of its corresponding receptor complex ErbB2/ErbB3 leads to postnatal colonic aganglionosis. As diverticular disease (DD) is associated with intestinal hypoganglionosis, the NRG1-ErbB2/ErbB3 system and the nAChR were studied in patients with DD and controls. Samples of tunica muscularis of the sigmoid colon from patients with DD (n = 8) and controls (n = 11) were assessed for mRNA expression of NRG1, ErbB2, and ErbB3 and the nAChR subunits α3, α5, α7, β2, and β4. Site-specific gene expression levels of the NRG1-ErbB2/3 system were determined in myenteric ganglia harvested by laser microdissection (LMD). Localization studies were performed by immunohistochemistry for the NRG1-ErbB2/3 system and nAChR subunit β4. Rat enteric nerve cell cultures were stimulated with NRG1 or glial-cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) for 6 days and mRNA expression of the aforementioned nAchR was measured. NRG1, ErbB3, and nAChR subunit β4 expression was significantly down-regulated in both the tunica muscularis and myenteric ganglia of patients with DD compared to controls, whereas mRNA expression of ErbB3 and nAChR subunits β2, α3, α5, and α7 remained unaltered. NRG1, ErbB3, and nAChR subunit β4 immunoreactive signals were reduced in neuronal somata and the neuropil of myenteric ganglia from patients with DD compared to control. nAChR subunit β4 exhibited also weaker immunoreactive signals in the tunica muscularis of patients with DD. NRG1 treatment but not GDNF treatment of enteric nerve cell cultures significantly enhanced mRNA expression of nAchR β4. The down-regulation of NRG1 and ErbB3 in myenteric ganglia of patients with DD supports the hypothesis that intestinal hypoganglionosis observed in DD may be attributed to a lack of neurotrophic factors. Regulation of nAChR subunit β4 by NRG1 and decreased nAChR β4 in patients with DD provide evidence that a lack of NRG1 may affect the composition of enteric neurotransmitter receptor subunits thus contributing to the intestinal motility disorders previously reported in DD.</p>

<p>A variety of anatomical alterations have been reported in the hippocampal formation of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and these alterations have been correlated with cognitive symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Major hallmarks in AD are the presence of paired helical filaments of tau protein (PHF<sub>Tau</sub>) within neurons, also known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and aggregates of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) which form plaques in the extracellular space. Nevertheless, how the density of plaques and NFTs relate to the severity of cell loss and cognitive decline is not yet clear. The aim of the present study was to further examine the possible relationship of both Aβ plaques and NFTs with neuronal loss in several hippocampal fields (DG, CA3, CA1, and subiculum) of 11 demented AD patients. For this purpose, using stereological techniques, we compared neuronal densities (Nissl-stained, and immunoreactive neurons for NeuN) with: (i) numbers of neurons immunostained for two isoforms of PHF<sub>Tau</sub> (PHF<sub>Tau-AT8</sub> and PHF<sub>Tau-pS396</sub>); and (ii) number of Aβ plaques. We found that CA1 showed the highest number of NFTs and Aβ plaques, whereas DG and CA3 displayed the lowest number of these markers. Furthermore, AD patients showed a variable neuronal loss in CA1 due to tangle-related cell death, which seems to correlate with the presence of extracellular tangles.</p>

<p>Microglia and astrocytes can quench metal toxicity to maintain tissue homeostasis, but with age, increasing glial dystrophy alongside metal dyshomeostasis may predispose the aged brain to acquire neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate age-related changes in brain metal deposition along with glial distribution in normal C57Bl/6J mice aged 2-, 6-, 19- and 27-months (n = 4/age). Using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence elemental mapping, we demonstrated age-related increases in iron, copper, and zinc in the basal ganglia (p &lt; 0.05). Qualitative assessments revealed age-associated increases in iron, particularly in the basal ganglia and zinc in the white matter tracts, while copper showed overt enrichment in the choroid plexus/ventricles. Immunohistochemical staining showed augmented numbers of microglia and astrocytes, as a function of aging, in the basal ganglia (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, qualitative analysis of the glial immunostaining at the level of the fimbria and ventral commissure, revealed increments in the number of microglia but decrements in astroglia, in older aged mice. Upon morphological evaluation, aged microglia and astroglia displayed enlarged soma and thickened processes, reminiscent of dystrophy. Since glial cells have major roles in metal metabolism, we performed linear regression analysis and found a positive association between iron (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.57, p = 0.0008), copper (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.43, p = 0.0057), and zinc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, p = 0.0132) with microglia in the basal ganglia. Also, higher levels of iron (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, p = 0.0025) and zinc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.27, p = 0.040) were correlated to higher astroglia numbers. Aging was accompanied by a dissociation between metal and glial levels, as we found through the formulation of metal to glia ratios, with regions of basal ganglia being differentially affected. For example, iron to astroglia ratio showed age-related increases in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, while the ratio was decreased in the striatum. Meanwhile, copper and zinc to astroglia ratios showed a similar regional decline. Our findings suggest that inflammation at the choroid plexus, part of the blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier, prompts accumulation of, particularly, copper and iron in the ventricles, implying a compromised barrier system. Moreover, age-related glial dystrophy/senescence appears to disrupt metal homeostasis, likely due to induced oxidative stress, and hence increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The formation of senile plaques through amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Irrespective of its actual role in the synaptic alterations and cognitive impairment associated with AD, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed to reduce plaque formation. In rodents, daily intake of omega-3 (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) is required for neural development, and there is experimental and epidemiological evidence that their inclusion in the diet has positive effects on several neurodegenerative diseases. Similarly, estradiol appears to reduce senile plaque formation in primary mouse cell cultures, human cortical neurons and mouse AD models, and it prevents Aβ toxicity in neural cell lines. We previously showed that differences in dietary n-6/n-3 LC-PUFAs ratios modify the lipid composition in the cerebral cortex of female mice and the levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain. These effects depended in part on the presence of circulating estradiol. Here we explored whether this potentially synergistic action between diet and ovarian hormones may influence the progression of amyloidosis in an AD mouse model. Our results show that a diet with high n-3 LC-PUFA content, especially DHA (22:6n-3), reduces the hippocampal accumulation of Aβ<sub>1</sub><sub>–</sub><sub>4</sub><sub>0</sub>, but not amyloid Aβ<sub>1</sub><sub>–</sub><sub>42</sub> in female APPswe/PS1 E9A mice, an effect that was counteracted by the loss of the ovaries and that depended on circulating estradiol. In addition, this interaction between dietary lipids and ovarian function also affects the composition of the brain lipidome as well as the expression of certain neuronal signaling and synaptic proteins. These findings provide new insights into how ovarian hormones and dietary composition affect the brain lipidome and amyloid burden. Furthermore, they strongly suggest that when designing dietary or pharmacological strategies to combat human neurodegenerative diseases, hormonal and metabolic status should be specifically taken into consideration as it may affect the therapeutic response.</p>

<p>Object: There is an increasing interest in preoperative diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) to preserve function during surgeries in motor eloquent brain regions. However, DTI tractography is challenged by inherent presumptions during particular tracking steps [e.g., deterministic vs. probabilistic DTI, fractional anisotropy (FA) and fiber length (FL) thresholding] and the missing “ground truth” information. In the present study, we intended to establish an objective, neurophysiology-driven approach for parameter selection during DTI-FT of the corticospinal tract integrating both imaging and neurophysiological information.</p><p>Methods: In ten patients with lesions in eloquent motor areas, preoperative navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) was performed, followed by individual deterministic DTI-FT from a grid of cortical seed points. We investigated over 300 combinations of FA and FL thresholds and applied subsequently a multidimensional mathematical modeling of this empirical data. Optimal DTI parameters were determined by the relationship between DTI-FT (i.e., number of fibers, NoF) and nTMS (i.e., amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials) results. Finally, neurophysiological DTI parameters and the resulting tractography were compared to the current standard approaches of deterministic DTI fiber tracking with a 75% and 50% FA and a FL threshold of 110 mm as well as with intraoperative direct cortical and subcortical stimulation.</p><p>Results: There was a good goodness-of-fit for the mathematical model (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.68 ± 0 13; range: 0.59–0.97; n = 8) except of two cases. Neurophysiology-driven parameter selection showed a high correlation between DTI-FT and nTMS results (r = 0.73 ± 0.16; range: 0.38–0.93). In comparison to the standard approach, the mathematically calculated thresholds resulted in a higher NoF in 75% of patients. In 50% of patients this approach helped to clarify the exact tract location or to detect additional functional tracts, which were not identified by the standard approach. This was confirmed by direct cortical or subcortical stimulation.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study evaluates a novel user-independent method to extract objective DTI-FT parameters that were completely based on neurophysiological data. The findings suggest that this method may improve the specificity and sensitivity of DTI-FT and thereby overcome the disadvantages of current approaches.</p>

<p>Identification of the unique features of human brain development and function can be critical towards the elucidation of intricate processes such as higher cognitive functions and human-specific pathologies like neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders. The developing primate and human central nervous system (CNS) are distinguished by expanded progenitor zones and a protracted time course of neurogenesis, leading to the expansion in brain size, prominent gyral anatomy, distinctive synaptic properties, and complex neural circuits. Comparative genomic studies have revealed that adaptations of brain capacities may be partly explained by human-specific genetic changes that impact the function of proteins associated with neocortical expansion, synaptic function, and language development. However, the formation of complex gene networks may be most relevant for brain evolution. Indeed, recent studies identified distinct human-specific gene expression patterns across developmental time occurring in brain regions linked to cognition. Interestingly, such modules show species-specific divergence and are enriched in genes associated with neuronal development and synapse formation whilst also being implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases. microRNAs represent a powerful component of gene-regulatory networks by promoting spatiotemporal post-transcriptional control of gene expression in the human and primate brain. It has also been suggested that the divergence in miRNA expression plays an important role in shaping gene expression divergence among species. Primate-specific and human-specific miRNAs are principally involved in progenitor proliferation and neurogenic processes but also associate with human cognition, and neurological disorders. Human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells and brain organoids, permitting experimental access to neural cells and differentiation stages that are otherwise difficult or impossible to reach in humans, are an essential means for studying species-specific brain miRNAs. Single-cell sequencing approaches can further decode refined miRNA-mRNA interactions during developmental transitions. Elucidating species-specific miRNA regulation will shed new light into the mechanisms that control spatiotemporal events during human brain development and disease, an important step towards fostering novel, holistic and effective therapeutic approaches for neural disorders. In this review, we discuss species-specific regulation of miRNA function, its contribution to the evolving features of the human brain and in neurological disease, with respect also to future therapeutic approaches.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00557">Kv7.4 Channel Contribute to Projection-Specific Auto-Inhibition of Dopamine Neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area</a></h4>

<p>Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encode behavioral patterns important in reward and drug addiction as well as in emotional disorders. These functions of dopamine neurons are directly related to the release of dopamine in the targeted regions of the brain which are, thus, controlled by the excitability of dopamine neurons. One mechanism for modulation of dopamine neuronal excitability is mediated by the auto dopamine type 2 (D2) receptors, through activation of a Kir3/GIRK K<sup>+</sup> channel which inhibits the firing of dopamine neurons. In this study, we provide evidence that Kv7.4, in addition to Kir3.2 channels, contributes to dopamine (DA)-mediated auto-inhibition of DA activity projecting to NAc and to basolateral amygdale (BLA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that D2 receptors enhance Kv7.4 currents through G<sub>i/o</sub> protein and redox-dependent cellular pathway. Finally, we show this D2 mediated auto-inhibition is blunted in a social defeat mice model of depression, a phenomenon that may contribute to the altered excitability of VTA DA neurons in depressed animals. These results provide a new perspective for understanding the molecular mechanism of the excitability of VTA DA neurons and for potential new strategies against mental disorders involving altered excitability of DA neurons, such as major depression and drug addictions.</p>

<p>Many neurodegenerative diseases induce high levels of sustained cellular stress and alter a number of cellular processes. To examine how different mutations associated with neurodegenerative disease affect cell stress and signaling, we created live-cell assays for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated cell stress and second messenger signaling. We first examined neurodegenerative mutations associated with direct ER stress by exploring the effect of rhodopsin mutations on ER stress and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. The rhodopsin P23H mutation, the most common mutation in autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), produced increased ER stress levels compared to wild type (WT) rhodopsin. Moreover, this increase in cell stress correlated with blunted Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in a stress-dependent manner. Analysis of single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling profiles revealed unique Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling responses exist in cells expressing WT or P23H rhodopsin, consistent with the idea that second messenger signaling is affected by cell stress. To explore the use of the ER-stress biosensor in neurodegenerative diseases that may not have a direct effect on ER-mediated cell stress, we examined how various mutants of α-synuclein and TDP-43 affected ER stress. Mutants of both α-synuclein and TDP-43 associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) demonstrated increased ER stress compared to WT proteins. To examine the effect of α-synuclein and TDP-43 mutants on cellular signaling, we created a second live-cell assay to monitor changes in cAMP signaling during expression of various forms of α-synuclein and TDP-43. The increased cell stress caused by expression of the mutant proteins was accompanied by changes in phosphodiesterase activity. Both HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cells expressing these proteins displayed a shift towards increased cAMP degradation rates, likely due to increased phosphodiesterase activity. Together these data illustrate how biosensors for cellular stress and signaling can provide nuanced, new views of neurodegenerative disease processes.</p>

Many behaviors promote reproduction or food finding. These critical functions of behavior can conflict; successful reproductive strategies can grow populations to the point where food is depleted. In this issue of Neuron, Wu et al. (2019) show how the nematode C. elegans detects crowding to change feeding behavior by coupling pheromone sensing to signaling via insulin-like peptides.

In this issue of Neuron, O’Sullivan et al.

In this issue of Neuron, Fossati et al. (2019) report a new constellation of players regulating inhibitory synaptogenesis. They show that GluD1, through a non-canonical ionotropic-independent mechanism, controls GABAergic synapse formation via trans-synaptic interactions mediated by extracellular cerebellin-4. They identify ARHGEF12 and PPP1R12A as GluD1 intracellular interactors and downstream effectors.

Neuron recently published a study that studied human post-mortem brain samples to determine whether there is an association between herpes virus abundance and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Readhead et al., 2018). We assigned the paper to students in our computational biology course because it employed a variety of statistical analyses, which we thought would provide good practice. As we and the students looked more closely at the paper, however, we noticed that the most significant associations seemed to be between viral abundance and “AD possible” rather than “AD definite” samples (Readhead et al., 2018).

<p>Barring a few studies, there are not enough established treatments to improve upper limb motor function in patients with severe impairments due to chronic stroke. This study aimed to clarify the effect of the kinesthetic perceptional illusion induced by visual stimulation (KINVIS) on upper limb motor function and the relationship between motor function and resting-state brain networks. Eleven patients with severe paralysis of upper limb motor function in the chronic phase (seven men and four women; age: 54.7 ± 10.8 years; 44.0 ± 29.0 months post-stroke) participated in the study. Patients underwent an intervention consisting of therapy using KINVIS and conventional therapeutic exercise (TherEX) for 10 days. Our originally developed KiNvis™ system was applied to induce KINVIS while watching the movement of the artificial hand. Clinical outcomes were examined to evaluate motor functions and resting-state brain functional connectivity (rsFC) by analyzing blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The outcomes of motor function (Fugle-Meyer Assessment, FMA) and spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale, MAS) significantly improved after the intervention. The improvement in MAS scores for the fingers and the wrist flexors reached a minimum of clinically important differences. Before the intervention, strong and significant negative correlations between the motor functions and rsFC of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and premotor cortex (PMd) in the unaffected hemisphere was demonstrated. These strong correlations were disappeared after the intervention. A negative and strong correlation between the motor function and rsFC of the bilateral inferior parietal sulcus (IPS) significantly changed to strong and positive correlation after the intervention. These results may suggest that the combination approach of KINVIS therapy and TherEX improved motor functions and decreased spasticity in the paralyzed upper extremity after stroke in the chronic phase, possibly indicating the contribution of embodied-visual stimulation. The rsFC for the interhemispheric IPS and intrahemispheric IPL and PMd may be a possible regulatory factor for improving motor function and spasticity.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01274117.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00074">Principles of Neurorehabilitation After Stroke Based on Motor Learning and Brain Plasticity Mechanisms</a></h4>

<p>What are the principles underlying effective neurorehabilitation? The aim of neurorehabilitation is to exploit interventions based on human and animal studies about learning and adaptation, as well as to show that the activation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity augments functional recovery after stroke. Instead of teaching compensatory strategies that do not reduce impairment but allow the patient to return home as soon as possible, functional recovery might be more sustainable as it ensures a long-term reduction in impairment and an improvement in quality of life. At the same time, neurorehabilitation permits the scientific community to collect valuable data, which allows inferring about the principles of brain organization. Hence neuroscience sheds light on the mechanisms of learning new functions or relearning lost ones. However, current rehabilitation methods lack the exact operationalization of evidence gained from skill learning literature, leading to an urgent need to bridge motor learning theory and present clinical work in order to identify a set of ingredients and practical applications that could guide future interventions. This work aims to unify the neuroscientific literature relevant to the recovery process and rehabilitation practice in order to provide a synthesis of the principles that constitute an effective neurorehabilitation approach. Previous attempts to achieve this goal either focused on a subset of principles or did not link clinical application to the principles of motor learning and recovery. We identified 15 principles of motor learning based on existing literature: massed practice, spaced practice, dosage, task-specific practice, goal-oriented practice, variable practice, increasing difficulty, multisensory stimulation, rhythmic cueing, explicit feedback/knowledge of results, implicit feedback/knowledge of performance, modulate effector selection, action observation/embodied practice, motor imagery, and social interaction. We comment on trials that successfully implemented these principles and report evidence from experiments with healthy individuals as well as clinical work.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00306">ZPD-2, a Small Compound That Inhibits α-Synuclein Amyloid Aggregation and Its Seeded Polymerization</a></h4>

<p>α-Synuclein (α-Syn) forms toxic intracellular protein inclusions and transmissible amyloid structures in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Preventing α-Syn self-assembly has become one of the most promising approaches in the search for disease-modifying treatments for this neurodegenerative disorder. Here, we describe the capacity of a small molecule (ZPD-2), identified after a high-throughput screening, to inhibit α-Syn aggregation. ZPD-2 inhibits the aggregation of wild-type α-Syn and the A30P and H50Q familial variants in vitro at substoichiometric compound:protein ratios. In addition, the molecule prevents the spreading of α-Syn seeds in protein misfolding cyclic amplification assays. ZPD-2 is active against different α-Syn strains and blocks their seeded polymerization. Treating with ZPD-2 two different PD Caenorhabditis elegans models that express α-Syn either in muscle or in dopaminergic (DA) neurons substantially reduces the number of α-Syn inclusions and decreases synuclein-induced DA neurons degeneration. Overall, ZPD-2 is a hit compound worth to be explored in order to develop lead molecules for therapeutic intervention in PD.</p>

<p>Transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) is a key player in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we have gathered and presented structural information on the different regions of TDP-43 with high resolution structures available. A thorough understanding of TDP-43 structure, effect of modifications, aggregation and sites of localization is necessary as we develop therapeutic strategies targeting TDP-43 for neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss how different domains as well as post-translational modification may influence TDP-43 overall structure, aggregation and droplet formation. The primary aim of the review is to utilize structural insights as we develop an understanding of the deleterious behavior of TDP-43 and highlight locations of established and proposed post-translation modifications. TDP-43 structure and effect on localization is paralleled by many RNA-binding proteins and this review serves as an example of how structure may be modulated by numerous compounding elements.</p>

<p>In the sensory cortex, cross-modal interaction occurs during the early cortical stages of processing; however, its effect on the speed of neuronal activity remains unclear. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate whether tactile stimulation influences auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs). To this end, a 0.5-ms electrical pulse was randomly presented to the dorsum of the left or right hand of 12 healthy volunteers at 700 ms while a train of 25-ms pure tones were applied to the left or right side at 75 dB for 1,200 ms. Peak latencies of 40-Hz ASSR were measured. Our results indicated that tactile stimulation significantly shortened subsequent ASSR latency. This cross-modal effect was observed from approximately 50 ms to 125 ms after the onset of tactile stimulation. The somatosensory information that appeared to converge on the auditory system may have arisen during the early processing stages, with the reduced ASSR latency indicating that a new sensory event from the cross-modal inputs served to increase the speed of ongoing sensory processing. Collectively, our findings indicate that ASSR latency changes are a sensitive index of accelerated processing.</p>

<p>Hypothalamic dysfunction is a key pathological factor in inflammation-associated depression. In the present study, isobaric tags for relative-absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) combined with mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were employed to detect the proteomes and metabolomes in the hypothalamus of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression mouse, respectively. A total of 187 proteins and 27 metabolites were differentially expressed compared with the control group. Following the integration of bi-omics data, pertinent pathways and molecular interaction networks were further identified. The results indicated altered molecules were clustered into Ephrin receptor signaling, glutamatergic transmission, and inflammation-related signaling included the LXR/RXR activation, FXR/RXR activation, and acute phase response signaling. First discovered in the hypothalamus, Ephrin receptor signaling regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-predominant glutamatergic transmission, and further acted on AKT signaling that contributed to changes in hypothalamic neuroplasticity. Ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EPHB2), a transmembrane receptor protein in Ephrin receptor signaling, was significantly elevated and interacted with the accumulated NMDAR subunit GluN2A in the hypothalamus. Additionally, molecules involved in synaptic plasticity regulation, such as hypothalamic postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), p-AKT and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were significantly altered in the LPS-induced depressed group. It might be an underlying pathogenesis that the EPHB2-GluN2A-AKT cascade regulates synaptic plasticity in depression. EPHB2 can be a potential therapeutic target in the correction of glutamatergic transmission dysfunction. In summary, our findings point to the previously undiscovered molecular underpinnings of the pathophysiology in the hypothalamus of inflammation-associated depression and offer potential targets to develop antidepressants.</p>

<p>Neuropathic pain (NP) is an intractable disease accompanying with allodynia, hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain. Accumulating evidence suggested that large volume of neurotransmitters, genes, and signaling pathways were implicated with the initiation and development of NP, while the underlying mechanism still remained poorly understood. Therefore, it was extremely important to further elucidate the potential regulatory networks for developing appropriate treatment options. Here, the RNA-Seq high-throughput sequencing was employed to determine the genes expression change in mice undergoing spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Meanwhile, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by using integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis (iDEP) tools and String database. Then, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to detect the expression of hub gens. The results showed that the DEGs mainly comprised 1712 upregulated and 1515 downregulated genes at 7 days, and consisted of 243 upregulated and 357 downregulated genes at 28 days after surgery, respectively. Additionally, 133 genes and two pathways including retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and cardiac muscle contraction collectively participated in biological reactions of 7th and 28th day after operation. Moreover, the results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of Ccl5, Cacna2d1, Cacna2d2, Cacnb2, Gabrb3, GluA1, and GluA2 were significantly upregulated in SNL-7/28d group than that of in Sham-7/28d group (SNL-7d vs. Sham-7d; SNL-28d vs. Sham-28d; P &lt; 0.05). And the level of Glra2, Glra4, Glra3, Grik1, Grik2, NR1, NR2A, and NR2B was obviously increased in SNL-7d group compared to Sham-7d group (P &lt; 0.05), but which was no statistical difference between SNL-28d group and Sham-28d group. Therefore, these results provided new perspectives and strategies for deeply illuminating the underlying mechanism, and identifying the key elements for treating NP.</p>

<p>Autophagy is a highly conserved process by which long-lived macromolecules, protein aggregates and dysfunctional/damaged organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality control and cell homeostasis in response to energetic needs and environmental challenges. Indeed, activation of autophagy increases the life-span of living organisms, and impairment of autophagy is associated with several human disorders, among which neurodegenerative disorders of aging, such as Parkinson’s disease. These disorders are characterized by the accumulation of aggregates of aberrant or misfolded proteins that are toxic for neurons. Since aging is associated with impaired autophagy, autophagy inducers have been viewed as a strategy to counteract the age-related physiological decline in brain functions and emergence of neurodegenerative disorders. Parkinson’s disease is a hypokinetic, multisystemic disorder characterized by age-related, progressive degeneration of central and peripheral neuronal populations, associated with intraneuronal accumulation of proteinaceous aggregates mainly composed by the presynaptic protein α-synuclein. α-synuclein is a substrate of macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (two major forms of autophagy), thus impairment of its clearance might favor the process of α-synuclein seeding and spreading that trigger and sustain the progression of this disorder. Genetic factors causing Parkinson’s disease have been identified, among which mutations in the LRRK2 gene, which encodes for a multidomain protein encompassing central GTPase and kinase domains, surrounded by protein-protein interaction domains. Six LRRK2 mutations have been pathogenically linked to Parkinson’s disease, the most frequent being the G2019S in the kinase domain. LRRK2-associated Parkinson’s disease is clinically and neuropathologically similar to idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, also showing age-dependency and incomplete penetrance. Several mechanisms have been proposed through which LRRK2 mutations can lead to Parkinson’s disease. The present article will focus on the evidence that LRRK2 and its mutants are associated with autophagy dysregulation. Studies in cell lines and neurons in vitro and in LRRK2 knock-out, knock-in, kinase-dead and transgenic animals in vivo will be reviewed. The role of aging in LRRK2-induced synucleinopathy will be discussed. Possible mechanisms underlying the LRRK2-mediated control over autophagy will be analyzed, and the contribution of autophagy dysregulation to the neurotoxic actions of LRRK2 will be examined.</p>

<p>MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) combined with microbubbles (MBs) is a promising technology that can facilitate drug delivery through a temporarily disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induce the down-regulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression on the blood vessels. Despite the increasing evidence regarding the down-regulation of P-gp expression after MRgFUS BBB disruption (BBBD), its underlying molecular events remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the underlying mechanism of FUS BBBD-mediated P-gp down-regulation. While our results showed down-regulation of P-gp at 24 h post-BBBD in transcriptional and translational levels, restoration to the normal expression appeared at different time points for transcriptional (72 h) and translational (120 h) levels. In addition, the signaling molecule, JNK, was significantly activated in the cerebral blood vessels at 24 h post-BBBD. Although P-gp levels were significantly decreased, the expression levels of proteins involved in the integrity of blood vessels, such as Glut1, ZO-1 and occludin, were not decreased at 24 h post-BBBD. Our study suggests that the JNK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of FUS-induced P-gp expression, without affecting vessel integrity, and a detailed regulatory mechanism can provide the basis for clinical application of FUS to the treatment of neurological disease.</p>

<p>Intracortical electrodes for brain–machine interfaces rely on intimate contact with tissues for recording signals and stimulating neurons. However, the long-term viability of intracortical electrodes in vivo is poor, with a major contributing factor being the development of a glial scar. In vivo approaches for evaluating responses to intracortical devices are resource intensive and complex, making statistically significant, high throughput data difficult to obtain. In vitro models provide an alternative to in vivo studies; however, existing approaches have limitations which restrict the translation of the cellular reactions to the implant scenario. Notably, there is no current robust model that includes astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and neurons, the four principle cell types, critical to the health, function and wound responses of the central nervous system (CNS). In previous research a co-culture of primary mouse mature mixed glial cells and immature neural precursor cells were shown to mimic several key properties of the CNS response to implanted electrode materials. However, the method was not robust and took up to 63 days, significantly affecting reproducibility and widespread use for assessing brain-material interactions. In the current research a new co-culture approach has been developed and evaluated using immunocytochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The resulting method reduced the time in culture significantly and the culture model was shown to have a genetic signature similar to that of healthy adult mouse brain. This new robust CNS culture model has the potential to significantly improve the capacity to translate in vitro data to the in vivo responses.</p>

<p>Numerous observational studies have shown that depressive symptoms are common in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who have a higher rate of progress to dementia. However, it is still uncertain whether there are any differences between MCI patients with and without depression symptom in their brain function activities. Here we have identified the brain function activity differences in two groups of MCI patients (with depression or without depression) using the resting state MRI (rsfMRI) measurements. 76 right-handed MCI subjects have been recruited in this study, including 27 MCI patients with depression symptom (MCID), 49 MCI patients without depression symptom (MCIND). Analyses based on 7 rsfMRI measurements, including four static measurements (ALFF, fALFF, PerAF, and ReHo) and three dynamic measurements (dALFF, dfALFF, and dReHo) have been used to explore the temporal variability of intrinsic brain activity. No significant differences in ALFF and dALFF between the two group were found. In the MCID group, fALFF decreased in temporal gyrus, frontal gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and cerebellum, but increased in cuneus, calcarine, lingual; while PerAF increased in left parahippocampus. The differences of ReHo in the two groups was only found in cerebellum. Compared to MCIND group, dfALFF in MCID decreased in cuneus, occipital gyrus and calcarine, while dReHo in MCID increased in bilateral temporal gyrus, frontal gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and precuneus. Our results may provide a better understanding in the relationship between the depressive symptoms and memory deficits.</p>

<p>As part of a larger study examining relationships between taste properties and swallowing, we assessed the influence of genetic taster status (GTS) on measures of brain activity and swallowing physiology during taste stimulation in healthy men and women. Twenty-one participants underwent videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during trials of high-intensity taste stimuli. The precisely formulated mixtures included sour, sweet-sour, lemon, and orange taste profiles and unflavored controls. Swallowing physiology was characterized via computational analysis of swallowing mechanics plus other kinematic and temporal measures, all extracted from VFSS recordings. Whole-brain analysis of fMRI data assessed blood oxygen responses to neural activity associated with taste stimulation. Swallowing morphometry, kinematics, temporal measures, and neuroimaging analysis revealed differential responses by GTS. Supertasters exhibited increased amplitude of most pharyngeal movements, and decreased activity in the primary somatosensory cortex compared to nontasters and midtasters. These preliminary findings suggest baseline differences in swallowing physiology and the associated neural underpinnings associated with GTS. Given the potential implications for dysphagia risk and recovery patterns, GTS should be included as a relevant variable in future research regarding swallowing function and dysfunction.</p>

<p>Chronic pain is known as a complex disease due to its comorbidities with other symptoms and the lack of effective treatments. As a consequence, chronic pain seems to be under-diagnosed in more than 75% of patients. At the same time, the advance in brain imaging, the popularization of machine learning techniques and the development of new diagnostic tools based on these technologies have shown that these tools could be an option in supporting decision-making of healthcare professionals. In this study, we computed functional brain connectivity using resting-state fMRI data from one hundred and fifty participants to assess the performance of different machine learning models, including deep learning (DL) neural networks in classifying chronic pain patients and pain-free controls. The best result was obtained by training a convolutional neural network fed with data preprocessed using the MSDL probabilistic atlas and using the dynamic time warping (DTW) as connectivity measure. DL models had a better performance compared to other less costly models such as support vector machine (SVM) and RFC, with balanced accuracy ranged from 69 to 86%, while the area under the curve (ROC) ranged from 0.84 to 0.93. Also, DTW overperformed correlation as connectivity measure. These findings support the notion that resting-state fMRI data could be used as a potential biomarker of chronic pain conditions.</p>

<p>Observing others’ gaze is most informative during social encounters between humans: We can learn about potentially salient objects in the shared environment, infer others’ mental states and detect their communicative intentions. We almost automatically follow the gaze of others in order to check the relevance of the target of the other’s attention. This phenomenon called gaze cueing can be conceptualized as a triadic interaction involving a gaze initiator, a gaze follower and a gaze target, i.e., an object or person of interest in the environment. Gaze cueing can occur as “gaze pointing” with a communicative or “social” intention by the initiator, telling the observer that she/he is meant to follow, or as an incidental event, in which the observer follows spontaneously without any intention of the observed person. Here, we investigate which gaze cues let an observer ascribe a social intention to the observed person’s gaze and whether and to which degree previous eye contact in combination with an object fixation contributes to this ascription. We varied the orientation of the starting position of gaze toward the observer and the orientation of the end position of a lateral gaze shift. In two experiments participants had to infer from the gaze behavior either mere approach (“the person looked at me”) vs. a social (“the person wanted to show me something”) or a social vs. a private motivation (“the person was interested in something”). Participants differentially attributed either approach behavior, a social, or a private intention to the agent solely based on the passive observation of the two specific gaze cues of start and end position. While for the attribution of privately motivated behavior, participants relied solely on the end position of the gaze shift, the social interpretation of the observed behavior depended additionally upon initial eye contact. Implications of these results for future social gaze and social cognition research in general are discussed.</p>

<p>The personal importance of religion or spirituality (R/S) has been associated with a lower risk for major depression (MDD), suicidal behavior, reduced cortical thinning and increased posterior EEG alpha, which has also been linked to antidepressant treatment response in MDD. Building on prior event-related potential (ERP) findings using an emotional hemifield paradigm, this study examined whether abnormal early (preconscious) responsivity to negative arousing stimuli, which is indicative of right parietotemporal dysfunction in both MDD patients and individuals at clinical high risk for MDD, is likewise moderated by R/S. We reanalyzed 72-channel ERP data from 127 individuals at high or low family risk for MDD (Kayser et al., 2017, NeuroImage Clin. 14, 692–707) after R/S stratification (low R/S importance, low/high risk, n = 38/61; high R/S importance, n = 15/13). ERPs were transformed to reference-free current source density (CSD) and quantified by temporal principal components analysis (tPCA). This report focused on N2 sink (peak latency 212 ms), the earliest prominent CSD-tPCA component previously found to be sensitive to emotional content. While overall N2 sink reflected activation of occipitotemporal cortex (prestriate/cuneus), as estimated via a distributed inverse solution, affective significance was marked by a relative (i.e., superimposed) positivity. Statistical analyses employed both non-parametric permutation tests and repeated measures ANOVA for mixed factorial designs with unstructured covariance matrix, including sex, age, and clinical covariates. Participants with low R/S importance, independent of risk status, showed greater ERP responsivity to negative than neutral stimuli, particularly over the right hemisphere. In contrast, early emotional ERP responsivity and asymmetry was substantially reduced for high risk individuals with high R/S importance, however, enhanced for low risk individuals with high R/S importance. Hemifield modulations of these effects (i.e., emotional ERP enhancements with left visual field/right hemisphere stimulus presentations) further corroborated these observations. Results suggest down-regulation of a right-lateralized network for salience detection at an early processing stage in high risk and high R/S importance individuals, presumably to prevent overactivation of ventral brain regions further downstream. These findings may point to a neurophysiological mechanism underlying resilience of families at risk for depression with high R/S prioritization.</p>

Background<p>While neonates have no sophisticated language skills, the neural basis for acquiring this function is assumed to already be present at birth. Receptive language is measurable by 6 months of age and meaningful speech production by 10–18 months of age. Fiber tracts supporting language processing include the corpus callosum (CC), which plays a key role in the hemispheric lateralization of language; the left arcuate fasciculus (AF), which is associated with syntactic processing; and the right AF, which plays a role in prosody and semantics. We examined if neonatal maturation of these fiber tracts is associated with receptive language development at 12 months of age.</p>Methods<p>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed in 86 infants at 26.6 ± 12.2 days post-birth. Receptive language was assessed via the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory at 12 months of age. Tract-based fractional anisotropy (FA) was determined using the NA-MIC atlas-based fiber analysis toolkit. Associations between neonatal regional FA, adjusted for gestational age at birth and age at scan, and language development at 12 months of age were tested using ANOVA models.</p>Results<p>After multiple comparisons correction, higher neonatal FA was positively associated with receptive language at 12 months of age within the genu (p &lt; 0.001), rostrum (p &lt; 0.001), and tapetum (p &lt; 0.001) of the CC and the left fronto-parietal AF (p = 0.008). No significant clusters were found in the right AF.</p>Conclusion<p>Microstructural development of the CC and the AF in the newborn is associated with receptive language at 12 months of age, demonstrating that interindividual variation in white matter microstructure is relevant for later language development, and indicating that the neural foundation for language processing is laid well ahead of the majority of language acquisition. This suggests that some origins of impaired language development may lie in the intrauterine and potentially neonatal period of life. Understanding how interindividual differences in neonatal brain maturity relate to the acquisition of function, particularly during early development when the brain is in an unparalleled window of plasticity, is key to identifying opportunities for harnessing neuroplasticity in health and disease.</p>

<p>Moral advice (how to behave in life) is often conveyed by short, simple sentence constructions: “You – should – (plus verb with moral meaning).” Yet how moral prescriptions are processed has never been studied from a neurocognitive perspective. The results of this study suggest that the contingent negative variation (CNV) serves as a neural correlate for moral (and immoral) predictive phrases. In step 1, the original CNV paradigm (S1–S2–motor response) was extended using action-demanding three-word phrases taken from everyday contexts (e.g., “Ready–Set–Go”). In step 2, these commands were replaced by abstract words, each phrase then including a verb of moral or immoral meaning (e.g., “You should hope,” “You should praise,” and “You should lie”). During recording, each phrase type (e.g., moral or immoral) was presented blockwise. The task varied according to block order: Participants (n = 19) had to either listen attentively or respond with a finger tap immediately after the final word of a phrase. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were bandpass filtered (0.1–30 Hz) and analyzed at the onset of the second word, yielding two independent responses: a bilateral CNV and a bilateral motor-related negativity, both decreasing from anterior to posterior. The results show that the CNV is sensitive to phrase constructions of moral resp. immoral valence. Thus, transfer to remote semantic fields seems possible. Importantly, this transfer is combined with a change of time frames, from restricted and highly pragmatic (as in the original paradigm) to indefinite and vague. Thus, a CNV may indicate not only preparation to action but also general guidelines for social life. An N400 occurring as an additional, task-dependent result cannot be sufficiently explained on the basis of the present data.</p>

<p>Brain organoids have become increasingly used systems allowing 3D-modeling of human brain development, evolution, and disease. To be able to make full use of these modeling systems, researchers have developed a growing toolkit of genetic modification techniques. These techniques can be applied to mature brain organoids or to the preceding embryoid bodies (EBs) and founding cells. This review will describe techniques used for transient and stable genetic modification of brain organoids and discuss their current use and respective advantages and disadvantages. Transient approaches include adeno-associated virus (AAV) and electroporation-based techniques, whereas stable genetic modification approaches make use of lentivirus (including viral stamping), transposon and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. Finally, an outlook as to likely future developments and applications regarding genetic modifications of brain organoids will be presented.</p>

<p>Maternal immune activation (MIA) and juvenile social isolation (SI) are two most prevalent and widely accepted environmental insults that could increase the propensity of psychiatric illnesses. Using a two-hit mouse model, we examined the impact of the combination of these two factors on animal behaviors, neuronal excitability and expressions of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that MIA-SI induced a number of schizophrenia-related behavioral deficits. Patch clamp recordings revealed alterations in electrophysiological properties of PFC layer-5 pyramidal cells, including hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP), increased input resistance and enhanced medium after-hyperpolarization (mAHP). MIA-SI also increased the ratio of the maximal slope of somatodendritic potential to the peak slope of action potential upstroke, indicating a change in perisomatic Nav availability. Consistently, MIA-SI significantly increased the expression level of Nav1.2 and SK3 channels that contribute to the somatodendritic potential and the mAHP, respectively. Together, these changes may alter neuronal signaling in the PFC and behavioral states, representing a molecular imprint of environmental insults associated with neuropsychiatric illnesses.</p>

<p>Development of new stroke therapies requires animal models that recapitulate the pathophysiological and functional consequences of ischemic brain damage over time-frames relevant to the therapeutic intervention. This is particularly relevant for the rapidly developing area of stem cell therapies, where functional replacement of circuitry will require maturation of transplanted human cells over months. An additional challenge is the establishment of models of ischemia with stable behavioral phenotypes in chronically immune-suppressed animals to allow for long-term survival of human cell grafts. Here we report that microinjection of endothelin-1 into the sensorimotor cortex of athymic rats results in ischemic damage with a sustained deficit in function of the contralateral forepaw that persists for up to 9 months. The histological post-mortem analysis revealed chronic and diffuse atrophy of the ischemic cortical hemisphere that continued to progress over 9 months. Secondary atrophy remote to the primary site of injury and its relationship with long-term cognitive and functional decline is now recognized in human populations. Thus, focal cortical infarction in athymic rats mirrors important pathophysiological and functional features relevant to human stroke, and will be valuable for assessing efficacy of stem cell based therapies.</p>

<p>Background: Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered to contribute to the development of age-related hearing loss (AHL). The regulation of mitochondrial function requires mitochondrial quality control, which includes mitophagy and dynamics. Dynamin-related Protein 1 (DRP-1) is believed to play a central role in this regulation. However, the underlying mechanism of DRP-1 in AHL remains unclear. Here, we examined whether the decline of DRP-1-dependent mitophagy contributes to the development of AHL.</p><p>Methods: We induced cellular and cochlear senescence using hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and evaluated the level of senescence through senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining. We evaluated mitophagy levels via fluorescence imaging and Western Blotting of LC3II and P62. Mitochondrial function was assessed by ATP assay, mtDNA assay, and JC-1.</p><p>Results: We found that both the expression of DRP-1 and the mitophagy level decreased in senescent cells and aged mice. DRP-1 overexpression in HEI-OC1 cells initiated mitophagy and preserved mitochondrial function when exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, while cells with DRP-1 silencing displayed otherwise. Moreover, inhibition of DRP-1 by Mdivi-1 blocked mitophagy and exacerbated hearing loss in aged C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>Conclusion: These results indicated that DRP-1 initiated mitophagy, eliminated mitochondrial dysfunction, and may protect against oxidative stress-induced senescence. These results provide a potential therapeutic target for AHL.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00547">Store-Operated Calcium Channels Are Involved in Spontaneous Slow Calcium Oscillations in Striatal Neurons</a></h4>

<p>The striatum plays an important role in linking cortical activity to basal ganglia output. Striatal neurons exhibit spontaneous slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations that result from Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induced by the mGluR5-IP3R signaling cascade. The maximum duration of a single oscillatory event is about 300 s. A major question arises as to how such a long-duration Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation is maintained. Store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) are one of the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-permeable ion channels. SOCCs are opened by activating the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (mGluR5-IP3R) signal transduction cascade and are related to the pathophysiology of several neurological disorders. However, the functions of SOCCs in striatal neurons remain unclear. Here, we show that SOCCs exert a functional role in striatal GABAergic neurons. Depletion of calcium stores from the ER induced large, sustained calcium entry that was blocked by SKF96365, an inhibitor of SOCCs. Moreover, the application of SKF96365 greatly reduced the frequency of slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. The present results indicate that SOCCs contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in striatal GABAergic neurons, including medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) and GABAergic interneurons, through elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> due to spontaneous slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations.</p>

<p>Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum receive two excitatory afferents including granule cells-derived parallel fiber (PF) and the climbing fiber. Scaffolding protein Rack1 is highly expressed in the cerebellar PCs. Here, we found delayed formation of specific cerebellar vermis lobule and impaired motor coordination in PC-specific Rack1 conditional knockout mice. Our studies further revealed that Rack1 is essential for PF–PC synapse formation. In addition, Rack1 plays a critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity and long-term depression (LTD) induction of PF–PC synapses without changing the expression of postsynaptic proteins. Together, we have discovered Rack1 as the crucial molecule that controls PF–PC synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Our studies provide a novel molecular insight into the mechanisms underlying the neural development and neuroplasticity in the cerebellum.</p>

<p>In biomedical research, cell analysis is important to assess physiological and pathophysiological information. Virtual microscopy offers the unique possibility to study the compositions of tissues at a cellular scale. However, images acquired at such high spatial resolution are massive, contain complex information, and are therefore difficult to analyze automatically. In this article, we address the problem of individualization of size-varying and touching neurons in optical microscopy two-dimensional (2-D) images. Our approach is based on a series of processing steps that incorporate increasingly more information. (1) After a step of segmentation of neuron class using a Random Forest classifier, a novel min-max filter is used to enhance neurons’ centroids and boundaries, enabling the use of region growing process based on a contour-based model to drive it to neuron boundary and achieve individualization of touching neurons. (2) Taking into account size-varying neurons, an adaptive multiscale procedure aiming at individualizing touching neurons is proposed. This protocol was evaluated in 17 major anatomical regions from three NeuN-stained macaque brain sections presenting diverse and comprehensive neuron densities. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed method provides satisfactory results in most regions (e.g., caudate, cortex, subiculum, and putamen) and outperforms a baseline Watershed algorithm. Neuron counts obtained with our method show high correlation with an adapted stereology technique performed by two experts (respectively, 0.983 and 0.975 for the two experts). Neuron diameters obtained with our method ranged between 2 and 28.6 μm, matching values reported in the literature. Further works will aim to evaluate the impact of staining and interindividual variability on our protocol.</p>

<p>Physical exercise performed regularly is known to improve health and to reduce the risk of age-related diseases. Furthermore, there is some evidence of cognitive improvement in physically active middle-aged and older adults. We hypothesized that long-term physically active middle-aged men may have developed brain resilience that can be detected with the analysis of peripheral blood markers. We aimed to analyze the activation of pathways potentially modulated by physical activity in a cohort of healthy amateur rugby players (n = 24) and control subjects with low physical activity (n = 25) aged 45–65 years. We had previously reported neuropsychological improvement in immediate memory responses in the player group compared to the controls. Here, we tested the expression of selected genes of longevity, inflammation, redox homeostasis, and trophic signaling in whole blood mRNA. Analyses were also performed on blood samples of young (aged 15–25 years) control subjects with low physical activity (n = 21). Physical activity and other lifestyle factors were thoroughly recorded with standardized questionnaires. Interestingly, middle-aged control subjects showed lower levels of expression of SIRT1, SIRT3, CAT, and SOD1 than the young controls, although rugby players maintained the expression levels of these genes at a young-like level. Middle-aged players showed lower levels of IL1B than the non-physically active groups. However, there was a tendency towards a decrease in trophic and transduction factors in middle-aged groups as compared to the young controls. A statistical study of Spearman’s correlations supported a positive effect of sporting activity on memory and executive functions, and on peripheral gene expression of SIRT1, SIRT3 and downstream genes, in the middle-aged rugby players. Our results indicate that the SIRT1-SIRT3 axis, and associated neuroprotective signaling, may contribute to the anti-aging resilience of the brain mediated by physical exercise.</p>

<p>Background: The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) has proposed a biological definition of Alzheimer’s disease (AD): individuals with both abnormal amyloid and tau biomarkers (A+T+) would be defined as AD. It remains unclear why different cognitive status is present in subjects with biological AD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has provided an opportunity to reveal the brain activity patterns in a biologically-defined AD cohort. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate distinct brain activity patterns in subjects with existed AD pathology but in the different cognitive stages.</p><p>Method: We selected individuals with AD pathology (A+T+) and healthy controls (HC, A−T−) based on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. According to the cognitive stage, we divided the A+T+ cohort into three groups: (1) preclinical AD; (2) prodromal AD; and (3) AD with dementia (d-AD). We compared spontaneous brain activity measured by a fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) approach among four groups.</p><p>Results: The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) results showed significant differences in fALFF in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu). Further, compared to HC, we found increased fALFF values in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the preclinical AD stage, whereas prodromal AD patients showed reduced fALFF in the bilateral precuneus, right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. Within the d-AD group, both hyperactivity (right fusiform gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus (PHG)/hippocampus, and inferior temporal gyrus) and hypoactivity (bilateral precuneus, left posterior cingulate cortex, left cuneus and superior occipital gyrus) were detected.</p><p>Conclusion: We found the distinct brain activity patterns in different cognitive stages among the subjects defined as AD biologically. Our findings may be helpful in understanding mechanisms leading to cognitive changes in the AD pathophysiological process.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke is a devastating disease with long-term disability. However, the pathogenesis is unclear and treatments are limited. Meisoindigo, a second-generation derivative of indirubin, has general water solubility and is well-tolerated. Previous studies have shown that meisoindigo reduces inflammation by inhibiting leukocyte chemotaxis and migration. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that meisoindigo was also protective against ischemic stroke, then evaluated its underlying mechanisms. In vivo, adult male C57BL/6J wild-type mice were used to produce a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model. On day three after reperfusion, obvious improvement in neurological scores, infarct volume reduction and cerebral edema amelioration were observed in meisoindigo treatment. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining and western-blot showed that the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and its associated proteins in neurons and microglia was inhibited by meisoindigo. The effects of Meisoindigo on NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation and increased the M2 phenotype of microglia/macrophage through shifting from a M1 phenotype, which was possibly mediated by inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB. Furthermore, we verified the inhibitory effect of meisoindigo on TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, and found that meisoindigo treatment could significantly suppressed the expression of TLR4/NF-κB pathway-associated proteins in a dose-dependent manner, meanwhile, which resulted in downregulation of HMGB1 and IL-1β. Next, we established an in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation/Reperfusion (OGD/R) model in HT-22 and BV2 cells to simulate ischemic conditions. Cytotoxicity assay showed that meisoindigo substantially improved relative cell vitality and in HT-22 and BV2 cells following OGD/R in vitro. After suffering OGD/R, the TLR4/NF-κB pathway was activated, the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated proteins and M1 microglia/macrophage were increased, but meisoindigo could inhibit above changes in both HT-22 and BV2 cells. Additionally, though lipopolysaccharide stimulated the activation of TLR4 signaling in OGD/R models, meisoindigo co-treatment markedly reversed the upregulation of TLR4 and following activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and polarization of M1 microglia/macrophages mediated by TLR4. Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that meisoindigo post-treatment alleviates brain damage induced by ischemic stroke in vivo and in vitro experiments through blocking activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and regulating the polarization of microglia/macrophages via inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.</p>

Background<p>Working memory, a fundamental short-term cognitive process, is known to decline with advanced age even in healthy older adults. Normal age-related declines in working memory can cause loss of independence and decreased quality of life. Cognitive training has shown some potential at enhancing certain cognitive processes, although, enhancements are variable. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, has shown promise at enhancing working memory abilities, and may further the benefits from cognitive training interventions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying tDCS brain-based enhancements remain unknown.</p>Objective/Hypothesis<p>Assess the effects of a 2-week intervention of active-tDCS vs. sham paired with cognitive training on functional connectivity of the working memory network during an N-Back working memory task.</p>Methods<p>Healthy older adults (N = 28; mean age = 74 ± 7.3) completed 10-sessions of cognitive training paired with active or sham-tDCS. Functional connectivity was evaluated at baseline and post-intervention during an N-Back task (2-Back vs. 0-Back).</p>Results<p>Active-tDCS vs. sham demonstrated a significant increase in connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right inferior parietal lobule at post-intervention during 2-Back. Target accuracy on 2-Back was significantly improved for active vs. sham at post-intervention.</p>Conclusion<p>These results suggest pairing tDCS with cognitive training enhances functional connectivity and working memory performance in older adults, and thus may hold promise as a method for remediating age-related cognitive decline. Future studies evaluating optimal dose and long-term effects of tDCS on brain function will help to maximize potential clinical impacts of tDCS paired with cognitive training in older adults.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02137122.</p>

<p>Publication date: June 2020</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 62</p><p>Author(s): Jami L Saloman, Jonathan A Cohen, Daniel H Kaplan</p><div><p>The nervous system is often viewed as an isolated system that integrates information from the environment and host. Recently, there has been a renewed focus exploring the concept that the nervous system also communicates across biological systems. Specifically, several high profile studies have recently highlighted the importance of neuro-immune communication in the context of homeostasis, central nervous system disorders, host defense and injury. Here, we discuss the history of shared mechanisms and interconnectedness of the nervous, immune and epithelial compartments. In light of these overlapping mechanisms, it is perhaps unsurprising that neuro-immune-epithelial signaling plays a key role in regulating diverse biological phenomena. In this review, we explore recent breakthroughs in understanding neuro-immune signaling to highlight the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to biomedical research and the future development of novel therapeutics.</p></div>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25655?af=R">Randomized Placebo‐Controlled Trial of Intravenous Immunoglobulin in Autoimmune LGI1/CASPR2 Epilepsy</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Drug‐resistant seizures are common in patients with leucine‐rich, glioma‐inactivated 1 (LGI1)‐IgG associated and contactin‐associated protein‐like 2 (CASPR2)‐IgG associated encephalitis. We performed the first randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in reducing seizure frequency.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Our enrollment goal was 30 LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG–seropositive adult patients with ≥2 seizures per week. Patients were randomized to receive IVIG (0.5g/kg day 1, 1g/kg day 2, 0.6g/kg weeks 3 and 5) or volume‐matched intravenous normal saline. Following the blinded phase, the nonresponders in the placebo group received IVIG. The primary clinical outcome was 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to 5 weeks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After enrollment of 17 patients (LGI1‐IgG, 14; CASPR2‐IgG, 3) over 34 months, the study was terminated due to slow enrollment. Six of 8 patients in the IVIG group were responders, compared to 2 of 9 in the placebo group (<i>p</i> = 0.044, odds ratio = 10.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.1–98.9). For the LGI1‐IgG seropositive subgroup, 6 of 8 patients in the IVIG group were responders, compared to zero of 6 in the placebo group. Two LGI1‐IgG–seropositive patients receiving IVIG, but none receiving placebo, were seizure‐free at the end of the blinded phase. Four of the 6 patients entering the open‐label IVIG arm reported ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency. There were no correlations with LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG1–4 subclasses.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Superiority of IVIG to placebo reached statistical significance for the primary endpoint for all patients and the subset with LGI1‐IgG. These results have to be interpreted with the caveat that the study did not reach its originally selected sample size. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

The worldwide average human lifespan has increased over the past century. These changing demographics demand a reinvention of experimental approaches to study the brain and aging, with the aim of better matching cognitive healthspan with human lifespan. Past studies of cognitive aging included sample sizes that tended to be underpowered, were not sufficiently representative of national population characteristics, and often lacked longitudinal assessments. As a step to address these shortcomings, we propose a framework that encourages interaction between electronic-based and face-to-face study designs.

<p>Publication date: April 2020</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 61</p><p>Author(s): Joel Simrén, Nicholas J Ashton, Kaj Blennow, Henrik Zetterberg</p><div><p>Over the last twenty years, the characterization of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients has progressed from a description of clinical symptomatology followed by neuropathological findings at autopsy to <em>in vivo</em> pathophysiological signatures using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET). Additionally, CSF biomarkers now reflect synaptic pathology, axonal injury and neuroinflammation. Novel techniques are capable of measuring proteins of pathophysiological importance at femtomolar concentrations in blood (e.g. amyloid, tau species and neurofilaments), which enable screening of large populations in the near future. This will be essential for secondary prevention trials and clinical management. However, common diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease and frontotemporal dementias, are still without reliable diagnostic biomarkers, although emerging techniques show promising pilot results for some of these diseases. This is likely to change in the next few years, which will be crucial to stratify populations enrolling in clinical trials, since pathologies often coexist.</p></div>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Regional variations in oscillatory activity during human sleep remain unknown. Using the unique ability of intracranial electroencephalography to study in situ brain physiology, this study assesses regional variations of electroencephalographic sleep activity and creates the first atlas of human sleep using recordings from the first sleep cycle.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings with channels displaying physiological activity from nonlesional tissue were selected from 91 patients of 3 tertiary epilepsy centers. Sections during non–rapid eye movement sleep (stages N2 and N3) and rapid eye movement sleep (stage R) were selected from the first sleep cycle for oscillatory and nonoscillatory signal analysis. Results of 1,468 channels were grouped into 38 regions covering all cortical areas.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found regional differences in the distribution of sleep transients and spectral content during all sleep stages. There was a caudorostral gradient, with more slow frequencies and fewer spindles in temporoparieto‐occipital than in frontal cortex. Moreover, deep‐seated structures showed spectral peaks differing from the baseline electroencephalogram. The regions with &gt;60% of channels presenting significant rhythmic activity were either mesial or temporal basal structures that contribute minimally to the scalp electroencephalogram. Finally, during deeper sleep stages, electroencephalographic analysis revealed a more homogeneous spatial distribution, with increased coupling between high and low frequencies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides a better understanding of the regional variability of sleep, and establishes a baseline for human sleep in all cortical regions during the first sleep cycle. Furthermore, the open‐access atlas will be a unique resource for research (<a href="https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca</a>).

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether midlife atherosclerosis is associated with different dementia subtypes and related underlying pathologies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants comprised the cardiovascular cohort of the Swedish prospective population‐based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (N = 6,103). Carotid plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured at baseline (1991–1994). Dementia incidence until 2014 was obtained from national registers. Diagnoses were reviewed and validated in medical records. In a cognitively unimpaired subcohort (n = 330), β‐amyloid<sub>42</sub> and tau were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds were estimated on magnetic resonance imaging (2009–2015).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During 20 years of follow‐up, 462 individuals developed dementia (mean age at baseline = 57.5 ± 5.9 years, 58% women). Higher IMT in midlife was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all‐cause dementia (adjusted HR = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03–1.26]) and vascular dementia (adjusted HR = 1.32 [95% CI = 1.10–1.57]) but not Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (adjusted HR = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.77–1.17]). Carotid plaques were associated with vascular dementia when assessed as a 3‐graded score (adjusted HR = 1.90 [95% CI = 1.07–3.38]). In the cognitively unimpaired subcohort (53.8 ± 4.6 years at baseline, 60% women), higher IMT in midlife was associated with development of small vessel disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.47 [95% CI = 1.05–2.06]) but not significantly with abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (adjusted OR = 1.28 [95% CI = 0.87–1.90] for Aβ<sub>42</sub> and 1.35 [95% CI = 0.86–2.13] for Aβ<sub>42</sub>/p‐tau). Carotid plaques revealed no significant association with any of the underlying brain pathologies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings support an association between midlife atherosclerosis and development of vascular dementia and cerebral small vessel disease but not between atherosclerosis and subsequent AD dementia or AD pathology. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:52–62</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To analyze why numerous acute stroke treatments were successful in the laboratory but failed in large clinical trials.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We searched all phase 3 trials of medical treatments for acute ischemic stroke and corresponding early clinical and experimental studies. We compared the overall efficacy and assessed the impact of publication bias and study design on the efficacy. Furthermore, we estimated power and true report probability of experimental studies.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 50 phase 3 trials with 46,008 subjects, 75 early clinical trials with 12,391 subjects, and 209 experimental studies with &gt;7,141 subjects. Three (6%) phase 3, 24 (32%) early clinical, and 143 (69.08%) experimental studies were positive. The mean treatment effect was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.83) in experimental studies, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.71–1.06) in early clinical trials, and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.95–1.06) in phase 3 trials. Funnel plot asymmetry and trim‐and‐fill revealed a clear publication bias in experimental studies and early clinical trials. Study design and adherence to quality criteria had a considerable impact on estimated effect sizes. The mean power of experimental studies was 17%. Assuming a bias of 30% and pre‐study odds of 0.5 to 0.7, this leads to a true report probability of &lt;50%.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pivotal study design differences between experimental studies and clinical trials, including different primary end points and time to treatment, publication bias, neglected quality criteria and low power, contribute to the stepwise efficacy decline of stroke treatments from experimental studies to phase 3 clinical trials. Even under conservative estimates, less than half of published positive experimental stroke studies are truly positive. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:40–51</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine whether genetic variation affecting the expression or function of lipid‐lowering drug targets is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) risk, to evaluate the potential impact of long‐term exposure to corresponding therapeutics.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses using variants in genes that encode the protein targets of several approved lipid‐lowering drug classes: <i>HMGCR</i> (encoding the target for statins), <i>PCSK9</i> (encoding the target for PCSK9 inhibitors, eg, evolocumab and alirocumab), <i>NPC1L1</i> (encoding the target for ezetimibe), and <i>APOB</i> (encoding the target of mipomersen). Variants were weighted by associations with low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) using data from lipid genetics consortia (n up to 295,826). We meta‐analyzed Mendelian randomization estimates for regional variants weighted by LDL‐C on AD risk from 2 large samples (total n = 24,718 cases, 56,685 controls).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Models for <i>HMGCR, APOB</i>, and <i>NPC1L1</i> did not suggest that the use of related lipid‐lowering drug classes would affect AD risk. In contrast, genetically instrumented exposure to PCSK9 inhibitors was predicted to increase AD risk in both of the AD samples (combined odds ratio per standard deviation lower LDL‐C inducible by the drug target = 1.45, 95% confidence interval = 1.23–1.69). This risk increase was opposite to, although more modest than, the degree of protection from coronary artery disease predicted by these same methods for PCSK9 inhibition.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We did not identify genetic support for the repurposing of statins, ezetimibe, or mipomersen for AD prevention. Notwithstanding caveats to this genetic evidence, pharmacovigilance for AD risk among users of PCSK9 inhibitors may be warranted. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:30–39</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is widely established for older generation AEDs, whereas there is limited evidence about newer AEDs. Our aim is to assess the benefit of TDM of newer generation AEDs in epilepsy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing systematic with rescue TDM of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, brivaracetam, zonisamide, or pregabalin. Participants were adults with epilepsy, in whom treatment with newer generation AEDs was initiated or needed adjustment. In the systematic TDM arm, AED plasma levels were available at each appointment, whereas in the rescue TDM arm, levels were known only if a study endpoint was reached (inefficacy or adverse events). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants followed 1 year without reaching one of the predefined endpoints.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 151 participants were enrolled; global retention in the study was similar in both arms (56% overall, 58% in the systematic, and 53% in the rescue TDM arm, <i>p</i> = 0.6, Cox regression). There was no difference in terms of outcome regarding treatment efficacy or tolerability. Partial adherence of clinicians to TDM (adjusting or not AED dosage based on blood levels) did not explain this lack of benefit.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides class A evidence that systematic drug level monitoring of newer generation AEDs does not bring tangible benefits in the management of patients with epilepsy. Poor correlation between clinical effects and drug levels likely accounts for this finding. However, TDM is useful in several situations, such as pregnancy, as well as when there are compliance issues. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:22–29</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Symptomatic head trauma associated with American‐style football (ASF) has been linked to brain pathology, along with physical and mental distress in later life. However, the longer‐term effects of such trauma on objective metrics of cognitive–motor function remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that ASF‐related symptomatic head trauma would predict worse gait performance, particularly during dual task conditions (ie, walking while performing an additional cognitive task), in later life.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sixty‐six retired professional ASF players aged 29 to 75 years completed a health and wellness questionnaire. They also completed a validated smartphone‐based assessment in their own homes, during which gait was monitored while they walked normally and while they performed a verbalized serial‐subtraction cognitive task.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants who reported more symptomatic head trauma, defined as the total number of impacts to the head or neck followed by concussion‐related symptoms, exhibited greater dual task cost (ie, percentage increase) to stride time variability (ie, the coefficient of variation of mean stride time). Those who reported ≥1 hit followed by loss of consciousness, compared to those who did not, also exhibited greater dual task costs to this metric. Relationships between reported trauma and dual task costs were independent of age, body mass index, National Football League career duration, and history of musculoskeletal surgery. Symptomatic head trauma was not correlated with average stride times in either walking condition.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Remote, smartphone‐based assessments of dual task walking may be utilized to capture meaningful data sensitive to the long‐term impact of symptomatic head trauma in former professional ASF players and other contact sport athletes. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:75–83</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly variable. We aim to determine the long‐term clinical outcomes in MS, and to identify early prognostic features of these outcomes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred thirty‐two people presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome were prospectively recruited between 1984 and 1987, and followed up clinically and radiologically 1, 5, 10, 14, 20, and now 30 years later. All available notes and magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed, and MS was defined according to the 2010 McDonald criteria.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Clinical outcome data were obtained in 120 participants at 30 years. Eighty were known to have developed MS by 30 years. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were available in 107 participants, of whom 77 had MS; 32 (42%) remained fully ambulatory (EDSS scores ≤3.5), all of whom had relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 3 (4%) had RRMS and EDSS scores &gt;3.5, 26 (34%) had secondary progressive MS (all had EDSS scores &gt;3.5), and MS contributed to death in 16 (20%). Of those with MS, 11 received disease‐modifying therapy. The strongest early predictors (within 5 years of presentation) of secondary progressive MS at 30 years were presence of baseline infratentorial lesions and deep white matter lesions at 1 year.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thirty years after onset, in a largely untreated cohort, there was a divergence of MS outcomes; some people accrued substantial disability early on, whereas others ran a more favorable long‐term course. These outcomes could, in part, be predicted by radiological findings from within 1 year of first presentation. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:63–74</p>

<p>An understanding of basement membrane (BM) assembly at a molecular level provides a foundation with which to develop repair strategies for diseases with defects of BM structure. As currently understood, laminins become anchored to cell surfaces through receptor-mediated interactions and polymerize. This provisional matrix binds to proteoglycans, nidogens and type IV collagen to form a mature BM. Identification of BM binding domains and their binding targets has enabled investigators to engineer proteins that link BM components to modify and improve their functions. This approach is illustrated by the development of two linker proteins to repair the LAMA2-deficient muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD). Dystrophy-causing mutations of the LAMA2 gene product (Lmα2) disrupt the BM molecular architecture, destabilizing it. In a mild ambulatory type of the dystrophy, α2LN mutations in laminin-211 prevents polymerization. In the more common and severe non-ambulatory type (MDC1A), an absent Lmα2 subunit is replaced by the naturally occurring Lmα4 subunit that is normally largely confined to the microvasculature. The compensatory laminin, however, is a poor substitute because it neither polymerizes nor binds adequately to the anchoring receptor α-dystroglycan. A chimeric laminin-binding protein called αLNNd enables laminins with defective or absent αLN domains to polymerize while another engineered protein, miniagrin (mag), promotes efficient α-dystroglycan receptor-binding in otherwise weakly adhesive laminins. Alone, αLNNd enables Lm211 with a self-assembly defect to polymerize and was used to ameliorate a mouse model of the ambulatory dystrophy. Together, these linker proteins alter Lm411 such that it both polymerizes and binds αDG such that it properly assembles. This combination was used to ameliorate a mouse model of the non-ambulatory dystrophy in which Lm411 replaced Lm211 as seen in the human disease. Collectively, these studies pave the way for the development of somatic gene delivery of repair proteins for treatment of LAMA2-MD. The studies further suggest a more general approach of linker-protein mediated repair in which a variety of existing BM protein domains can be combined together to stabilize BMs in other diseases.</p>

<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in basic research and clinical neuroscience is increasing. AI methods enable the interpretation of large multimodal datasets that can provide unbiased insights into the fundamental principles of brain function, potentially paving the way for earlier and more accurate detection of brain disorders and better informed intervention protocols. Despite AI’s ability to create accurate predictions and classifications, in most cases it lacks the ability to provide a mechanistic understanding of how inputs and outputs relate to each other. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a new set of techniques that attempts to provide such an understanding, here we report on some of these practical approaches. We discuss the potential value of XAI to the field of neurostimulation for both basic scientific inquiry and therapeutic purposes, as well as, outstanding questions and obstacles to the success of the XAI approach.</p>

<p>Transcranial electrical stimulation is an important neuromodulation tool, which has been widely applied in the cognitive sciences and in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases. In this work, a novel non-invasive method of transcranial electrical stimulation with high-resolution transcranial magneto-acoustic stimulation (TMAS) method has been tested experimentally in living mice for the first time. It can achieve spatial resolution of 2 mm in the cortex and even in the deep brain regions. The induced electrical field of TMAS was simulated and measured using a test sample. Then, an animal experimental system was built, and the healthy as well as Parkinson’s disease (PD) mice were simulated by TMAS in vivo. To investigate the effect of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) at the same time as TMAS, a TUS group was added in the experiments and its results compared with those of the TMAS group. The results not only demonstrate the high-resolution ability and safety of TMAS, but also show that both TMAS and TUS improved the synaptic plasticity of the PD mice and might improve the spatial learning and memory ability of the healthy mice and the PD mice, although the improvement performance of the TMAS group was superior to that of the TUS-group. Based on the in vivo TMAS studies, we propose that TMAS functions as a dual-mode stimulation combining the electric field of the magneto-acoustic effect and the mechanical force of TUS. Our results also provide an explanation of the mechanism of TMAS. This research suggests that future use of US stimulation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided studies should involve careful consideration of the induced magneto-acoustic electrical field caused by the static magnetic field of MRI.</p>

<p>The aggregation of the human tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles is directly diagnostic of many neurodegenerative conditions termed tauopathies. The species, factors and events that are responsible for the initiation and propagation of tau aggregation are not clearly established, even in a simplified and artificial in vitro system. This motivates the mechanistic study of in vitro aggregation of recombinant tau from soluble to fibrillar forms, for which polyanionic cofactors are the most commonly used external inducer. In this study, we performed biophysical characterizations to unravel the mechanisms by which cofactors induce fibrillization. We first reinforce the idea that cofactors are the limiting factor to generate ThT-active tau fibrils, and establish that they act as templating reactant that trigger tau conformational rearrangement. We show that heparin has superior potency for recruiting monomeric tau into aggregation-competent species compared to any constituent intermediate or aggregate “seeds.” We show that tau and cofactors form intermediate complexes whose evolution toward ThT-active fibrils is tightly regulated by tau-cofactor interactions. Remarkably, it is possible to find mild cofactors that complex with tau without forming ThT-active species, except when an external catalyst (e.g., a seed) is provided to overcome the energy barrier. In a cellular context, we propose the idea that tau could associate with cofactors to form a metastable complex that remains “inert” and reversible, until encountering a relevant seed that can trigger an irreversible transition to β-sheet containing species.</p>

<p>Extracellular electrophysiology has been widely applied in neural network studies. Local field potentials and single-unit activities can be recorded with high-density electrodes, which facilitate the decoding of neural codes. However, the chronic multi-regional recording is still a challenging task for achieving high placement accuracy and long-term stability. Here, we present a novel electrode design with low-cost 3D-printed parts and custom printed circuits boards. This new design could facilitate precise electrode placement in multiple brain regions simultaneously and reduce the working time for surgical procedures as well. In this paper, the design and fabrication of the 3D printed multi-channel microdrive are explained in detail. We also show the result of high-quality electrophysiological recordings in eight pain-related areas from rats and the electrode placement accuracy. This novel 3D-printed multi-drive system could achieve synchronous electrophysiological recording in multiple brain regions and facilitate future neural network research.</p>

<p>The molecular mechanism underlying Parkinson’s disease (PD), an increasingly common neurodegenerative disease, remains unclear. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays essential roles in gene expression and human diseases. We hypothesize that lncRNAs are involved in neuronal degeneration of PD. Using microarray, we identified 122 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 48 DE mRNAs between the circulating leukocytes from PD patients and healthy controls. There were 714 significant correlations (r ≥ 0.8 or ≤−0.8, p &lt; 0.05) among the DE lncRNAs and mRNAs. Gene function and pathway analysis of the 48 DE mRNAs revealed biological pathways related to PD pathogenesis, including immune response, inflammatory response, MAPK, and Jak-STAT pathway. In a cohort of 72 PD patients and 22 healthy controls, the upregulation of four lncRNAs (AC131056.3-001, HOTAIRM1, lnc-MOK-6:1, and RF01976.1-201) in circulating leukocytes of PD patients were further confirmed. These lncRNAs were also upregulated in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, after inflammatory stimulation. Interestingly, the conditioned culture medium of THP-1 cells or 6-OHDA significantly increased the expression of these lncRNAs in SH-SY5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line expressing dopaminergic markers. Importantly, overexpression of AC131056.3-001 or HOTAIRM1 increased baseline and 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, we identified distinct expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNA in circulating leukocytes between PD patients and healthy controls. Dysregulated lncRNAs such as HOTAIRM1 and AC131056.3-001 may contribute to PD pathogenesis by promoting the apoptosis of dopaminergic neuron.</p>

<p>A unique clinical course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), beginning with memory deficit as the earliest symptom, is well-correlated with a progressive pattern of intracellular aggregates of tau (neurofibrillary tangles), which spread from the medial temporal lobe to other brain areas in a stereotypical manner. Recent findings from basic research using in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that pathological forms of extracellular tau can be taken up by cells and induce intracellular tau aggregates. On the basis of these neuropathological observations and experimental findings, the “tau propagation hypothesis” has been proposed, in which the stereotypical spreading of the tau pathology observed in the brain of AD patients can be explained by the interneuron transfer of the pathological form of tau. The concept of tau propagation remains controversial, and many unsolved questions exist; however, it has been attracting attention as a potential therapeutic target for halting AD progression. This article reviews the recent findings regarding the tau propagation hypothesis, including the basic concept and evidence of interneuron tau transfer, potentials as a diagnostic and therapeutic target, and unsolved questions for a better understanding of tau propagation.</p>

<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most prevalent childhood disorders today, is generally more likely to be diagnosed and treated in boys than in girls. However, gender differences in ADHD are currently poorly understood, partly because previous research included only a limited proportion of girls and relied mainly on subjective measures of ADHD, which are highly vulnerable to reporter’s bias. To further examine gender differences in ADHD and to address some of the shortcomings of previous studies, this study examined gender differences in subjective and objective measures of ADHD among clinic-referred children with ADHD. Participants were 204 children aged 6–17 years-old with ADHD (129 boys, 75 girls). A retrospective analysis was conducted using records of a clinical database. Obtained data included parent and teacher forms of the Conners ADHD rating scales, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher’s Report Form (TRF), and child’s continuous performance test (CPT) scores. Results showed that according to parents’ and teachers’ reports of ADHD-related symptoms (Conners ADHD rating scales), girls had more inattention problems than boys, but no differences were identified in the level of hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms. CPT data, however, revealed higher impulsivity among boys. We did not find gender differences in the level of distractibility during CPT performance. Specifically, the effects of distractors type (visual environmental stimuli, auditory stimuli, or a combination of them) and distractors load (one or two distracting stimuli at a time) on CPT performance did not differ between boys and girls with ADHD. These findings suggest that gender effects on ADHD symptoms may differ between subjective and objective measures.

Purpose<p>Psycholinguistic models traditionally view verbal working memory capacity as independent from linguistic features; connectionist models suggest otherwise. Moreover, lexical processing studies show high frequency words differ in cognitive effort from low frequency words, although these effects during concurrent processing of words in working memory are unknown. This novel study examines potential differences in cognitive effort, as measured by differences in HbO2 and Hb, for high frequency versus low frequency words during a working memory paradigm.</p>Methods<p>A total of 21 neurologically typical participants (age 18–23) completed an auditory, n-back, working memory task comparing performance with high- as compared to low- frequency words. Hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex were recorded with a continuous-wave functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device. Behavioral data (accuracy, reaction time) were recorded using E-prime.</p>Results<p>Differences in word frequency were evident at both behavioral and neurological levels. Participants were more accurate, albeit slower in identifying the target two back in a sequence for low- as compared to high-frequency words. Patterns of hemodynamic changes were also significantly different between HF and LF conditions.</p>Conclusion<p>The results from this study indicate that the behavioral and neurological signatures inherent in holding high- versus low-frequency words in working memory differs significantly. Specifically, the findings from this study indicated that words differing in frequency place different demands on cognitive processing load in memory updating tasks.</p>

<p>Chronic pain disproportionately affects older adults, severely impacting quality of life and independent living, with musculoskeletal pain most prevalent. Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with specific structural alterations in the brain and interindividual variability in brain structure is likely an important contributor to susceptibility for the development of chronic pain. However, understanding of age-related structural changes in the brain and their associations with chronic musculoskeletal pain is currently limited. Oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide present in the periphery and central nervous system, has been implicated in pain attenuation. Variation of the endogenous OT system (e.g., OT receptor genotype, blood, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid OT levels) is associated with morphology in brain regions involved in pain processing and modulation. Intranasal OT administration has been shown to attenuate pain. Yet, studies investigating the efficacy of OT for management of chronic musculoskeletal pain are lacking, including among older individuals who are particularly susceptible to the development of chronic musculoskeletal pain. The goal of this focused narrative review was to synthesize previously parallel lines of work on the relationships between chronic pain, brain morphology, and OT in the context of aging. Based on the existing evidence, we propose that research on the use of intranasal OT administration as an intervention for chronic pain in older adults is needed and constitutes a promising future direction for this field. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research in the emerging field, guided by our proposed Model of Oxytocin’s Anagelsic and Brain Structural Effects in Aging.</p>

Pyroptosis (‘fiery death’) is an inflammatory type of regulated cell death (RCD), which occurs downstream of inflammasome activation. Pyroptosis is mediated directly by the recently identified family of pore-forming proteins known as gasdermins, the best characterized of which is gasdermin D (GSDMD). Recent investigations implicate pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological diseases. In this review, we discuss molecular mechanisms that drive pyroptosis, evidence for pyroptosis within the CNS, and emerging therapeutic strategies for its inhibition in the context of neurological disease.

<p>Age-progressive neurodegenerative pathologies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are distinguished and diagnosed by disease-specific components of intra- or extra-cellular aggregates. Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation promotes protein aggregation, and is involved in the etiology of neurological diseases. We synthesized and tested analogs of the naturally occurring tubulin-binding compound, combretastatin A-4. One such analog, PNR502, markedly reduced the quantity of Alzheimer-associated amyloid aggregates in the BRI-Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> mouse model of AD, while blunting the ability of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to raise levels of amyloid plaque and its protein precursors in a neuronal cell-culture model. In transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) strains that express human Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> in muscle or neurons, PNR502 rescued Aβ-induced disruption of motility (3.8-fold, P &lt; 0.0001) or chemotaxis (1.8-fold, P &lt; 0.05), respectively. Moreover, in C. elegans with neuronal expression of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, a single day of PNR502 exposure reverses the chemotaxis deficit by 54% (P &lt; 0.01), actually exceeding the protection from longer exposure. Moreover, continuous PNR502 treatment extends nematode lifespan 23% (P ≤ 0.001). Given that PNR502 can slow, prevent, or reverse Alzheimer-like protein aggregation in human-cell-culture and animal models, and that its principal predicted and observed binding targets are proteins previously implicated in Alzheimer’s, we propose that PNR502 has therapeutic potential to inhibit cerebral Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> aggregation and prevent or reverse neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a hexacoordinate protein, associated with the transport of oxygen, nitric oxide scavenging, tumor suppression and protection against oxidative stress and inflammation. This protein is expressed in brain areas including the preoptic area (POA) of the anterior hypothalamus, the region responsible for the regulation of body temperature. In this study, we show that Cygb is upregulated in the rat hypothalamus 2.5 h and 5 h after intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We investigated the effect of treatment with Cygb in POA primary cultures stimulated with LPS for 4 h. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured and the results showed that Cygb reduced the concentrations of both cytokines. We further observed a decrease in immunoreactivity of the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), but not NF-IL6 and STAT3, in the nucleus of Cygb-treated POA cells. These findings suggest that Cygb attenuates the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated POA primary cultures via inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, indicating that this protein might play an important role in the control of neuroinflammation and fever.</p>

<p>Inhibitory synapses represent a minority of the total chemical synapses in the mammalian brain, yet proper tuning of inhibition is fundamental to shape neuronal network properties. The neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediates rapid synaptic inhibition by the activation of the type A GABA receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R), a pentameric chloride channel that governs major inhibitory neuronal transduction in the nervous system. Impaired GABA transmission leads to a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy or anxiety. From an evolutionary perspective, GABA<sub>A</sub>R shows remarkable conservations, and are found in all eukaryotic clades and even in bacteria and archaea. Specifically, bona fide GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are found in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Because of the anatomical simplicity of the nervous system and its amenability to genetic manipulations, C. elegans provide a powerful system to investigate the molecular and cellular biology of GABA synapses. In this mini review article, we will introduce the structure of the C. elegans GABAergic system and describe recent advances that have identified novel proteins controlling the localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at synapses. In particular, Ce-Punctin/MADD-4 is an evolutionarily-conserved extracellular matrix protein that behaves as an anterograde synaptic organizer to instruct the excitatory or inhibitory identity of postsynaptic domains.</p>

<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important regulatory control in biological systems. Though the field of lncRNA has been progressing rapidly, a complete understanding of the role of lncRNAs in neuroblastoma pathogenesis is still lacking. To identify the abrogated lncRNAs in primary neuroblastoma and in the metastasized as well as the relapsed form of neuroblastoma, we analyzed an RNA-seq dataset on neuroblastoma that is available online to identify the lncRNAs that could potentially be contributing to the biology of neuroblastoma. The identified lncRNAs were further scrutinized using a publicly available epigenetic dataset of neuroblastoma and a cancer database. After this cross-sectional study, we were able to identify three significant lncRNAs, CASC15, PPP1R26-AS1, and USP3-AS1, which could serve as potential biomarkers in clinical studies of neuroblastoma pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Dysfunction of the endosomal–lysosomal system is a prominent pathogenic factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We and others have extensively characterized the neuronal endosomal pathway pathology that results from either triplication of the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) gene in Down syndrome (DS) or from expression of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), the greatest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. More recently brain exosomes, extracellular vesicles that are generated within and released from endosomal compartments, have been shown to be altered in DS and by APOE4 expression. In this review, we discuss the emerging data arguing for an interdependence between exosome production and endosomal pathway integrity in the brain. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that altered trafficking through the endosomal pathway or compromised cargo turnover within lysosomes can affect the production, secretion, and content of exosomes. Conversely, exosome biogenesis can affect the endosomal–lysosomal system. Indeed, we propose that efficient exosome release helps to modulate flux through the neuronal endosomal pathway by decompressing potential “traffic jams.” Exosome secretion may have the added benefit of unburdening the neuron’s lysosomal system by delivering endosomal–lysosomal material into the extracellular space, where other cell types may contribute to the degradation of neuronal debris. Thus, maintaining robust neuronal exosome production may prevent or mitigate endosomal and lysosomal abnormalities linked to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. While the current evidence suggests that the exosomal system in the brain can be modulated both by membrane lipid composition and the expression of key proteins that contribute to the formation and secretion of exosomes, how exosomal pathway-regulatory elements sense and respond to perturbations in the endosomal pathway is not well understood. Based upon findings from the extensively studied DS and APOE4 models, we propose that enhanced neuronal exosome secretion can be a protective response, reducing pathological disruption of the endosomal–lysosomal system in disease-vulnerable neurons. Developing therapeutic approaches that help to maintain or enhance neuronal exosome biogenesis and release may be beneficial in a range of disorders of the central nervous system.</p>

<p>The use of serious game tools in training of medical professions is steadily growing. However, there is a lack of reliable performance assessment methods to evaluate learner’s outcome. The aim of this study is to determine whether functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used as an additional tool for assessing the learning outcome of virtual reality (VR) based learning modules. The hypothesis is that together with an improvement in learning outcome there would be a decrease in the participants’ cerebral oxygenation levels measured from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region and an increase of participants’ serious gaming results. To test this hypothesis, the subjects were recruited and divided into four groups with different combinations of prior virtual reality experience and prior Basic Life Support (BLS) knowledge levels. A VR based serious gaming module for teaching BLS and 16-Channel fNIRS system were used to collect data from the participants. Results of the participants’ scores acquired from the serious gaming module were compared with fNIRS measures on the initial and final training sessions. Kruskal Wallis test was run to determine any significant statistical difference between the groups and Mann–Whitney U test was utilized to obtain pairwise comparisons. BLS training scores of the participants acquired from VR based serious game’s the learning management system and fNIRS measurements revealed decrease in use of resources from the PFC, but increase in behavioral performance. Importantly, brain-based measures can provide an additional quantitative metric for trainee’s expertise development and can assist the medical simulation instructors.</p>

<p>Identifying brain effective connectivity (EC) networks from neuroimaging data has become an effective tool that can evaluate normal brain functions and the injuries associated with neurodegenerative diseases. So far, there are many methods used to identify EC networks. However, most of the research currently focus on learning EC networks from single modal imaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This paper proposes a new method, called ACOEC-FD, to learn EC networks from fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using ant colony optimization (ACO). First, ACOEC-FD uses DTI data to acquire some positively correlated relations among regions of interest (ROI), and takes them as anatomical constraint information to effectively restrict the search space of candidate arcs in an EC network. ACOEC-FD then achieves multi-modal imaging data integration by incorporating anatomical constraint information into the heuristic function of probabilistic transition rules to effectively encourage ants more likely to search for connections between structurally connected regions. Through simulation studies on generated datasets and real fMRI-DTI datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach results in improved inference results on EC compared to some methods that only used fMRI data.</p>

<p>Auricular vagal nerve stimulation (AVNS) is an evolving neuromodulation technology that has a wide range of therapeutic applications across multiple disciplines of medical science. To date, AVNS results had been interpreted in the context of a monolog concept of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN): that this is the sole network of the mechanism of action and/or structure in the auricular area of the stimulation in the context of activations in the brainstem nuclei, including the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), locus coeruleus (LC), trigeminal brainstem nuclei, and the nucleus cuneatus. This review considers the overlooked aspects of neural networks, connections, hijacking axons from cranial nerves and cervical sympathetic ganglions, the inhomogeneous distribution of perivascular sympathetic nerves, and intrinsic/extrinsic auricular muscles in the auricular zone that can explain the vagal and non-vagal nucleus activations in AVNS. In addition, the unique cortical representation of the human ear and interspecies differences in the auricula are discussed. The detailed auricular anatomy of the AVNS zone explored in the present study references structural and functional neural network information to overcome default designs and misinterpretations of existing research on AVNS to provide a better foundation for future investigations that use this modality.</p>

<p>Children and youths are at a greater risk of concussions than adults, and once injured, take longer to recover. A key feature of concussion is an increase in functional connectivity, yet it remains unclear how changes in functional connectivity relate to the patterns of information flow within resting state networks following concussion and how these relate to brain function. We applied a data-driven measure of directed effective brain connectivity to compare the patterns of information flow in healthy adolescents and adolescents with subacute concussion during the resting state condition. Data from 32 healthy adolescents (mean age =16 years) and 21 concussed adolescents (mean age = 15 years) within 1 week of injury were included in the study. Five minutes of resting state data EEG were collected while participants sat quietly with their eyes closed. We applied the information flow rate to measure the transfer of information between the EEG time series of each individual at different source locations, and therefore between different brain regions. Based on the ensemble means of the magnitude of normalized information flow rate, our analysis shows that the dominant nexus of information flow in healthy adolescents is primarily left lateralized and anterior-centric, characterized by strong bidirectional information exchange between the frontal regions, and between the frontal and the central/temporal regions. In contrast, adolescents with concussion show distinct differences in information flow marked by a more left-right symmetrical, albeit still primarily anterior-centric, pattern of connections, diminished activity along the central-parietal midline axis, and the emergence of inter-hemispheric connections between the left and right frontal and the left and right temporal regions of the brain. We also find that the statistical distribution of the normalized information flow rates in each group (control and concussed) is significantly different. This paper is the first to describe the characteristics of the source space information flow and the effective connectivity patterns between brain regions in healthy adolescents in juxtaposition with the altered spatial pattern of information flow in adolescents with concussion, statistically quantifying the differences in the distribution of the information flow rate between the two populations. We hypothesize that the observed changes in information flow in the concussed group indicate functional reorganization of resting state networks in response to brain injury.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00081">Multivariate Analysis of Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reveals Transcriptomic Classification of de novo Glioblastoma Patients</a></h4>

<p>Glioblastoma, the most frequent primary malignant brain neoplasm, is genetically diverse and classified into four transcriptomic subtypes, i. e., classical, mesenchymal, proneural, and neural. Currently, detection of transcriptomic subtype is based on ex vivo analysis of tissue that does not capture the spatial tumor heterogeneity. In view of accumulative evidence of in vivo imaging signatures summarizing molecular features of cancer, this study seeks robust non-invasive radiographic markers of transcriptomic classification of glioblastoma, based solely on routine clinically-acquired imaging sequences. A pre-operative retrospective cohort of 112 pathology-proven de novo glioblastoma patients, having multi-parametric MRI (T1, T1-Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR), collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were included. Following tumor segmentation into distinct radiographic sub-regions, diverse imaging features were extracted and support vector machines were employed to multivariately integrate these features and derive an imaging signature of transcriptomic subtype. Extracted features included intensity distributions, volume, morphology, statistics, tumors' anatomical location, and texture descriptors for each tumor sub-region. The derived signature was evaluated against the transcriptomic subtype of surgically-resected tissue specimens, using a 5-fold cross-validation method and a receiver-operating-characteristics analysis. The proposed model was 71% accurate in distinguishing among the four transcriptomic subtypes. The accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) for distinguishing each subtype (classical, mesenchymal, proneural, neural) from the rest was equal to 88.4% (71.4/92.3), 75.9% (83.9/72.8), 82.1% (73.1/84.9), and 75.9% (79.4/74.4), respectively. The findings were also replicated in The Cancer Genomic Atlas glioblastoma dataset. The obtained imaging signature for the classical subtype was dominated by associations with features related to edge sharpness, whereas for the mesenchymal subtype had more pronounced presence of higher T2 and T2-FLAIR signal in edema, and higher volume of enhancing tumor and edema. The proneural and neural subtypes were characterized by the lower T1-Gd signal in enhancing tumor and higher T2-FLAIR signal in edema, respectively. Our results indicate that quantitative multivariate analysis of features extracted from clinically-acquired MRI may provide a radiographic biomarker of the transcriptomic profile of glioblastoma. Importantly our findings can be influential in surgical decision-making, treatment planning, and assessment of inoperable tumors.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders, but the nature of the relationship(s) between obesity and mental illness remains highly controversial. Some argue that depression and anxiety lead to increased consumption of “comfort foods,” the intake of which reduces negative affect and promotes obesity. In contrast, others have theorized that negative affect results from chronic excessive consumption of highly palatable foods. The brain serotonin (5-HT) system has long been implicated in both the development and treatment of mental illness. Preclinical studies have shown that low brain 5-HT exacerbates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors induced by stress and blocks reductions in depression-like behavior induced by antidepressants, but the effects of brain 5-HT deficiency on responses to high-fat diet (HFD) have not been explored. The current work used genetically modified mice to evaluate the effects of low 5-HT on behavioral and molecular alterations induced by chronic exposure to HFD. Our results reveal that HFD decreases depression-like behavior and increases some anxiety-like behaviors in wild-type (WT) mice. However, genetic brain 5-HT deficiency blocks HFD-induced reductions in forced swim immobility and prevents HFD-induced increases in hippocampal GSK3β phosphorylation despite having no significant effects on HFD-induced changes in body weight or anxiety-like behavior. Together, our results suggest that brain 5-HT deficiency significantly impacts a subset of behavioral and molecular responses to HFD, a finding that could help explain the complex relationships between obesity and mental illness.</p>

<p>Genetic testing for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is highly challenging because of genetic heterogeneity and overlapping manifestations. Targeted-gene panels (TGPs), coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS), can facilitate the profiling of a large repertoire of ND-related genes. Due to the technical limitations inherent in NGS and TGPs, short tandem repeat (STR) variations are often ignored. However, STR expansions are known to cause such NDs as Huntington’s disease and spinocerebellar ataxias type 3 (SCA3). Here, we studied the clinical utility of a custom-made TGP that targets 199 NDs and 311 ND-associated genes on 118 undiagnosed patients. At least one known or likely pathogenic variation was found in 54 patients; 27 patients demonstrated clinical profiles that matched the variants; and 16 patients whose original diagnosis were refined. A high concordance of variant calling were observed when comparing the results from TGP and whole-exome sequencing of four patients. Our in-house STR detection algorithm has reached a specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.82 in our SCA3 cohort. This study also uncovered a trove of novel and recurrent variants that may enrich the repertoire of ND-related genetic markers. We propose that a combined comprehensive TGPs-bioinformatics pipeline can improve the clinical diagnosis of NDs.</p>

<p>Cellular growth, function, and protection require proper iron management, and ferritin plays a crucial role as the major iron sequestration and storage protein. Ferritin is a 24 subunit spherical shell protein composed of both light (FTL) and heavy chain (FTH1) subunits, possessing complimentary iron-handling functions and forming three-fold and four-fold pores. Iron uptake through the three-fold pores is well-defined, but the unloading process somewhat less and generally focuses on lysosomal ferritin degradation although it may have an additional, energetically efficient pore mechanism. Hereditary Ferritinopathy (HF) or neuroferritinopathy is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the FTL C-terminal sequence, which in turn cause disorder and unraveling at the four-fold pores allowing iron leakage and enhanced formation of toxic, improperly coordinated iron (ICI). Histopathologically, HF is characterized by iron deposition and formation of ferritin inclusion bodies (IBs) as the cells overexpress ferritin in an attempt to address iron accumulation while lacking the ability to clear ferritin and its aggregates. Overexpression and IB formation tax cells materially and energetically, i.e., their synthesis and disposal systems, and may hinder cellular transport and other spatially dependent functions. ICI causes cellular damage to proteins and lipids through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation because of high levels of brain oxygen, reductants and metabolism, taxing cellular repair. Iron can cause protein aggregation both indirectly by ROS-induced protein modification and destabilization, and directly as with mutant ferritin through C-terminal bridging. Iron release and ferritin degradation are also linked to cellular misfunction through ferritinophagy, which can release sufficient iron to initiate the unique programmed cell death process ferroptosis causing ROS formation and lipid peroxidation. But IB buildup suggests suppressed ferritinophagy, with elevated iron from four-fold pore leakage together with ROS damage and stress leading to a long-term ferroptotic-like state in HF. Several of these processes have parallels in cell line and mouse models. This review addresses the roles of ferritin structure and function within the above-mentioned framework, as they relate to HF and associated disorders characterized by abnormal iron accumulation, protein aggregation, oxidative damage, and the resulting contributions to cumulative cellular stress and death.</p>

<p>The Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) of the cerebral cortex is a functionally heterogeneous region that also exhibits substantial anatomical variability across individuals. As a result, the precise functional organization of TPJ remains controversial. One or more regions within TPJ support visual attention processes, but the “attention TPJ” is difficult to functionally observe in individual subjects, and thus is typically identified by averaging across a large group of subjects. However, group-averaging also blurs localization and can obscure functional organization. Here, we develop and test an individual-subject approach to identifying attentional TPJ. This paradigm employs novel oddball images with a strong visual drive to produce robust TPJ responses in individuals. Vivid, novel oddballs drive responses in two TPJ regions bilaterally, a posterior region centered in posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (TPJ<sub>STS</sub>) and an anterior region in ventral Supramarginal Gyrus (TPJ<sub>SMG</sub>). Although an attentional reorienting task fails to drive TPJ activation in individuals, group analysis of the attentional reorienting contrast reveals recruitment of right TPJ<sub>STS</sub>, but not right TPJ<sub>SMG</sub>. Similarly, right TPJ<sub>STS</sub>, as identified in individual subjects by the vivid, novel oddball contrast, is activated by attentional reorienting, but right TPJ<sub>SMG</sub> is not. These findings advance an individual-subject based approach to understanding the functional organization of TPJ.</p>

<p>Data augmentation is a popular technique which helps improve generalization capabilities of deep neural networks, and can be perceived as implicit regularization. It plays a pivotal role in scenarios in which the amount of high-quality ground-truth data is limited, and acquiring new examples is costly and time-consuming. This is a very common problem in medical image analysis, especially tumor delineation. In this paper, we review the current advances in data-augmentation techniques applied to magnetic resonance images of brain tumors. To better understand the practical aspects of such algorithms, we investigate the papers submitted to the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS 2018 edition), as the BraTS dataset became a standard benchmark for validating existent and emerging brain-tumor detection and segmentation techniques. We verify which data augmentation approaches were exploited and what was their impact on the abilities of underlying supervised learners. Finally, we highlight the most promising research directions to follow in order to synthesize high-quality artificial brain-tumor examples which can boost the generalization abilities of deep models.</p>

<p>Post-stroke systemic injections of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) exert neuroprotective effects in rats. In the current study, we aimed to test the efficacy of IGF-1 neuroprotection in aged rats (24–25 months old) and to compare the results with adult rats (6–7 months old). Furthermore, we addressed putative differences in microglial responses to IGF-1 in adult and aged rats. Rats were subjected to ischemic stroke while they were conscious by infusing endothelin-1 (Et-1) through a guide cannula that was implemented in the vicinity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Rats were given subcutaneous injections of IGF-1 (1 mg/kg) at 30 min and 120 min after the insult. Post-stroke IGF-1 treatment reduced the infarct size by 34% and 38% in aged and adult rats, respectively. The IGF-1 treated adult rats also showed significant improvement in sensorimotor function following stroke, while this function was not significantly affected in aged rats. Furthermore, aged rats displayed exaggerated activation of microglia in the ischemic hemisphere. Significant reduction of microglial activation by IGF-1 was only detected at specific regions in the ipsilateral hemisphere of adult rats. We show that IGF-1 reduced infarct size in aged rats with an ischemic stroke. It remains to be established, however, whether the age-related changes in microglial function affect the improvement in behavioral outcomes.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common tauopathy, is an age-dependent, progressive neurodegenerative disease. Epidemiological studies implicate the role of genetic background in the onset and progression of AD. Despite mutations in familial AD, several risk factors have been implicated in sporadic AD, of which the onset is unknown. In AD, there is a sequential and hierarchical spread of tau pathology to other brain areas. Studies have strived to understand the factors that influence this characteristic spread. Using transgenic rat models with different genetic backgrounds, we reported that the genetic background may influence the manifestation of neurofibrillary pathology. In this study we investigated whether genetic background has an influence in the spread of tau pathology, using hippocampal inoculations of insoluble tau from AD brains in rodent models of tauopathy with either a spontaneously hypertensive (SHR72) or Wistar-Kyoto (WKY72) genetic background. We observed that insoluble tau from human AD induced AT8-positive neurofibrillary structures in the hippocampus of both lines. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of neurofibrillary structures, but the extent of spread was prominent in the W72 line. On the other hand, we observed significantly higher levels of AT8-positive structures in the parietal and frontal cortical areas in W72 when compared to SHR72. Interestingly, we also observed that the microglia in these brain areas in W72 were predominantly phagocytic in morphology (62.4% in parietal and 47.3% in frontal), while in SHR72 the microglia were either reactive or ramified (67.2% in parietal and 84.7% in frontal). The microglia in the hippocampus and occipital cortex in both lines were reactive or ramified structures. Factors such as gender or age are not responsible for the differences observed in these animals. Put together, our results, for the first time, show that the immune response modulating genetic variability is one of the factors that influences the propagation of tau neurofibrillary pathology.</p>

<p>Globular glial tauopathies (GGTs) have heterogeneous presentations with little available information regarding typical clinical manifestations. We report on a case of atypical primary progressive aphasia (PPA) due to comorbid GGT and limbic transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy. The initial clinical phenotype was compatible with the nonfluent-agrammatical variant of PPA and early hippocampal amnesia. Progressively, parkinsonism and supranuclear oculomotor impairment occurred, and finally, late mutism with frontal-type dementia, impaired comprehension, and behavioral manifestations developed. The neuropathology was characteristic of GGT type I with vascular changes and comorbid limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). Our findings expand the clinical spectrum of GGTs to include a complex progressive aphasia syndrome. The extraordinary feature, in this case, was the combination of two progressive aphasia subtypes, that is, the early nonfluent-agrammatical variant and the late semantic variant. Our findings also expand the spectrum of neuropathological comorbidities in GGT.</p>

<p>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the most frequent causes of brain injury in the newborn. From a pathophysiological standpoint, a complex process takes place at the cellular and tissue level during the development of newborn brain damage in the absence of oxygen. Initially, the lesion is triggered by a deficit in the supply of oxygen to cells and tissues, causing a primary energy insufficiency. Subsequently, high energy phosphate levels recover transiently (the latent phase) that is followed by a secondary phase, in which many of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of neonatal brain damage ensue (i.e., excitotoxicity, massive influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, oxidative and nitrosative stress, inflammation). This leads to cell death by necrosis or apoptosis. Eventually, a tertiary phase occurs, characterized by the persistence of brain damage for months and even years after the HI insult. Hypothermia is the only therapeutic strategy against HIE that has been incorporated into neonatal intensive care units with limited success. Thus, there is an urgent need for agents with the capacity to curtail acute and chronic damage in HIE. Melatonin, a molecule of unusual phylogenetic conservation present in all known aerobic organisms, has a potential role as a neuroprotective agent both acutely and chronically in HIE. Melatonin displays a remarkable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and is capable to cross the blood-brain barrier readily. Moreover, in many animal models of brain degeneration, melatonin was effective to impair chronic mechanisms of neuronal death. In animal models, and in a limited number of clinical studies, melatonin increased the level of protection developed by hypothermia in newborn asphyxia. This review article summarizes briefly the available therapeutic strategies in HIE and assesses the role of melatonin as a potentially relevant therapeutic tool to cover the hypoxia-ischemia phase and the secondary and tertiary phases following a hypoxic-ischemic insult.</p>

<p>While it is proposed that interaction between Schwann cells and axons is key for successful nerve regeneration, the behavior of Schwann cells migrating into a nerve gap following a transection injury and how migrating Schwann cells interact with regenerating axons within the nerve bridge has not been studied in detail. In this study, we combine the use of our whole-mount sciatic nerve staining with the use of a proteolipid protein-green fluorescent protein (PLP-GFP) mouse model to mark Schwann cells and have examined the behavior of migrating Schwann cells and regenerating axons in the sciatic nerve gap following a nerve transection injury. We show here that Schwann cell migration from both nerve stumps starts later than the regrowth of axons from the proximal nerve stump. The first migrating Schwann cells are only observed 4 days following mouse sciatic nerve transection injury. Schwann cells migrating from the proximal nerve stump overtake regenerating axons on day 5 and form Schwann cell cords within the nerve bridge by 7 days post-transection injury. Regenerating axons begin to attach to migrating Schwann cells on day 6 and then follow their trajectory navigating across the nerve gap. We also observe that Schwann cell cords in the nerve bridge are not wide enough to guide all the regenerating axons across the nerve bridge, resulting in regenerating axons growing along the outside of both proximal and distal nerve stumps. From this analysis, we demonstrate that Schwann cells play a crucial role in controlling the directionality and speed of axon regeneration across the nerve gap. We also demonstrate that the use of the PLP-GFP mouse model labeling Schwann cells together with the whole sciatic nerve axon staining technique is a useful research model to study the process of peripheral nerve regeneration.</p>

<p>An important issue in contemporary neuroscience is to identify functional principles at play within neural circuits. The reciprocity of the connections between two distinct brain areas appears as an intriguing feature of some of these circuits. This organization has been viewed as “re-entry,” a process whereby two or more brain regions concurrently stimulate and are stimulated by each other, thus supporting the synchronization of neural firing required for rapid neural integration. However, until relatively recently, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive functional assessment of such reciprocal pathways. In this Brief Research Report, we highlight the use of a chemogenetic strategy to target projection-defined neurons in reciprocally connected areas through CAV-2 mediated interventions in the rat. Specifically, we targeted the bidirectional pathways between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the mediodorsal thalamus, as well as those connecting the insular cortex (IC) and the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). These data showcase the usefulness of CAV-2-related strategies to address circuit-level issues. Moreover, we illustrate the inherent limitation of Cre-dependent adeno-associated virues (AAVs) with “leaked” expression of the gene of interest in the absence of Cre and highlight the need for appropriate control conditions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01321">Analyzing Neuroimaging Data Through Recurrent Deep Learning Models</a></h4>

<p>The application of deep learning (DL) models to neuroimaging data poses several challenges, due to the high dimensionality, low sample size, and complex temporo-spatial dependency structure of these data. Even further, DL models often act as black boxes, impeding insight into the association of cognitive state and brain activity. To approach these challenges, we introduce the DeepLight framework, which utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based DL models to analyze whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. To decode a cognitive state (e.g., seeing the image of a house), DeepLight separates an fMRI volume into a sequence of axial brain slices, which is then sequentially processed by an LSTM. To maintain interpretability, DeepLight adapts the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique. Thereby, decomposing its decoding decision into the contributions of the single input voxels to this decision. Importantly, the decomposition is performed on the level of single fMRI volumes, enabling DeepLight to study the associations between cognitive state and brain activity on several levels of data granularity, from the level of the group down to the level of single time points. To demonstrate the versatility of DeepLight, we apply it to a large fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project. We show that DeepLight outperforms conventional approaches of uni- and multivariate fMRI analysis in decoding the cognitive states and in identifying the physiologically appropriate brain regions associated with these states. We further demonstrate DeepLight's ability to study the fine-grained temporo-spatial variability of brain activity over sequences of single fMRI samples.</p>

Objective<p>To investigate the effect of sudden deprivation of sensory inputs from the periodontium on jaw kinematics and time-varying activation profile of the masseter muscle.</p>Methods<p>Fourteen (age range: 22–26 years; four men) healthy and natural dentate volunteers participated in a single experimental session.

However, there was a significant increase in the jaw opening velocity (P = 0.030) and a significant increase in the duration of occlusal phase (P = 0.004) during the anesthetized condition. The EMG activity of the jaw closing phase was significantly higher during the control condition [116.5 arbitrary units (AU)] than anesthetized condition (93.9 AU). The temporal profile of the masseter muscle showed a biphasic increase in the excitatory muscle drive in the control condition but this increase was virtually absent during the anesthetized condition.</p>Conclusion<p>Sudden deprivation of sensory inputs from the periodontium affects the jaw kinematics and jaw muscle activity, with a clear difference in the time-varying activation profile of the masseter muscle. The activation profile of the masseter muscle shows that periodontal mechanoreceptors contribute to approximately 20% of the EMG activity during the jaw closing phase.</p>

<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and hereditary ataxia (HA) are two groups of disorders characterized, respectively, by progressive dysfunction or degeneration of the pyramidal tracts (HSP) and of the Purkinje cells and spinocerebellar tracts (HA). Although HSP and HA are generally shown to have distinct clinical-genetic profiles, in several cases the clinical presentation, the causative genes, and the cellular pathways and mechanisms involved overlap between the two forms. Genetic analyses in humans in combination with in vitro and in vivo studies using model systems have greatly expanded our knowledge of spinocerebellar degenerative disorders. In this review, we focus on the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a vertebrate model widely used in biomedical research since its overall nervous system organization is similar to that of humans. A critical analysis of the literature suggests that zebrafish could serve as a powerful experimental tool for molecular and genetic dissection of both HA and HSP. The zebrafish, found to be very useful for demonstrating the causal relationship between defect and mutation, also offers a useful platform to exploit for the development of therapies.</p>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI), one of the most severe types of neurological damage, results in persistent motor and sensory dysfunction and involves complex gene alterations. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently discovered class of regulatory molecules, and their roles in SCI still need to be addressed. This study comprehensively investigated circRNA alterations in rats across a set time course (days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) after hemisection SCI at the right T9 site. A total of 360 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified using RNA sequencing. From these, the functions of the exonic circRNA_01477 were further explored in cultured spinal cord astrocytes. Knockdown of circRNA_01477 significantly inhibited astrocyte proliferation and migration. The circRNA_01477/microRNAs (miRNA)/messenger RNA (mRNA) interaction network was visualized following microarray assay. Among the downregulated differentially expressed mRNAs, four of the seven validated genes were controlled by miRNA-423-5p. We then demonstrated that miRNA-423-5p is significantly upregulated after circRNA_01477 depletion. In summary, this study provides, for the first time, a systematic evaluation of circRNA alterations following SCI and an insight into the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved. It further reveals that circRNA_01477/miR-423-5p could be a key regulator involved in regulating the changeable regeneration environment that occurs during recovery from SCI.</p>

<p>Epidemiological studies show increasing prevalence rates of cognitive decline and hearing loss with age, particularly after the age of 65 years. These conditions are reported to be associated, although conclusive evidence of causality and implications is lacking. Nevertheless, audiological and cognitive assessment among elderly people is a key target for comprehensive and multidisciplinary evaluation of the subject’s frailty status. To evaluate the use of tools for identifying older adults at risk of hearing loss and cognitive decline and to compare skills and abilities in terms of hearing and cognitive performances between older adults and young subjects, we performed a prospective cross-sectional study using supraliminal auditory tests. The relationship between cognitive assessment results and audiometric results was investigated, and reference ranges for different ages or stages of disease were determined. Patients older than 65 years with different degrees of hearing function were enrolled. Each subject underwent an extensive audiological assessment, including tonal and speech audiometry, Italian Matrix Sentence Test, and speech audiometry with logatomes in quiet. Cognitive function was screened and then verified by experienced clinicians using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and further investigations in some. One hundred twenty-three subjects were finally enrolled during 2016–2019: 103 were &gt;65 years of age and 20 were younger participants (as controls). Cognitive functions showed a correlation with the audiological results in post-lingual hearing-impaired patients, in particular in those affected by slight to moderate hearing loss and aged more than 70 years. Audiological testing can thus be useful in clinical assessment and identification of patients at risk of cognitive impairment. The study was limited by its sample size (CI 95%; CL 10%), strict dependence on language, and hearing threshold. Further investigations should be conducted to confirm the reported results and to verify similar screening models.</p>

<p>The rate of disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is highly variable, even between patients with the same genetic mutations. Metabolic alterations may affect disease course variability in ALS patients, but challenges in identifying the preclinical and early phases of the disease limit our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying differences in the rate of disease progression. We examined effects of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> on thoracic and lumbar spinal cord metabolites in two mouse ALS models with different rates of disease progression: the transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-C57BL/6JOlaHsd (C57-G93A, slow progression) and transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-129SvHsd (129S-G93A, fast progression) strains. Samples from three timepoints (presymptomatic, disease onset, and late stage disease) were analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry metabolomics. Tissue metabolome differences in the lumbar spinal cord were driven primarily by mouse genetic background, although larger responses were observed in metabolic trajectories after the onset of symptoms. The significantly affected lumbar spinal cord metabolites were involved in energy and lipid metabolism. In the thoracic spinal cord, metabolic differences related to genetic background, background-SOD1 genotype interactions, and longitudinal SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> effects. The largest responses in thoracic spinal cord metabolic trajectories related to SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> effects before onset of visible symptoms. More metabolites were significantly affected in the thoracic segment, which were involved in energy homeostasis, neurotransmitter synthesis and utilization, and the oxidative stress response. We find evidence that initial metabolic alterations in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice confer disadvantages for maintaining neuronal viability under ALS-related stressors, with slow-progressing C57-G93A mice potentially having more favorable spinal cord bioenergetic profiles than 129S-G93A. These genetic background-associated metabolic differences together with the different early metabolic responses underscore the need to better characterize the impact of germline genetic variation on cellular responses to ALS gene mutations both before and after the onset of symptoms in order to understand their impact on disease development.</p>

<p>The major genetic risk for late onset Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with the presence of APOE4 alleles. However, the impact of different APOE alleles on the brain aging trajectory, and how they interact with the brain local environment in a sex specific manner is not entirely clear. We sought to identify vulnerable brain circuits in novel mouse models with homozygous targeted replacement of the mouse ApoE gene with either human APOE3 or APOE4 gene alleles. These genes are expressed in mice that also model the human immune response to age and disease-associated challenges by expressing the human NOS2 gene in place of the mouse mNos2 gene. These mice had impaired learning and memory when assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Ex vivo MRI-DTI analyses revealed global and local atrophy, and areas of reduced fractional anisotropy (FA). Using tensor network principal component analyses for structural connectomes, we inferred the pairwise connections which best separate APOE4 from APOE3 carriers. These involved primarily interhemispheric connections among regions of olfactory areas, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. Our results also suggest that pairwise connections may be subdivided and clustered spatially to reveal local changes on a finer scale. These analyses revealed not just genotype, but also sex specific differences. Identifying vulnerable networks may provide targets for interventions, and a means to stratify patients.</p>

<p>Neural spike train analysis methods are mainly used for understanding the temporal aspects of neural information processing. One approach is to measure the dissimilarity between the spike trains of a pair of neurons, often referred to as the spike train distance. The spike train distance has been often used to classify neuronal units with similar temporal patterns. Several methods to compute spike train distance have been developed so far. Intuitively, a desirable distance should be the shortest length between two objects. The Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) can compute spike train distance by measuring the shortest length between two spike trains via shifting a fraction of spikes from one spike train to another. The EMD could accurately measure spike timing differences, temporal similarity, and spikes time synchrony. It is also robust to firing rate changes. Victor and Purpura (1996) distance measures the minimum cost between two spike trains. Although it also measures the shortest path between spike trains, its output can vary with the time-scale parameter. In contrast, the EMD measures distance in a unique way by calculating the genuine shortest length between spike trains. The EMD also outperforms other existing spike train distance methods in measuring various aspects of the temporal characteristics of spike trains and in robustness to firing rate changes. The EMD can effectively measure the shortest length between spike trains without being considerably affected by the overall firing rate difference between them. Hence, it is suitable for pure temporal coding exclusively, which is a predominant premise underlying the present study.</p>

<p>Head direction (HD) cells, which fire action potentials whenever an animal points its head in a particular direction, are thought to subserve the animal’s sense of spatial orientation. HD cells are found prominently in several thalamo-cortical regions including anterior thalamic nuclei, postsubiculum, medial entorhinal cortex, parasubiculum, and the parietal cortex. While a number of methods in neural decoding have been developed to assess the dynamics of spatial signals within thalamo-cortical regions, studies conducting a quantitative comparison of machine learning and statistical model-based decoding methods on HD cell activity are currently lacking. Here, we compare statistical model-based and machine learning approaches by assessing decoding accuracy and evaluate variables that contribute to population coding across thalamo-cortical HD cells.</p>

<p>Aging is a known non-modifiable risk factor for stroke. Usually, this refers to chronological rather than biological age. Biological brain age can be estimated based on cortical and subcortical brain measures. For stroke patients, it could serve as a more sensitive marker of brain health than chronological age. In this study, we investigated whether there is a difference in brain age between stroke survivors and control participants matched on chronological age. We estimated brain age at 3 months after stroke, and then followed the longitudinal trajectory over three time-points: within 6 weeks (baseline), at 3 and at 12 months following their clinical event. We found that brain age in stroke participants was higher compared to controls, with the mean difference between the groups varying between 3.9 and 8.7 years depending on the brain measure used for prediction. This difference in brain age was observed at 6 weeks after stroke and maintained at 3 and 12 months after stroke. The presence of group differences already at baseline suggests that stroke might be an ultimate manifestation of gradual cerebrovascular burden accumulation and brain degeneration. Brain age prediction, therefore, has the potential to be a useful biomarker for quantifying stroke risk.</p>

<p>White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is widely observed in the elderly population and serves as a key indicator of cognitive impairment (CI). However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Herein, we investigated the topological patterns of resting state functional networks in WMH subjects and the relationship between the topological measures and CI. A graph theory-based analysis was employed in the resting-state functional magnetic resonance scans of 112 subjects (38 WMH subjects with cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), 36 WMH subjects with normal cognition and 38 healthy controls (HCs), and we found that WMH-CIND subjects displayed decreased global efficiency at the levels of the whole brain, specific subnetworks [fronto-parietal network (FPN) and cingulo-opercular network (CON)] and certain nodes located in the FPN and CON, as well as decreased local efficiency in subnetworks. Our results demonstrated that nodal global efficiency in frontal and parietal regions mediated the impairment of information processing speed related to periventricular WMH (PWMH). Additionally, we performed support vector machine (SVM) analysis and found that altered functional efficiency can identify WMH-CIND subjects with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. These findings suggest impaired functional networks in WMH-CIND individuals and that decreased functional efficiency may be a feature of CI in WMH subjects.</p>

<p>Microstructural and macrostructural white matter damage occurs frequently with aging, is associated with negative health outcomes, and can be imaged non-invasively as fractional anisotropy (FA) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), respectively. The extent to which diminished microstructure precedes or results from macrostructural white matter damage is poorly understood. This study evaluated the hypothesis that white matter areas with normatively lower microstructure in young adults are most susceptible to develop WMH in older adults. Forty-nine younger participants (age = 25.8 ± 2.8 years) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 557 older participants (age = 73.9 ± 5.7 years) underwent DWI and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In older adults, WMH had a mostly periventricular distribution with higher frequency in frontal regions. We found lower FA in areas of frank WMH compared to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in older adults. Then, to determine if areas of normatively lower white matter microstructure spatially overlap with areas that frequently develop macrostructural damage in older age, we created a WMH frequency map in which each voxel represented the percentage of older adults with a WMH in that voxel. We found lower normative FA in young adults with regions frequently segmented as WMH in older adults. We conclude that low white matter microstructure is observed in areas of white matter macrostructural damage, but white matter microstructure is also normatively low (i.e., at ages 20–30) in regions with high WMH frequency, prior to white matter macrostructural damage.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is marked by the presence of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuronal death and synaptic loss, and inflammation in the brain. AD research has, in large part, been dedicated to the understanding of Aβ and NFT deposition as well as to the pharmacological reduction of these hallmarks. However, recent GWAS data indicates neuroinflammation plays a critical role in AD development, thereby redirecting research efforts toward unveiling the complexities of AD-associated neuroinflammation. It is clear that the innate immune system is intimately associated with AD progression, however, the specific roles of glia and neuroinflammation in AD pathology remain to be described. Moreover, inflammatory processes have largely been painted as detrimental to AD pathology, when in fact, many immune mechanisms such as phagocytosis aid in the reduction of AD pathologies. In this review, we aim to outline the delicate balance between the beneficial and detrimental aspects of immune activation in AD as a more thorough understanding of these processes is critical to development of effective therapeutics for AD.</p>

Ordinary human experience is embedded in a web of causal relations that link the brain to the body and the wider environment. However, there might be conditions in which brain activity supports consciousness even when that activity is fully causally isolated from the body and its environment. Such cases would involve what we call islands of awareness: conscious states that are neither shaped by sensory input nor able to be expressed by motor output. This Opinion paper considers conditions in which such islands might occur, including ex cranio brains, hemispherotomy, and in cerebral organoids.

Studies have shown that gamma oscillations (30–100 Hz) are relevant for neurocircuit function, behavior, and memory. To examine a possible causal contribution of gamma oscillations to cognitive function, recent studies have employed various types of brain stimulation to induce gamma oscillations. Techniques such as optogenetics or sensory stimulation appear to engage canonical neurocircuits that encompass excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, similarly to those driven by sensory experience, to induce gamma entrainment.

<p>Biological neural networks produce information backgrounds of multi-scale spontaneous activity that become more complex in brain states displaying higher capacities for cognition, for instance, attentive awake versus asleep or anesthetized states. Here, we review brain state-dependent mechanisms spanning ion channel currents (microscale) to the dynamics of brain-wide, distributed, transient functional assemblies (macroscale). Not unlike how microscopic interactions between molecules underlie structures formed in macroscopic states of matter, using statistical physics, the dynamics of microscopic neural phenomena can be linked to macroscopic brain dynamics through mesoscopic scales. Beyond spontaneous dynamics, it is observed that stimuli evoke collapses of complexity, most remarkable over high dimensional, asynchronous, irregular background dynamics during consciousness. In contrast, complexity may not be further collapsed beyond synchrony and regularity characteristic of unconscious spontaneous activity. We propose that increased dimensionality of spontaneous dynamics during conscious states supports responsiveness, enhancing neural networks' emergent capacity to robustly encode information over multiple scales.</p>

<p>In the study of memory engrams, synaptic memory allocation is a newly emerged theme that focuses on how specific synapses are engaged in the storage of a given memory. Cumulating evidence from imaging and molecular experiments indicates that the recruitment of synapses that participate in the encoding and expression of memory is neither random nor uniform. A hallmark observation is the emergence of groups of synapses that share similar response properties and/or similar input properties and are located within a stretch of a dendritic branch. This grouping of synapses has been termed “synapse clustering” and has been shown to emerge in many different memory-related paradigms, as well as in in vitro studies. The clustering of synapses may emerge from synapses receiving similar input, or via many processes which allow for cross-talk between nearby synapses within a dendritic branch, leading to cooperative plasticity. Clustered synapses can act in concert to maximally exploit the nonlinear integration potential of the dendritic branches in which they reside. Their main contribution is to facilitate the induction of dendritic spikes and dendritic plateau potentials, which provide advanced computational and memory-related capabilities to dendrites and single neurons. This review focuses on recent evidence which investigates the role of synapse clustering in dendritic integration, sensory perception, learning, and memory as well as brain dysfunction. We also discuss recent theoretical work which explores the computational advantages provided by synapse clustering, leading to novel and revised theories of memory. As an eminent phenomenon during memory allocation, synapse clustering both shapes memory engrams and is also shaped by the parallel plasticity mechanisms upon which it relies.</p>

<p>The scientific landscape surrounding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continues to shift as the number of genes associated with the disease risk and pathogenesis, and the cellular processes involved, continues to grow. Despite decades of intense research and over 50 potentially causative or disease-modifying genes identified, etiology remains unexplained and treatment options remain limited for the majority of ALS patients. Various factors have contributed to the slow progress in understanding and developing therapeutics for this disease. Here, we review the genetic basis of ALS, highlighting factors that have contributed to the elusiveness of genetic heritability. The most commonly mutated ALS-linked genes are reviewed with an emphasis on disease-causing mechanisms. The cellular processes involved in ALS pathogenesis are discussed, with evidence implicating their involvement in ALS summarized. Past and present therapeutic strategies and the benefits and limitations of the model systems available to ALS researchers are discussed with future directions for research that may lead to effective treatment strategies outlined.</p>

<p>Attention plays a fundamental role in acquiring and understanding information. Therefore, it is useful to evaluate attention objectively in such fields as education and mental health. Aimed at extracting objective indicators of attention from physiological signals, this study examined the characteristics of electroencephalography (EEG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and pupil diameter signals during a free recall task. The objective was to clarify the temporal characteristics of these signals in relation to attention. We used a free recall task as a cognitive task with an attentional load. The participants attempted to memorize and then recall 13 serially presented words. Our hypothesis was that the significant physiological responses should differ depending on the time scale of the attention evaluation. The physiological responses were compared on the basis of differences between success and failure to recall a word on a short time scale, in terms of the attentional state among five serial position groups on a middle time scale, and on the basis of differences between trials with many and few words recalled on a long time scale. We found that the response of each physiological signal depended on the attention in the different time-scale comparisons. (1) The P300 amplitudes of the EEG signals for the words that were recalled were significantly higher than those for the words that were not recalled. (2) Pupillary dilation differed significantly depending on the serial position group. (3) Functional connectivity in the right hemisphere revealed by NIRS was significantly stronger in trials with many words recalled than in those with few words recalled. Different temporal characteristics of physiological signals with respect to attention were suggested by multimodal measurement and multiple-time-scale analysis. Consideration of these characteristics should help in the development of applications requiring objective attention evaluation.</p>

<p>Neurocognitive disorders, among which Alzheimer’s disease (AD), have become one of the major causes of death in developed countries. No effective disease-modifying therapy is available, possibly because current treatments are administered too late to still be able to intervene in the disease progress. AD is characterized by a gradual onset with subclinical neurobiological and behavioral changes that precede diagnosis with years to even decades. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier potential treatments can be tested and started. Mouse models are valuable to study the possible causes underlying early phases of neuropathology and their reflection in behavior and other biomarkers, to help improve preclinical detection and diagnosis of AD. Here, we assessed cognitive functioning and social behavior in transgenic mice expressing tau pathology only (Tau-P301L) or a combination of amyloid and tau pathology [amyloid precursor protein (APP)-V717I × Tau-P301L]. The mice were subjected to a variety of behavioral tasks at an age of 3–6 months, i.e., at an early phase of their AD-like pathology. We hypothesized that compared to age-matched wild-type controls, transgenic mice would show specific impairments in both cognitive and non-cognitive tasks. In line with our expectations, transgenic mice showed decreased cognitive flexibility in the Morris water maze, decreased exploratory behavior, decreased performance in a nesting task, and increased anxiety-like behavior. In accordance with the amyloid-cascade hypothesis, some of the behavioral measures showed more severe deficits in APP-V717I × Tau-P301L compared to Tau-P301L mice, indicating an exacerbation of disease processes due to the co-occurrence of amyloid and tau pathology. Our study supports the use of behavioral markers as early indicators of ongoing AD pathology during the preclinical phase.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00299">Targeting Alpha-Synuclein as a Therapy for Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders with a global burden of approximately 6.1 million patients. Alpha-synuclein has been linked to both the sporadic and familial forms of the disease. Moreover, alpha-synuclein is present in Lewy-bodies, the neuropathological hallmark of PD, and the protein and its aggregation have been widely linked to neurotoxic pathways that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration. Such pathways include autophagy/lysosomal dysregulation, synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial disruption, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress. Alpha-synuclein has not only been shown to alter cellular pathways but also to spread between cells, causing aggregation in host cells. Therapeutic approaches will need to address several, if not all, of these angles of alpha-synuclein toxicity. Here we review the current advances in therapeutic efforts for PD that aim to produce a disease-modifying therapy by targeting the spread, production, aggregation, and degradation of alpha-synuclein. These include: receptor blocking strategies whereby putative alpha-synuclein receptors could be blocked inhibiting alpha-synuclein spread, an alpha-synuclein reduction which will decrease the amount alpha-synuclein available for aggregation and pathway disruption, the use of small molecules in order to target alpha-synuclein aggregation, immunotherapy and the increase of alpha-synuclein degradation by increasing autophagy/lysosomal flux. The research discussed here may lead to a disease-modifying therapy that tackles disease onset and progression in the future.</p>

<p>Neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases are mostly modeled using genetically modified animals such as mice. However, animal models do not recapitulate all the phenotypes that are specific to human disease. This is mainly due to the genetic, anatomical and physiological difference in the neuromuscular systems of animals and humans. The emergence of direct and indirect human somatic cell reprogramming technologies may overcome this limitation because they enable the use of disease and patient-specific cellular models as enhanced platforms for drug discovery and autologous cell-based therapy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and urine-derived stem cells (USCs) are increasingly employed to recapitulate the pathophysiology of various human diseases. Recent cell-based modeling approaches utilize highly complex differentiation systems that faithfully mimic human tissue- and organ-level dysfunctions. In this review, we discuss promising cellular models, such as USC- and iPSC-based approaches, that are currently being used to model human neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism for molecular and functional diversification. In neurons, alternative splicing extensively controls various developmental steps as well as the plasticity and remodeling of neuronal activity in the adult brain. The axon initial segment (AIS) is the specialized compartment of proximal axons that initiates action potential (AP). At the AIS, the ion channels and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) required for AP initiation are densely clustered via the scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins. Notably, recent studies have elucidated that multiple AIS proteins are controlled by extensive alternative splicing in developing and adult brains. Here, we argue the potential role of dynamic regulation of alternative splicing in the development, specification, and functions of the AIS. In particular, we propose the novel concept that alternative splicing potentially modulates the structural and functional plasticity at the AIS.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke with highest mortality and morbidity. We have previously demonstrated that dipotassium bisperoxo (picolinato) oxovanadate (V), (bpV[pic]) inhibits phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. In this study, we examined the effect of bpV[pic] in the rat ICH model in vivo and the hemin-induced injury model in rat cortical cultures. The rat model of ICH was created by injecting autologous blood into the striatum, and bpV[pic] was intraperitoneally injected. The effects of bpV[pic] were evaluated by neurological tests, Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining, and Nissl staining. We demonstrate that bpV[pic] attenuates ICH-induced brain injury in vivo and hemin-induced neuron injury in vitro. The expression of E2F1 was increased, but β-catenin expression was decreased after ICH, and the altered expressions of E2F1 and β-catenin after ICH were blocked by bpV[pic] treatment. Our results further show that bpV[pic] increases β-catenin expression through downregulating E2F1 in cortical neurons and prevents hemin-induced neuronal damage through E2F1 downregulation and subsequent upregulation of β-catenin. By testing the effect of PTEN-siRNA, PTEN cDNA, or combined use of ERK1/2 inhibitor and bpV[pic] in cultured cortical neurons after hemin-induced injury, we provide evidence suggesting that PTEN inhibition by bpV[pic] confers neuroprotection through E2F1 and β-catenin pathway, but the neuroprotective role of ERK1/2 activation by bpV[pic] cannot be excluded.</p>

Importance<p>Non-invasive techniques for retrieving ocular surface cells from babies infected by zika virus (ZIKV) during the gestational period remain to be determined.</p>Objectives<p>The aim of this study was to describe an optimized impression cytology method for the isolation of viable cells from Zika infected babies with and without Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) in satisfactory amount and quality to enable easy adoption in the field and application in the context of genomic and molecular approaches.</p>Design, Settings, and Participants<p>Ocular surface samples were obtained with a hydrophilic nitrocellulose membrane (through optimized impression cytology method) from twelve babies referred to the Pediatric Service of the Antonio Pedro Hospital, Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After an authorized written informed consent from the parents, samples were collected from both eyes of 12 babies (4 babies with maternal ZIKV exposure during gestation and presence of clinical signs which included ocular abnormalities and microcephaly; 4 babies with maternal ZIKV exposure during gestation but no clinical signs; and 4 unaffected control babies with negative PCR for Zika virus and without clinical signs). Cells were used for microscopy analyses and evaluated for their suitability for downstream molecular applications in transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.</p>Results<p>Our optimized impression cytology protocol enabled the capture of a considerable number of viable cells. The microscopic features of the conjunctival epithelial cells were described by both direct analysis of the membrane-attached cells and analysis of cytospinned captured cells using several staining procedures. Epithelial basal, polyhedral and goblet cells were clearly identified in all groups. All cases of ZIKV infected babies showed potential morphological alterations (cell keratinization, pyknosis, karyolysis, anucleation, and vacuolization). Molecular approaches were also performed in parallel. Genomic DNA and RNA were successfully isolated from all samples to enable the establishment of transcriptomic and proteomic studies.</p>Conclusions and Relevance<p>Our method proved to be a suitable, fast, and non-invasive tool to obtain ocular cell preparations from babies with and without Zika infection. The method yielded sufficient cells for detailed morphological and molecular analyses of samples. We discuss perspectives for the application of impression cytology in the context of ZIKV studies in basic and clinical research.</p>

<p>Music training programs have been shown to enhance executive functions in aging adults; however, little is known regarding the extent to which different types of bimanual coordination (i.e., fine and gross motor) in music instruction contribute to these outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of bimanual coordination in music interventions on cognitive performance in healthy older adults (60–80 years). Participants (N = 135) completed motor measures and battery of standardized cognitive measures, before and after a 16-week music training program with a 3 h practice requirement. All participants were matched by age, education, and estimate of intelligence to one of three training programs: piano training (fine motor); percussion instruction (gross motor), and music listening instruction (MLI) (no motor control condition). Results of a Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed significant enhancements in bimanual synchronization and visual scanning/working memory abilities for fine and gross motor training groups as compared to MLI. Pairwise comparisons revealed that piano training significantly improved motor synchronization skills as compared to percussion instruction or music listening. Results suggest that active music performance may benefit working memory, the extent of these benefits may depend upon coordination demands.</p>

<p>Background: Many detailed features of the cochlear anatomy have not been included in existing 3D cochlear models, including the microstructures inside the modiolar bone, which in turn determines the path of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs).</p><p>Method: We captured the intricate modiolar microstructures in a 3D human cochlea model reconstructed from μCT scans. A new algorithm was developed to reconstruct ANFs running through the microstructures within the model. Using the finite element method, we calculated the electrical potential as well as its first and second spatial derivatives along each ANF elicited by the cochlear implant electrodes. Simulation results of electrical potential was validated against intracochlear potential measurements. Comparison was then made with a simplified model without the microstructures within the cochlea.</p><p>Results: When the stimulus was delivered from an electrode located deeper in the apex, the extent of the auditory nerve influenced by a higher electric potential grew larger; at the same time, the maximal potential value at the auditory nerve also became larger. The electric potential decayed at a faster rate toward the base of the cochlea than toward the apex. Compared to the cochlear model incorporating the modiolar microstructures, the simplified version resulted in relatively small differences in electric potential. However, in terms of the first and second derivatives of electric potential along the fibers, which are relevant for the initiation of action potentials, the two models exhibited large differences: maxima in both derivatives with the detailed model were larger by a factor of 1.5 (first derivative) and 2 (second derivative) in the exemplary fibers. More importantly, these maxima occurred at different locations, and opposite signs were found for the values of second derivatives between the two models at parts along the fibers. Hence, while one model predicts depolarization and spike initiation at a given location, the other may instead predict a hyperpolarization.</p><p>Conclusions: Although a cochlear model with fewer details seems sufficient for analysing the current spread in the cochlear ducts, a detailed-segmented cochlear model is required for the reconstruction of ANF trajectories through the modiolus, as well as the prediction of firing thresholds and spike initiation sites.</p>

<p>Purpose: Susceptibility distortions impact diffusion MRI data analysis and is typically corrected during preprocessing. Correction strategies involve three classes of methods: registration to a structural image, the use of a fieldmap, or the use of images acquired with opposing phase encoding directions. It has been demonstrated that phase encoding based methods outperform the other two classes, but unfortunately, the choice of which phase encoding based method to use is still an open question due to the absence of any systematic comparisons.</p><p>Methods: In this paper we quantitatively evaluated six popular phase encoding based methods for correcting susceptibility distortions in diffusion MRI data. We employed a framework that allows for the simulation of realistic diffusion MRI data with susceptibility distortions. We evaluated the ability for methods to correct distortions by comparing the corrected data with the ground truth. Four diffusion tensor metrics (FA, MD, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) were calculated from the corrected data and compared with the ground truth. We also validated two popular indirect metrics using both simulated data and real data. The two indirect metrics are the difference between the corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation over the corrected LR, RL, AP, and PA data.</p><p>Results: We found that DR-BUDDI and TOPUP offered the most accurate and robust correction compared to the other four methods using both direct and indirect evaluation metrics. EPIC and HySCO performed well in correcting b<sub>0</sub> images but produced poor corrections for diffusion weighted volumes, and also they produced large errors for the four diffusion tensor metrics. We also demonstrate that the indirect metric (the difference between corrected LR and AP data) gives a different ordering of correction quality than the direct metric.</p><p>Conclusion: We suggest researchers to use DR-BUDDI or TOPUP for susceptibility distortion correction. The two indirect metrics (the difference between corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation) should be interpreted together as a measure of distortion correction quality. The performance ranking of the various tools inferred from direct and indirect metrics differs slightly. However, across all tools, the results of direct and indirect metrics are highly correlated indicating that the analysis of indirect metrics may provide a good proxy of the performance of a correction tool if assessment using direct metrics is not feasible.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00079">Passing the Message: Representation Transfer in Modular Balanced Networks</a></h4>

<p>Neurobiological systems rely on hierarchical and modular architectures to carry out intricate computations using minimal resources. A prerequisite for such systems to operate adequately is the capability to reliably and efficiently transfer information across multiple modules. Here, we study the features enabling a robust transfer of stimulus representations in modular networks of spiking neurons, tuned to operate in a balanced regime. To capitalize on the complex, transient dynamics that such networks exhibit during active processing, we apply reservoir computing principles and probe the systems' computational efficacy with specific tasks. Focusing on the comparison of random feed-forward connectivity and biologically inspired topographic maps, we find that, in a sequential set-up, structured projections between the modules are strictly necessary for information to propagate accurately to deeper modules. Such mappings not only improve computational performance and efficiency, they also reduce response variability, increase robustness against interference effects, and boost memory capacity. We further investigate how information from two separate input streams is integrated and demonstrate that it is more advantageous to perform non-linear computations on the input locally, within a given module, and subsequently transfer the result downstream, rather than transferring intermediate information and performing the computation downstream. Depending on how information is integrated early on in the system, the networks achieve similar task-performance using different strategies, indicating that the dimensionality of the neural responses does not necessarily correlate with nonlinear integration, as predicted by previous studies. These findings highlight a key role of topographic maps in supporting fast, robust, and accurate neural communication over longer distances. Given the prevalence of such structural feature, particularly in the sensory systems, elucidating their functional purpose remains an important challenge toward which this work provides relevant, new insights. At the same time, these results shed new light on important requirements for designing functional hierarchical spiking networks.</p>

<p>The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is best known for its robust dopaminergic projections to forebrain regions and their critical role in regulating reward, motivation, cognition, and aversion. However, the VTA is not only made of dopamine (DA) cells, as approximately 30% of cells in the VTA are GABA neurons. These neurons play a dual role, as VTA GABA neurons provide both local inhibition of VTA DA neurons and long-range inhibition of several distal brain regions. VTA GABA neurons have increasingly been recognized as potent mediators of reward and aversion in their own right, as well as potential targets for the treatment of addiction, depression, and other stress-linked disorders. In this review article, we dissect the circuit architecture, physiology, and behavioral roles of VTA GABA neurons and suggest critical gaps to be addressed.</p>

<p>Critical brain hypothesis has been intensively studied both in experimental and theoretical neuroscience over the past two decades. However, some important questions still remain: (i) What is the critical point the brain operates at? (ii) What is the regulatory mechanism that brings about and maintains such a critical state? (iii) The critical state is characterized by scale-invariant behavior which is seemingly at odds with definitive brain oscillations? In this work we consider a biologically motivated model of Izhikevich neuronal network with chemical synapses interacting via spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as well as axonal time delay. Under generic and physiologically relevant conditions we show that the system is organized and maintained around a synchronization transition point as opposed to an activity transition point associated with an absorbing state phase transition. However, such a state exhibits experimentally relevant signs of critical dynamics including scale-free avalanches with finite-size scaling as well as critical branching ratios. While the system displays stochastic oscillations with highly correlated fluctuations, it also displays dominant frequency modes seen as sharp peaks in the power spectrum. The role of STDP as well as time delay is crucial in achieving and maintaining such critical dynamics, while the role of inhibition is not as crucial. In this way we provide possible answers to all three questions posed above. We also show that one can achieve supercritical or subcritical dynamics if one changes the average time delay associated with axonal conduction.</p>

<p>The transient receptor potential cation channel, vanilloid type (TRPV) 3, is a member of the TRPV subfamily that is expressed predominantly in the skin, hair follicles, and gastrointestinal tract. It is also distributed in the organ of Corti of the inner ear and colocalizes with TRPV1 or TRPV4, but its role in auditory function is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that TRPV3 is expressed in inner hair cells (HCs) but mainly in cochlear outer HCs in mice, with expression limited to the cytoplasm and not detected in stereocilia. We compared the number of HCs as well as distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between TRPV3 knockout (V3KO) and wild-type (V3WT) mice and found that although most mutants (72.3%) had normal hearing, a significant proportion (27.7%) showed impaired hearing associated with loss of cochlear HCs. Compensatory upregulation of TRPV4 in HCs prevented HC damage and kanamycin-induced hearing loss and preserved normal auditory function in most of these mice. Thus, TRPV4 and TRPV3 in cochlear HCs protect hearing in mice; moreover, the results suggest some functional redundancy in the functions of TRPV family members. Our findings provide novel insight into the molecular basis of auditory function in mammals that can be applied to the development of strategies to mitigate hearing loss.</p>

<p>Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are subterranean rodents that utilize their incisors for feeding, chisel-tooth digging of complex tunnel systems, social interactions, and defense in their eusocial colony structure. Previous studies have shown that naked mole-rats have morphological and anatomical adaptations that predict strong bite forces, namely, skulls that are relatively tall and wide, in addition to impressive masticatory musculature. However, no studies to date have directly measured bite force in this species or analyzed the relationship between bite force and social caste. In the current study, we assessed adult naked mole-rat maximum bite force in relation to body mass, in addition to considering each animal’s position within the eusocial hierarchy (i.e., dominant versus subordinate). Each animal was permitted to freely interact with a piezo-resistive bite force sensor. Our results showed that bite force was correlated with body mass in subordinate but not in dominant naked mole-rats, and that subordinate animals exhibited a shorter latency in producing their first bite. Maximum bite force was significantly influenced by caste. In comparing bite force with available data from previous studies across 82 additional mammalian species, subordinate naked mole-rats exhibited a bite force that was 65% higher than predicted for their body size, comparable to Tasmanian devils and exceeding bite force values for all of the carnivorans included for comparison. These results supported the hypothesis that the naked mole-rat’s bite force would exceed predictions based on body size due to the behavioral importance and specialization of the naked mole-rat incisors. This study provides insight into the differences in bite force across species, and the significant role that social and ecological factors might play in the evolutionary relationship between bite force performance and underlying anatomical structures.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00069">A MEG Study of Acute Arbaclofen (STX-209) Administration</a></h4>

<p>Several electrophysiological parameters, including the auditory evoked response component M50/M100 latencies and the phase synchrony of transient and steady-state gamma-band oscillations have been implicated as atypical (to various extents) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Furthermore, some hypotheses suggest that an underlying neurobiological mechanism for these observations might be atypical local circuit function indexed by atypical levels of inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, escalating-dose, acute investigation conducted in 25 14–18 year-old adolescents with ASD. The study assessed the sensitivity of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and MEGAPRESS “GABA” magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor dose-dependent acute effects, as well as seeking to define properties of the pre-drug “baseline” electrophysiological and GABA signatures that might predict responsiveness to the GABA-B agonist, arbaclofen (STX-209). Overall, GABA levels and gamma-band oscillatory activity showed no acute changes at either low (15 mg) or high (30 mg) dose. Evoked M50 response latency measures tended to shorten (normalize), but there was heterogeneity across the group in M50 latency response, with only a subset of participants (n = 6) showing significant M50 latency shortening, and only at the 15 mg dose. Findings thus suggest that MEG M50 latency measures show acute effects of arbaclofen administration in select individuals, perhaps reflecting effective target engagement. Whether these subjects have a greater trend towards clinical benefit remains to be established. Finally, findings also provide preliminary support for the use of objective electrophysiological measures upon which to base inclusion for optimal enrichment of populations to be included in full-scale clinical trials of arbaclofen.</p>

Introduction<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by increased impulsivity, which is multifactorial and can be assessed by tests like the delay discounting, Go-Nogo, and stop signal task (SST). Impulsivity has been related to poor treatment outcomes in substance use disorders, including AUD. In order to decrease impulsivity or improve inhibitory control, high frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has gained interest. Studies applying HF-rTMS over the DLPFC of individuals suffering from AUD assessing its effects on impulsivity measures are scarce, and results are inconclusive.</p>Methods<p>The current study (registered in Netherlands Trial Register with trial number 5291: https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5151) applied 10 sessions of HF-rTMS [sixty 10 Hz trains of 5 s at 110% motor threshold (MT)] over the right DLPFC of 80 alcohol dependent patients in clinical treatment on 10 consecutive workdays. At baseline, halfway and after the HF-rTMS treatment, the delay discounting, Go-NoGo, and SST were assessed.</p>Results<p>Ten sessions of HF-rTMS over the right DLPFC versus sham HF-rTMS did not affect performance on the delay discounting, Go-NoGo, and SSTs. A significant effect of age was found for the Go-NoGo task, with higher age associated with better performance. Furthermore, no significant correlations were found between difference scores of task performance and baseline impulsivity or severity of AUD.</p>Discussion<p>Results of this study, in combination with other studies using HF-rTMS studies in alcohol and substance use disorder, indicate mixed and inconclusive findings of HF-rTMS on impulsivity. Future studies within patient groups hospitalized at the same department are recommended to consider using a sham coil that mimics the sensations on the scalp of active HF-rTMS and to measure motivation across test sessions.</p>

Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) transform scant chemical inputs into significant neural signals. This transformation requires signal amplification. In this issue of Neuron, Ng et al. (2019) identified a mechanism by which the signals evoked by pheromones are amplified in the ORNs that selectively promote courtship behavior in Drosophila.

<p>Publication date: June 2020</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 62</p><p>Author(s): Ouyang Chen, Christopher R Donnelly, Ru-Rong Ji</p><div><p>Inflammation is the body’s protective reaction to injury and infection. Pain is a hallmark of inflammation and can be either protective or detrimental during acute or chronic phase. Macrophages play a chief role in the pathogenesis of pain and have bilateral communications with nociceptors, the specialized primary sensory neurons that sense pain. Macrophages ‘talk to’ nociceptors by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines) that induce pain via direct activation of nociceptors. Macrophages also ‘listen to’ nociceptors, by which nociceptors secrete neuropeptides and chemokines which act on macrophages. Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in nociceptors releases CCL2, activating macrophages and potentiating pathological pain. Emerging evidence also points to a pro-resolution role of macrophages in inflammation and pain. Macrophage GPR37 is activated by neuroprotectin D1, a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) and resolves inflammatory pain via phagocytosis and production of IL-10 that inhibits nociceptors. Macrophage-nociceptor interactions are also mediated by microRNAs and microRNA-containing exosomes in chronic pain. Notably, extracellular microRNAs (e.g. let-7b and miR-711) can directly bind and activate nociceptors. Targeting macrophage-nociceptor interactions will help to control inflammation and pain.</p></div>

In contrast to most vertebrates, insects usually must cope with low resolution retinal images and the inability to infer spatial features using accommodation or stereovision. However, during locomotion, the retinal input is dominated by characteristic panoramic image shifts, termed optic flow, that depend on self-motion parameters and environmental features. Therefore, optic flow provides a rich source of information guiding locomotion speed as well as the position and orientation of animals over time relative to their surroundings. Here, focusing on flight behavior, we describe the strategies and putative underlying neuronal mechanisms by which insects control their course through processing of visual motion cues.</p></div>

<p>Clusters of neurons can communicate with others through the cross-frequency coupling mechanism of oscillatory synchrony. We addressed the hypothesis that neuronal networks at various levels from micro- to macrocircuits implement this communication strategy. An abundance of local recurrent axons of vagal complex (VC) cells establish dense local microcircuits and seem to generate high-frequency noise-causing stochastic resonance (reverberation) and coherence resonance, even in in vitro slice preparations. These phenomena were observed in vitro as the generation of episodes of higher-frequency noise after an external stimulation and as stimulus-induced or spontaneous high-amplitude signals (postsynaptic activities). The in vitro microcircuit networks rarely sustained the stochastic resonance and coherence resonance cooperatively; however, in vivo networks involving additional intrabulbar mesocircuits and large-scale macrocircuits were able to sustain them cooperatively. This gave rise to large-scale oscillatory synchrony leading to robust power and coherence of signals with high amplitudes, reaching several millivolts in amplitude from a noise level of ~100 microV through cardiorespiratory frequency coupling. A regenerative mechanism of neuronal circuits might work for the generation of large-scale oscillatory synchrony. The amplitude and phase of neuronal activity in vivo may interact cooperatively to give rise to varying degrees of power and coherence of robust rhythmic activity for distinct physiological roles. The cooperative interaction between phase adaptation and amplitude amplification of neuronal activity may provide diverse nervous systems with both robustness and resilience.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00075">QUINT: Workflow for Quantification and Spatial Analysis of Features in Histological Images From Rodent Brain</a></h4>

<p>Transgenic animal models are invaluable research tools for elucidating the pathways and mechanisms involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Mechanistic clues can be revealed by applying labelling techniques such as immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridisation to brain tissue sections. Precision in both assigning anatomical location to the sections and quantifying labelled features is crucial for output validity, with a stereological approach or image-based feature extraction typically used. However, both approaches are restricted by the need to manually delineate anatomical regions. To circumvent this limitation, we present the QUINT workflow for quantification and spatial analysis of labelling in series of rodent brain section images based on available 3D reference atlases. The workflow is semi-automated, combining three open source software that can be operated without scripting knowledge, making it accessible to most researchers. As an example, a brain region-specific quantification of amyloid plaques across whole transgenic Tg2576 mouse brain series, immunohistochemically labelled for three amyloid-related antigens is demonstrated. First, the whole brain image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to produce customised atlas maps adapted to match the cutting plan and proportions of the sections (QuickNII software). Second, the labelling was segmented from the original images by the Random Forest Algorithm for supervised classification (ilastik software). Finally, the segmented images and atlas maps were used to generate plaque quantifications for each region in the reference atlas (Nutil software). The method yielded comparable results to manual delineations and to the output of a stereological method. While the use case demonstrates the QUINT workflow for quantification of amyloid plaques only, the workflow is suited to all mouse or rat brain series with labelling that is visually distinct from the background, for example for the quantification of cells or labelled proteins.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00074">Decoding Movement From Electrocorticographic Activity: A Review</a></h4>

<p>Electrocorticography (ECoG) holds promise to provide efficient neuroprosthetic solutions for people suffering from neurological disabilities. This recording technique combines adequate temporal and spatial resolution with the lower risks of medical complications compared to the other invasive methods. ECoG is routinely used in clinical practice for preoperative cortical mapping in epileptic patients. During the last two decades, research utilizing ECoG has considerably grown, including the paradigms where behaviorally relevant information is extracted from ECoG activity with decoding algorithms of different complexity. Several research groups have advanced toward the development of assistive devices driven by brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode motor commands from multichannel ECoG recordings. Here we review the evolution of this field and its recent tendencies, and discuss the potential areas for future development.</p>
