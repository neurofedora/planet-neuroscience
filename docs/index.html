              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11174">Identifying Influential nodes in Brain Networks via Self-Supervised Graph-Transformer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying influential nodes (I-nodes) in brain networks is of great significance in the field of brain imaging. Most existing studies consider brain connectivity hubs as I-nodes. However, this approach relies heavily on prior knowledge from graph theory, which may overlook the intrinsic characteristics of the brain network, especially when its architecture is not fully understood. In contrast, self-supervised deep learning can learn meaningful representations directly from the data. This approach enables the exploration of I-nodes for brain networks, which is also lacking in current studies. This paper proposes a Self-Supervised Graph Reconstruction framework based on Graph-Transformer (SSGR-GT) to identify I-nodes, which has three main characteristics. First, as a self-supervised model, SSGR-GT extracts the importance of brain nodes to the reconstruction. Second, SSGR-GT uses Graph-Transformer, which is well-suited for extracting features from brain graphs, combining both local and global characteristics. Third, multimodal analysis of I-nodes uses graph-based fusion technology, combining functional and structural brain information. The I-nodes we obtained are distributed in critical areas such as the superior frontal lobe, lateral parietal lobe, and lateral occipital lobe, with a total of 56 identified across different experiments. These I-nodes are involved in more brain networks than other regions, have longer fiber connections, and occupy more central positions in structural connectivity. They also exhibit strong connectivity and high node efficiency in both functional and structural networks. Furthermore, there is a significant overlap between the I-nodes and both the structural and functional rich-club. These findings enhance our understanding of the I-nodes within the brain network, and provide new insights for future research in further understanding the brain working mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10715">Self-Attention Limits Working Memory Capacity of Transformer-Based Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.10715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has revealed striking limits in their working memory capacity, similar to what has been found in human behavioral studies. Specifically, these models' performance drops significantly on N-back tasks as N increases. However, there is still a lack of mechanistic interpretability as to why this phenomenon would arise. Inspired by the executive attention theory from behavioral sciences, we hypothesize that the self-attention mechanism within Transformer-based models might be responsible for their working memory capacity limits. To test this hypothesis, we train vanilla decoder-only transformers to perform N-back tasks and find that attention scores gradually aggregate to the N-back positions over training, suggesting that the model masters the task by learning a strategy to pay attention to the relationship between the current position and the N-back position. Critically, we find that the total entropy of the attention score matrix increases as N increases, suggesting that the dispersion of attention scores might be the cause of the capacity limit observed in N-back tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10944">Contrasformer: A Brain Network Contrastive Transformer for Neurodegenerative Condition Identification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.10944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding neurological disorder is a fundamental problem in neuroscience, which often requires the analysis of brain networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Despite the prevalence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers in various domains, applying them to brain networks faces challenges. Specifically, the datasets are severely impacted by the noises caused by distribution shifts across sub-populations and the neglect of node identities, both obstruct the identification of disease-specific patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose Contrasformer, a novel contrastive brain network Transformer. It generates a prior-knowledge-enhanced contrast graph to address the distribution shifts across sub-populations by a two-stream attention mechanism. A cross attention with identity embedding highlights the identity of nodes, and three auxiliary losses ensure group consistency. Evaluated on 4 functional brain network datasets over 4 different diseases, Contrasformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain networks by achieving up to 10.8\% improvement in accuracy, which demonstrates its efficacy in neurological disorder identification. Case studies illustrate its interpretability, especially in the context of neuroscience. This paper provides a solution for analyzing brain networks, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10078">Spurious reconstruction from brain activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.10078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in brain decoding, particularly visual image reconstruction, have sparked discussions about the societal implications and ethical considerations of neurotechnology. As these methods aim to recover visual experiences from brain activity and achieve prediction beyond training samples (zero-shot prediction), it is crucial to assess their capabilities and limitations to inform public expectations and regulations. Our case study of recent text-guided reconstruction methods, which leverage a large-scale dataset (Natural Scene Dataset, NSD) and text-to-image diffusion models, reveals limitations in their generalizability. We found poor performance when applying these methods to a different dataset designed to prevent category overlaps between training and test sets. UMAP visualization of the text features with NSD images showed a limited diversity of semantic and visual clusters, with overlap between training and test sets. Formal analysis and simulations demonstrated that clustered training samples can lead to "output dimension collapse," restricting predictable output feature dimensions. Simulations further showed that diversifying the training set improved generalizability. However, text features alone are insufficient for mapping to the visual space. We argue that recent realistic reconstructions may primarily be a blend of classification into trained categories and generation of inauthentic images through text-to-image diffusion (hallucination). Diverse datasets and compositional representations spanning the image space are essential for genuine zero-shot prediction. Interdisciplinary discussions grounded in understanding the current capabilities and limitations, as well as ethical considerations, of the technology are crucial for its responsible development.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06816">On the Similarity of Deep Learning Representations Across Didactic and Adversarial Examples</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2002.06816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) has motivated a parallel endeavor: the design of adversaries that profit from successful misclassifications. However, not all adversarial examples are crafted for malicious purposes. For example, real world systems often contain physical, temporal, and sampling variability across instrumentation. Adversarial examples in the wild may inadvertently prove deleterious for accurate predictive modeling. Conversely, naturally occurring covariance of image features may serve didactic purposes. Here, we studied the stability of deep learning representations for neuroimaging classification across didactic and adversarial conditions characteristic of MRI acquisition variability. We show that representational similarity and performance vary according to the frequency of adversarial examples in the input space.

                arXiv:2409.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks, the third generation of artificial neural networks, have become an important family of neuron-based models that sidestep many of the key limitations facing modern-day backpropagation-trained deep networks, including their high energy inefficiency and long-criticized biological implausibility. In this work, we design and investigate a proof-of-concept instantiation of contrastive-signal-dependent plasticity (CSDP), a neuromorphic form of forward-forward-based, backpropagation-free learning. Our experimental simulations demonstrate that a hardware implementation of CSDP is capable of learning simple logic functions without the need to resort to complex gradient calculations.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that a single-layer neural network using Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) activation can solve the XOR problem, a simple fact that has been overlooked so far. We compare this solution to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the Growing Cosine Unit (GCU) activation function and explain why PReLU enables this capability. Our results show that the single-layer PReLU network can achieve 100\% success rate in a wider range of learning rates while using only three learnable parameters.

                arXiv:2409.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Bio-Inspired Mamba (BIM), a novel online learning framework for selective state space models that integrates biological learning principles with the Mamba architecture. BIM combines Real-Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)-like local learning rules, addressing the challenges of temporal locality and biological plausibility in training spiking neural networks. Our approach leverages the inherent connection between backpropagation through time and STDP, offering a computationally efficient alternative that maintains the ability to capture long-range dependencies. We evaluate BIM on language modeling, speech recognition, and biomedical signal analysis tasks, demonstrating competitive performance against traditional methods while adhering to biological learning principles. Results show improved energy efficiency and potential for neuromorphic hardware implementation. BIM not only advances the field of biologically plausible machine learning but also provides insights into the mechanisms of temporal information processing in biological neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10594">Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.10594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers stand as the cornerstone of mordern deep learning. Traditionally, these models rely on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers to mix the information between channels. In this paper, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), a novel architecture that replaces MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers to enhance the expressiveness and performance of the model. Integrating KANs into transformers, however, is no easy feat, especially when scaled up. Specifically, we identify three key challenges: (C1) Base function. The standard B-spline function used in KANs is not optimized for parallel computing on modern hardware, resulting in slower inference speeds. (C2) Parameter and Computation Inefficiency. KAN requires a unique function for each input-output pair, making the computation extremely large. (C3) Weight initialization. The initialization of weights in KANs is particularly challenging due to their learnable activation functions, which are critical for achieving convergence in deep neural networks. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose three key solutions: (S1) Rational basis. We replace B-spline functions with rational functions to improve compatibility with modern GPUs. By implementing this in CUDA, we achieve faster computations. (S2) Group KAN. We share the activation weights through a group of neurons, to reduce the computational load without sacrificing performance. (S3) Variance-preserving initialization. We carefully initialize the activation weights to make sure that the activation variance is maintained across layers. With these designs, KAT scales effectively and readily outperforms traditional MLP-based transformers.

Abstract: Our research combines an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to update the ansatz parameters, in place of traditional gradient-based methods, and benchmark on the Max-Cut problem. We demonstrate that our Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) pairing performs on par or better than a COBYLA-based QAOA in terms of solution accuracy and variance, for $d$-3 regular graphs between 4 and 26 nodes, using both $max\_count$ and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness function evaluations. Furthermore, we take our algorithm one step further and present a novel approach by presenting a multi-population EA distributed on two QPUs, which evolves independent and isolated populations in parallel, classically communicating elite individuals. Experiments were conducted on both simulators and quantum hardware, and we investigated the relative performance accuracy and variance.

                arXiv:2409.11078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have significantly advanced various fields by effectively recognizing patterns and solving complex problems. Despite these advancements, their interpretability remains a critical challenge, especially in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. To address this, explainable AI (XAI) has made progress in demystifying ANNs, yet interpretability alone is often insufficient. In certain applications, model predictions must align with expert-imposed requirements, sometimes exemplified by partial monotonicity constraints. While monotonic approaches are found in the literature for traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they still face difficulties in achieving both interpretability and certified partial monotonicity. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture, based on learnable activation functions parametrized as splines, has been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to MLPs. Building on this, we introduce a novel ANN architecture called MonoKAN, which is based on the KAN architecture and achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability. To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity through a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output. Our experiments demonstrate that MonoKAN not only enhances interpretability but also improves predictive performance across the majority of benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.

                arXiv:2403.12116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for versatile AI hardware that can learn on the edge using both labeled and unlabeled data is challenging. Deep end-to-end training methods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning are accurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires even more computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high for current embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training, such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but does not integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose a method enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervised learning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding two simple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target" for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for both fully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibrium propagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%), and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning, adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600 labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron. Our results show that this approach can effectively enable networks and hardware initially dedicated to supervised learning to also perform unsupervised learning, adapting to varying availability of labeled data.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and impaired motor performance. This study aimed to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during virtual reality (VR) tasks on the motor performance of women with FM. Methods: Participants were divided into two groups: Group A received active tDCS for 10 days followed by sham tDCS for 10 days, while Group B received the opposite sequence. Both groups performed VR tasks using MoveHero software (v. 2.4) during the tDCS sessions. Motor performance was assessed by the number of hits (movement with correct timing to reach the targets) and absolute (accuracy measure) and variable (precision measure) errors during VR tasks. Participants were 21 women, aged 30&amp;amp;ndash;50 years, and diagnosed with FM. Results: Group A, which received active tDCS first, presented significant improvements in motor performance (number of hits and absolute and variable errors). The benefits of active tDCS persisted into the sham phase, suggesting a lasting neuroplastic effect. Conclusions: tDCS during VR tasks significantly improved motor performance in women with FM, particularly in complex, extensive movements. These findings indicate that tDCS enhances neuroplasticity, leading to sustained motor improvements, making it a promising therapeutic tool in FM rehabilitation.</p>

                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee members’ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Background The global rise in cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) poses a significant health challenge, which is why adult stem cells have gained great importance in recent years, due to their potential to promote the regeneration of the flowcardiac tissue, among which multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) stand out, thanks to their clinical usefulness. Objectives To evaluate the effect of the dose, timing, and route of administration of MSCs on their regenerative capacity after MI. Methods We searched for randomized clinical trials and experimental studies published up to April 25, 2024, in Medline (PubMed) and Scopus. Results Nine clinical studies were included in the qualitative assessment. The main routes of application were coronary, intramyocardially, epicardial topical and systemic venous perfusion, which could have clinical effectiveness with doses of 1x106 MSC/Kg,1 to 3 x 106, 4x106 and those greater than 0.5x106, respectively. The median number of viable cells administered was 2.4x106 (IQR: 1.6-2.4) in the PCI group versus 1.6x106 in the RCVI group (p=0.167). Median ex vivo retention was 2.55% in the RCVI group, 30 days after AMI, and 39.40% in the PCI group. At 4 and 12 months of follow-up, a better left ventricular end-to-end (LVEF) was observed in the group treated with ADSCs, at 4 (51.8% ±5.4% vs. 35.5% ±1.9%) and 8 weeks (52.1%± 3.4% versus 34.2% ±4.7%, p = 0.048). Conclusions The dosing, timing of administration, and routes of administration were important factors to assess the efficacy of the MSC.

                Fondrakö is the local wisdom of the Nias ethnic community and has two functions. First are the oral religious holy book teaching ancestors' values and philosophy. Second is the highest consensus institution of the traditional society formulating and making decisions on the socio-religious law to guarantee the order of the community. This paper explains that social differentiation has happened in the modern era; philosophical values of fondrakö remain to live up to this day and experience the proliferation of rites. The argumentation built through this paper is that primitive culture will not simply disappear in the modern community just because it experiences accommodation and the decrease of emotional intensity into new forms. Social laws of primitive religion are not always contradictory and can run parallel with civilization.

                Background This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the themes of lack, desire, and denial in the realm of disability culture as conceptualized by Dan Goodley. In Disability Studies: An Interdisciplinary Introduction (2011), Goodley re-examines the psychoanalysis of disabled characters, Emphasizing the necessity of a critical approach to psychoanalysis rather than a blind alignment with it. Despite this caution, he investigates potential connections between Lacanian theory and disability studies, acknowledging the current literature on this topic is limited and lacks further development. Nevertheless, the author argues that psychoanalysis is most effective when used to understand the biases and prejudices faced by handicapped individuals in a culture, as well as the unrealistic expectations of extreme rationality and independence in modern society. Method The research juxtaposes the disability portrayals in J.M. Coetzee’s Slow Man, written from an abled author’s perspective, and John Green’s Turtles All the Way Down, written from a disabled author’s perspective. Through meticulous evaluation of these works, the article uncovers how the writers’ individual encounters and viewpoints influence their depiction of disability. Result The analysis uncovers notable disparities in the portrayal of disability in the two works. These disparities are influenced by the authors’ personal experiences and perspectives, highlighting the significant differences in how abled and disabled authors depict disability. Conclusion This approach reveals the significance of having a variety of perspectives in literature, specifically focusing on the influential role of authors with disabilities in establishing disability culture and promoting a nuanced comprehension of disability within society. It promotes a nuanced comprehension of disability within society, underlining the critical role of varied authorial viewpoints in enriching the understanding of disability.

                Traditional educational frameworks in Saudi Arabia have historically adopted a deficit-based approach to special education, potentially overlooking the benefits of neurodiversity. As global educational paradigms shift toward inclusive practices, examining the alignment of Saudi special education laws with neurodiversity principles becomes crucial. This content analysis study aimed to explore the existing literature on special education in Saudi Arabia to ascertain whether the laws and policies support or hinder the practice of neurodiversity, a concept that is gaining international recognition but remains nascent in Saudi Arabia. A systematic literature search was performed in Web of Science and Scopus, yielding 21 relevant studies after screening and application of inclusion criteria. A content analysis was conducted, focusing on the categorization of data relevant to special education laws and their implications for neurodiversity. The analysis identified seven key categories, including Implementation of Inclusive education and transition services, that reflect the current state of special education laws in relation to neurodiversity. A conceptual model was developed, illustrating the potential of special education laws to both support and impede neurodiversity in Saudi Arabia and potentially worldwide.

                Rab10 is a small GTPase involved in cargo transport from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and endocytic recycling back to the cell membrane. It has garnered significant interest in neurodegenerative disease research, particularly due to its phosphorylation by the LRRK2 kinase. This relationship underscores the importance of Rab10 in cellular processes related to disease pathology, specifically Parkinson’s disease. The accessibility of renewable and selective antibodies against Rab10 would advance research efforts, enabling further understanding of its function and implications in disease. Here, we have characterized eight Rab10 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Introduction Zero-dose children (ZDC) are defined as those that have never been reached by routine immunization services. In Latin America, almost 2.7 million infants younger than 1 year of age, have incomplete vaccination schedules, and vaccine preventable diseases such as measles or polio have increase worldwide. ZDC are reported to reside in high risk and fragile settings, including remote-rural areas, urban slums, and conflict-affected areas. Identifying the problem and settings in each country is mandatory to propose possible solutions to the immunization coverage situation. Areas covered In November 2023, a group of experts of the Latin America Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (SLIPE) analyzed the global and regional reality of ZDC, and present in this document an updated reality of the Latin American region and the weight of the possible interventions to overcome this problem. Expert commentary Communication is a key element to improve vaccination coverage, as it is quality and use of vaccination data. Campaigns that deliver targeted and effective messages to communities and families, provide education about vaccination, avoid missed vaccination opportunities, and coordinate efforts across different sectors and communities, among other strategies, could improve the current immunization situation.

Weinberger, Nathan D. Grubaugh</p>

Significant variations have been observed in viral copies generated during SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the factors that impact viral copies and infection dynamics are not fully understood, and may be inherently dependent upon different viral and host factors. Here, we conducted virus whole genome sequencing and measured viral copies using RT-qPCR from 9,902 SARS-CoV-2 infections over a 2-year period to examine the impact of virus genetic variation on changes in viral copies adjusted for host age and vaccination status. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, we identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome associated with variations in viral copies. We further applied a marginal epistasis test to detect interactions among SNPs and identified multiple pairs of substitutions located in the spike gene that have non-linear effects on viral copies. We also analyzed the temporal patterns and found that SNPs associated with increased viral copies were predominantly observed in Delta and Omicron BA.2/BA.4/BA.5/XBB infections, whereas those associated with decreased viral copies were only observed in infections with Omicron BA.1 variants. Our work showcases how GWAS can be a useful tool for probing phenotypes related to SNPs in viral genomes that are worth further exploration. We argue that this approach can be used more broadly across pathogens to characterize emerging variants and monitor therapeutic interventions.

                <p>by Hannah Zoller, Carlos Garcia Perez, Javier Betel Geijo Fernández, Wolfgang zu Castell</p>

Considering biological systems as information processing entities and analyzing their organizational structure via information-theoretic measures has become an established approach in life sciences. We transfer this framework to a field of broad general interest, the human gut microbiome. We use BacArena, a software combining agent-based modelling and flux-balance analysis, to simulate a simplified human intestinal microbiome (SIHUMI). In a first step, we derive information theoretic measures from the simulated abundance data, and, in a second step, relate them to the metabolic processes underlying the abundance data. Our study provides further evidence on the role of active information storage as an indicator of unexpected structural change in the observed system. Besides, we show that information transfer reflects coherent behavior in the microbial community, both as a reaction to environmental changes and as a result of direct effective interaction. In this sense, purely abundance-based information theoretic measures can provide meaningful insight on metabolic interactions within bacterial communities. Furthermore, we shed light on the important however little noticed technical aspect of distinguishing immediate and delayed effects in the interpretation of local information theoretical measures.

                <p>by Yoshitaka Kurikawa, Ikuko Koyama-Honda, Norito Tamura, Seiichi Koike, Noboru Mizushima</p>

Organelles have unique structures and molecular compositions for their functions and have been classified accordingly. However, many organelles are heterogeneous and in the process of maturation and differentiation. Because traditional methods have a limited number of parameters and spatial resolution, they struggle to capture the heterogeneous landscapes of organelles. Here, we present a method for multiparametric particle-based analysis of organelles. After disrupting cells, fluorescence microscopy images of organelle particles labeled with 6 to 8 different organelle markers were obtained, and their multidimensional data were represented in two-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) spaces. This method enabled visualization of landscapes of 7 major organelles as well as the transitional states of endocytic organelles directed to the recycling and degradation pathways. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria contact sites were detected in these maps. Our proposed method successfully detects a wide array of organelles simultaneously, enabling the analysis of heterogeneous organelle landscapes.

                Background A multifaceted and interactive teaching approach is recommended for achieving proficiency in evidence-based practice, with critical thinking considered vital for connecting theory and practice. In this context, we advocate the strategic use of health claims in media to promote critical thinking and provide an accessible entry point to evidence-based practice for early-stage university healthcare students. Method We conducted a convergent mixed methods study, including a cross-sectional survey with structured and open-ended questions as well as focus group interviews, at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Oslo Metropolitan University, during the 2020-2021 academic year. Participants were bachelor’s students in bioengineering, physiotherapy, social education, and occupational therapy. We employed a blended learning approach, combining digital learning resources, teaching in critical assessment of health claims and evidence-based practice, and a concurrent group exam assignment centered around health news. The outcome measures included students’ experiences integrating health claims into evidence-based practice teaching and their experiences with teaching approaches, including the group exam. Results Out of 446 participants, 136 (30.5%) responded to the structured questions in the survey. In response to the open-ended questions within the survey, 109 (80.1%) of the respondents shared positive experiences about the course, while 98 (72%) suggested improvements. Additionally, 25 students participated in focus group interviews. Synthesizing the results, we found that students viewed the inclusion of health claim assessment as a useful entry point for learning evidence-based practice. In addition, both the blended learning design and the group exam were identified as contributors to a positive perception of learning outcomes from the course. Conclusions Integrating critical reflection on media health claims into evidence-based practice education, alongside a blended learning approach and a group exam, may be beneficial for educating bachelor’s healthcare students. However, further rigorous study designs are needed to assess the effect of the course on learning outcomes. Registration DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6985449

                Near-death experience (NDE) is a transcendent mental event of uncertain etiology that arises on the cusp of biological death. Since the discovery of NDE in the mid-1970s, multiple neuroscientific theories have been developed in an attempt to account for it in strictly materialistic or reductionistic terms. Therefore, in this conception, NDE is at most an extraordinary hallucination without any otherworldly, spiritual, or supernatural denotations. During the last decade or so, a number of animal and clinical studies have emerged which reported that about the time of death, there may be a surge of high frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) at a time when cortical electrical activity is otherwise at a very low ebb. This oscillatory rhythm falls within the range of the enigmatic brain wave-labelled gamma-band activity (GBA). Therefore, it has been proposed that this brief, paradoxical, and perimortem burst of the GBA may represent the neural foundation of the NDE. This study examines three separate but related questions concerning this phenomenon. The first problem pertains to the electrogenesis of standard GBA and the extent to which authentic cerebral activity has been contaminated by myogenic artifacts. The second problem involves the question of whether agents that can mimic NDE are also underlain by GBA. The third question concerns the electrogenesis of the surge in GBA itself. It has been contended that this is neither cortical nor myogenic in origin. Rather, it arises in a subcortical (amygdaloid) location but is recorded at the cortex via volume conduction, thereby mimicking standard GBA. Although this surge of GBA contains genuine electrophysiological activity and is an intriguing and provocative finding, there is little evidence to suggest that it could act as a kind of neurobiological skeleton for a phenomenon such as NDE.

<p>We examined the contribution of imagery to sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) performance of <i>proficient imagers</i>, utilizing a synchronization–continuation paradigm that included an auditory or visual distractor task during the continuation phase. While the visual distractor task had minimal effect, SMS consistency was significantly impacted by the auditory distractor task. Our electroencephalography analysis revealed beat-related (1.67 Hz) neural entrainment to the guiding visual stimulus during the synchronization phase (a) and during the continuation phase without guiding visual stimulus only when the visual (c) or auditory (d) distractor tasks were present. During continuation with the auditory distractor task (d), the neural entrainment showed an occipital electrode distribution, suggesting the involvement of visual imagery. Unique to SMS continuation with the auditory distractor task, neural and sub-vocal (measured with electromyography) entrainment were found at the three-beat pattern frequency. In this most difficult condition, <i>proficient imagers</i> employed both beat- and pattern-related imagery strategies. Our results suggest that <i>proficient imagers</i> effectively utilized beat-related imagery in one modality when imagery in another modality was limited.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) is the temporal coordination of motor movements with external or imagined stimuli. Finger-tapping studies indicate better SMS performance with auditory or tactile stimuli compared to visual. However, SMS with a visual rhythm can be improved by enriching stimulus properties (e.g., spatiotemporal content) or individual differences (e.g., one's vividness of auditory imagery). We previously showed that higher self-reported vividness of auditory imagery led to more consistent synchronization–continuation performance when participants continued without a guiding visual rhythm. Here, we examined the contribution of imagery to the SMS performance of <i>proficient imagers</i>, including an auditory or visual distractor task during the continuation phase. While the visual distractor task had minimal effect, SMS consistency was significantly worse when the auditory distractor task was present. Our electroencephalography analysis revealed beat-related neural entrainment, only when the visual or auditory distractor tasks were present. During continuation with the auditory distractor task, the neural entrainment showed an occipital electrode distribution, suggesting the involvement of visual imagery. Unique to SMS continuation with the auditory distractor task, we found neural and sub-vocal (measured with electromyography) entrainment at the three-beat pattern frequency. In this most difficult condition, <i>proficient imagers</i> employed both beat- and pattern-related imagery strategies. However, this combination was insufficient to restore SMS consistency to that observed with visual or no distractor task. Our results suggest that <i>proficient imagers</i> effectively utilized beat-related imagery in one modality when imagery in another modality was limited.</p>

                Troubleshooting is an important part of experimental research, but graduate students rarely receive formal training in this skill. In this article, we describe an initiative called Pipettes and Problem Solving that we developed to teach troubleshooting skills to graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin. An experienced researcher presents details of a hypothetical experiment that has produced unexpected results, and students have to propose new experiments that will help identify the source of the problem. We also provide slides and other resources that can be used to facilitate problem solving and teach troubleshooting skills at other institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96553">OsNF-YB7 inactivates OsGLK1 to inhibit chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice embryo</a></h4>

              
                As a master regulator of seed development, Leafy Cotyledon 1 (LEC1) promotes chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, but the mechanism underlying this remains poorly understood. Here, we found that loss of function of <i>OsNF-YB7</i>, a <i>LEC1</i> homolog of rice, leads to chlorophyllous embryo, indicating that <i>OsNF-YB7</i> plays an opposite role in Chl biosynthesis in rice compared with that in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. OsNF-YB7 regulates the expression of a group of genes responsible for Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis by directly binding to their promoters. In addition, OsNF-YB7 interacts with Golden 2-Like 1 (OsGLK1) to inhibit the transactivation activity of OsGLK1, a key regulator of Chl biosynthesis. Moreover, OsNF-YB7 can directly repress <i>OsGLK1</i> expression by recognizing its promoter in vivo, indicating the involvement of OsNF-YB7 in multiple regulatory layers of Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo. We propose that OsNF-YB7 functions as a transcriptional repressor to regulate Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98834">Bidirectional dysregulation of synaptic glutamate signaling after transient metabolic failure</a></h4>

              
                Ischemia leads to a severe dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis and excitotoxic cell damage in the brain. Shorter episodes of energy depletion, for instance during peri-infarct depolarizations, can also acutely perturb glutamate signaling. It is less clear if such episodes of metabolic failure also have persistent effects on glutamate signaling and how the relevant mechanisms such as glutamate release and uptake are differentially affected. We modeled acute and transient metabolic failure by using a chemical ischemia protocol and analyzed its effect on glutamatergic synaptic transmission and extracellular glutamate signals by electrophysiology and multiphoton imaging, respectively, in the mouse hippocampus. Our experiments uncover a duration-dependent bidirectional dysregulation of glutamate signaling. Whereas short chemical ischemia induces a lasting potentiation of presynaptic glutamate release and synaptic transmission, longer episodes result in a persistent postsynaptic failure of synaptic transmission. We also observed unexpected differences in the vulnerability of the investigated cellular mechanisms. Axonal action potential firing and glutamate uptake were surprisingly resilient compared to postsynaptic cells, which overall were most vulnerable to acute and transient metabolic stress. We conclude that short perturbations of energy supply lead to a lasting potentiation of synaptic glutamate release, which may increase glutamate excitotoxicity well beyond the metabolic incident.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94349">Cell-type-specific origins of locomotor rhythmicity at different speeds in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Different speeds of locomotion require heterogeneous spinal populations, but a common mode of rhythm generation is presumed to exist. Here, we explore the cellular versus synaptic origins of spinal rhythmicity at different speeds by performing electrophysiological recordings from premotor excitatory interneurons in larval zebrafish. Chx10-labeled V2a neurons are divided into at least two morphological subtypes proposed to play distinct roles in timing and intensity control. Consistent with distinct rhythm generating and output patterning functions within the spinal V2a population, we find that descending subtypes are recruited exclusively at slow or fast speeds and exhibit intrinsic cellular properties suitable for rhythmogenesis at those speeds, while bifurcating subtypes are recruited more reliably at all speeds and lack appropriate rhythmogenic cellular properties. Unexpectedly, however, phasic firing patterns during locomotion in rhythmogenic and non-rhythmogenic V2a neurons alike are best explained by distinct modes of synaptic inhibition linked to cell type and speed. At fast speeds reciprocal inhibition in descending V2a neurons supports phasic firing, while recurrent inhibition in bifurcating V2a neurons helps pattern motor output. In contrast, at slow speeds recurrent inhibition in descending V2a neurons supports phasic firing, while bifurcating V2a neurons rely on reciprocal inhibition alone to pattern output. Our findings suggest cell-type-specific, not common, modes of rhythmogenesis generate and coordinate different speeds of locomotion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91046">Structure and evolution of alanine/serine decarboxylases and the engineering of theanine production</a></h4>

              
                Ethylamine (EA), the precursor of theanine biosynthesis, is synthesized from alanine decarboxylation by alanine decarboxylase (AlaDC) in tea plants. AlaDC evolves from serine decarboxylase (SerDC) through neofunctionalization and has lower catalytic activity. However, lacking structure information hinders the understanding of the evolution of substrate specificity and catalytic activity. In this study, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of AlaDC from <i>Camellia sinensis</i> (CsAlaDC) and SerDC from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (AtSerDC). Tyr<sup>341</sup> of AtSerDC or the corresponding Tyr<sup>336</sup> of CsAlaDC is essential for their enzymatic activity. Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC and the corresponding Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC determine their substrate specificity. Both CsAlaDC and AtSerDC have a distinctive zinc finger and have not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases. Based on the structural comparisons, we conducted a mutation screen of CsAlaDC. The results indicated that the mutation of L110F or P114A in the CsAlaDC dimerization interface significantly improved the catalytic activity by 110% and 59%, respectively. Combining a double mutant of CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> with theanine synthetase increased theanine production 672% in an <i>in vitro</i> system. This study provides the structural basis for the substrate selectivity and catalytic activity of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC and provides a route to more efficient biosynthesis of theanine.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92173">DNL343 is an investigational CNS penetrant eukaryotic initiation factor 2B activator that prevents and reverses the effects of neurodegeneration caused by the integrated stress response</a></h4>

              
                The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved pathway in eukaryotic cells that is activated in response to multiple sources of cellular stress. Although acute activation of this pathway restores cellular homeostasis, intense or prolonged ISR activation perturbs cell function and may contribute to neurodegeneration. DNL343 is an investigational CNS-penetrant small-molecule ISR inhibitor designed to activate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and suppress aberrant ISR activation. DNL343 reduced CNS ISR activity and neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner in two established in vivo models – the optic nerve crush injury and an eIF2B loss of function (LOF) mutant – demonstrating neuroprotection in both and preventing motor dysfunction in the LOF mutant mouse. Treatment with DNL343 at a late stage of disease in the LOF model reversed elevation in plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and prevented premature mortality. Several proteins and metabolites that are dysregulated in the LOF mouse brains were normalized by DNL343 treatment, and this response is detectable in human biofluids. Several of these biomarkers show differential levels in CSF and plasma from patients with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD), a neurodegenerative disease that is driven by eIF2B LOF and chronic ISR activation, supporting their potential translational relevance. This study demonstrates that DNL343 is a brain-penetrant ISR inhibitor capable of attenuating neurodegeneration in mouse models and identifies several biomarker candidates that may be used to assess treatment responses in the clinic.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88673">Vglut2-based glutamatergic signaling in central noradrenergic neurons is dispensable for normal breathing and chemosensory reflexes</a></h4>

              
                Central noradrenergic (NA) neurons are key constituents of the respiratory homeostatic network. NA dysfunction is implicated in several developmental respiratory disorders including Congenital Central Hyperventilation Syndrome (CCHS), Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and Rett Syndrome. The current unchallenged paradigm in the field, supported by multiple studies, is that glutamate co-transmission in subsets of central NA neurons plays a role in breathing control. If true, NA-glutamate co-transmission may also be mechanistically important in respiratory disorders. However, the requirement of NA-derived glutamate in breathing has not been directly tested and the extent of glutamate co-transmission in the central NA system remains uncharacterized. Therefore, we fully characterized the cumulative fate maps and acute adult expression patterns of all three vesicular glutamate transporters (<i>Slc17a7</i> (Vglut1), <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2), and <i>Slc17a8</i> (Vglut3)) in NA neurons, identifying a novel, dynamic expression pattern for Vglut2 and an undescribed co-expression domain for Vglut3 in the NA system. In contrast to our initial hypothesis that NA-derived glutamate is required to breathing, our functional studies showed that loss of Vglut2 throughout the NA system failed to alter breathing or metabolism under room air, hypercapnia, or hypoxia in unrestrained and unanesthetized mice. These data demonstrate that Vglut2-based glutamatergic signaling within the central NA system is not required for normal baseline breathing and hypercapnic, hypoxic chemosensory reflexes. These outcomes challenge the current understanding of central NA neurons in the control of breathing and suggests that glutamate may not be a critical target to understand NA neuron dysfunction in respiratory diseases.

">Interaction between facial expression and color in modulating EPR P3</a></h4>

              
                The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence attention remains unclear. Additionally, whether facial expressions affect selective attention is unknown; for example, reddish angry faces increase negative social evaluation or emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether selective attention is similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 amplitudes for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, there was no significant main effect or interaction effect of facial expression or facial color on P1 amplitudes for the target, and there were significant main effects of facial expression only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the intensity of a human's selective attention to facial expressions varies according to the higher-order semantic processing of the relationship between emotion and color rather than simple facial expression or facial color effects individually. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.

">Cortical state contributions to response variability in the early visual cortex: A system identification approach</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the early visual cortex respond selectively to multiple features of visual stimuli, but they respond differently to repeated presentation of the same visual stimulus. Such trial-to-trial response variabilities are often treated as noise and addressed by simple trial-averaging to obtain the stimulus-driven response, though this approach is insufficient to fully remove the response variability. More importantly, there is evidence that response variability may primarily be caused by non-sensory factors, particularly by variations in cortical state. Here we recorded and analyzed neuronal spiking activity in response to natural images from areas 17 and 18 of cats, along with local population neuronal signals; local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA). We used a variability ratio (VR) measure to quantify the variability of neural responses across trials and two cortical state indicative measures; global fluctuation index (GFI) calculated using MUA and synchrony index (SI) calculated using LFP signals. We propose a compact convolutional neural network model with two parallel pathways, to capture the stimulus-driven activity and the cortical state-driven response variabilities. The stimulus-driven pathway contains a spatiotemporal filter, a parametric rectifier and a Gaussian map and the cortical state-driven pathway contains temporal filters for MUA and LFP. The model parameters are fit to best predict the spiking activity of each neuron. Single neurons showed highly varying degrees of trial-to-trial response variability, even when recorded simultaneously. The fitted model performed with a significantly higher accuracy in predicting neural responses compared to a basic model with a stimulus-driven pathway alone. The neurons with higher response variability benefited more from the cortical state-driven pathway compared to less variable neurons. These results provide insights to understanding the possibility of trial-to-trial response variabilities emerging as an effect of cortical state dynamics.

                This study investigates the neural activity patterns associated with impaired decision-making in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by examining the effects of amyloid pathology on prefrontal-hippocampal circuit dynamics in 5XFAD mice, a model system known for its pronounced early amyloid pathology. Using ecologically relevant ''approach food-avoid predator'' paradigms, we revealed that 5XFAD mice display impaired decision strategies in risky foraging tasks, characterized by rigid hippocampal place fields and diminished sharp-wave ripple (SWR) frequencies, accompanied by disrupted prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity. These neural deficits align with behavioral inflexibility in dynamic threat scenarios. Our findings indicate that disrupted SWR dynamics and corticolimbic connectivity contribute to decision-making deficits in AD, emphasizing the potential of targeting these specific neural mechanisms to ameliorate cognitive impairments. This research contributes significantly to our understanding of AD's impact on cognition, providing insights that could lead to more targeted therapeutic strategies.

">Limbic System White Matter in Children and Adolescents with ADHD: A Longitudinal Diffusion MRI Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasingly recognized as a disorder linked to atypical white matter development across large-scale brain networks. However, current research predominantly focuses on cortical networks, leaving the developmental trajectories of many subcortical networks, including the limbic system, largely unexplored. The limbic system is crucial for emotion and cognition, making it a key area of interest in ADHD research. This study employed multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to map the development of limbic system white matter in individuals with ADHD (n = 72) and controls (n = 97) across three time points between ages 9 and 14. Diffusion kurtosis imaging and graph theory metrics were used to characterize limbic system white matter, alongside assessments of emotional regulation and ADHD symptom severity. Compared to controls, individuals with ADHD exhibited significantly lower microstructural organization, particularly in kurtosis anisotropy, within the bilateral cingulum bundle from childhood to adolescence. Brain-behavior analyses further revealed that higher ADHD symptom severity was associated with a lower number of limbic system white matter connections, notably decreased routing efficiency and network density. These findings offer novel insights into the role of disrupted limbic system white matter in ADHD pathophysiology, broadening our understanding of the disorder's neural mechanisms and opening promising avenues for future exploration of subcortical brain networks.

">Overabundant endocannabinoids in neurons are detrimental to cognitive function</a></h4>

              
                2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the most prevalent endocannabinoid involved in maintaining brain homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that inactivating monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme responsible for degrading 2-AG in the brain, alleviates neuropathology and prevents synaptic and cognitive decline in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. However, we show that selectively inhibiting 2-AG metabolism in neurons impairs cognitive function in mice. This cognitive impairment appears to result from decreased expression of synaptic proteins and synapse numbers, impaired long-term synaptic plasticity and cortical circuit functional connectivity, and diminished neurogenesis. Interestingly, the synaptic and cognitive deficits induced by neuronal MAGL inactivation can be counterbalanced by inhibiting astrocytic 2-AG metabolism. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that inhibiting neuronal 2-AG degradation leads to widespread changes in expression of genes associated with synaptic function. These findings suggest that crosstalk in 2-AG signaling between astrocytes and neurons is crucial for maintaining synaptic and cognitive functions and that excessive 2-AG in neurons alone is detrimental to cognitive function.

">Activation of 5-HT7 receptors in the mouse dentate gyrus selectively enhances GABAergic inhibition of hilar mossy cells without affecting plasticity at the perforant path synapse</a></h4>

              
                Background: The study examined the effects of 5-HT7 receptor activation on GABAergic transmission within the dentate gyrus and plasticity at the glutamatergic perforant path input. Methods: Immunofluorescence imaging was performed using transverse hippocampal slices from transgenic mice expressing GFP under the Htr7 promoter. This was followed by whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded from dentate granule cells and hilar mossy cells -- two glutamatergic neuron types present in the dentate gyrus. Extracellular recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were then performed to assess whether 5-HT7 receptor activation influenced theta burst stimulation-evoked plasticity of the perforant path synaptic input. Results: It was found that parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons in the dentate gyrus expressed GFP. Activation of 5-HT7 receptors increased GABAergic transmission targeting mossy cells but not granule cells. However, there was no effect of 5-HT7 receptor activation on perforant path plasticity either with intact or blocked GABAA receptor signaling. Conclusion: The presence of 5-HT7 receptors in a subset of parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus could mean that they are involved in the inhibitory control of dentate gyrus activity, although the effect seems to be confined to mossy cells and did not translate to changes in perforant path plasticity. Further experiments are needed to fully elucidate the functional role of these receptors in the dentate gyrus.

">High-resolution in vivo kinematic tracking with injectable fluorescent nanoparticles</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral quantification is a cornerstone of many neuroscience experiments. Recent advances in motion tracking have streamlined the study of behavior in small laboratory animals and enabled precise movement quantification on fast (millisecond) timescales. This includes markerless keypoint trackers, which utilize deep network systems to label positions of interest on the surface of an animal (e.g., paws, snout, tail, etc.). These approaches mark a major technological achievement. However, they have a high error rate relative to motion capture in humans and are yet to be benchmarked against ground truth datasets in mice. Moreover, the extent to which they can be used to track joint or skeletal kinematics remains unclear. As the primary output of the motor system is the activation of muscles that, in turn, exert forces on the skeleton rather than the skin, it is important to establish potential limitations of techniques that rely on surface imaging. This can be accomplished by imaging implanted fiducial markers in freely moving mice. Here, we present a novel tracking method called QD-Pi (Quantum Dot-based Pose estimation in vivo), which employs injectable near-infrared fluorescent nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs) immobilized on microbeads. We demonstrate that the resulting tags are biocompatible and can be imaged non-invasively using commercially available camera systems when injected into fatty tissue beneath the skin or directly into joints. Using this technique, we accurately capture 3D trajectories of up to ten independent internal positions in freely moving mice over multiple weeks. Finally, we leverage this technique to create a large-scale ground truth dataset for benchmarking and training the next generation of markerless keypoint tracker systems.

">Astrocyte glucocorticoid receptors mediate sex-specific changes in activity following stress</a></h4>

              
                Interactions between orexin neurons and astrocytes in the lateral hypothalamus influence activity levels including circadian and motivated behaviour. These behaviors are disrupted by stress in rodents and form a hallmark of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we set out to understand how stress influences activity and the underlying cellular mechanisms. We report that the long-term effects of stress on activity levels correlate with spontaneous firing of orexin neurons with hyperactivity in males and hypoactivity presented by female mice. These neuronal changes were accompanied by extensive astrocyte remodelling. Causal manipulations identified lateral hypothalamic astrocytes as key regulators of activity patterns. In the context of stress, genetic deletion of glucocorticoid receptors in lateral hypothalamic astrocytes rescued the effects of stress on orexin neuron firing, restoring activity to control levels in both males and females. Overall, these data suggest that astrocytic regulation of orexin neuron firing enables the maintenance of activity levels, and their dysfunction drives stress-induced activity dysregulation.

">Unique Transcriptomic Cell Types of the Granular Retrosplenial Cortex are Preserved Across Mice and Rats Despite Dramatic Changes in Key Marker Genes</a></h4>

              
                The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) supports key functions ranging from memory consolidation to spatial navigation. The mouse RSG contains several cell types that are remarkably distinct from those found in other cortical regions. This includes the physiologically and transcriptomically unique low rheobase neuron that is the dominant cell-type in RSG layers 2/3 (L2/3 LR), as well as the similarly exclusive pyramidal cells that comprise much of RSG layer 5a (L5a RSG). While the functions of the RSG are extensively studied in both mice and rats, it remains unknown if the transcriptomically unique cell types of the mouse RSG are evolutionarily conserved in rats. Here, we show that mouse and rat RSG not only contain the same cell types, but key subtypes including the L2/3 LR and L5a RSG neurons are amplified in their representations in rats compared to mice. This preservation of cell types in male and female rats happens despite dramatic changes in key cell-type-specific marker genes, with the Scnn1a expression that selectively tags mouse L5a RSG neurons completely absent in rats. Important for Cre-driver line development, we identify alternative, cross-species genes that can be used to selectively target the cell types of the RSG in both mice and rats. Our results show that the unique cell types of the RSG are evolutionarily conserved across millions of years of evolution between mice and rats, but also emphasize stark species-specific differences in marker genes that need to be considered when making cell-type-specific transgenic lines of mice versus rats.

">Amygdala stimulation transforms short-term memory into remote memory by persistent activation of atypical PKC in the anterior cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Although many studies have addressed the role of the amygdala in modulating long-term memory, it is not known whether weak training plus amygdala stimulation can transform a short-term memory into a remote memory. Object place recognition (OPR) memory after strong training remains hippocampus-dependent through the persistent action of PKM{zeta} for at least 6 days, but it is unknown whether weak training plus amygdala stimulation can transform short-term memory into an even longer memory, and whether such memory is stored through more persistent action of PKM{zeta} in hippocampus. We trained rats to acquire OPR and 15 min or 5 h later induced a brief pattern of electrical stimulation in basolateral amygdala (BLA). Our results reveal that a short-term memory lasting < 4 h can be converted into remote memory lasting at least 3 weeks if the BLA is activated 15 min, but not 5 h after learning. To examine how this remote memory is maintained, we injected ZIP, an inhibitor of atypical PKCs (aPKCs), PKM{zeta} and PKC{iota}/{lambda}, into either hippocampal CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), or anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Our data reveal amygdala stimulation produces consolidation into remote memory, not by persistent aPKC activation and capture by synaptic tagging processes in the hippocampal formation, but in ACC. Our data establish a powerful modulating role of the BLA in forming remote memory and open a path in the search for neurological restoration of memory, based on enhancing synaptic plasticity in aging or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

">GABAergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus regulate social hierarchy in mice</a></h4>

              
                Social hierarchy serves as a fundamental organizational mechanism within most animal societies, exerting significant influence on health, survival, and reproductive success in both humans and animals. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain regulates dominance hierarchies remain inadequately understood. Considering that GABAergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) exert substantial inhibitory control over serotonergic firing, which may be implicated in the acquisition of dominance, we hypothesized that DRN GABAergic neurons may play a pivotal role in regulating social hierarchy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, fiber photometry recordings, and behavioral assays in mice, to elucidate the functional contributions of these neurons. Our results revealed a biphasic activity pattern of DRN GABAergic neurons, characterized by increased firing during retreats and decreased firing during push-initiation in the tube test. Furthermore, the optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of DRN GABAergic neurons led to an increase in the number of retreats and a reduction in social rank, while inhibition of these neurons produced the opposite effects. These findings elucidate the bidirectional regulatory role of DRN GABAergic neurons in social hierarchies.

                Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to classify Alzheimer's disease or infer dementia severity from 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans. Here, we examine the value of adding occlusion sensitivity analysis (OSA) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to these models to make the results more interpretable. Much research in this area focuses on specific datasets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) or National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), which assess people of North American, predominantly European ancestry, so we examine how well models trained on these data generalize to a new population dataset from India (NIMHANS cohort). We also evaluate the benefit of using a combined dataset to train the CNN models. Our experiments show feature localization consistent with knowledge of AD from other methods. OSA and Grad-CAM resolve features at different scales to help interpret diagnostic inferences made by CNNs.

">Sex-specific maladaptive responses to acute stress upon in utero THC exposure are mediated by dopamine</a></h4>

              
                Cannabis remains by far the most consumed illicit drug in Europe. The availability of more potent cannabis has raised concerns regarding the enhanced health risks associated with its use, particularly among pregnant women. Growing evidence shows that cannabis use during pregnancy increases the risks of child psychopathology. We have previously shown that male rat offspring prenatally exposed to delta9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a rat model of prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), display a hyperdopaminergic phenotype associated with a differential susceptibility to acute THC- and stress-mediated effects on sensorimotor gating functions. Here, we explore the contribution of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, key regulator of body adaptive stress responses, to the detrimental effects of acute stress on ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons and sensorimotor gating function of PCE rats. We report a sex-dependent compromised balance in mRNA levels of genes encoding mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in the VTA, alongside with stress-induced prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits. Notably, VTA dopamine neuronal activity is required for the manifestation of stress-dependent deterioration of PPI. Finally, pharmacological manipulations targeting glycogen-synthase-kinase-3-beta signaling during postnatal development correct these stress-induced, sex-specific and dopamine-dependent deficits of PPI. Collectively, these results highlight the critical sex-dependent interplay between HPA axis and dopamine system in the regulation of sensorimotor gating functions in rats.

">Neuroimaging model of visceral manipulation in awake rat</a></h4>

              
                Reciprocal neuronal connections exist between the internal organs of the body and the nervous system. These projections to and from the viscera play an essential role in maintaining and finetuning organ responses in order to sustain homeostasis and allostasis. Functional maps of brain regions participating in this bidirectional communication have been previously studied in awake humans and anesthetized rodents. To further refine the mechanistic understanding of visceral influence on brain states, however, new paradigms that allow for more invasive, and ultimately more informative, measurements and perturbations must be explored. Further, such paradigms should prioritize human translatability. In the current paper, we address these issues by demonstrating the feasibility of non-anesthetized animal imaging during visceral manipulation. More specifically, we used a barostat interfaced with an implanted gastric balloon to cyclically induce distension of a non-anesthetized rat's stomach during simultaneous BOLD fMRI. General linear modeling and spatial independent component analysis revealed several regions with BOLD activation temporally coincident with the gastric distension stimulus. The ON-OFF (20 mmHg - 0 mmHg) barostat-balloon pressure cycle resulted in widespread BOLD activation of the inferior colliculus, cerebellum, ventral midbrain, and a variety of hippocampal structures. These results suggest that neuroimaging models of gastric manipulation in the non-anesthetized rat are achievable and provide an avenue for more comprehensive studies involving the integration of other neuroscience techniques like electrophysiology.

                Synchronizing motoric responses to metrical sensory rhythms is key to social activities, e.g., group singing and dancing. It remains elusive, however, whether there is a common neural network for motoric synchronization to metrical rhythms from different sensory modalities. Here, we separate sensorimotor responses from basic sensory responses by combining a metrical sensorimotor synchronization task with frequency-domain magnetoencephalography (MEG) analysis. A common frontal-temporal network, not including visual cortex, is observed during both visual- and auditory-motor synchronization, and the network remains in congenitally deaf participants during visual-motor synchronization, suggesting the network is formed by intrinsic cortical connections instead of auditory experience. Furthermore, activation of the left and right frontal-temporal areas, as well as the ipsilateral white matter connection, separately predict the precision of auditory and visual synchronization. These results reveal a common but lateralized frontal-temporal network for visual- and auditory-motor synchronization, which is generated based on intrinsic cortical connections.

">A dopaminergic basis of behavioral control</a></h4>

              
                Both goal-directed and automatic processes shape human behavior. These processes often conflict, and behavioral control is the decision about which determines behavior. Behavioral control, or deciding how to decide, is critical for adaptive behavior. However, the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral control remain unclear. We performed deep phenotyping of individual dopamine system function by combining PET measures of dopamine physiology, functional MRI, and administration of dopaminergic drugs in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects performed a rule-based response time task in which we operationalized goal-directed and automatic decision-making as model-based and model-free contributions to behavior, respectively. We found convergent and causal evidence that dopamine D2/3 receptors in the striatum regulate behavioral control by enhancing model-based and blunting model-free influences on behavior. In contrast, we found a double dissociation whereby presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum was linked to acquiring model-based knowledge but not behavioral control. Neuroimaging analysis suggested that striatal D2/3 receptors influence behavioral control by adjusting frontostriatal functional connectivity. This multimodal study establishes a specific role of D2/3 receptors in regulating behavioral control and could contribute to an improved understanding of dysregulated behavioral control in clinical disorders affecting dopamine neurotransmission.

">Realistic mossy fiber input patterns to unipolar brush cells evoke a continuum of temporal responses comprised of components mediated by different glutamate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex that receive mossy fiber (MF) inputs and excite granule cells. The UBC population responds to brief burst activation of MFs with a continuum of temporal transformations, but it is not known how UBCs transform the diverse range of MF input patterns that occur in vivo. Here we use cell-attached recordings from UBCs in acute cerebellar slices to examine responses to MF firing patterns that are based on in vivo recordings. We find that MFs evoke a continuum of responses in the UBC population, mediated by three different types of glutamate receptors that each convey a specialized component. AMPARs transmit timing information for single stimuli at up to 5 spikes/s, and for very brief bursts. A combination of mGluR2/3s (inhibitory) and mGluR1s (excitatory) mediates a continuum of delayed, and broadened responses to longer bursts, and to sustained high frequency activation. Variability in the mGluR2/3 component controls the time course of the onset of firing, and variability in the mGluR1 component controls the duration of prolonged firing. We conclude that the combination of glutamate receptor types allows each UBC to simultaneously convey different aspects of MF firing. These findings establish that UBCs are highly flexible circuit elements that provide diverse temporal transformations that are well suited to contribute to specialized processing in different regions of the cerebellar cortex.

">Representational shifts from feedforward to feedback rhythms index phenomenological integration in natural vision</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain integrate complex and dynamic visual inputs into phenomenologically seamless percepts? Previous results demonstrate that when visual inputs are organized coherently across space and time, they are more strongly encoded in feedback-related alpha rhythms, and less strongly in feedforward-related gamma rhythms. Here, we tested whether this representational shift from feedforward to feedback rhythms is linked to the phenomenological experience of coherence. In an EEG study, we manipulated the degree of spatiotemporal coherence by presenting two segments from the same video across visual hemifields, either synchronously or asynchronously (with a delay between segments). We asked participants whether they perceived the stimulus as coherent or incoherent. When stimuli were presented at the perceptual threshold (i.e., when the same stimulus was judged as coherent 50% of times), perception co-varied with stimulus coding across alpha and gamma rhythms: When stimuli were perceived as coherent, they were represented in alpha activity; when stimuli were perceived as incoherent, they were represented in gamma activity. Whether the same visual input is perceived as coherent or incoherent thus depends on representational shifts between feedback-related alpha and feedforward-related gamma rhythms.

">Sparsity of population activity in the hippocampus is task-invariant across the tri-synaptic circuit and dorsal-ventral axis</a></h4>

              
                Evidence from neurophysiological and genetic studies demonstrates that activity sparsity, the proportion of neurons that are active at a given time in a population, systematically varies across the canonical trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus. Recent work has also shown that sparsity varies across the hippocampal dorsoventral (long) axis, wherein activity is sparser in ventral than dorsal regions. While the hippocampus has a critical role in long term memory (LTM), whether sparsity across the trisynaptic circuit and hippocampal long axis is task dependent or invariant remains unknown. Importantly, representational sparsity has significant implications for neural computation and theoretical models of learning and memory within and beyond the hippocampus. Here we used functional molecular imaging to quantify sparsity in the rat hippocampus during performance of the Morris water task (MWT) and contextual fear discrimination (CFD); two popular and distinct assays of LTM. We found that activity sparsity is highly reliable across memory tasks, wherein activity increases sequentially across the trisynaptic circuit (DG < CA3 < CA1) and decreases across the long axis (ventral < dorsal). These results have important implications for models of hippocampal function and suggest that activity sparsity is a preserved property in the hippocampal system across cognitive settings.

">Variations in human trigeminal and facial nerve branches and foramina identified by dissection and microcomputed tomography</a></h4>

              
                The aim of this study was to identify branches of the trigeminal and facial nerves relevant to surgical incisions and injections and the scalp block techniques in the frontotemporal region, and to determine their relationships with superficial vascular structures and bony landmarks. Half-heads from consenting embalmed donors (6 male, 2 female, mean age at death 78.4 years) were used in this study. Detailed dissection was carried out to identify the position of the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN) relative to the superior temporal artery (STA) and the facial nerve (FN) in six subjects (5 male, 1 female). The results provide a minimum safe distance of 5 mm between the STA and the frontotemporal branches of the FN at the level of the low edge of zygoma and 8mm between the low edge of zygoma and the FN trunk, providing a pre-auricular triangle of safety for incisions and injections. Variability between subjects was up to 60%. Microcomputed tomography (microCT) scans were taken from all eight subjects and the three-dimensional reconstructions were used to identify the supraorbital notch (SON), the zygomaticotemporal foramen (ZTF) and the zygomaticofacial foramen (ZFF). The volume and relative locations of these foramina were calculated for 5-8 subjects. The closest distance between ZTF and the FZS ranged from 9 to 21mm (26% variation); 3 subjects had a single ZTF while 5 subjects had two ZTF. The angle at the centre of the orbit between ZFF and the FZS ranged from 156 to 166 degrees (2.5% variation). These findings demonstrate that both traditional cadaveric dissection methods as well as contemporary microCT methods can be used to investigate the relative locations of nerves or their foramina in the human head. The findings provide anatomical considerations for fronto-temporal incisions and local anaesthesia.

">Predictive filtering of sensory response via orbitofrontal top-down input</a></h4>

              
                Habituation is a crucial sensory filtering mechanism whose dysregulation can lead to a continuously intense world in disorders with sensory overload. While habituation is considered to require top-down predictive signaling to suppress irrelevant inputs, the exact brain loci storing the internal predictive model and the circuit mechanisms of sensory filtering remain unclear. We found that daily neural habituation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) was reversed by inactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Top-down projections from the ventrolateral OFC, but not other frontal areas, carried predictive signals that grew with daily sound experience and suppressed A1 via somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons. Thus, prediction signals from the OFC cancel out behaviorally irrelevant anticipated stimuli by generating their "negative images" in sensory cortices.

">The tilt illusion arises from an efficient reallocation of neural coding resources at the contextual boundary</a></h4>

              
                The tilt illusion - a bias in the perceived orientation of a center stimulus induced by an oriented surround - illustrates how context shapes visual perception. While the tilt illusion has been the subject of quantitative study for over 85 years, we still lack a comprehensive account of the phenomenon that connects its neural and behavioral characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that the tilt illusion originates from a dynamic change in neural coding precision induced by the surround context. We simultaneously obtained psychophysical and fMRI responses from human subjects while they viewed gratings in the absence and presence of an oriented surround, and extracted sensory encoding precision from their behavioral and neural data. Both measures show that in the absence of a surround, encoding reflects the natural scene statistics of orientation. However, in the presence of an oriented surround, encoding precision is significantly increased for stimuli similar to the surround orientation. This local change in encoding is sufficient to accurately predict the behavioral characteristics of the tilt illusion using a Bayesian observer model. The effect of surround modulation increases along the ventral stream, and is localized to the portion of the visual cortex with receptive fields at the center-surround boundary. The pattern of change in coding accuracy reflects the surround-conditioned orientation statistics in natural scenes, but cannot be explained by local stimulus configuration. Our results suggest that the tilt illusion naturally emerges from a dynamic coding strategy that efficiently reallocates neural coding resources based on the current stimulus context.

">Brain-wide microstrokes affect the stability of memory circuits in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive deficits affect over 70% of stroke survivors, yet the mechanisms by which multiple small ischemic events contribute to cognitive decline remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed chronic two-photon calcium imaging to longitudinally track the fate of individual neurons in the hippocampus of mice navigating a virtual reality environment, both before and after inducing brain-wide microstrokes. Our findings reveal that, under normal conditions, hippocampal neurons exhibit varying degrees of stability in their spatial memory coding. However, microstrokes disrupted this functional network architecture, leading to cognitive impairments. Notably, the preservation of stable coding place cells, along with the stability, precision, and persistence of the hippocampal network, was strongly predictive of cognitive outcomes. Mice with more synchronously active place cells near important locations demonstrated recovery from cognitive impairment. This study uncovers critical cellular responses and network alterations following brain injury, providing a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies preventing cognitive decline.

">Feasibility of laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping</a></h4>

              
                Layer fMRI is an increasingly utilized technique that provides insights into the laminar organization of brain activity. However, both blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and vascular space occupancy data (VASO) have certain limitations, such as bias towards larger cortical veins in BOLD fMRI and high specific absorption rate in VASO. This study aims to explore the feasibility of whole-brain laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping (fQSM) compared to laminar BOLD fMRI and VASO at ultra-high field. Data were acquired using 3D EPI techniques. Complex data were denoised with NORDIC and susceptibility maps were computed using 3D path-based unwrapping, the variable-kernel sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction as well as the streaking artifact reduction for QSM algorithms. To assess layer-specific activation, twenty layers were segmented in the somatosensory and motor cortices, obtained from a finger tapping paradigm, and further averaged into six anatomical cortical layers. The magnitude of signal change and z-scores were compared across layers for each technique. fQSM showed the largest activation-dependent mean susceptibility decrease in Layers II/III in M1 and Layers I/ II in S1 with up to -1.3 ppb while BOLD fMRI showed the strongest mean signal increase in Layer I. Our data suggest that fQSM demonstrates less bias towards activation in superficial layers compared to BOLD fMRI. Moreover, activation-based susceptibility change was comparable to VASO data. Studying whole-brain, layer-dependent activation with submillimeter fQSM is feasible, and reduces bias towards venous drainage effects on the cortical surface compared to BOLD fMRI, thereby enabling better localization of laminar activation.

">A neural model for V1 that incorporates dendritic nonlinearities and back-propagating action potentials</a></h4>

              
                The groundbreaking work of Hubel and Wiesel has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of V1, leading to modeling neural responses as cascades of linear and nonlinear processes in what has come to be known as the ``standard model'' of vision. Under this formulation, however, some dendritic properties cannot be represented in a practical manner, while extensive evidence indicates that dendritic processes are an indispensable element of key neural behaviours. As a result, current V1 models fail to explain neural responses in a number of scenarios. In this work, we propose an implicit model for V1 that considers nonlinear dendritic integration and backpropagation of action potentials from the soma to the dendrites. This is a parsimonious scheme that minimizes an energy, allows for a better conceptual understanding of neural processes, and explains several neurophysiological phenomena that have challenged classical approaches.

">Functional consequences of fast-spiking interneurons in striatum</a></h4>

              
                The striatum features a distinct network characterized by a high degree of shared feedforward inhibition (FFI) from a mere 1% of fast-spiking interneurons (FSI). We investigate the potential roles of this extensively shared FFI in striatal function beyond inducing synchrony. Our findings reveal that FSIs increase the across-trial variability of striatal responses to cortical stimuli and, combined with recurrent inhibition, lead to a 'correlation attractor' of striatal activities, i.e., weakly correlated inputs result in more correlated responses and vice versa. Thus, we uncover a mechanism by which input correlation can be bidirectionally modulated, which is possible only because of high sharing of FSI inputs. We posit that the emergence of a correlation attractor leads to non-zero correlation level and variable rate trajectories of striatal responses across trials, hence beneficial for exploration in learning. However, given their role in across-trial variability, we argue that FSIs should be 'disengaged' from the MSNs during performance where stability across trials is required.

">The Pattern and Staging of Brain Atrophy in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2): MRI Volumetrics from ENIGMA-Ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease characterised by progressive deterioration in both motor coordination and cognitive function. Atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord are core features of SCA2, however the evolution and pattern of whole-brain atrophy in SCA2 remain unclear. We undertook a multi-site, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study to comprehensively characterize the neurodegeneration profile of SCA2. Methods: Voxel-based morphometry analyses of 110 participants with SCA2 and 128 controls were undertaken to assess groupwise differences in whole-brain volume. Correlations with clinical severity and genotype, and cross-sectional profiling of atrophy patterns at different disease stages, were also performed. Results: Atrophy in SCA2 relative to controls was greatest (Cohen's d>2.5) in the cerebellar white matter (WM), middle cerebellar peduncle, pons, and corticospinal tract. Very large effects (d>1.5) were also evident in the superior cerebellar, inferior cerebellar, and cerebral peduncles. In cerebellar grey matter (GM), large effects (d>0.8) mapped to areas related to both motor coordination and cognitive tasks. Strong correlations (|r|>0.4) between volume and disease severity largely mirrored these groupwise outcomes. Stratification by disease severity showed a degeneration pattern beginning in cerebellar and pontine WM in pre-clinical subjects; spreading to the cerebellar GM and cerebro-cerebellar/corticospinal WM tracts; then finally involving the thalamus, striatum, and cortex in severe stages. Interpretation: The magnitude and pattern of brain atrophy evolves over the course of SCA2, with widespread, non-uniform involvement across the brainstem, cerebellar tracts, and cerebellar cortex; and late involvement of the cerebral cortex and striatum.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Given the importance of emotion recognition for communication purposes, and the impairment for such skill in CI users despite impressive language performances, the aim of the present study was to investigate the neural correlates of emotion recognition skills, apart from language, in adult unilateral CI (UCI) users during a music in noise (happy/sad) recognition task. Furthermore, asymmetry was investigated through electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythm, given the traditional concept of hemispheric lateralization for emotional processing, and the intrinsic asymmetry due to the clinical UCI condition. Methods: Twenty adult UCI users and eight normal hearing (NH) controls were recruited. EEG gamma and alpha band power was assessed as there is evidence of a relationship between gamma and emotional response and between alpha asymmetry and tendency to approach or withdraw from stimuli. The TAS-20 questionnaire (alexithymia) was completed by the participants. Results: The results showed no effect of background noise, while supporting that gamma activity related to emotion processing shows alterations in the UCI group compared to the NH group, and that these alterations are also modulated by the etiology of deafness. In particular, relative higher gamma activity in the CI side corresponds to positive processes, correlated with higher emotion recognition abilities, whereas gamma activity in the non-CI side may be related to positive processes inversely correlated with alexithymia and also inversely correlated with age; a correlation between TAS-20 scores and age was found only in the NH group. Conclusions: EEG gamma activity appears to be fundamental to the processing of the emotional aspect of music and also to the psychocognitive emotion-related component in adults with CI.</p>

	<p>Background: This report aims to supplement the existing knowledge on the inferior oblique muscle. In particular, this study presents detailed anatomical and histological data concerning the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s entry point (or entry zone) of the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle. Particular attention was paid to the topographical relationships of the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle (NTIO), including the location of its entry point to the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly and its anatomical variations. Methods: Sixty orbits from cadaveric hemi-heads fixed in 10% formalin were studied. The course of the NTIO was traced along the lateral border of the inferior rectus muscle as far as its entry point to the inferior oblique muscle. Particular attention was paid to the various ways in which the NTIO&amp;amp;rsquo;s muscular sub-branches penetrated between the fibers of the inferior oblique muscle. Results: Three types of NTIO entries to the inferior oblique muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly were distinguished. In the most common type (48.3%), the nerve entered the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s inferior (orbital) surface. In the next most common type (36.7%), terminal muscular sub-branches of the NTIO joined the superior (also referred to as ocular or global) surface of the inferior oblique muscle. In the remaining four cases (15%), the terminal sub-branches of the NTIO were divided into two main groups (superior and inferior) that joined both the superior and inferior surfaces of the muscle. Histological examination confirmed that the distal part of the NTIO shows a characteristic arcuate course (angulation) just before reaching the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly. The process for splitting and forming separate muscular sub-branches of the NTIO was observed for all the examined histological specimens at the level of the nerve&amp;amp;rsquo;s angulation. Conclusions: The presented findings enhance the understanding of the anatomical variations and precise distribution of motor sub-branches reaching the inferior oblique muscle, which may deepen anatomical knowledge and potentially enhance the management of ocular motor disorders.</p>

	<p>Need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) confers an increased risk of hearing loss in the newborn and of later neurodevelopmental impairment. In this retrospective longitudinal case-controlled study, we assess how the degree of prematurity, measured via gestational age, birth weight, and z-scores, in 138 infants admitted to the NICU are associated with permanent childhood hearing loss (PCHI) and 2-year developmental outcomes. Logistic regression analyses, Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis analysis of variance, and Chi-squared tests were used. Independent of prematurity, PCHI and NICU admission were predictive of poor developmental outcomes. Twenty-one (47%) children with PCHI had a moderate-to-severe developmental delay, compared to three (7%) matched controls. Days in the NICU but not z-scores predicted PCHI. Z-score was not prognostic of moderate or severe developmental impairment in children with PCHI. The odds ratio of moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment with PCHI was high, at 12.48 [95% CI = 3.37&amp;amp;ndash;46.40]. Children with PCHI were significantly more likely to have cerebral palsy than their matched counterparts (30% vs. 2%). These findings challenge the conventional focus on gestational age and birth weight on neurodevelopmental outcomes for children with PCHI and NICU admission. A more nuanced approach to monitoring and intervention is needed.</p>

                <p>Contemporary research has begun to show a strong relationship between movements and the perception of time. More specifically, concurrent movements serve to both bias and enhance time estimates. To explain these effects, we recently proposed a mechanism by which movements provide a secondary channel for estimating duration that is combined optimally with sensory estimates. However, a critical test of this framework is that by introducing "noise" into movements, sensory estimates of time should similarly become noisier. To accomplish this, we had human participants move a robotic arm while estimating intervals of time in either auditory or visual modalities (<I>n</I> = 24, ea.). Crucially, we introduced an artificial "tremor" in the arm while subjects were moving, that varied across three levels of amplitude (1&ndash;3 N) or frequency (4&ndash;12 Hz). The results of both experiments revealed that increasing the frequency of the tremor led to noisier estimates of duration. Further, the effect of noise varied with the base precision of the interval, such that a naturally less precise timing (i.e., visual) was more influenced by the tremor than a naturally more precise modality (i.e., auditory). To explain these findings, we fit the data with a recently developed drift-diffusion model of perceptual decision-making, in which the momentary, within-trial variance was allowed to vary across conditions. Here, we found that the model could recapitulate the observed findings, further supporting the theory that movements influence perception directly. Overall, our findings support the proposed framework, and demonstrate the utility of inducing motor noise via artificial tremors.</p>

                Background - The new increasing homeless lately consist of women, children, youth, the elderly and marginalized ethnic or migrant groups. Some of them are working and earn salaries, however, the income is not sufficient to live modestly. Purpose – The purpose of this research is to establish a desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness in the country. Design/methodology/approach – This is an exploratory descriptive method study which employed quantitative techniques.  The study employed a social ecological model to investigate behavior of homeless via multiple levels of influences including intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and public policy. Surveys have been conducted on sixty-five homeless individuals.  Findings – It was found that support systems and structures should be derived from the whole streams from families, communities, organizations and government. Employment opportunities, long-term shelters within the community places and highly demanded skills are needed to improve their living condition. Research limitations – This study is only focused on the socio-economic structures of the homeless in a capital city. Originality/value – This is an empirical research using a social ecological model for the homeless in the Kuala Lumpur area. Research on homeless study has received little attention and has yet to be fully explored.

                Background We evaluated if the course of recovery from sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) can be predicted using variables collected at admission. Methods A total of 63 patients admitted for sepsis-induced AKI in our Mangalore ICU were evaluated and baseline demographic and clinical/laboratory parameters, including serum creatinine (SCr), base excess (BE), Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI), Caval Index, R wave variability index (RVI), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal resistivity index (RI) using renal doppler and need for inotropes were assessed on admission. Patients were managed as per standard protocol. After six hours of fluid resuscitation, patients were classified as volume responders or non-responders. Re-assessment was done at 24 hours and 72 hours after admission. Primary outcome was persistent AKI after 72 hours. Secondary outcome was initiation of dialysis or death within 15 days of admission. Results A total of 34 subjects recovered from AKI, of whom 32 patients were volume responders and 31 were non-responders. Response to fluid, MAP at admission and six hours, BE at admission, inotrope requirement, and PVI at admission did not correlate with recovery. Multiple logistic regression showed that SCr < 2.36 mg%, RVI > 14.45 and RI < 0.8 on admission correlated with recovery and they were evaluated further to model AKI recovery and develop PASS. PASS score = (SCr points × 5.4) + (RVI points × 4.0) + (RI points × 6.2). One point each was allotted if SCr was < 2.36, RVI was > 14.45 and RI was <0.8, and 0 otherwise. A score > 7.8 predicted recovery with a sensitivity of 79.4%, specificity of 72.4%, PPV 81.8%, NPV 76.7% and AuROC of 0.85. Conclusions The PASS score can be used to identify salvageable cases of sepsis-AKI, guiding fluid resuscitation and aiding early referral from rural to tertiary care centers for better management.

                Background Patient-related factors and limited medication adherence in patients with chronic diseases, are associated with poor clinical outcomes, long-term complications, and increased overall disease costs. Many methods have been tested with mixed results, and innovative approaches are needed to encourage patients to adhere to their prescribed drug regimens. Methods This randomised controlled trial examined a new multifactorial pharmacist-led intervention protocol (MPIP), including a medication therapy management (MTM) program with face-to-face counselling, patient-specific medication booklets, and a mobile application, from July 2021 to September 2022 in the Oud Al Touba diagnostic and screening ambulatory centre in 192 patients with type 2 diabetes in the United Arab Emirates. Medication adherence was assessed using the fixed medication possession ratio of medication refills and the medication adherence questionnaire. Results At 12 months follow-up, participants in the MPIP showed significant improvement in overall medication adherence with total (composite) medication possession ratio (MPRt) of mean (±SD) 0.95 (±0.09) compared to 0.92 (± 0.09) in the control group with mean difference of 0.03 (95%, CI 0.01–0.06), P =0.02. In addition, improvement trend was evident in the MPIP group for all medication regimens with P value <0.01. Comparable results were noticeable in adherence questionnaire scores at the end of the study, with 66 participants in the intervention group scored zero on the questionnaire, suggesting high adherence to medication compared to the control group (48 participants only). The MTM program performed 41 clinical interventions on drug-related problems, compared to six interventions in the control group, and the use of mobile application and medication booklet have increased to 45.7% compared to 21.4% before study exit. Conclusions The pharmacy intervention protocol effectively improved medication adherence and optimised medication regimens in diabetic patients with chronic medication regimens in an ambulatory healthcare centre.

                Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, apathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Method A systematic search was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework with studies published on leisure-based intervention from January 1990 to December 2023. Results The review included 11 articles in the study. In total two studies were pilot interventional study, one randomized controlled study, one case-control, one retrospective study, three were cross sectional, one was cross sectional longitudinal study and two were qualitative in nature. Studies used different types of leisure activities like cooking group, discussions, board games, arts and craft, painting, beading, sewing, clay work, paper craft, etc were used as an intervention. Qualitative studies found that individuals with schizophrenia spent less time in social and leisure activities and more time relaxing and doing nothing. Conclusion The study highlights the need to conduct further research on leisure-based interventions using various study designs like randomized controlled trials and mixed methods to understand its effectiveness among individuals with schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1605/v4?src=rss">Effects of a low, medium, and high-intensity aquatic physiotherapy protocol on functional and biochemical parameters in individuals with knee osteoarthritis: protocol for a crossover randomized controlled trial [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 appro</a></h4>

              
                Background Knee osteoarthritis affects the performance of daily activities, independence, and quality of life. The etiopathogenesis of this condition considers the mechanisms of activation of metalloproteinase and reactive oxygen species production pathways. Metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) may be responsible for cartilage destruction. Aquatic physiotherapy promotes a positive impact on the clinical picture of osteoarthritis, and this study presents an intervention protocol that aims to evaluate the effects of a single session of different aquatic physiotherapy modalities on the biochemical and functional behavior of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods This will be a crossover randomized controlled trial in which 15 individuals will be submitted to three aquatic physiotherapy modalities with a minimum 15-day wash-out period in patients over 50 years old and diagnosed with OA in at least one knee, presence of pain and at least one functional dysfunction for at least 6 months, absence of physical limitation that prevents the exercise protocol from being performed, Kellgren and Lawrence ranking between I and IV, walk independently and without auxiliary device. Variations in the concentrations of MMP-3 and GPx in peripheral blood, pain, edema, and flexibility resulting from the three aquatic physiotherapeutic interventions will be evaluated both pre- and immediate post-intervention.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                Future viability depends on ensuring a sustainable society because green energy methods may efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, stakeholders, consumers, and developers continue to be notably ignorant of the financial incentives connected to green technology. Moreover, there is still a dearth of studies on the range of financial incentives offered by different authorities in India. Monetary incentives, such as tax breaks, indirect tax exemptions, and refunds, are crucial in encouraging the use of green technology in the modern world. This study explores the importance of financial incentives for green building technologies in India, which also looks at the wide range of incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. Furthermore, the study highlights various state government programs such as goods subsidies, exemptions from local taxes, and fee waivers. Notably, several incentives aimed at consumers, developers, and other stakeholders have been implemented by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). This review study emphasizes the effectiveness of financial incentives in green construction projects and draws attention to a clear knowledge gap regarding the adoption of green technology. This study also provides insights into potential future directions. Studies and research results emphasize the importance of spreading the word about financial incentives as a key factor in determining the adoption of green technologies. Many parties, including governmental organizations, municipal governments, developers, and clients engaged in green building technology projects, stand to gain increased awareness.

An exploration using a novel, value-based, publication metric framework: the EMPIRE Index [version 4; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index is a value-based, multi-component metric framework to assess the impact of medical publications in terms of relevance to different stakeholders. It comprises three component scores (social, scholarly and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics that indicate a different aspect of engagement with the publication. Here, we present an exploratory investigation of whether publication types or disease indications influence EMPIRE Index scores. Methods Article-level metrics were extracted and EMPIRE Index scores were calculated for 5825 journal articles published from 1 May 2017 to 1 May 2018, representing 12 disease indications (chosen to reflect a wide variety of common and rare diseases with a variety of aetiologies) and five publication types. Results There were significant differences in scores between article types and disease indications. Median (95% CI) social and scholarly impact scores ranged from 1.2 (0.3–1.6) to 4.8 (3.1–6.6), respectively, for phase 3 clinical trials, and from 0.3 (0.3–0.4) to 2.3 (1.9–2.6), respectively, for observational studies. Social and scholarly impact scores were highest for multiple sclerosis publications and lowest for non-small cell lung cancer publications. Systematic reviews achieved greater impact than regular reviews. Median trends in the social impact of different disease areas matched the level of public interest as assessed through Google search interest. Although most articles did not register societal impact, mean societal impact scores were highest for migraine publications. Conclusions The EMPIRE Index successfully identified differences in impact by disease area and publication type, which supports the notion that the impact of each publication needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors, and potentially others. These findings should be considered when using the EMPIRE Index to assess publication impact.

                <p>by Anibal S. Amaral, Damien P. Devos</p>

An often-overlooked aspect of biology is formed by the outliers of the protein length distribution, specifically those proteins with more than 5000 amino acids, which we refer to as huge proteins (HPs). By examining UniprotKB, we discovered more than 41 000 HPs throughout the tree of life, with the majority found in eukaryotes. Notably, the phyla with the highest propensity for huge proteins are Apicomplexa and Fornicata. Moreover, we observed that certain bacteria, such as Elusomicrobia or Planctomycetota, have a higher tendency for encoding huge proteins, even more than the average eukaryote. To investigate if these macro-polypeptides represent “real” proteins, we explored several indirect metrics. Additionally, orthology analyses reveals thousands of clusters of homologous sequences of HPs, revealing functional groups related to key cellular processes such as cytoskeleton organization and functioning as chaperones or as E3-ubiquitin ligases in eukaryotes. In the case of bacteria, the major clusters have functions related to Non-Ribosomomal peptide synthesis/Polyketide synthesis, followed by pathogen-host attachment or recognition surface proteins. Further exploration of the annotations for each HPs supported the previously identified functional groups. These findings underscore the need for further investigation of the cellular and ecological roles of these HPs and their potential impact on biology and biotechnology.

In addition to the classical HLA genes, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) harbors a high number of other polymorphic genes with less established roles in disease associations and transplantation matching. To facilitate studies of the non-classical and non-HLA genes in large patient and biobank cohorts, we trained imputation models for <i>MICA</i>, <i>MICB</i>, <i>HLA-E</i>, <i>HLA-F</i> and <i>HLA-G</i> alleles on genome SNP array data. We show, using both population-specific and multi-population 1000 Genomes references, that the alleles of these genes can be accurately imputed for screening and research purposes. The best imputation model for <i>MICA</i>, <i>MICB</i>, <i>HLA-E</i>, <i>-F</i> and <i>-G</i> achieved a mean accuracy of 99.3% (min, max: 98.6, 99.9). Furthermore, validation of the 1000 Genomes exome short-read sequencing-based allele calling against a clinical-grade reference data showed an average accuracy of 99.8%, testifying for the quality of the 1000 Genomes data as an imputation reference. We also fitted the models for Infinium Global Screening Array (GSA, Illumina, Inc.) and Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array (PMRA, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) SNP content, with mean accuracies of 99.1% (97.2, 100) and 98.9% (97.4, 100), respectively.

Dengue virus (DENV) is currently causing epidemics of unprecedented scope in endemic settings and expanding to new geographical areas. It is therefore critical to track this virus using genomic surveillance. However, the complex patterns of viral genomic diversity make it challenging to use the existing genotype classification system. Here, we propose adding 2 sub-genotypic levels of virus classification, named major and minor lineages. These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national, and subnational discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance. Information about our lineage system, including methods to assign lineages to sequence data and propose new lineages, can be found at: dengue-lineages.org.

Ancient divergences within Opisthokonta—a major lineage that includes organisms in the kingdoms Animalia, Fungi, and their unicellular relatives—remain contentious. To assess progress toward a genome-scale Opisthokonta phylogeny, we conducted the most taxon rich phylogenomic analysis using sets of genes inferred with different orthology inference methods and established the geological timeline of Opisthokonta diversification. We also conducted sensitivity analysis by subsampling genes or taxa from the full data matrix based on filtering criteria previously shown to improve phylogenomic inference. We found that approximately 85% of internal branches were congruent across data matrices and the approaches used. Notably, the use of different orthology inference methods was a substantial contributor to the observed incongruence: analyses using the same set of orthologs showed high congruence of 97% to 98%, whereas different sets of orthologs resulted in somewhat lower congruence (87% to 91%). Examination of unicellular Holozoa relationships suggests that the instability observed across varying gene sets may stem from weak phylogenetic signals. Our results provide a comprehensive Opisthokonta phylogenomic framework that will be useful for illuminating ancient evolutionary episodes concerning the origin and diversification of the 2 major eukaryotic kingdoms and emphasize the importance of investigating effects of orthology inference on phylogenetic analyses to resolve ancient divergences.

<p>Schematic of glymphatic system and hypothetical influence factors in MMD. CSF crosses the perivascular space from arteries entering the interstitium and drives metabolic waste toward perivenous spaces. Advanced Suzuki stage, abnormal anastomoses, and decreased CBF in MMD would alter para-arterial CSF flow. Enlarged perivascular space (EPVS) and deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensities (DSWMH) are markers of neuronal dysfunction, small vessel damage, and blocked glymphatic system circulation. These factors are associated with DTI-ALPS in MMD. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; DTI-ALPS, diffusion tensor imaging analysis along perivascular spaces; ISF, interstitial fluid; MMD, moyamoya disease.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Assessing the glymphatic system activity using diffusion tensor imaging analysis along with the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) may be helpful to understand the pathophysiology of moyamoya disease (MMD). 63 adult patients with MMD and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were included for T1-weighted images, T2-FLAIR, pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling, and DTI. 60 patients had digital subtraction angiography more than 6 months after combined revascularization. The Suzuki stage, postoperative Matsushima grade, periventricular anastomoses (PA), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensities (DSWMH), DTI-ALPS, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cognitive scales of MMD patients were assessed. MMD patients were divided into early and advanced stage based on the Suzuki stage. We detected lower DTI-ALPS in patients with advanced stage relative to HCs (<i>p</i> = 0.046) and patients with early stage (<i>p</i> = 0.004), hemorrhagic MMD compared with ischemic MMD (<i>p</i> = 0.048), and PA Grade 2 compared with Grade 0 (<i>p</i> = 0.010). DTI-ALPS was correlated with the EPVS in basal ganglia (<i>r</i> = −0.686, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Suzuki stage (<i>r</i> = −0.465, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), DSWMH (<i>r</i> = −0.423, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and global CBF (<i>r</i> = 0.300, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and cognitive scores (<i>r</i> = 0.343, <i>p</i> = 0.018). The DTI-ALPS of patients with good postoperative collateral formation was higher compared to those with poor postoperative collateral formation (<i>p</i> = 0.038). In conclusion, the glymphatic system was impaired in advanced MMD patients and may affected cognitive function and postoperative neoangiogenesis.</p>

<br/>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The clinical continuum of AD spans from preclinical disease to subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages (mild, moderate, and severe). Neuropathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) into extracellular plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral vasculature, and by abnormally phosphorylated tau that accumulates intraneuronally forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Development of treatment approaches that prevent or even reduce the cognitive decline because of AD has been slow compared to other major causes of death. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to 2 different Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies. However, this breakthrough disease modifying approach only applies to a limited subset of patients in the AD continuum and there are stringent eligibility criteria. Furthermore, these approaches do not prevent progression of disease, because other AD-related pathologies, such as NFTs, are not directly targeted. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is to address lifestyle interventions that can help reduce the risk of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). It is estimated that addressing such modifiable risk factors could potentially delay up to 40% of AD/ADRD cases. In this review, we discuss some of the many modifiable risk factors that may be associated with prevention of AD/ADRD and/or increasing brain resilience, as well as other factors that may interact with these modifiable risk factors to influence AD/ADRD progression.

                <p>Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multi-faceted theoretical construct associated with stroke risk and outcomes. Knowing which SES measures best correlate with population stroke metrics would improve its accounting in observational research and inform interventions. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES) and other publicly available databases, we conducted an ecological study comparing correlations of different United States county-level SES, health care access and clinical risk factor measures with age-adjusted stroke prevalence. The prevalence of adults living below 150% of the federal poverty level most strongly correlated with stroke prevalence compared to other SES and non-SES measures (correlation coefficient = 0.908, <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.825; adjusted partial correlation coefficient: 0.589, <i>R</i>

                <p>Many antiseizure medications cause apoptotic cell death in developing brains. The newer antiseizure medication lacosamide is increasingly used in neonates and infants. Neurotoxicity of lacosamide and its combination with levetiracetam was studied in neonatal mice. Animals received single or repeat injections of saline, phenobarbital (75mg/kg), lacosamide (20–40mg/kg), levetiracetam (100mg/kg), lacosamide (40mg/kg) + levetiracetam (100mg/kg) and euthanized at 6 to 30 hours. Cells undergoing apoptosis were increased in the brains of phenobarbital-treated animals. Densities of apoptotic profiles following lacosamide and levetiracetam treatment did not differ from saline-treated controls. Findings suggest that lacosamide, levetiracetam and their combination do not cause apoptosis in developing mouse brains. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:812–818</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27016?af=R">Inflammation‐Triggered Enlargement of Choroid Plexus in Subacute COVID‐19 Patients with Neurological Symptoms</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether choroid plexus volumes in subacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with neurological symptoms could indicate inflammatory activation or barrier dysfunction and assess their association with clinical data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Choroid plexus volumes were measured in 28 subacute COVID-19 patients via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy patients (n = 25), asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 21). Associations with inflammatory serum markers (peak counts of leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6), an MRI-based marker of barrier dysfunction (CSF volume fraction [V-CSF]), and clinical parameters like olfactory performance and cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>COVID-19 patients showed significantly larger choroid plexus volumes than control groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.172). These volumes correlated significantly with peak leukocyte levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.621) and V-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.009, Spearman's rho = 0.534), but neither with CRP nor interleukin 6. No significant correlations were found with clinical parameters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with subacute COVID-19, choroid plexus volume is a marker of central nervous system inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the presence of neurologic symptoms. The absence of plexus enlargement in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy suggests a specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 effect. This study also documents an increase in choroid plexus volume for the first time as a parainfectious event. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:715–725</p>

<p>Multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation and considered an inborn error of metabolism. In recent years, we have diagnosed an increasing number of patients where, despite extensive investigation, no disease-causing mutations have been found. We therefore investigated a cohort of consecutive patients, with the objective to detect possible non-genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We searched the patient records and the registry of muscle biopsies, for patients with MADD, diagnosed within the past 10 years. The patient records were reviewed regarding symptoms, clinical findings, comorbidities, drugs, diagnostic investigations, and response to treatment. In addition, complementary investigations of muscle tissue were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 9 patients diagnosed with late-onset MADD. All presented with muscle weakness and elevated levels of creatine kinase. A lipid storage myopathy was evident in the muscle biopsies, as was elevated acylcarnitines in blood. Despite thorough genetic investigations, a probable genetic cause was found in only 2 patients. Remarkably, all 7 patients without disease-causing mutations were treated with sertraline. In some cases, a deterioration of symptoms closely followed dose increase, and discontinuation resulted in an improved acylcarnitine profile. All 9 patients responded to riboflavin treatment with normalization of creatine kinase and muscle biopsy findings, and in 8 patients the clinical symptoms clearly improved.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings strongly suggest that sertraline may induce an acquired form of MADD in some patients. Importantly, riboflavin treatment seems to be similarly effective as in genetic MADD, but discontinuation of sertraline is reasonably warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:802–811</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess comparative effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of off-label rituximab, compared with frequently used therapies approved for multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A Swedish cohort study of persons with relapsing–remitting MS, age 18 to 75 years at inclusion and with a first therapy start or a first therapy switch between 2011 and 2018. Low-dose rituximab was compared with MS-approved therapies. Primary outcomes were proportions with 12 months confirmed disability worsening and change in MS Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) scores, respectively. Secondary endpoints included relapses, therapy discontinuation, and serious adverse events. Analyses used an intention-to-treat approach and were adjusted for demographics, MS features, and health characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 2,449 participants as first therapy start and 2,463 as first therapy switch. Proportions with disability worsening at 3 years were 9.1% for rituximab as first therapy and 5.1% after therapy switch, with no differences to MS-approved comparators. Worsening on rituximab was mostly independent of relapses. MSIS-29 with rituximab at 3 years improved by 1.3/8.4 points (physical/psychological) for first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and 0.4/3.6 for DMT switch, and was mostly similar across therapies. Rituximab had lower relapse rates and higher therapy persistence in both groups. The rate of hospital-treated infections was higher with rituximab after a therapy switch, but not as a first therapy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This population-based real-world cohort study found low rates of disability progression, mostly independent of relapses, and without significant differences between rituximab and MS-approved comparators. Rituximab led to lower rates of inflammatory activity and higher treatment persistence, but was associated with an increased rate of serious infections. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:678–693</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27015?af=R">Lesions Causing Alice in Wonderland Syndrome Map to a Common Brain Network Linking Body and Size Perception</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) profoundly affects human perception of size and scale, particularly regarding one's own body and the environment. Its neuroanatomical basis has remained elusive, partly because brain lesions causing AIWS can occur in different brain regions. Here, we aimed to determine if brain lesions causing AIWS map to a distributed brain network.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective case–control study analyzing 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS identified through systematic literature review was conducted. Using resting-state functional connectome data from 1,000 healthy individuals, the whole-brain connections of each lesion were estimated and contrasted with those from a control dataset comprising 1,073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric syndromes. Additionally, connectivity findings from lesion-induced AIWS cases were compared with functional neuroimaging results from 5 non-lesional AIWS cases.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AIWS-associated lesions were located in various brain regions with minimal overlap (≤33%). However, the majority of lesions (≥85%) demonstrated shared connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, known to be selectively activated by viewing body part images, and the inferior parietal cortex, involved in size and scale judgements. This pattern was uniquely characteristic of AIWS when compared with other neuropsychiatric disorders (family-wise error-corrected <i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) and consistent with functional neuroimaging observations in AIWS due to nonlesional causes (median correlation <i>r =</i> 0.56, interquartile range 0.24).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AIWS-related perceptual distortions map to one common brain network, encompassing regions critical for body representation and size-scale processing. These findings lend insight into the neuroanatomical localization of higher-order perceptual functions, and may inform future therapeutic strategies for perceptual disorders.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We investigated whether patients with large infarct and the presence or absence of perfusion mismatch are associated with endovascular treatment benefit.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a post-hoc analysis of the Endovascular Therapy in Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion with a Large Infarct (ANGEL-ASPECT) randomized trial, which enrolled patients within 24 hours of onset with ASPECTS 3 to 5 or ASPECTS 0 to 2 with an infarct core 70 to 100 ml. Mismatch ratio was defined as time-to-maximum (T<sub>max</sub>) &gt;6 s cerebral volume/ischemic core volume, and mismatch volume was defined as T<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s volume minus ischemic core volume. We divided patients into mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml, and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups. The primary outcome was the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ordinal distribution. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day mortality.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 425 patients included. In both the mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 395; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 31) and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 346; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 80), better 90-day modified Rankin Scale outcomes were found in the endovascular treatment group compared with the MM group (4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], common odds ratio [cOR], 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.001; 4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], cOR, 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively), but not in patients without mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (5 [3–6] vs 5 [4–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.3–4.1, <i>p</i> = 0.83), and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml (4 [3–6] vs 5 [3–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.60). However, no interaction effect was found in both subgroups (<i>p</i> interaction &gt;0.10).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Endovascular treatment was more efficacious than MM in patients with mismatch profiles, but no treatment effect or interaction was noted in the no mismatch profile patients. However, the small sample size of patients with no mismatch may have underpowered our analysis. A pooled analysis of large core trials stratified by mismatch is warranted.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Most paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) cases are hereditary, yet approximately 60% of patients remain genetically undiagnosed. We undertook the present study to uncover the genetic basis for undiagnosed PKD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 106 <i>PRRT2</i>-negative PKD probands. The functional impact of the genetic variants was investigated in HEK293T cells and <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> were identified in 11 individuals from 8 unrelated families, which accounted for 7.5% (8/106) of the <i>PRRT2</i>-negative probands. Both co-segregation of the identified variants and the significantly higher frequency of rare <i>KCNJ10</i> variants in PKD cases supported impacts from the detected <i>KCNJ10</i> heterozygous variants on PKD pathogenesis. Moreover, a <i>KCNJ10</i> mutation-carrying father from a typical EAST/SeSAME family was identified as a PKD patient. All patients manifested dystonia attacks triggered by sudden movement with a short episodic duration. Patch-clamp recordings in HEK293T cells revealed apparent reductions in K<sup>+</sup> currents of the patient-derived variants, indicating a loss-of-function. In <i>Drosophila</i>, milder hyperexcitability phenotypes were observed in heterozygous <i>Irk2</i> knock-in flies compared to homozygotes, supporting haploinsufficiency as the mechanism for the detected heterozygous variants. Electrophysiological recordings showed that excitatory neurons in <i>Irk2</i> haploinsufficiency flies exhibited increased excitability, and glia-specific complementation with human Kir4.1 rescued the <i>Irk2</i> mutant phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study established haploinsufficiency resulting from heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> can be understood as a previously unrecognized genetic cause for PKD and provided evidence of glial involvement in the pathophysiology of PKD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:758–773</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although metabolic abnormalities are implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a subject of controversy. We aimed to identify the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study included 395,987 participants from the UK Biobank to investigate the relationship between MetS and ALS. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Stratified analyses were performed based on gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and education level. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore potential mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this study, a total of 539 cases of ALS were recorded after a median follow-up of 13.7 years. Patients with MetS (defined harmonized) had a higher risk of developing ALS after adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19–1.89). Specifically, hypertension and high triglycerides were linked to a higher risk of ALS (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19–1.95; HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.61, respectively). Moreover, the quantity of metabolic abnormalities showed significant results. Stratified analysis revealed that these associations are particularly significant in individuals with a BMI &lt;25. These findings remained stable after sensitivity analysis. Notably, mediation analysis identified potential metabolites and metabolomic mediators, including alkaline phosphatase, cystatin C, γ-glutamyl transferase, saturated fatty acids to total fatty acids percentage, and omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids ratio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MetS exhibits a robust association with an increased susceptibility to ALS, particularly in individuals with a lower BMI. Furthermore, metabolites and metabolomics, as potential mediators, provide invaluable insights into the intricate biological mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:788–801</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated entorhinal cortex (EC) tau in low beta-amyloid individuals can predict accumulation of pathology and cognitive decline. We compared the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived locus coeruleus integrity, neocortical beta-amyloid burden by positron emission tomography (PET), and hippocampal volume in identifying elevated entorhinal tau signal in asymptomatic individuals who are considered beta-amyloid PET-negative.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 188 asymptomatic individuals (70.78 ± 11.51 years, 58% female) who underwent 3T-MRI of the locus coeruleus, Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), and Flortaucipir (FTP) PET. Associations between elevated EC tau and neocortical PiB, hippocampal volume, or locus coeruleus integrity were evaluated and compared using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses in the PiB− sample with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. Associations with clinical progression (CDR-sum-of-boxes) over a time span of 6 years were evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 26 (21%) individuals with high EC FTP in the CDR = 0/PiB− sample. Locus coeruleus integrity was a significantly more sensitive and specific predictor of elevated EC FTP (area under the curve [AUC] = 85%) compared with PiB (AUC = 77%) or hippocampal volume (AUC = 76%). Based on the Youden-index, locus coeruleus integrity obtained a sensitivity of 77% and 85% specificity. Using the resulting locus coeruleus Youden cut-off, lower locus coeruleus integrity was associated with a two-fold increase in clinical progression, including mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Locus coeruleus integrity has promise as a low-cost, non-invasive screening instrument to detect early cortical tau deposition and associated clinical progression in asymptomatic, low beta-amyloid individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:650–661</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine/chemokine profile of central nervous system (CNS) neurosarcoidosis (NS), and its utility in differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this case–control study, we validated 17 cytokines/chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) in a multiplexed automated immunoassay system (ELLA; Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and assessed them in CSF and serum of symptomatic patients with probable or definite CNS NS (01/2011–02/2023) with gadolinium enhancement and/or CSF pleocytosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis, primary CNS lymphoma, aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positivity, non-inflammatory disorders, and healthy individuals were used as controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 32 NS patients (59% women; median age, 59 years [19–81]) were included; concurrent sera were available in 12. CSF controls consisted of 26 multiple sclerosis, 8 primary CNS lymphoma, 84 aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positive, and 34 patients with non-inflammatory disorders. Gadolinium enhancement was present in 31 of 32 NS patients, and CSF pleocytosis in 27 of 32 (84%). CSF IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in NS patients compared with non-inflammatory controls (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.02); elevations were more common in CSF than serum. Concurrent elevation of IL-6, CXCL9, CXCL10, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha was present in 18 of 32 NS patients, but only in 1 control. Elevated IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, CXCL9, CXL10, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha associated with measures of disease activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27026?af=R">Hospital‐Treated Infections and Risk of Disability Worsening in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the association between infections and disability worsening in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with either B-cell depleting therapy (rituximab) or interferon-beta/glatiramer acetate (IFN/GA).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study spanned from 2000 to 2021, using data from the Swedish MS Registry linked to national health care registries, comprising 8,759 rituximab and 7,561 IFN/GA treatment episodes. The risk of hospital-treated infection was estimated using multivariable Cox models. The association between infections and increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores was assessed using a doubly robust generalized estimating equations model. Additionally, a piece-wise exponential model analyzed events of increased disability beyond defined cut-off values, controlling for relapses, and MRI activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with IFN/GA, rituximab displayed increased risk of both inpatient- and outpatient-treated infections (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50–2.90 and HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13–1.67, respectively). An inpatient-treated infection was associated with a 0.19-unit increase in EDSS (95% CI, 0.12–0.26). Degree of worsening was greatest for progressive MS, and under IFN/GA treatment, which unlike rituximab, was more commonly associated with MRI activity. After controlling for relapses and MRI activity, inpatient-treated infections were associated with disability worsening in people with relapsing–remitting MS treated with IFN/GA (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.59–2.53), but not in those treated with rituximab.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to IFN/GA, rituximab doubled the infection risk, but reduced the risk of subsequent disability worsening. Further, the risk of worsening after hospital-treated infection was greater with progressive MS than with relapsing–remitting MS. Infection risk should be considered to improve long term outcomes.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. Objective surrogate markers sensitive to detect changes in disease severity are needed to reduce sample sizes in interventional trials and identification of predictors of faster disease progression would facilitate patient selection, enrichment, or stratification in such trials.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal, multimodal study in 34 ataxic SCA1 individuals and 21 healthy controls. We collected clinical, patient-reported outcomes, biochemical and magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers at baseline and after 1 year. We determined 1-year progression and evaluated the potential predictive value of several baseline markers on 1-year disease progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, multiple structural and spectroscopic MR markers in pons and cerebellum differentiated SCA1 from healthy controls and correlated with disease severity. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) chain and CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were elevated in SCA1. In longitudinal analysis, total brainstem and pontine volume change, inventory of non-ataxia signs (INAS) count, and SCA functional index (SCAFI) showed larger responsiveness compared to the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).</p>
<p>Longer disease duration, longer non-expanded CAG repeat length, and higher disease burden were associated with faster SARA increase after 1-year in the SCA1 group. Similarly, lower baseline brainstem, pontine, and cerebellar volumes, as well as lower levels of N-acetylaspartate and glutamate in the cerebellar white matter, were also associated with faster SARA increase.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results guide the selection of the most sensitive measures of disease progression in SCA1 and have identified features associated with accelerated progression that could inform the design of clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:774–787</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blepharospasm (BSP), focal dystonia with the highest risk of spread, lacks clear understanding of early spreading risk factors and objective prognostic indicators. We aimed to identify these risk factors through clinical and electrophysiological assessments, and to establish a predictive model for dystonic spread in BSP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We prospectively followed BSP patients for 4 years, collecting data on dystonic spread, and conducting electrophysiological evaluations. The blink reflex, masseter inhibitory reflex, and trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential were assessed. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess clinical characteristics associated with BSP dystonic spread. A predictive model was constructed using a nomogram, and performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 136 enrolled participants (mean age 56.34 years) completed a 4-year follow-up. Among them, 62 patients (45.6%) showed spread to other body regions. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that a high Hamilton Anxiety Scale score (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.13–1.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), prolonged trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential mandibular branch P1-N2 peak interval (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.017), and elevated trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential mandibular branch P1-N2 peak amplitude (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for BSP dystonic spread within 4 years. Combining these factors, the predictive models demonstrated excellent discriminative ability, with the receiver operating characteristic curve score being 0.797, 0.790, 0.847, and 0.820 at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years after enrollment, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We established a predictive model with significant value for anticipating dystonic spread in BSP, offering crucial evidence. These findings contribute essential insights into the early clinical identification of the development and evolution of BSP diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:747–757</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Training clinician–scientists is a primary objective of many academic neurology departments, as these individuals are uniquely positioned to perform insightful clinical or laboratory-based research informed both by clinical knowledge and their own experiences caring for patients. Despite its importance, training clinician–scientists has perhaps never been so challenging. The National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) R25 program was designed in an attempt to support these individuals, decrease the time needed to obtain National Institutes of Health K awards, and to help educate a cohort of trainees preparing for a career in academic neurology. We endeavored to describe the structure and features of the program while examining its outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>R25 outcome data from 2009 to 2024 were reviewed. Statistical comparisons were made using 2-sided Mann–Whitney <i>U</i> testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 67% of adult neurologists who received an R25 had a successful application for a National Institutes of Health K award compared with 45% of adult neurologists who had not received R25 support (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Among child neurologists, 73% who applied went on to receive K funding after R25 support, compared with 45% who had not been part of the R25 program (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The average time between completion of residency and obtaining a K award for R25 participants was decreased by 26 months among those with an MD/PhD degree, and 32 months for those with an MD degree compared with non-R25 individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The R25 program has been successful in achieving its training goals, but stands as only one component of support for aspiring clinician–scientists. Investments and commitments made by academic neurology departments are key to supporting this success. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:625–632</p>

                Background Dentocraniofacial asymmetry is a common condition that affects many individuals. Accurate diagnosis of this condition is essential for effective treatment planning. Aim This study aimed to compare the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial asymmetry using two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at the Orthodontic Specialist Clinic of the Dental Hospital Faculty of Dentistry, University of Indonesia from March to April 2023. The study included 15 patients who had not undergone orthodontic treatment and were diagnosed with dentocraniofacial asymmetry. The study compared the results of diagnosing asymmetry in 15 different facial features, including the anterior nasal spine, upper and lower first incisors, pterygomaxillary fissure, orbita, menton, porion, upper and lower first molars, coronoid process, gonion, zygoma, latero nasale, and jugulare. Results The study found that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two- and three-dimensional methods across all 15 parameters measured. The researchers used Fisher's Exact Test to compare the proportion between dependent variables and found that the p-value was greater than 0.05, indicating that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two methods. The study also used Kappa Cohen analysis to measure the strength of agreement between the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods on each parameter. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that both two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods are equally effective in diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry. This information may be useful for orthodontists in deciding which method to use when diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-779/v2?src=rss">Optimal timing for lithium levels [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Reddy and Reddy (2014) discuss the optimal timing for lithium levels in patients taking once-daily extended-release lithium formulations. They argue for blood sampling 24 h after the previous dose rather than the standard 12 h. I interpret the data quite differently. The authors start with the assumption that the clinician wants a trough level. I disagree. What one wants is to be able to compare a patient’s lithium level to the large body of published knowledge about lithium dosing. Almost all of that data comes from standard 12-h blood draws with plain (immediate-release) lithium carbonate or lithium citrate. So, the real question of interest is, with extended-release lithium formulations, at what time point does one draw the lithium level to compare most accurately with a standard 12-h blood draw with plain lithium carbonate? The answer is not obvious because extended-release formulations affect only the absorption and not the excretion of lithium. Their primary benefit is reducing the transient peak lithium serum concentration, not delaying the (already relatively slow) elimination of lithium. Emami and colleagues (2004) provide the needed data. First they show that 90% of the administered dose of a commercial extended-release formulation (Eskalith CR®) is absorbed by 4 h after a dose, and ~100% is absorbed by 8 h (their Figure 2A). Second, they show that at 12 h after a dose, the blood levels for immediate and extended release formulations are essentially identical (their Figure 3).  Thus 12 h after the previous dose is the ideal time for drawing blood levels for extended-release lithium tablets.

                Introduction Treating the early phase of schizophrenia is crucial for preventing further episodes and improving quality of life, functioning, and social inclusion. Pharmacotherapies are first-line treatments, but have limitations. There is consensus on the need for non-pharmacological interventions for individuals in the early phase of schizophrenia. Several psychological interventions have shown promising effects; however, their comparative effectiveness remains largely unknown. To address this issue, a network meta-analysis will be performed. We aim to develop a hierarchy of existing psychological treatments concerning their efficacy and tolerability, which will inform treatment guidelines. Protocol Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychological interventions for first-episode psychosis, first-episode schizophrenia, or early phase schizophrenia will be included. The primary outcome will be overall schizophrenia symptoms (measured up to 6 and 12 months, and at the longest follow-up) and relapse as a co-primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are premature discontinuation; change in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia; response; quality of life; overall functioning; satisfaction with care; adherence; adverse events; and mortality. The study selection and data extraction are performed by two independent reviewers. We will assess the risk of bias of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 and evaluate the confidence in the results using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of our findings. Discussion This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to compare multiple existing psychological interventions, establishing which are best for symptom reduction, relapse prevention, and other important outcomes in early phase schizophrenia. Our results may provide practical guidance concerning the most effective psychological intervention to reduce symptom severity and the societal burden associated with the disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90992">Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in Sertoli cells regulates age-dependent changes in sperm DNA methylation</a></h4>

              
                Over the past several decades, a trend toward delayed childbirth has led to increases in parental age at the time of conception. Sperm epigenome undergoes age-dependent changes increasing risks of adverse conditions in offspring conceived by fathers of advanced age. The mechanism(s) linking paternal age with epigenetic changes in sperm remain unknown. The sperm epigenome is shaped in a compartment protected by the blood-testes barrier (BTB) known to deteriorate with age. Permeability of the BTB is regulated by the balance of two mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells where mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes the opening of the BTB and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) promotes its integrity. We hypothesized that this balance is also responsible for age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed reproductive outcomes, including sperm DNA methylation in transgenic mice with Sertoli cell-specific suppression of mTORC1 (<i>Rptor</i> KO) or mTORC2 (<i>Rictor</i> KO). mTORC2 suppression accelerated aging of the sperm DNA methylome and resulted in a reproductive phenotype concordant with older age, including decreased testes weight and sperm counts, and increased percent of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and mitochondrial DNA copy number. Suppression of mTORC1 resulted in the shift of DNA methylome in sperm opposite to the shift associated with physiological aging – sperm DNA methylome rejuvenation and mild changes in sperm parameters. These results demonstrate for the first time that the balance of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells regulates the rate of sperm epigenetic aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96643">PPI-hotspotID for detecting protein–protein interaction hot spots from the free protein structure</a></h4>

              
                Experimental detection of residues critical for protein–protein interactions (PPI) is a time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive process. Hence, high-throughput PPI-hot spot prediction methods have been developed, but they have been validated using relatively small datasets, which may compromise their predictive reliability. Here, we introduce PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup>, a novel method for identifying PPI-hot spots using the free protein structure, and validated it on the largest collection of experimentally confirmed PPI-hot spots to date. We explored the possibility of detecting PPI-hot spots using (i) FTMap in the PPI mode, which identifies hot spots on protein–protein interfaces from the <i>free</i> protein structure, and (ii) the interface residues predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer. PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup> yielded better performance than FTMap and SPOTONE, a webserver for predicting PPI-hot spots given the protein sequence. When combined with the AlphaFold-Multimer-predicted interface residues, PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup> yielded better performance than either method alone. Furthermore, we experimentally verified several PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup>-predicted PPI-hot spots of eukaryotic elongation factor 2. Notably, PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup> can reveal PPI-hot spots not obvious from complex structures, including those in <i>indirect</i> contact with binding partners. PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup> serves as a valuable tool for understanding PPI mechanisms and aiding drug design. It is available as a web server (<a href="https://ppihotspotid.limlab.dnsalias.org/">https://ppihotspotid.limlab.dnsalias.org/</a>) and open-source code (<a href="https://github.com/wrigjz/ppihotspotid/">https://github.com/wrigjz/ppihotspotid/</a>).

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91432">Cryo-EM structure of the CBC-ALYREF complex</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotes, RNAs transcribed by RNA Pol II are modified at the 5′ end with a 7-methylguanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G) cap, which is recognized by the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). The CBC plays multiple important roles in mRNA metabolism, including transcription, splicing, polyadenylation, and export. It promotes mRNA export through direct interaction with a key mRNA export factor, ALYREF, which in turn links the TRanscription and EXport (TREX) complex to the 5′ end of mRNA. However, the molecular mechanism for CBC-mediated recruitment of the mRNA export machinery is not well understood. Here, we present the first structure of the CBC in complex with an mRNA export factor, ALYREF. The cryo-EM structure of CBC-ALYREF reveals that the RRM domain of ALYREF makes direct contact with both the NCBP1 and NCBP2 subunits of the CBC. Comparing CBC-ALYREF with other cellular complexes containing CBC and/or ALYREF components provides insights into the coordinated events during mRNA transcription, splicing, and export.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99770">Exploring protein structural ensembles: Integration of sparse experimental data from electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with molecular modeling methods</a></h4>

              
                Under physiological conditions, proteins continuously undergo structural fluctuations on different timescales. Some conformations are only sparsely populated, but still play a key role in protein function. Thus, meaningful structure–function frameworks must include structural ensembles rather than only the most populated protein conformations. To detail protein plasticity, modern structural biology combines complementary experimental and computational approaches. In this review, we survey available computational approaches that integrate sparse experimental data from electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with molecular modeling techniques to derive all-atom structural models of rare protein conformations. We also propose strategies to increase the reliability and improve efficiency using deep learning approaches, thus advancing the field of integrative structural biology.

">Manipulating attentional priority creates a trade-off between memory and sensory representations in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                People often remember visual information over brief delays while actively engaging with ongoing inputs from the surrounding visual environment. Depending on the situation, one might prioritize mnemonic contents (i.e., remembering details of a past event), or preferentially attend sensory inputs (i.e., minding traffic while crossing a street). Previous fMRI work has shown that early sensory regions can simultaneously represent both mnemonic and passively viewed sensory information. Here we test the limits of such simultaneity by manipulating attention towards sensory distractors during a working memory task performed by human subjects during fMRI scanning. Participants remembered the orientation of a target grating while a distractor grating was shown during the middle portion of the memory delay. Critically, there were several subtle changes in the contrast and the orientation of the distractor, and participants were cued to either ignore the distractor, detect a change in contrast, or detect a change in orientation. Despite sensory stimulation being matched in all three conditions, the fidelity of memory representations in early visual cortex was highest when the distractor was ignored, intermediate when participants attended distractor contrast, and lowest when participants attended the orientation of the distractor during the delay. In contrast, the fidelity of distractor representations was lowest when ignoring the distractor, intermediate when attending distractor-contrast, and highest when attending distractor-orientation. These data suggest a trade-off in early sensory representations when engaging top-down feedback to attend both seen and remembered features and may partially explain memory failures that occur when subjects are distracted by external events.

">Establishment of an optimized and automated workflow for whole brain probing of neuronal activity.</a></h4>

              
                Behaviors are encoded by widespread neural circuits within the brain that change with age and experience. Immunodetection of the immediate early gene c-Fos has been successfully used for decades to reveal neural circuits active during specific tasks or conditions. Our objectives here were to develop and benchmark a workflow that circumvents classical temporal and spatial limitations associated with c-Fos quantification. We combined c-Fos immunohistochemistry with c-Fos driven Cre-dependant tdTomato expression in the TRAP2 mice, to visualize and perform a direct comparison of neural circuits activated at different times or during different tasks. By using open-source software (QuPath and ABBA), we established a workflow that optimize and automate cell detection, cell classification (e.g. c-Fos vs. c-Fos/tdTomato) and whole brain registration. We demonstrate that this workflow, based on fully automatic scripts, allows accurate cell number quantification with minimal interindividual variability. Further, interrogation of brain atlases at different scales (from simplified to detailed) allows gradually zooming on brain regions to explore spatial distribution of activated cells. We illustrate the potential of this approach by comparing patterns of neuronal activation in various contexts (two vigilance states, complex behavioral tasks...), in separate groups of mice or at two time points in the same animals. Finally, we explore software (BrainRender) for intuitive representation of the results. Altogether, this automated workflow accessible to all labs with some expertise in histology, allows an unbiased, fast and accurate analysis of the whole brain activity pattern at the cellular level, in various contexts.

                Auriculotherapy is a technique based on stimulation applied to specific ear points. Its mechanism of active and clinical efficacy remain to be established. This study aims to assess the role that primary somatosensory cortex may play to validate auriculotherapy mechanisms. This study examined whether tactile stimulation at specific auricular points is correlated with distinct cortical activation in the primary somatosensory cortex. Seventeen healthy adults participated in the study. Tactile stimuli were delivered to the thumb, shoulder, and skin master points on the ear using von Frey filaments. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure and spatially map cortical responses. This study revealed distinct hemodynamic activity patterns in response to ear point stimulation, consistent with the classic homunculus model of somatotopic organization. Ipsilateral stimulation showed specific cortical activations for the thumb and shoulder points, while contralateral stimulation showed less significant activity. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy effectively captured localized cortical responses to ear tactile stimuli, supporting the somatotopic mapping hypothesis. These findings enhance the understanding of sensory processing with auricular stimulation and supports the concepts of auricular cartography that underpins some schools of auriculotherapy practice. Future research should explore bilateral cortical mapping and the integration of other neuroimaging techniques.

	<p>Compelling evidence supports the foundational importance of early self-regulation (SR). It also supports parents in the home environment as having the foremost influence on early development. Yet, prevailing approaches to support early SR growth have tended to leverage early education and clinical settings. Partners in Play (PiP) was developed as a sustainable approach for parents to learn how and when to support children through experiences of self-regulation challenges in the home learning environment. This study reports the first randomised control trial evaluation of the PiP program, with 21 parent&amp;amp;ndash;child dyads (consisting of twelve girl&amp;amp;ndash;mother dyads, eight boy&amp;amp;ndash;mother dyads, and one boy&amp;amp;ndash;father dyad; mean child age = 4.12 years, SD = 0.65). Dyads were randomised to a PiP intervention group (n = 10), which entailed four online parent information sessions and four out-of-home guided practice dyadic play sessions across 8 weeks, or an active control group (n = 11). The primary outcome was parent autonomy support, and the secondary outcome was child SR. Results indicated a significant increase in parents&amp;amp;rsquo; use of autonomy support and a non-significant but moderate-sized effect on child SR. This innovative proof-of-concept program and evaluation provides a roadmap for effecting change in parental support during children&amp;amp;rsquo;s play, to the prospective benefit of important abilities such as child SR. Analyses show promise for a parent-based model toward parent behaviour change and child SR improvement.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Previous research has established that bilinguals automatically activate lexical items in both of their languages in a nonselectivemanner, even when processing linguistic information in the second language (L2) alone. However, whether this co-activation extends to the sub-lexical level remains debated. In this study, we investigate whether bilinguals access sub-lexical information while processing in their L2. Thirty-two Chinese&amp;amp;ndash;English bilinguals and thirty-one English monolinguals completed an EEG-based semantic relatedness task, during which they judged whether pairs of English words were related in meaning or not (&amp;amp;plusmn;S). Unbeknownst to the participants, the form (&amp;amp;plusmn;F) of the Chinese translations in half of the pairs shared a sub-lexical semantic radical. This leads to four conditions: +S+F, +S&amp;amp;minus;F, &amp;amp;minus;S+F, and &amp;amp;minus;S&amp;amp;minus;F. This design, along with the comparison to English monolinguals, allows us to examine if bilinguals&amp;amp;rsquo; native language is activated at the sub-lexical level when they are exposed only to L2. The results revealed that both groups showed sensitivity to semantic relatedness, as evidenced by a greater N400 for semantic unrelated pairs than related pairs, with monolinguals eliciting a more pronounced difference. Bilinguals, on the other hand, exhibited a greater P200 difference compared to monolinguals, indicating greater sensitivity to the hidden Chinese radical/form manipulation. These results suggest that highly proficient bilinguals automatically engage in lexical co-activation of their native language during L2 processing. Crucially, this co-activation extends to the sub-lexical semantic radical level.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the connection between the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) values and failure patterns of patients with IDH wild-type glioblastoma (GB) who underwent radiotherapy (RT) with FLAIR-based gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation. Methods: Seventy-one patients who received RT at a dose of 60 Gy to the GTV and 50 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV) and had documented recurrence were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s maximum distance of recurrence (MDR) from the GTV was documented in whichever plane it extended the farthest. The failure patterns were described as intra-GTV, in-CTV/out-GTV, distant, and intra-GTV and distant. For analytical purposes, the failure pattern was categorized into two groups, namely Group 1, intra-GTV or in-CTV/out-GTV, and Group 2, distant or intra-GTV and distant. The SIRI was calculated before surgery and corticosteroid administration. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal SIRI cut-off that distinguishes between the different failure patterns. Results: Failure occurred as follows: intra-GTV in 40 (56.3%), in-CTV/out-GTV in 4 (5.6%), distant in 18 (25.4%), and intra-GTV + distant in 9 (12.7%) patients. The mean MDR was 13.5 mm, and recurrent lesions extended beyond 15 mm in only seven patients. Patients with an SIRI score &amp;amp;ge; 3 demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of Group 1 failure patterns than their counterparts with an SIRI score &amp;amp;lt; 3 (74.3% vs. 50.0%; p = 0.035). Conclusions: The present results show that using the SIRI with a cut-off value of &amp;amp;ge;3 significantly predicts failure patterns. Additionally, the margin for the GTV can be safely reduced to 15 mm when using FLAIR-based target delineation in patients with GB.</p>

     alt="Activity-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex of Male Rats Underlies Resilience-Related Behaviors to Social Adversity"/>
<p>One adverse social experience in adulthood such as social defeat promotes vulnerability. Two adverse social experiences during development (maternal separation + social defeat) foster resilience. Activity-dependent plasticity in the mPFC seems to be crucial for resilience to social adversity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Individuals considered resilient can overcome adversity, achieving normal physical and psychological development, while those deemed vulnerable may not. Adversity promotes structural and functional alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. Moreover, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is intricately linked to neuronal shaping resulting from experiences. We hypothesize that this plasticity plays a crucial role in resilience processes. However, there is a notable absence of studies investigating this plasticity and behavioral changes following social adversity at different life stages. Consequently, we evaluated the impact of social adversity during early postnatal development (maternal separation [MS]), adulthood (social defeat [SD]), and a combined exposure (MS + SD) on behavioral outcomes (anxiety, motivation, anhedonia, and social interaction). We also examined cFos expression induced by social interaction in mPFC and hippocampus of adult male rats. Behavioral analyses revealed that SD-induced anhedonia, whereas MS + SD increased social interaction and mitigated SD-induced anhedonia. cFos evaluation showed that social interaction heightened plasticity in the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices, dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1. Social interaction-associated plasticity was compromised in IL and PrL cortices of the MS and SD groups. Interestingly, social interaction-induced plasticity was restored in the MS + SD group. Furthermore, plasticity was impaired in DG by all social stressors, and in CA3 was impaired by SD. Our findings suggest in male rats (i) two adverse social experiences during development foster resilience; (ii) activity-dependent plasticity in the mPFC is a foundation for resilience to social adversity; (iii) plasticity in DG is highly susceptible to social adversity.</p>

                The cis interaction between CD80 and PD-L1 disrupts PD-L1 function. Robinson et al. show that CTLA-4 restores PD-L1 activity, but this requires rigid bivalent binding of CTLA-4 to CD80. The unusual angle of the PD-L1-CD80 interaction indicates that PD-L1 release occurs via a physical reorientation of CD80, which is then unfavorable for PD-L1 binding.

They show that key DNA-repair factors and chromatin and actin network regulators are UFMylation targets in response to DSBs and that loss of UFM1-E3 ligase UFL1 impairs ATM activation and rDNA transcriptional silencing, leading to reduced rDNA segregation.

	<p>Study Objectives: The Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) Informatics System contains individual-patient-level traumatic brain injury (TBI) data, which when combined, allows for the examination of rates and outcomes for key subpopulations at risk for developing sleep disturbance. Methods: This proof-of-concept study creates a model system for harmonizing data (i.e., combining and standardizing data) across FITBIR studies for participants with and without a history of TBI to estimate rates of sleep disturbance and identify risk factors. Results: Three studies were eligible for harmonization (N = 1753). Sleep disturbance was common among those with a history of mild TBI (63%). Individuals with mild TBI were two to four times more likely to have sleep disturbance compared to those with no history of TBI. Conclusions: This study established methods, harmonization code, and meta-databases that are publicly available on the FITBIR website. We demonstrated how the harmonization of FITBIR studies can answer TBI research questions, showing that associations between TBI and sleep disturbance may be influenced by demographic factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23634?af=R">P2X7 expression patterns in the developing Fmr1‐knockout mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in <i>Fmr1 KO</i> whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during <i>Fmr1</i>-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the <i>Fmr1-</i>KO hippocampus formation.</p>

                <p>Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks. However, a major technical challenge for investigating astrocyte function and disease-related pathophysiology has been the limited ability to obtain functional human astrocytes. Despite recent advances in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) techniques, primary rodent astrocytes remain the gold standard in coculture with human neurons. We demonstrate that a combination of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) directs hPSC-derived neural precursor cells to a highly pure population of astroglia in 28&nbsp;d. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we confirm the astroglial identity of these cells and highlight profound transcriptional adaptations in cocultured hPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons, consistent with their further maturation. In coculture with human neurons, multielectrode array recordings revealed robust network activity of human neurons in a coculture with hPSC-derived or rat astrocytes [3.63 &plusmn; 0.44&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (hPSC-derived), 2.86 &plusmn; 0.64&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>= 0.19]. In comparison, we found increased spike frequency within network bursts of human neurons cocultured with hPSC-derived astrocytes [56.31 &plusmn; 8.56&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 24.77 &plusmn; 4.04&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.01], and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed an increase of postsynaptic currents [2.76 &plusmn; 0.39&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 1.07 &plusmn; 0.14&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001], consistent with a corresponding increase in synapse density [14.90 &plusmn; 1.27/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (hPSC-derived), 8.39 &plusmn; 0.63/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001]. Taken together, we show that hPSC-derived astrocytes compare favorably with rat astrocytes in supporting human neural network activity and maturation, providing a fully human platform for investigating astrocyte function and neuronal-glial interactions.</p>

                <p>Much of what has been discovered concerning neurophysiological mechanisms can be credited to ex vivo biomedical experiments. Beyond these discoveries, ex vivo research techniques have enhanced the global understanding of human physiology and pathology in almost every biomedical specialty. Naturally, ex vivo experiments are among the most desired methods of research, particularly in the field of neuroscience. Ex vivo experiment platforms may be purchased commercially. However, their substantial cost and sometimes limited availability can render them inaccessible to many research labs. Moreover, these manufactured systems are often rigid in function with no possibility of customization, severely narrowing their capabilities. However, developing essential components for ex vivo laboratory systems with a fused deposition modeling printer provides a practical solution to each of these obstacles. Here, we provide the designs and construction process for an easily accessible, highly adaptable recording stage with modifiable submersion chambers using a 3D printer for a total cost under $15.00. With the versatility afforded by the exchangeable custom chambers, the system may be used to conduct research on a variety of ex vivo tissue preparations, paving the way for novel research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-571/v2?src=rss">Analyzing Molecular Traits of H9N2 Avian Influenza Virus Isolated from a Same Poultry Farm in West Java Province, Indonesia, in 2017 and 2023 [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                Background The current report describes a unimodular thyroid goiter (TGo), identified unilaterally in a female cadaver, causing displacement or compression effects in the adjacent neck structures (common carotid artery (CCA) and internal jugular vein (IJV),). Methods Routine dissection of the neck of an 86-year-old female donated a Greek cadaver. Results A thyroid gland variant was identified coexisting with a TGo originating from the left thyroid lobe. The variant is a pyramidal lobe located on the left side of the isthmus. Owing to the presence of the TGo, the left CCA, along with the left IJV, deviated 50.6 mm ipsilaterally from the midline of the neck. The right CCA had a minor deviation of 30.8 mm, from the midline to the right side due to the proximity of the shifted trachea and esophagus with the CCA origin. The trachea and esophagus deviated contralaterally to the TGo, 24.4 mm from the midline. Conclusions CCA compression, stenosis, and angulation may cause dizziness, weakness, and hypomnesia. The potential outcomes were worse with IJV compression. Atherosclerosis tends to occur more often in arteries with inclined (angulated) parts.

                Background In this paper we analyse the novel The End of Eddy by Édouard Louis. The motivation for this paper is Bourdeau’s (2020) observation that Louis’s book explores working class politics, sexuality, and masculinity. Methods We analysed the amendment through narrative content analysis, the application of which allows us to answer the following question: Édouard Louis’s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? Results We conclude that this narrative is built on contradictions that can be summarized as a conflict between a socio-cultural norm anchored in a French village and a person who does not fulfil this concept, who is outside of it. We believe that hegemonic masculinity, that is, one part of the cultural norm of a given village, causes Eddy’s inclination or consciousness of homonationalism. Thus, on the one hand, hegemonic masculinity is undoubtedly present in this novel; on the other hand, it forms a kind of background or socio-cultural environment which, although it defines itself against the given, unconsciously causes the “birth of the conscious homosexual”. Conclusions Thus, we dare to claim that the narrative under analysis is not only a representation of hegemonic masculinity, but also an accentuation of its external and internal influence on one’s own perception of (sexual) difference.

                Background Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent condition caused by weakened pelvic floor support structures. Extracellular matrix alterations, including changes in collagen type I, collagen type III, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. Human platelet-rich fibrin lysate (hPRF-L) is a novel regenerative treatment that has shown beneficial results in treating structural weaknesses related to various pelvic floor diseases, including POP. Methods This study protocol aims to investigate the effects of hPRF-L injection on collagen I, III, and MMP-1 in the vaginal mucosa of a rat POP model. POP will be induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats, which will be randomly assigned to control, sham, and hPRF-L treatment groups. The hPRF-L group will receive weekly injections of hPRF-L (25, 50, or 75 μL) into the vaginal mucosa for 4 weeks. Vaginal tissue samples will be collected, and collagen type I, collagen type III, and MMP-1 expression will be evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. Data analysis will be performed with ANOVA and post-hoc tests. Discussion The findings from this study protocol are expected to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which hPRF-L impacts the structural integrity of the pelvic floor. By elucidating these mechanisms, this study aims to inform future POP treatment strategies. The anticipated results are an increase in collagen type I and III expression and a reduction in MMP-1 levels in the hPRF-L treatment group compared to the control and sham groups. These outcomes could support the use of hPRF-L as a regenerative therapy for managing POP, offering a potential alternative to more invasive surgical interventions. Conclusion The expected results will contribute to the development of less invasive treatments for POP, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

                CSNK1A1 is a key regulator of various signalling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Playing a central role in cellular function and disease pathology, CSNK1A1 has emerged as an attractive protein target for therapeutic development. In this study we characterize ten CSNK1A1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Monitoring and strict control of anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events. The objective of this research was to explore the association of the quality of anticoagulation control with the occurrence of stroke, thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, or death during follow-up in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) on vitamin K antagonists. Methods A retrospective and observational study was carried out in clinical practice (real world data). Data were collected on age, sex, income level, occupational status, ischemic stroke, thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, death, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) was measured using TAONet software and TTR ≥60% was considered indicative of good anticoagulation control. Survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models to compare time-to-event by quality of anticoagulation control. Determinants of anticoagulation quality were identified using logistic regression. Results Of 856 patients recruited, only 286 (33%) had a TTR ≥60%. Cox models including sociodemographic and clinical variables showed that the risk of all four events was much higher in the subsample with TTR <60% and the differences were statistically significant. Specifically, the hazard ratios (HRs) for this group were 1.94 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.30) for stroke, 1.60 (CI: 1.10-2.33) for thrombotic events, 1.61 (CI: 1.08-2.42) for hemorrhagic events and 2.97 (CIs: 1.86-4.75) for death. Conclusions The positive conclusion of the study was the markedly lower rate of events associated with TTR ≥60% and the negative conclusion was the low percentage of patients achieving good anticoagulation control. This implies that despite being “protected”, they continue to have a high risk of stroke, embolism, hemorrhagic complications and death. We believe it is necessary to develop and implement strategies to tackle this problem.

                Background Industry 4.0 is a significant technical revolution that combines big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems to improve manufacturing productivity. This study investigates the impact of digital trust and sustainable attitude on perceived value and the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. It also examines the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance in these relationships. Methods Data were collected from 189 employees of leading manufacturing companies in Indonesia that are recognized for their Industry 4.0 practices. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology with SmartPLS software to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the moderating effects. Results The findings reveal that both digital trust and sustainable attitude significantly influence perceived value. However, these factors do not directly affect the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between digital trust and adoption intention. Specifically, in environments with high uncertainty avoidance, digital trust becomes a critical factor influencing the decision to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Conclusions The study provides valuable insights for organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives. It highlights the importance of fostering digital trust and considering cultural dimensions, such as uncertainty avoidance, in their technology adoption strategies.

                <p>by Brian C. O’Meara, Jeremy M. Beaulieu</p>

Across a variety of biological datasets, from genomes to conservation to the fossil record, evolutionary rates appear to increase toward the present or over short time scales. This has long been seen as an indication of processes operating differently at different time scales, even potentially as an indicator of a need for new theory connecting macroevolution and microevolution. Here we introduce a set of models that assess the relationship between rate and time and demonstrate that these patterns are statistical artifacts of time-independent errors present across ecological and evolutionary datasets, which produce hyperbolic patterns of rates through time. We show that plotting a noisy numerator divided by time versus time leads to the observed hyperbolic pattern; in fact, randomizing the amount of change over time generates patterns functionally identical to observed patterns. Ignoring errors can not only obscure true patterns but create novel patterns that have long misled scientists.

                <p>by Israel Luis, Maarten Afschrift, Friedl De Groote, Elena M. Gutierrez-Farewik</p>

The metabolic energy rate of individual muscles is impossible to measure without invasive procedures. Prior studies have produced models to predict metabolic rates based on experimental observations of isolated muscle contraction from various species. Such models can provide reliable predictions of metabolic rates in humans if muscle properties and control are accurately modeled. This study aimed to examine how muscle-tendon model individualization and metabolic energy models influenced estimation of muscle-tendon states and time-series metabolic rates, to evaluate the agreement with empirical data, and to provide predictions of the metabolic rate of muscle groups and gait phases across walking speeds. Three-dimensional musculoskeletal simulations with prescribed kinematics and dynamics were performed. An optimal control formulation was used to compute muscle-tendon states with four levels of individualization, ranging from a scaled generic model and muscle controls based on minimal activations, inclusion of calibrated muscle passive forces, personalization of Achilles and quadriceps tendon stiffnesses, to finally informing muscle controls with electromyography. We computed metabolic rates based on existing models. Simulations with calibrated passive forces and personalized tendon stiffness most accurately estimate muscle excitations and fiber lengths. Interestingly, the inclusion of electromyography did not improve our estimates. The whole-body average metabolic cost was better estimated with a subset of metabolic energy models. We estimated metabolic rate peaks near early stance, pre-swing, and initial swing at all walking speeds. Plantarflexors accounted for the highest cost among muscle groups at the preferred speed and were similar to the cost of hip adductors and abductors combined. Also, the swing phase accounted for slightly more than one-quarter of the total cost in a gait cycle, and its relative cost decreased with walking speed. Our prediction might inform the design of assistive devices and rehabilitation treatment. The code and experimental data are available online.

                <p>by Monica Golumbeanu, Olivier Briët, Clara Champagne, Jeanne Lemant, Munir Winkel, Barnabas Zogo, Maximilian Gerhards, Marianne Sinka, Nakul Chitnis, Melissa Penny, Emilie Pothin, Tom Smith</p>

In recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access R package that quantifies the impact of vector control interventions depending on mosquito species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 <i>Anopheles</i> species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.

An understanding of human brain individuality requires the integration of data on brain organization across people and brain regions, molecular and systems scales, as well as healthy and clinical states. Here, we help advance this understanding by leveraging methods from computational genomics to integrate large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, neuroimaging, and electronic-health record data sets. We estimated genetically regulated gene expression (gr-expression) of 18,647 genes, across 10 cortical and subcortical regions of 45,549 people from the UK Biobank. First, we showed that patterns of estimated gr-expression reflect known genetic–ancestry relationships, regional identities, as well as inter-regional correlation structure of directly assayed gene expression. Second, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to discover 1,065 associations between individual variation in gr-expression and gray-matter volumes across people and brain regions. We benchmarked these associations against results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the same sample and found hundreds of novel associations relative to these GWAS. Third, we integrated our results with clinical associations of gr-expression from the Vanderbilt Biobank. This integration allowed us to link genes, via gr-expression, to neuroimaging and clinical phenotypes. Fourth, we identified associations of polygenic gr-expression with structural and functional MRI phenotypes in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), a small neuroimaging-genomic data set with high-quality functional imaging data. Finally, we showed that estimates of gr-expression and magnitudes of TWAS were generally replicable and that the <i>p</i>-values of TWAS were replicable in large samples. Collectively, our results provide a powerful new resource for integrating gr-expression with population genetics of brain organization and disease.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite bilateral hippocampal damage dating to the perinatal or early childhood period and severely impaired episodic memory, patients with developmental amnesia continue to exhibit well-developed semantic memory across the developmental trajectory. Detailed information on the extent and focality of brain damage in these patients is needed to hypothesize about the neural substrate that supports their remarkable capacity for encoding and retrieval of semantic memory. In particular, we need to assess whether the residual hippocampal tissue is involved in this preservation, or whether the surrounding cortical areas reorganize to rescue aspects of these critical cognitive memory processes after early injury. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, automatic (FreeSurfer) and manual segmentation to characterize structural changes in the brain of an exceptionally large cohort of 23 patients with developmental amnesia in comparison with 32 control subjects. Both the VBM and the FreeSurfer analyses revealed severe structural alterations in the hippocampus and thalamus of patients with developmental amnesia. Milder damage was found in the amygdala, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Manual segmentation demonstrated differences in the degree of atrophy of the hippocampal subregions in patients. The level of atrophy in CA-DG subregions and subicular complex was more than 40%, while the atrophy of the uncus was moderate (−24%). Anatomo-functional correlations were observed between the volumes of residual hippocampal subregions in patients and selective aspects of their cognitive performance, viz, intelligence, working memory, and verbal and visuospatial recall. Our findings suggest that in patients with developmental amnesia, cognitive processing is compromised as a function of the extent of atrophy in hippocampal subregions. More severe hippocampal damage may be more likely to promote structural and/or functional reorganization in areas connected to the hippocampus. In this hypothesis, different levels of hippocampal function may be rescued following this variable reorganization. Our findings document not only the extent, but also the limits of circuit reorganization occurring in the young brain after early bilateral hippocampal damage.</p>

     alt="Covariation of Skull and Brain Morphology in Domestic Dogs"/>
<p>Using T2-weighted MRI studies of 79 dogs, we find that skull shape covaries with brain morphology. Dogs with extreme skull shapes – brachycephaly and dolichocephaly – show regional reductions in relative gray matter volume.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Despite their distinct embryonic origins, the skull and brain are highly integrated. Understanding the covariation between the skull and brain can shed light on anatomical, cognitive, and behavioral traits in extant and extinct species. Domestic dogs offer a unique opportunity to investigate skull–brain covariation due to their diverse skull morphologies and neural anatomy. To assess this question, we examined <i>T</i>2-weighted MRI studies of 62 dogs from 33 breeds, plus an additional 17 dogs of mixed or unknown breeds. Scans were opportunistically collected from a veterinary teaching hospital of dogs that were referred for neurological examination but did not have grossly observable structural brain abnormalities. As the neurocrania of dogs become broader and shorter, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the right olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, marginal gyrus, and cerebellum. On the other hand, as the neurocrania of dogs become narrower and longer, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, cerebellum, and brainstem. Selective breeding for specific skull shapes may impact canine brain anatomy and function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1394/v7?src=rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 7; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to acid-catalysed cyclization of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 413 hemp-based products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 48 products (12%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC, with the safety of CBD itself currently being unclear with significant uncertainties regarding possible liver and reproductive toxicity. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

                Zhang et al. discovered that bookmarking factor FOXA1 undergoes dynamic phosphorylation at Serine 221 by Aurora B during mitosis, orchestrating its different DNA binding patterns and the periodic FOXA1 condensate formation during the cell cycle. Moreover, this phosphorylation regulates the target gene reactivation post-mitosis and cancer cell proliferation.

The results indicate that the removal of diribonucleotides is an essential function in γ-proteobacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95289">Limited column formation in the embryonic growth plate implies divergent growth mechanisms during pre- and postnatal bone development</a></h4>

              
                Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95888">TMC7 deficiency causes acrosome biogenesis defects and male infertility in mice</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are a highly conserved ion channel family consisting of eight members (TMC1–TMC8) in mammals. TMC1/2 are components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells, and mutations of TMC1/2 cause deafness in humans and mice. However, the physiological roles of other TMC proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we show that <i>Tmc7</i> is specifically expressed in the testis and that it is required for acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. <i>Tmc7</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids, similar to human oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. We further demonstrate that TMC7 is colocalized with GM130 at the <i>cis</i>-Golgi region in round spermatids. TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the developing acrosome. Moreover, upon loss of TMC7 intracellular ion homeostasis is impaired and ROS levels are increased, which in turn causes Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, these results suggest that TMC7 is required to maintain pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for acrosome biogenesis. Our findings unveil a novel role for TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91636">Language experience shapes predictive coding of rhythmic sound sequences</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual systems heavily rely on prior knowledge and predictions to make sense of the environment. Predictions can originate from multiple sources of information, including contextual short-term priors, based on isolated temporal situations, and context-independent long-term priors, arising from extended exposure to statistical regularities. While the effects of short-term predictions on auditory perception have been well-documented, how long-term predictions shape early auditory processing is poorly understood. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography data from native speakers of two languages with different word orders (Spanish: functor-initial vs Basque: functor-final) listening to simple sequences of binary sounds alternating in duration with occasional omissions. We hypothesized that, together with contextual transition probabilities, the auditory system uses the characteristic prosodic cues (duration) associated with the native language’s word order as an internal model to generate long-term predictions about incoming non-linguistic sounds. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the amplitude of the mismatch negativity elicited by sound omissions varied orthogonally depending on the speaker’s linguistic background and was most pronounced in the left auditory cortex. Importantly, listening to binary sounds alternating in pitch instead of duration did not yield group differences, confirming that the above results were driven by the hypothesized long-term ‘duration’ prior. These findings show that experience with a given language can shape a fundamental aspect of human perception – the neural processing of rhythmic sounds – and provides direct evidence for a long-term predictive coding system in the auditory cortex that uses auditory schemes learned over a lifetime to process incoming sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91619">Conserved regulatory motifs in the juxtamembrane domain and kinase N-lobe revealed through deep mutational scanning of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase domain</a></h4>

              
                MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (METΔEx14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of the MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild-type and METΔEx14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase ⍺C-helix, pointing to potential differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a β5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for the kinase domain in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.
