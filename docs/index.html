	<p>Facial expression processing mainly depends on whether the facial features related to expressions can be fully acquired, and whether the appropriate processing strategies can be adopted according to different conditions. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty accurately recognizing facial expressions and responding appropriately, which is regarded as an important cause of their social disorders. This study used eye tracking technology to explore the internal processing mechanism of facial expressions in children with ASD under the influence of spatial frequency and inversion effects for improving their social disorders. The facial expression recognition rate and eye tracking characteristics of children with ASD and typical developing (TD) children on the facial area of interest were recorded and analyzed. The multi-factor mixed experiment results showed that the facial expression recognition rate of children with ASD under various conditions was significantly lower than that of TD children. TD children had more visual attention to the eyes area. However, children with ASD preferred the features of the mouth area, and lacked visual attention and processing of the eyes area. When the face was inverted, TD children had the inversion effect under all three spatial frequency conditions, which was manifested as a significant decrease in expression recognition rate. However, children with ASD only had the inversion effect under the LSF condition, indicating that they mainly used a featural processing method and had the capacity of configural processing under the LSF condition. The eye tracking results showed that when the face was inverted or facial feature information was weakened, both children with ASD and TD children would adjust their facial expression processing strategies accordingly, to increase the visual attention and information processing of their preferred areas. The fixation counts and fixation duration of TD children on the eyes area increased significantly, while the fixation duration of children with ASD on the mouth area increased significantly. The results of this study provided theoretical and practical support for facial expression intervention in children with ASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Beliefs on social distancing and face mask practices during the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Social distancing and wearing a face mask are highly recommended to mitigate the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the success of these strategies relies on individuals’ adherence and public compliance. This study was conducted to assess the level of belief in social distancing and face mask practices in communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and to identify their possible determinants.   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in ten LMICs countries in Asia, Africa, and South America from February to May 2021. A questionnaire was used to assess the belief, practice, and their plausible determinants. Identification of the associated determinants was performed using a logistic regression model.   Results: Our data revealed that only 62.6% and 66.9% of the participants had good beliefs in social distancing and good face mask practices, respectively. Residing in the Americas, having a healthcare-related job, knowing people in immediate social environment who are or have been infected and exposure to information of COVID-19 cases on social media or TV were factors significantly associated with good belief in social distancing. Residing country, gender, monthly household income, type of job and exposure to information of COVID-19 cases were significantly associated with face mask wearing practice.  Conclusion: The proportion of participants having good beliefs in social distancing and good face mask practices is relatively low (<75%). Hence, sustained health campaigns regarding social distancing benefits and face mask-wearing practices during COVID-19 are critical in LMICs.

                Background After the first cases of coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in January 2020, we conducted an epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 in Gabon. Methods We led molecular investigations on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from the 1161 first suspected cases of COVID-19. We diagnosed the first case of COVID-19 on March, 12 2020. Results Among those suspected cases, 83 were confirmed cases. There was no significant difference in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 between age groups (p=0.14). 73% were asymptomatic. The viral loads were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal samples than in the oropharyngeal samples (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in viral loads between age groups (p=0.9895) and no correlation between clinical symptoms and viral loads (p=0.06042). A phylogenetic analysis performed with five sequences of the spike S gene showed that two sequences had the D614G mutation. Conclusion In conclusion, this study provides the first molecular data from Gabon concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The data showed that most of the infected people were asymptomatic. The viral load was higher in the nasopharyngeal samples. The S gene analyzed suggested both introduction of the D614 and G614 variant in Gabon.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Numerical model for enhancing stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical microfibers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is useful, among others for generating slow light, sensing and amplification. SBS was previously viewed as a poor method due to the limitation on optical power in high-powered photonic applications. However, considering the many possible applications using SBS, it is now of interest to enhance SBS in areas of Brillouin frequency shift together with Brillouin Gain. A numerical model, using a fully vectorial approach, by employing the finite element method, was developed to investigate methods for enhancing SBS in optical fiber. This paper describes the method related to the numerical model and discusses the analysis between the interactions of longitudinal, shear and hybrid acoustic modes; and optical modes in optical fiber. Two case studies were used to demonstrate this. Based on this numerical model, we report the influence of core radius, clad radius and effective refractive index on the Brillouin frequency shift and gain. We observe the difference of Brillouin shift frequency between a normal silica optical fiber and that of a microfiber - a uniformed silica fiber of a much smaller core and cladding dimensions where nonlinearities are higher. Also observed, the different core radii used and their respective Brillouin shift. For future work, the COMSOL model can also be used for the following areas of research, including simulating “surface Brillouin shift” and also to provide in-sights to the Brillouin shift frequency vB of various structures of waveguides, e.g circular, and triangular, and also to examine specialty fibers, e.g. Thulium and Chalcogenide doped fibers, and their effects on Brillouin shift frequency.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-frequency oscillations and sequence generation in two-population models of hippocampal region CA1</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wilhelm Braun, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer</p>

Hippocampal sharp wave/ripple oscillations are a prominent pattern of collective activity, which consists of a strong overall increase of activity with superimposed (140 − 200 Hz) ripple oscillations. Despite its prominence and its experimentally demonstrated importance for memory consolidation, the mechanisms underlying its generation are to date not understood. Several models assume that recurrent networks of inhibitory cells alone can explain the generation and main characteristics of the ripple oscillations. Recent experiments, however, indicate that in addition to inhibitory basket cells, the pattern requires <i>in vivo</i> the activity of the local population of excitatory pyramidal cells. Here, we study a model for networks in the hippocampal region CA1 incorporating such a local excitatory population of pyramidal neurons. We start by investigating its ability to generate ripple oscillations using extensive simulations. Using biologically plausible parameters, we find that short pulses of external excitation triggering excitatory cell spiking are required for sharp/wave ripple generation with oscillation patterns similar to <i>in vivo</i> observations. Our model has plausible values for single neuron, synapse and connectivity parameters, random connectivity and no strong feedforward drive to the inhibitory population. Specifically, whereas temporally broad excitation can lead to high-frequency oscillations in the ripple range, sparse pyramidal cell activity is only obtained with pulse-like external CA3 excitation. Further simulations indicate that such short pulses could originate from dendritic spikes in the apical or basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, which are triggered by coincident spike arrivals from hippocampal region CA3. Finally we show that replay of sequences by pyramidal neurons and ripple oscillations can arise intrinsically in CA1 due to structured connectivity that gives rise to alternating excitatory pulse and inhibitory gap coding; the latter denotes phases of silence in specific basket cell groups, which induce selective disinhibition of groups of pyramidal neurons. This general mechanism for sequence generation leads to sparse pyramidal cell and dense basket cell spiking, does not rely on synfire chain-like feedforward excitation and may be relevant for other brain regions as well.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational exploration of treadmilling and protrusion growth observed in fire ant rafts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robert J. Wagner, Franck J. Vernerey</p>

Collective living systems regularly achieve cooperative emergent functions that individual organisms could not accomplish alone. The rafts of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) are often studied in this context for their ability to create aggregated structures comprised entirely of their own bodies, including tether-like protrusions that facilitate exploration of and escape from flooded environments. While similar protrusions are observed in cytoskeletons and cellular aggregates, they are generally dependent on morphogens or external gradients leaving the isolated role of local interactions poorly understood. Here we demonstrate through an ant-inspired, agent-based numerical model how protrusions in ant rafts may emerge spontaneously due to local interactions. The model is comprised of a condensed structural network of agents that represents the monolayer of interconnected worker ants, which floats on the water and gives ant rafts their form. Experimentally, this layer perpetually contracts, which we capture through the pairwise contraction of all neighboring structural agents at a strain rate of d˙. On top of the structural layer, we model a dispersed, on-lattice layer of motile agents that represents free ants, which walk on top of the floating network. Experimentally, these self-propelled free ants walk with some mean persistence length and speed that we capture through an ant-inspired phenomenological model. Local interactions occur between neighboring free ants within some radius of detection, <i>R</i>, and the persistence length of freely active agents is tuned through a noise parameter, <i>η</i> as introduced by the Vicsek model. Both <i>R</i> and <i>η</i> where fixed to match the experimental trajectories of free ants. Treadmilling of the raft occurs as agents transition between the structural and free layers in accordance with experimental observations. Ultimately, we demonstrate how phases of exploratory protrusion growth may be induced by increased ant activity as characterized by a dimensionless parameter, A. These results provide an example in which functional morphogenesis of a living system may emerge purely from local interactions at the constituent length scale, thereby providing a source of inspiration for the development of decentralized, autonomous active matter and swarm robotics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High fidelity epigenetic inheritance: Information theoretic model predicts threshold filling of histone modifications post replication</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nithya Ramakrishnan, Sibi Raj B. Pillai, Ranjith Padinhateeri</p>

During cell devision, maintaining the epigenetic information encoded in histone modification patterns is crucial for survival and identity of cells. The faithful inheritance of the histone marks from the parental to the daughter strands is a puzzle, given that each strand gets only half of the parental nucleosomes. Mapping DNA replication and reconstruction of modifications to equivalent problems in communication of information, we ask how well enzymes can recover the parental modifications, if they were ideal computing machines. Studying a parameter regime where realistic enzymes can function, our analysis predicts that enzymes may implement a critical threshold filling algorithm which fills unmodified regions of length at most <i>k</i>. This algorithm, motivated from communication theory, is derived from the maximum à posteriori probability (MAP) decoding which identifies the most probable modification sequence based on available observations. Simulations using our method produce modification patterns similar to what has been observed in recent experiments. We also show that our results can be naturally extended to explain inheritance of spatially distinct antagonistic modifications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regulatory network-based imputation of dropouts in single-cell RNA sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ana Carolina Leote, Xiaohui Wu, Andreas Beyer</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods are typically unable to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell, creating a need for the computational prediction of missing values (‘dropout imputation’). Most existing dropout imputation methods are limited in the sense that they exclusively use the scRNA-seq dataset at hand and do not exploit external gene-gene relationship information. Further, it is unknown if all genes equally benefit from imputation or which imputation method works best for a given gene. Here, we show that a transcriptional regulatory network learned from external, independent gene expression data improves dropout imputation. Using a variety of human scRNA-seq datasets we demonstrate that our network-based approach outperforms published state-of-the-art methods. The network-based approach performs particularly well for lowly expressed genes, including cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Further, the cell-to-cell variation of 11.3% to 48.8% of the genes could not be adequately imputed by any of the methods that we tested. In those cases gene expression levels were best predicted by the mean expression across all cells, i.e. assuming no measurable expression variation between cells. These findings suggest that different imputation methods are optimal for different genes. We thus implemented an R-package called ADImpute (available via Bioconductor https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ADImpute.html) that automatically determines the best imputation method for each gene in a dataset. Our work represents a paradigm shift by demonstrating that there is no single best imputation method. Instead, we propose that imputation should maximally exploit external information and be adapted to gene-specific features, such as expression level and expression variation across cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Blood and brain gene expression signatures of chronic intermittent ethanol consumption in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura B. Ferguson, Amanda J. Roberts, R. Dayne Mayfield, Robert O. Messing</p>

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing syndrome diagnosed by a heterogeneous set of behavioral signs and symptoms. There are no laboratory tests that provide direct objective evidence for diagnosis. Microarray and RNA-Seq technologies enable genome-wide transcriptome profiling at low costs and provide an opportunity to identify biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients. However, access to brain tissue in living patients is not possible. Blood contains cellular and extracellular RNAs that provide disease-relevant information for some brain diseases. We hypothesized that blood gene expression profiles can be used to diagnose AUD. We profiled brain (prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus) and blood gene expression levels in C57BL/6J mice using RNA-seq one week after chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, a mouse model of alcohol dependence. We found a high degree of preservation (rho range: [0.50, 0.67]) between blood and brain transcript levels. There was small overlap between blood and brain DEGs, and considerable overlap of gene networks perturbed after CIE related to cell-cell signaling (e.g., GABA and glutamate receptor signaling), immune responses (e.g., antigen presentation), and protein processing / mitochondrial functioning (e.g., ubiquitination, oxidative phosphorylation). Blood gene expression data were used to train classifiers (logistic regression, random forest, and partial least squares discriminant analysis), which were highly accurate at predicting alcohol dependence status (maximum AUC: 90.1%). These results suggest that gene expression profiles from peripheral blood samples contain a biological signature of alcohol dependence that can discriminate between CIE and Air subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysing pneumococcal invasiveness using Bayesian models of pathogen progression rates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alessandra Løchen, James E. Truscott, Nicholas J. Croucher</p>

The disease burden attributable to opportunistic pathogens depends on their prevalence in asymptomatic colonisation and the rate at which they progress to cause symptomatic disease. Increases in infections caused by commensals can result from the emergence of “hyperinvasive” strains. Such pathogens can be identified through quantifying progression rates using matched samples of typed microbes from disease cases and healthy carriers. This study describes Bayesian models for analysing such datasets, implemented in an RStan package (https://github.com/nickjcroucher/progressionEstimation). The models converged on stable fits that accurately reproduced observations from meta-analyses of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> datasets. The estimates of invasiveness, the progression rate from carriage to invasive disease, in cases per carrier per year correlated strongly with the dimensionless values from meta-analysis of odds ratios when sample sizes were large. At smaller sample sizes, the Bayesian models produced more informative estimates. This identified historically rare but high-risk <i>S</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> serotypes that could be problematic following vaccine-associated disruption of the bacterial population. The package allows for hypothesis testing through model comparisons with Bayes factors. Application to datasets in which strain and serotype information were available for <i>S</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> found significant evidence for within-strain and within-serotype variation in invasiveness. The heterogeneous geographical distribution of these genotypes is therefore likely to contribute to differences in the impact of vaccination in between locations. Hence genomic surveillance of opportunistic pathogens is crucial for quantifying the effectiveness of public health interventions, and enabling ongoing meta-analyses that can identify new, highly invasive variants.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tool evaluation for the detection of variably sized indels from next generation whole genome and targeted sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ning Wang, Vladislav Lysenkov, Katri Orte, Veli Kairisto, Juhani Aakko, Sofia Khan, Laura L. Elo</p>

Insertions and deletions (indels) in human genomes are associated with a wide range of phenotypes, including various clinical disorders. High-throughput, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enable the detection of short genetic variants, such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels. However, the variant calling accuracy for indels remains considerably lower than for SNVs. Here we present a comparative study of the performance of variant calling tools for indel calling, evaluated with a wide repertoire of NGS datasets. While there is no single optimal tool to suit all circumstances, our results demonstrate that the choice of variant calling tool greatly impacts the precision and recall of indel calling. Furthermore, to reliably detect indels, it is essential to choose NGS technologies that offer a long read length and high coverage coupled with specific variant calling tools.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Further evidence for the capacity of mirror self-recognition in cleaner fish and the significance of ecologically relevant marks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Masanori Kohda, Shumpei Sogawa, Alex L. Jordan, Naoki Kubo, Satoshi Awata, Shun Satoh, Taiga Kobayashi, Akane Fujita, Redouan Bshary</p>

An animal that tries to remove a mark from its body that is only visible when looking into a mirror displays the capacity for mirror self-recognition (MSR), which has been interpreted as evidence for self-awareness. Conservative interpretations of existing data conclude that convincing evidence for MSR is currently restricted to great apes. Here, we address proposed shortcomings of a previous study on MSR in the cleaner wrasse <i>Labroides dimidiatus</i>, by varying preexposure to mirrors and by marking individuals with different colors. We found that (1) 14/14 new individuals scraped their throat when a brown mark had been provisioned, but only in the presence of a mirror; (2) blue and green color marks did not elicit scraping; (3) intentionally injecting the mark deeper beneath the skin reliably elicited spontaneous scraping in the absence of a mirror; (4) mirror-naive individuals injected with a brown mark scraped their throat with lower probability and/or lower frequency compared to mirror-experienced individuals; (5) in contrast to the mirror images, seeing another fish with the same marking did not induce throat scraping; and (6) moving the mirror to another location did not elicit renewed aggression in mirror-experienced individuals. Taken together, these results increase our confidence that cleaner fish indeed pass the mark test, although only if it is presented in ecologically relevant contexts. Therefore, we reiterate the conclusion of the previous study that either self-awareness in animals or the validity of the mirror test needs to be revised.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Develop and assess the psychometric property test on Burdened Care Caregiver Scale-Thai Version for Schizophrenia and Co-occurring Methamphetamine Use [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The objective of the present study was to develop the Thai version of the Impact and Burden of Care Scale for Caregivers of Persons with Schizophrenia and Co-occurring Methamphetamine Use (TIBSCSM) and test its psychometric properties. Methods: This instrument development research subjects were 142 caregivers of persons with schizophrenia and co-occurring methamphetamine use. Sample size adequacy was tested by Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett's test of sphericity tested the adequacy of the item correlation matrix. The second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the theoretical model. Results The 32-item TIBSCSM showed convergent validity correlations with two quality-of-life measures. Additionally, KMO=0.9, Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity χ2=5248.5, df=496, p<0.001, CVI =1, and internal consistency reliability was high (α=0.9). The CFA has shown that the findings are supported by the theoretical models (χ2=325.2, df=287, p<0.001, RMSEA=0.0, CFI =0.9). Conclusion: The TIBSCSM scale has potential benefits for psychiatric nurses and psychiatric care teams to measure the impact and care burden of caregivers of persons with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use in the areas of nursing, research, education, and clinical determination. The test results suggested that The TIBSCSM scale has potential benefits for psychiatric and mental health care team to assess the impact and burden care of schizophrenic caregiver for both research and clinical purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic for providing care to relieve the impact and burden of care. Implication for nursing and research: The TIBSCSM is a new tool developed in the Thai context, and it may replicate the studies to evaluate variations in TIBSCSM across settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cohort study on educational well-being of children of Chinese origin adopted into transracial and international families in the Spanish education system [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The following dataset focuses on the educational well-being of adopted girls of Chinese origin in Spanish schools. Due to its characteristics, the presence of this group may generate complex interaction dynamics in school; particularly regarding bullying in school linked to factors such as the acceptance of others. These are dynamics, which may indeed condition the educational experience of this social group. Therefore, the aim of creating this dataset is to measure the educational well-being of children of Chinese origin adopted into transracial families in Spain. Although this research was justified by the lack of studies on this social group, we aimed to go one-step further, we also studied the correlation between this social group’s educational experience, and to what extent they show an interest in Chinese culture. As we have written before, we incorporated the concept of Well-Being and we worked with the following indicators: Satisfaction with Life, Social Life, and Bullying in School, Racial Bullying, Personal Identity and Interest in Chinese Culture. To achieve the objective set forth, we conducted a questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 268 individuals. The creation of this dataset provided us with information that can shed light on the relationship between adoption, race/ethnicity and the educational experience of adopted children of Chinese origin.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cross-sectional assessment of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with knee osteoarthritis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are prevalent in India. However, there is dearth of literature among Indians studying the relationship between the two. This study was carried out to assess various cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in patients with knee OA with an objective to investigate their association, screening and management.  Methods: In total, 225 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were diagnosed with knee OA on the basis of the Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) classification of their radiograph. Participants were also assessed for CV risk factors; age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, smoking. Joint British Society QRisk3 calculator (JBS3) a comprehensive risk score calculator as well as a screening tool, which produces three more variables, namely 10-years risk of developing CVD, physiological heart age and life expectancy, was used. Chi Square, Fishers exact test and one-way ANOVA tests were used to compare the categorical and quantitative variables, respectively.. Multiple regression analysis was done to adjust the multiple con-founders and determine their significance. Results: Patients with severe knee OA had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of CV risk factors (p<0.05). Grade 4 knee OA patients were found to have a mean JBS3 risk of 38%, heart age of 82 years and life expectancy of 77 years as compared to grade 2 patients who had a mean JBS3 risk of 11%, heart age of 63 years and life expectancy of 82 years.  Conclusions: Our study concluded that there is a strong relation between knee OA and CVD, with CV risk score being positively correlated to the severity of OA.

                Background: Patient satisfaction is an important measure of health service and a key indicator of the quality of health service. Studies focus on how to improve quality rather than patient satisfaction. This study was conducted to identify patients’ satisfaction with the pharmaceutical service package of Health Insurance Corporation of Khartoum State in Jabal-Awliya locality, Khartoum, Sudan.  Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Satisfaction was estimated using the Likert Scale. The association between patient’s satisfaction and patient care indicators, namely: average dispensing time, percentage of medicine dispensed and labelled, and patient correct dose knowledge were assessed using Chi- square test, where a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.   Results: Out of 378 participants, the mean age was 47 with a comparable frequency of male and female participants (49.3% and 50.7% respectively). The mean satisfaction was 62.2% (3.11 ± 0.68). Most of the participants were satisfied with the way the pharmacist dealt with them (3.7, ± 0.778), while a low mean of satisfaction was reported regarding the availability of medicine within the pharmaceutical benefit package (2.06, ± 1.17). Average dispensing time was 5.78 minutes (p = 0.002), a low percentage of medicine actually dispensed and labelled was observed at 67% and 58% respectively (p = 0.00). A higher patient knowledge was reported 96.6% (p = 0.00), and the majority of the patients were able to pay 65% (p = 0.00).  Conclusion: The current study demonstrates a comparable satisfaction score. However, medication unavailability is the main factor that affects patient satisfaction.

                Background: Major depression (MD) is a prevalent and disabling condition in Chile. Most MD cases are treated at the primary care level. In Chilean primary care, the authors have gathered evidence of a prevalent complex depression subtype associated with a worse prognosis and characterized by interpersonal difficulties, suicidality and trauma history. This MD presentation suggests the need for a multidimensional, trauma-informed and interprofessional approach. The present study protocol describes the context, hypotheses and methods for a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) comparing a collaborative multidimensional approach and usual care in treatment outcomes of MD in primary care in Chile. Methods: This is a two-arm, single-blinded, cluster RCT to compare the efficacy of a collaborative multidimensional approach for depression (CMAD) versus usual care to treat MD in primary care clinics in Chile. In total, 394 depressed adults from 18 to 65 years of age in twelve clinics located in Chile’s Maule Region will be consented to participate in the study. Patients and care teams from each clinic will be randomized to the intervention or to the control arm. Interprofessional teams in the intervention arm will attend 27 hours of didactic and active learning sessions focused on clinical competences to effectively engage, treat and follow up patients with complex presentation of MD. Team in the control arm will receive 27 didactic sessions on current clinical guidelines for MD, professionals in both arms will receive 27 hours of continued education. Discussion: To improve treatment outcomes of MD in Chile, primary care teams should develop clinical competencies relevant to complex, difficult-to-treat types of MD within collaborative and trauma-informed approaches.

                The retrosplenial cortex (RC) is a brain structure crucial for spatial navigation and memory. It contains neurons such as head direction cells, border cells, as well as other cells supporting spatial and contextual encoding. How such complex and diverse neuronal properties are generated by RC microcircuitry and how they jointly orchestrate subsequent behavior remains enigmatic. Here, we consider recent findings that extend current knowledge about how the RC modulates spatial navigation and spatial cognition.

                De novo protein synthesis is required for long-term memory consolidation. Dynamic regulation of protein synthesis occurs via a complex interplay of translation factors and modulators. Many components of the protein synthesis machinery have been targeted either pharmacologically or genetically to establish its requirement for memory. The combination of ligand/light-gating and genetic strategies, that is, chemogenetics and optogenetics, has begun to reveal the spatiotemporal resolution of protein synthesis in specific cell types during memory consolidation.

                Cholesterol homeostasis is vital for brain function. Brain cholesterol is locally synthesized, with varying synthesis capacities across different cell types. Moreover, brain cholesterol horizontally transfers across various cell types not only to accommodate distinct cholesterol needs, but also to fulfill regulatory functions in target cells. Cholesterol metabolism within individual cell types is essential for brain functioning, and the role of cholesterol-related communication between different cell types is gaining growing recognition.

                Stress disorders are leading causes of disease burden in the U.S. and worldwide, yet available therapies are fully effective in less than half of all individuals with these disorders. Although to date, much of the focus has been on neuron-intrinsic mechanisms, emerging evidence suggests that chronic stress can affect a wide range of cell types in the brain and periphery, which are linked to maladaptive behavioral outcomes. Here, we synthesize emerging literature and discuss mechanisms of how non-neuronal cells in limbic regions of brain interface at synapses, the neurovascular unit, and other sites of intercellular communication to mediate the deleterious, or adaptive (i.e., pro-resilient), effects of chronic stress in rodent models and in human stress-related disorders.

                Although the CA2 hippocampal region is essential for social memory and detection of social novelty, the inputs that provide social information to CA2 are unknown. We found that social memory depends on the direct inputs CA2 receives from the lateral entorhinal cortex. As this input is activated similarly by novel and familiar individuals, CA2 itself may compute novelty.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Differential dendritic integration of long-range inputs in association cortex via subcellular changes in synaptic AMPA-to-NMDA receptor ratio</a></h4>

              
                Lafourcade et al. reveal that apical oblique dendrites of retrosplenial cortical L5 neurons exhibit unexpectedly linear integration compared with basal and tuft branches via increased synaptic AMPA:NMDA. Long-range inputs are targeted to these distinct dendritic domains, supporting the idea that single neurons perform a diverse range of subcellular processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Discovery of coordinately regulated pathways that provide innate protection against interbacterial antagonism</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial survival is fraught with antagonism, including that deriving from viruses and competing bacterial cells. It is now appreciated that bacteria mount complex antiviral responses; however, whether a coordinated defense against bacterial threats is undertaken is not well understood. Previously we showed that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> possess a danger sensing pathway that is a critical fitness determinant during competition against other bacteria. Here, we conducted genome-wide screens in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> that reveal three conserved and widespread interbacterial antagonism resistance clusters (<i>arc1-3</i>). We find that although <i>arc1-3</i> are coordinately activated by the Gac/Rsm danger sensing system, they function independently and provide idiosyncratic defense capabilities, distinguishing them from general stress response pathways. Our findings demonstrate that Arc3 family proteins provide specific protection against phospholipase toxins by preventing the accumulation of lysophospholipids in a manner distinct from previously characterized membrane repair systems. These findings liken the response of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to bacterial threats to that of eukaryotic innate immunity, wherein threat detection leads to the activation of specialized defense systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allele-specific gene expression can underlie altered transcript abundance in zebrafish mutants</a></h4>

              
                In model organisms, RNA sequencing is frequently used to assess the effect of genetic mutations on cellular and developmental processes. Typically, animals heterozygous for a mutation are crossed to produce offspring with different genotypes. Resultant embryos are grouped by genotype to compare homozygous mutant embryos to heterozygous and wild-type siblings. Genes that are differentially expressed between the groups are assumed to reveal insights into the pathways affected by the mutation. Here we show that in zebrafish, differentially expressed genes are often overrepresented on the same chromosome as the mutation due to different levels of expression of alleles from different genetic backgrounds. Using an incross of haplotype-resolved wild-type fish, we found evidence of widespread allele-specific expression, which appears as differential expression when comparing embryos homozygous for a region of the genome to their siblings. When analysing mutant transcriptomes, this means that the differential expression of genes on the same chromosome as a mutation of interest may not be caused by that mutation. Typically, the genomic location of a differentially expressed gene is not considered when interpreting its importance with respect to the phenotype. This could lead to pathways being erroneously implicated or overlooked due to the noise of spurious differentially expressed genes on the same chromosome as the mutation. These observations have implications for the interpretation of RNA-seq experiments involving outbred animals and non-inbred model organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping the functional connectivity of ecosystem services supply across a regional landscape</a></h4>

              
                Sustainably managing multifunctional landscapes for production of multiple ecosystem services (ES) requires thorough understanding of the interactions between ES and the ecological processes that drive them. We build upon landscape connectivity theory to present a spatial approach for assessing functional connections between multiple ES at the landscape scale, and take a closer look at the concept of ES interactions by explicitly representing the mechanisms behind the relationships between ES. We demonstrate application of the approach using existing ES supply mapping data for plant agriculture, waterflow regulation, and landscape aesthetics and map the functional connectivity between them. We find that, when weights of all linkages were amalgamated, areas of high-value connectivity are revealed that are not present on any individual ES supply area or pairwise link maps, which suggests that the spatial focus of planning for optimal service provisioning may shift when functional relationships between several ES are considered. From water flow supply areas, our modeling maps several functional connections that operate over both short and long distances, which highlights the importance of managing ES flows both locally and across jurisdictions. We also found that different land use and land cover types than those associated with ES supply areas may be serving as critical corridors connecting interdependent ES. By providing spatial information on ES connectivity, our approach enables local and regional environmental planning and management to take full consideration of the complex, multi-scale interactions between ecological processes, land use and land cover, and ecosystem service supply on a landscape.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Constructing the hierarchy of predictive auditory sequences in the marmoset brain</a></h4>

              
                Our brains constantly generate predictions of sensory input that are compared with actual inputs, propagate the prediction-errors through a hierarchy of brain regions, and subsequently update the internal predictions of the world. However, the essential feature of predictive coding, the notion of hierarchical depth and its neural mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the hierarchical depth of predictive auditory processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density whole-brain electrocorticography (ECoG) in marmoset monkeys during an auditory local-global paradigm in which the temporal regularities of the stimuli were designed at two hierarchical levels. The prediction-errors and prediction updates were examined as neural responses to auditory mismatches and omissions. Using fMRI, we identified a hierarchical gradient along the auditory pathway: midbrain and sensory regions represented local, shorter-time-scale predictive processing followed by associative auditory regions, whereas anterior temporal and prefrontal areas represented global, longer-time-scale sequence processing. The complementary ECoG recordings confirmed the activations at cortical surface areas and further differentiated the signals of prediction-error and update, which were transmitted via putative bottom-up g and top-down b oscillations, respectively. Furthermore, omission responses caused by absence of input, reflecting solely the two levels of prediction signals that are unique to the hierarchical predictive coding framework, demonstrated the hierarchical top-down process of predictions in the auditory, temporal, and prefrontal areas. Thus, our findings support the hierarchical predictive coding framework, and outline how neural networks and spatiotemporal dynamics are used to represent and arrange a hierarchical structure of auditory sequences in the marmoset brain.

                The ventricular zone (VZ) of the nervous system contains radial glia cells that were originally considered relatively homogenous in their gene expression, but a detailed characterization of transcriptional diversity in these VZ cells has not been reported. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity of neural progenitors within the VZ and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the ganglionic eminences (GEs), the source of all forebrain GABAergic neurons. By using a transgenic mouse line to enrich for VZ cells, we characterize significant transcriptional heterogeneity, both between GEs and within spatial subdomains of specific GEs. Additionally, we observe differential gene expression between E12.5 and E14.5 VZ cells, which could provide insights into temporal changes in cell fate. Together, our results reveal a previously unknown spatial and temporal genetic diversity of VZ cells in the ventral forebrain that will aid our understanding of initial fate decisions in the forebrain.

                The cytoskeleton network of eukaryotic cells is essential for diverse cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cell motility and immunity, thus is a common target for bacterial virulence factors. A number of effectors from the bacterial pathogen <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> have been shown to modulate the function of host actin cytoskeleton to construct the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) permissive for its intracellular replication. In this study, we found that the Dot/Icm effector Lem8 (Lpg1290) is a protease whose activity is catalyzed by a Cys-His-Asp motif known to be associated with diverse biochemical activities. Intriguingly, we found that Lem8 interacts with the host regulatory protein 14-3-3ζ, which activates its protease activity. Furthermore, Lem8 undergoes self-cleavage in a process that requires 14-3-3ζ. We identified the Pleckstrin homology-like domain-containing protein Phldb2 involved in cytoskeleton organization as a target of Lem8 and demonstrated that Lem8 plays a role in the inhibition of host cell migration by attacking Phldb2.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Different computations over the same inputs produce selective behavior in algorithmic brain networks</a></h4>

              
                A key challenge in neuroimaging remains to understand where, when, and now particularly <i>how</i> human brain networks compute over sensory inputs to achieve behavior. To study such dynamic algorithms from mass neural signals, we recorded the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity of participants who resolved the classic XOR, OR, and AND functions as overt behavioral tasks (N = 10 participants/task, N-of-1 replications). Each function requires a different computation over the same inputs to produce the task-specific behavioral outputs. In each task, we found that source-localized MEG activity progresses through four computational stages identified within individual participants: (1) initial contralateral representation of each visual input in occipital cortex, (2) a joint linearly combined representation of both inputs in midline occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus, followed by (3) nonlinear task-dependent input integration in temporal-parietal cortex, and finally (4) behavioral response representation in postcentral gyrus. We demonstrate the specific dynamics of each computation at the level of individual sources. The spatiotemporal patterns of the first two computations are similar across the three tasks; the last two computations are task specific. Our results therefore reveal where, when, and how dynamic network algorithms perform different computations over the same inputs to produce different behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glycan processing in the Golgi: optimal information coding and constraints on cisternal number and enzyme specificity</a></h4>

              
                Many proteins that undergo sequential enzymatic modification in the Golgi cisternae are displayed at the plasma membrane as cell identity markers. The modified proteins, called glycans, represent a molecular code. The fidelity of this glycan code is measured by how accurately the glycan synthesis machinery realises the desired target glycan distribution for a particular cell type and niche. In this paper, we construct a simplified chemical synthesis model to quantitatively analyse the tradeoffs between the number of cisternae, and the number and specificity of enzymes, required to synthesize a prescribed target glycan distribution of a certain complexity to within a given fidelity. We find that to synthesize complex distributions, such as those observed in real cells, one needs to have multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning in the Golgi. Additionally, for fixed number of enzymes and cisternae, there is an optimal level of specificity (promiscuity) of enzymes that achieves the target distribution with high fidelity. The geometry of the fidelity landscape in the multidimensional space of the number and specificity of enzymes, inter-cisternal transfer rates, and number of cisternae, provides a measure for robustness and identifies stiff and sloppy directions. Our results show how the complexity of the target glycan distribution and number of glycosylation enzymes places functional constraints on the Golgi cisternal number and enzyme specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in insular gyri responses to the cold pressor challenge</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Sex differences in autonomic control may contribute to physiological sex differences in cardiovascular disease, thermoregulation, and the experience of pain. We previously showed sex differences in functional mapping of autonomic responses across the insula, a central autonomic control region. Anterior insula response patterns to sympathetic activation (Valsalva) and parasympathetic withdrawal (handgrip) differed between men and women. We here assessed sex differences in autonomic insula gyrus responses to a cold pressor challenge, which involves temperature and pain regulation. Methods: Functional MRI (fMRI) involved a 1-minute right-foot cold pressor challenge in 22 women (age; mean{+/-}std: 50{+/-}4 yrs), and 39 men (45{+/-}3 yrs). Regions of interest (ROI) comprised left and right anterior short gyrus (ASG), middle short gyrus (MSG), posterior short gyrus (PSG), anterior long gyrus (ALG), and posterior long gyrus (PLG). Two-second time intervals of fMRI signal responses per ROI and concurrently recorded heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) were tested for within- and between-group effects over time (repeated measures ANOVA P [&le;]0.05). We tested sex differences in 1) each ROI; 2) lateralization effects; and 3) posterior-to-anterior gradients in responses. Results: No sex differences emerged in heart rate or SaO 2 . Women showed larger signal changes in several gyri than men after cold pressor onset and offset. Most consistently, women showed a greater right-over-left hemisphere dominance in cold pressor response compared to men in the MSG, PSG and ALG. Greater right-over-left hemisphere anterior-to-posterior dominance was more pronounced in men. Conclusions: The findings confirm anterior and right-hemispheric dominance of insular responses during sympathetic activation that includes pain and cold. Although distinct transient male-female differences in fMRI responses appeared during the cold pressor, unlike the Valsalva and handgrip, no sex differences in ASG lateralization emerged, suggesting that the previously found sex differences may not solely relate to regulating blood pressure responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisensory integration of social signals by a pathway from the basal amygdala to the auditory cortex in maternal mice</a></h4>

              
                Social encounters are inherently multimodal events, yet how and where social cues of distinct modalities merge and interact in the brain is poorly understood. For example, when their pups wander away from the nest, mother mice use a combination of vocal and olfactory signals emitted by the pups to locate and retrieve them. Previous work revealed the emergence of multisensory interactions in the auditory cortex (AC) of both dams and virgins who co-habitate with pups ('surrogates'). Here we identify a neural pathway that integrates information about odors with responses to sound. We found that a scattered population of glutamatergic neurons in the basal amygdala (BA) projects to the AC and responds to odors, including the smell of pups. These neurons also exhibit increased activity when the surrogate female is searching for pups. Finally, we show that selective optogenetic activation of BA-AC neurons modulates responses to pup calls, and that this modulation switches from predominantly suppressive to predominantly excitatory after maternal experience. This supports an underappreciated role for the amygdala in directly shaping sensory representations in an experience-dependent manner. We propose that the BA-AC pathway integrates olfaction and audition to facilitate maternal care, and speculate that it may carry valence information to the AC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity of the inferior frontal gyrus: A meta-analytic connectivity modeling study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neurocognitive models of language processing highlight the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the functional network underlying language. Furthermore, neuroscience research has shown that IFG is not a uniform region anatomically, cytoarchitectonically or functionally. However, no previous study explored the language-related functional connectivity patterns of different IFG subdivisions using a meta-analytic connectivity approach. Purpose: The present meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) study aimed to identify language-related coactivation patterns of the left and right IFG subdivisions. Method: Six regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using a probabilistic brain atlas corresponding to pars opercularis (BA44), pars triangularis (BA45) and pars orbitalis (Fo6&7) of IFG in both hemispheres. The ROIs were used to search the BrainMap functional database to identify neuroimaging experiments with healthy, right-handed participants reporting language-related activations in each ROI. Activation likelihood estimation analyses were then performed on the foci extracted from the identified studies to compute functional convergence for each ROI, which was also contrasted with the other ROIs within the same hemisphere. In addition, a behavioral analysis was conducted to determine functional specificity for language subdomains within each ROI. Results: A primarily left-lateralized functional network was revealed for the left and right IFG subdivisions. The left IFG ROIs exhibited a more robust coactivation pattern than the right IFG ROIs. In particular, the left posterior-dorsal IFG (BA44) was associated with the most extensive coactivation pattern involving bilateral frontal, bilateral parietal, left temporal, left subcortical (thalamus and putamen), and right cerebellar regions, while the left anterior-ventral IFG (BA45 and Fo6&7) revealed a predominantly left-lateralized involvement of frontotemporal regions. Conclusion: The findings align with the neurocognitive models of language processing that propose a division of labor among the left IFG subdivisions and their respective functional networks. Also, the opercular part of left IFG (BA44) stands out as a major hub in the language network with connections to diverse cortical, subcortical and cerebellar structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A call to rethink the cognitive benefits of physical exercise: An umbrella review of randomized controlled trials</a></h4>

              
                Many meta-analytic reviews have examined the cognitive benefits of regular physical exercise across the lifespan, with a wide range of inclusion criteria and disparate analytic approaches. In fact, most global health organizations incorporate the purported cognitive benefits as part of their policies to promote regular physical exercise. We assess whether those claims are well supported by scientific evidence. We conducted a pre-registered (PROSPERO: CRD42020191357) umbrella review of meta-analyses limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on exercise-cognition. Outcomes of each meta-analysis were reanalyzed following a multilevel model approach. Publication bias was also analyzed to correct final effect sizes. Most of the 12 reviewed meta-analyses reported a positive small effect (d = 0.21, [0.07 0.40]) of physical exercise across all cognitive domains in all life stages. However, a critical assessment of the primary studies included in these reviews and the meta-analytic approaches used indicates that the evidence might not be reliable and therefore no strong conclusions should be drawn based on the existing evidence. We found that the literature has undergone an unusually rapid growth upon underpowered RCTs and potentially biased meta-analytic reviews. The exponential accumulation of low-quality evidence on the exercise-cognition topic has led to stagnation in the field, hindering the discernment of the potential impact of exercise on cognition. We urge worldwide organizations committed to public health to reconsider their recommendations on the promotion of regular physical exercise to boost cognitive functions in the healthy population until high-quality empirical evidence confirms these exercise-induced cognitive benefits.

                Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) where neuroinflammation underlies disease progression and pathogenesis. Unresolved inflammation in AD is known to be exacerbated by brain deficits in unesterified pro-resolving lipid mediators enzymatically synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Recently, we reported that in the brain, unesterified pro-resolving lipid mediators which are bioactive, can also be supplied from less bioactive esterified lipid pools such as neutral lipids (NLs) and phospholipids (PLs). It is not known whether esterified pro-resolving lipid mediators are affected by AD pathology and exacerbated by TRAP exposure. In the present study we addressed this data gap using TgF344-AD male and female rats that express human AD risk genes and their wildtype littermates exposed to filtered air (FA) or TRAP from 1 to 15 months of age. Esterified lipid mediators within NLs and PLs were quantified by mass-spectrometry. We observed a significant reduction in pro-resolving lipid mediators in both NLs and PLs of female TgF344-AD rats compared to wildtype controls. TRAP exposure also reduced pro-resolving lipids in the female brain, mainly in PL pools, but did not exacerbate changes observed in TgF344-AD rats. Minimal changes were observed in males. Our findings indicate that AD genotype and chronic TRAP exposure result in sex-specific deficits in brain esterified pro-resolving lipid mediators, the pool that supplies free and bioactive lipid mediators. These data provide new information on lipid-mediated mechanisms regulating impaired inflammation resolution in AD, and show for the first time that chronic TRAP exposure targets the same lipid network implicated in AD.

                Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinsonism. The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. ATXN2 (or Atx2 in insects) can function in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Previous work has shown that the LSm (Like-Sm) domain of Atx2, which can help stimulate mRNA translation, antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE), co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein (PABP) interacting, PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Transgenic experiments in Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration.

                Electrophysiological signatures of ischemic stroke might help to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of recovery. Here, analyses of multichannel electrocorticography (ECoG) in awake mice demonstrated that the shape of power spectral density (PSD) is modulated in the vicinity of sensory cortical stroke. PSD consists of both rhythmic oscillatory and non-rhythmic, aperiodic components. The alteration of spectrum shape was reflected in a transient increase of aperiodic exponents, while the relative power and frequency of slow oscillations remained unchanged in the peri-infarct cortex. Exponents derived from motor areas significantly correlated with recovery of fine motor deficits of the contralateral forepaw thus indicating functional modifications of neuronal activity. In conclusion, aperiodic spectral exponents exhibited a unique spatiotemporal profile in the mouse cortex after stroke and might complement future studies providing a dynamic link from pathophysiology to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An electrophysiological and behavioral model of Paramecium, the "swimming neuron"</a></h4>

              
                Paramecium is a large unicellular organism that swims in fresh water using cilia. When stimulated by various means (mechanically, chemically, optically, thermally), it often swims backward then turns and swims forward again in a new direction: this is called the avoiding reaction. This reaction is triggered by a calcium-based action potential. For this reason, several authors have called Paramecium the "swimming neuron". Here we present an empirically constrained model of its action potential based on electrophysiology experiments on live immobilized paramecia, together with simultaneous measurement of ciliary beating using particle image velocimetry. Using these measurements and additional behavioral measurements of free swimming, we extend the electrophysiological model by coupling calcium concentration to kinematic parameters, turning it into a swimming model. In this way, we obtain a model of autonomously behaving Paramecium. Finally, we demonstrate how the modeled organism interacts with an environment, can follow gradients and display collective behavior. This work provides a modeling basis for investigating the physiological basis of autonomous behavior of Paramecium in ecological environments.

                Neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex (area LIP) represent the formation of a decision when it is linked to a specific action, such as an eye movement to a choice target. However, these neurons should be unable to represent a decision that transpires across actions that would disrupt this linkage. We investigated this limitation by recording simultaneously from many neurons. While intervening actions disrupt the representation by single neurons, the ensemble achieves continuity of the decision process by passing information from currently active neurons to neurons that will become active after the action. In this way, the representation of an evolving decision can be generalized across actions and transcends the frame of reference that specifies the neural response fields. The finding extends previous observations of receptive field remapping, thought to support the stability of perception across eye movements, to the continuity of a thought process, such as a decision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual consequences of interocular imbalances in the duration of temporal integration</a></h4>

              
                Temporal differences in visual information processing between the eyes can cause dramatic misperceptions of motion and depth. Processing delays between the eyes cause the Pulfrich effect: oscillating targets in the frontal plane are misperceived as moving along near-elliptical motion trajectories in depth (Pulfrich, 1922). Here, we explain a previously reported but poorly understood variant: the anomalous Pulfrich effect. When this variant is perceived, the illusory motion trajectory appears oriented left- or right-side back in depth, rather than aligned with the true direction of motion. Our data indicate that this perceived misalignment is due to interocular differences in neural temporal integration periods, as opposed to interocular differences in delay. For oscillating motion, differences in the duration of temporal integration dampen the effective motion amplitude in one eye relative to the other. In a dynamic analog of the Geometric effect in stereo-surface-orientation perception (Ogle, 1950), the different motion amplitudes cause the perceived misorientation of the motion trajectories. Forced-choice psychophysical experiments, conducted with either different spatial frequencies and/or different onscreen motion damping in the two eyes, show that the perceived misorientation in depth is associated with the eye having greater motion damping. A target-tracking experiment provided more direct evidence that the anomalous Pulfrich effect is caused by interocular differences in temporal integration and delay. These findings highlight the computational hurdles posed to the visual system by temporal differences in sensory processing. Future work will explore how the visual system overcomes these challenges to achieve accurate perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep duration and brain structure - phenotypic associations and genotypic covariance</a></h4>

              
                The question of how much sleep is best for the brain attracts scientific and public interest, and there is concern that insuficient sleep leads to poorer brain health. However, it is unknown how much sleep is sufficient and how much is too much. We analyzed 51,295 brain magnetic resonnance images from 47,039 participants, and calculated the self-reported sleep duration associated with the largest regional volumes and smallest ventricles relative to intracranial volume (ICV) and thickest cortex. 6.8 hours of sleep was associated with the most favorable brain outcome overall. Critical values, defined by 95% confidence intervals, were 5.7 and 7.9 hours. There was regional variation, with for instance the hippocampus showing largest volume at 6.3 hours. Moderately long sleep (> 8 hours) was more strongly associated with smaller relative volumes, thinner cortex and larger ventricles than even very short sleep (< 5 hours), but effect sizes were modest. People with larger ICV reported longer sleep (7.5 hours), so not correcting for ICV yielded longer durations associated with maximal volume. Controlling for socioeconomic status, body mass index and depression symptoms did not alter the associations. Genetic analyses showed that genes related to longer sleep in short sleepers were related to shorter sleep in long sleepers. This may indicate a genetically controlled homeostatic regulation of sleep duration. Mendelian randomization analyses did not suggest sleep duration to have a causal impact on brain structure in the analyzed datasets. The findings challenge the notion that habitual short sleep is negatively related to brain structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">2-Arachodonoylglycerol-mediated endocannabinoid signaling modulates mechanical hypersensitivity associated with alcohol withdrawal in mice</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUDs) commonly co-occurs in patients with chronic pain, and a major barrier to achieving abstinence and preventing relapse is the emergence of hyperalgesia during alcohol withdrawal. Elucidating novel therapeutic approaches to target hyperalgesia associated with alcohol withdrawal could have important implications for the treatment of AUD. Here we examined the role of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)-mediated endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling in the regulation of hyperalgesia associated with alcohol withdrawal in mice and tested the hypothesis that pharmacological augmentation of 2-AG signaling could reduce hyperalgesia during withdrawal. After 72 hours of withdrawal from a continuous access two-bottle choice drinking paradigm, male and female mice exhibited increased mechanical but not thermal hypersensitivity, which normalized by 7 days. This effect was reversed by pretreatment with the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor JZL184, which elevates levels of 2-AG. The effects of JZL184 were prevented by coadministration of either a CB1 or CB2 antagonist. Inhibition of the 2-AG synthetic enzyme diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) with DO34 exacerbated mechanical hypersensitivity during alcohol withdrawal, causing an earlier onset and persistent hypersensitivity even one week into withdrawal. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of 2-AG signaling in the bidirectional regulation of mechanical sensitivity during alcohol withdrawal, with enhancement of 2-AG levels reducing sensitivity, and inhibition of 2-AG synthesis exacerbating sensitivity. These data suggest 2-AG augmentation could represent a novel approach to the treatment of alcohol withdrawal-associated hyperalgesia and AUD in patients with comorbid pain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contribution of individual excitatory synapses on dendritic spines to electrical signaling</a></h4>

              
                Even though dendritic spines are widely considered the elementary computational units of the brain, the current understanding of the exact contribution of individual synapses on spines to the electrical signaling in neurons is incomplete. We combined the techniques of whole-cell recording and voltage imaging to monitor directly unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by two-photon glutamate uncaging (uEPSPs) on individual dendritic spines. We analyzed the initiation, temporal summation, and propagation of uEPSPs from the spine head to the parent dendrite and to the cell body in neocortical pyramidal neurons. Our measurements show no significant attenuation of uEPSPs across the spine neck in different types of pyramidal neurons. This result implies that spine synapses are not electrically isolated from parent dendrites and that spines do not serve a meaningful electrical role. Using the same techniques, we next characterized temporal summation of uEPSPs induced at individual spine synapses by repetitive glutamate uncaging mimicking burst activity of presynaptic neurons. We found that pharmacological block of desensitization of AMPA receptors increased the amplitude of cumulative uEPSP response in the spines head and, consequently, in parent dendrite and soma. Thus, responses to high frequency repetitive quantal EPSPs are strictly limited in amplitude and waveform by AMPA receptor desensitization at the site of origin thereby preventing synaptic saturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inferring monosynaptic connections from paired dendritic spine Ca2+ imaging and large-scale recording of extracellular spiking</a></h4>

              
                Techniques to identify monosynaptic connections between neurons have been vital for neuroscience research, facilitating important advancements concerning network topology, synaptic plasticity, and synaptic integration, among others. Here, we introduce a novel approach to identify and monitor monosynaptic connections using high-resolution dendritic spine Ca2+ imaging combined with simultaneous large-scale recording of extracellular electrical activity by means of high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). We introduce an easily adoptable analysis pipeline that associates the imaged spine with its presynaptic unit and test it on in vitro recordings. The method is further validated and optimized by simulating synaptically-evoked spine Ca2+ transients based on measured spike trains in order to obtain simulated ground-truth connections. The proposed approach offers unique advantages as i) it can be used to identify monosynaptic connections with an accurate localization of the synapse within the dendritic tree, ii) it provides precise information of presynaptic spiking, and iii) postsynaptic spine Ca2+ signals and, finally, iv) the non-invasive nature of the proposed method allows for long-term measurements. The analysis toolkit together with the rich data sets that were acquired are made publicly available for further exploration by the research community.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of auditory sleep modulation approaches on brain oscillatory and cardiovascular dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Sleep modulation techniques to elucidate the functional role of sleep brain oscillations in brain and body functions have gained large interest. Slow waves, the hallmark feature of deep non-rapid eye movement sleep, do potentially drive restorative effects on brain and cardiovascular functions. Auditory stimulation to modulate slow waves is a promising tool, however, directly comparing different auditory stimulation approaches within a night and analyzing induced dynamic brain and cardiovascular effects are yet missing. Here, we tested various auditory stimulation approaches in a windowed, 10 s ON (stimulations) followed by 10 s OFF (no stimulations), within-night stimulation design and compared them to a SHAM control condition. We report the results of three studies and a total of 51 included stimulation nights. We found a large and global increase in slow wave activity (SWA) in the stimulation window compared to SHAM. Furthermore, slow wave dynamics were most pronouncedly increased at the start of the stimulation and declined across the stimulation window. Beyond the changes in brain oscillations, we observed, for some conditions, a significant increase in the mean interval between two heartbeats within a stimulation window, indicating a slowing of the heart rate, and increased heart rate variability derived parasympathetic activity. Those cardiovascular changes were positively correlated with the change in SWA and thus, our findings provide mechanistic insight into the potential of auditory slow wave enhancement to modulate cardiovascular restorative conditions during sleep. However, future studies need to investigate whether the potentially increased restorative capacity through slow wave enhancements translates into a more rested cardiovascular system on the subsequent day.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain regional identity and cell type specificity landscape of human cortical organoid models</a></h4>

              
                In vitro models of corticogenesis using mouse and human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) have greatly improved our understanding of human brain development and disease. Among these, 3D cortical organoid systems are able to recapitulate some aspects of in vivo cytoarchitecture of the developing cortex. Here, we tested three cortical organoid protocols for brain regional identity, cell type-specificity and neuronal maturation. Overall all protocols gave rise to organoids that displayed a time-dependent expression of neuronal maturation genes such as those involved in the establishment of synapses and neuronal function. We showed that three months old cortical organoids showed a pattern of gene expression that resembled late human embryonic cortex. Comparatively, directed differentiation methods without WNT activation gave rise to the highest degree of cortical regional identity in brain organoids. Whereas, default intrinsic brain organoid differentiation produced the broadest range of cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and hematopoietic-lineage derived microglia cells of the brain. These results suggest that cortical organoid models produce diverse outcomes in terms of brain regional identity and cell type specificity and emphasize the importance of selecting the correct model for the right application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis reveals divergence of glial cells in peripheral somatosensory system between human and mouse</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells play a crucial role in regulating physiological and pathological functions, such as sensation, infections, acute injuries, and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Glial cells include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and satellite glial cells (SGCs) in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Despite the understanding of glial subtypes and functional heterogeneity in animal models achieved by single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing, no research has investigated the transcriptomic profiles of glial cells in the human PNS and spinal cord. Here, we used high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing to map the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of SGCs in the human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the human spinal cord. To explore the conservation and divergence across species, we compared these human findings with those from mice. Additionally, the expression profiles of risk genes of common DRG and spinal cord diseases in glial cells were compared between humans and mice. As a result, little SGCs heterogeneity was found in both human and mouse DRG. In the human spinal cord, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes were respectively divided into six distinct transcriptomic subclusters. In the mouse spinal cord, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes were divided into six, five, and six distinct transcriptomic subclusters, respectively. The comparative results revealed substantial heterogeneity in all glial cells between humans and mice. Notably, we also identified transcriptomic heterogeneity in several classical genes and risk genes for neurological disorders across humans and mice. Together, the present data comprehensively profiled glial cell heterogeneity and provides a powerful resource for investigating the cellular basis of glial-related physiological and pathological conditions in peripheral somatosensory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural insight into the individual variability architecture of the functional brain connectome</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition and behaviors depend upon the brain's functional connectomes, which vary remarkably across individuals. However, whether and how the functional connectome individual variability architecture is structurally constrained remains largely unknown. Using tractography- and morphometry-based network models, we observed the spatial convergence of structural and functional connectome individual variability, with higher variability in heteromodal association regions and lower variability in primary regions. We demonstrated that functional variability is significantly predicted by a unifying structural variability pattern and that this prediction follows a primary-to-heteromodal hierarchical axis, with higher prediction accuracy in primary regions and lower accuracy in heteromodal regions. We also decomposed group-level connectome variability patterns into individual unique contributions and uncovered the structural-functional correspondence that is associated with individual cognitive traits. These results advance our understanding of the structural basis of individual functional variability and suggest the importance of integrating multimodal connectome signatures for individual differences in cognition and behaviors.

                Abstract Background Healthy older adults show a decrease in motor learning capacity as well as in working memory (WM) performance. WM has been suggested to be involved in motor learning processes, such as sequence learning. Correlational evidence has shown the involvement of the fronto-parietal network (FPN), a network underlying WM processes, in motor sequence learning. However, causal evidence is currently lacking. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) studies have focused so far predominantly on motor related areas to enhance motor sequence learning while areas associated with more cognitive aspects of motor learning have not yet been addressed. Hypothesis In this study, we aim to provide causal evidence for the involvement of WM processes and the underlying FPN in successful motor sequence learning by using a theta transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) paradigm targeting the FPN during motor sequence learning. Methods In a cohort of 20 healthy older adults, we applied bifocal tACS in the theta range to the FPN during a sequence learning task. With the use of a double-blind, cross-over design, we tested the efficacy of active compared with sham stimulation. Two versions of the motor task were used: one with high and one with low WM load, to explore the efficacy of stimulation on tasks differing in WM demand. Additionally, the effects of stimulation on WM performance were addressed using an N-back task. The tACS frequency was personalized by means of EEG measuring the individual theta peak frequency during the N-back task. Results The application of personalized theta tACS to the FPN improved performance on the motor sequence learning task with high WM load (p <.001), but not with low WM load. Active stimulation significantly improved both speed (p <.001), and accuracy (p =.03) during the task with high WM load. In addition, the stimulation paradigm improved performance on the N-back task for the 2-back task (p = .013), but not for 1-back and 3-back. Conclusion Motor sequence learning can be enhanced with the use of personalized bifocal theta tACS to the FPN when WM load is high. This indicates that the efficacy of this stimulation paradigm is dependent on the cognitive demand during the learning task and provides further causal evidence for the critical involvement of WM processes and the FPN in motor sequence learning in healthy older adults. These findings open new exciting possibilities to counteract the age-related decline in motor learning capacity and WM performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predator odor (TMT) exposure potentiates interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol and increases GABAergic gene expression in the anterior insular cortex and nucleus accumbens in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) confers enhanced vulnerability to develop comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD). Exposure to the scent of a predator, such as the fox odor TMT, has been used to model a traumatic stressor with relevance to PTSD symptomatology. Alcohol produces distinct interoceptive (subjective) effects that may influence vulnerability to problem drinking and AUD. As such, understanding the lasting impact of stressor on sensitivity to the interoceptive effects of alcohol is clinically relevant. The present study used a 2-lever, operant drug discrimination procedure to train male, Long-Evans rats to discriminate the interoceptive effects of alcohol (2 g/kg, IG) from water. Upon stable performance, rats underwent a 15-min exposure to TMT. Two weeks later, an alcohol dose-response curve was conducted to evaluate the lasting effects of the TMT stressor on the interoceptive effects of alcohol. The TMT group showed a leftward shift in ED50 of the dose response curve compared to controls, reflecting potentiated interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol. TMT exposure did not affect response rate. GABAergic signaling in both the anterior insular cortex (aIC) and the nucleus accumbens (Acb) is involved in the interoceptive effects of alcohol and stressor-induced adaptations. As such, follow-up experiments in alcohol-naive rats examined neuronal activation (as measured by c-Fos immunoreactivity) following TMT and showed that TMT exposure increased c-Fos expression in the aIC and the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC). 2 weeks after TMT exposure, Gad-1 gene expression was elevated in the aIC and Gat-1 was increased in the Acb compared to controls. Lastly, the alcohol discrimination and alcohol-naive groups displayed dramatic differences in stress reactive behaviors during the TMT exposure, suggesting that alcohol exposure may alter the behavioral response to predator odor. Together, these data suggest that predator odor stressor results in potentiated sensitivity to alcohol possibly through GABAergic adaptations in the aIC and Acb, which may be relevant to understanding PTSD-AUD comorbidity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Botulinum neurotoxin accurately separates tonic vs phasic transmission and reveals heterosynaptic plasticity rules in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In developing and mature nervous systems, diverse neuronal subtypes innervate common targets to establish and maintain functional neural circuits. A major challenge towards understanding the structural and functional architecture of neural circuits is to separate these inputs and determine their intrinsic and heterosynaptic relationships. The Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction is a powerful model system to study these questions, where two glutamatergic motor neurons, the strong phasic-like Is and weak tonic-like Ib, co-innervate individual muscle targets to coordinate locomotor behavior. However, complete neurotransmission from each input has never been electrophysiologically separated. We have developed a botulinum neurotoxin, BoNT-C, that eliminates both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission without perturbing synaptic growth or structure, enabling the first approach that accurately isolates input-specific neurotransmission. Selective expression of BoNT-C in Is or Ib motor inputs disambiguates functional properties of each input. Importantly, the composite values of Is and Ib neurotransmission can be fully recapitulated by isolated physiology from each input. Finally, selective silencing by BoNT-C does not induce heterosynaptic structural or functional plasticity at the convergent input. Thus, BoNT-C establishes the first approach to cleanly separate neurotransmission between tonic vs phasic neurons and defines heterosynaptic plasticity rules in a powerful model glutamatergic circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociable misconfigurations of striatal functional connectivity profiles in smokers</a></h4>

              
                Corticostriatal circuits are central to reward processing and reinforcement learning functions that often become dysregulated in substance use disorder (SUD) and drive compulsive drug use. Human neuroimaging research seeking to identify how corticostriatal circuits become altered in SUD has primarily focused on evaluating connectivity between cortex-striatum node-pairs. Yet, striatal nodes receive appreciable input from many cortical nodes, and the morphological and electrophysiological properties of striatal nodes dictate that combinational features of their multivariate "connectivity profiles" shape their activity more so than any individual cortical node. Here, we introduce an approach for quantifying and statistically evaluating different types of multivariate connectivity profile configuration differences (i.e., aggregate divergence, rank order arrangement, and entropy shift) that may reflect different forms of circuit plasticity, and apply it to nicotine dependent smokers (n=46) as an exemplar SUD. Foremost, we find evidence of significant connectivity profile misconfiguration throughout much of the striatum, suggesting that prior findings of abnormal connections between individual striatal-cortical node-pairs may only represent the "tip of the iceberg" of corticostriatal circuit alteration in nicotine dependence. Moreover, we find that dorsolateral and ventromedial striatum display distinct types of connectivity profile misconfiguration. Whereas dorsolateral striatum almost exclusively displays abnormal rank order arrangement that is present in both the nicotine sated and acutely abstinent states - indicative of a "trait" misconfiguration - ventromedial striatum almost exclusively displays abnormal aggregate divergence that only manifests during acute abstinence - indicative of a "state" misconfiguration. Further, we identify a unique striatal site in the right caudal ventral putamen that displays multiple forms of connectivity profile misconfiguration, where connections with cognitive processing cortical areas overtake those with motor/premotor control cortical areas as the strongest in the connectivity profile, and acute abstinence significantly strengthens this abnormal arrangement. Moreover, the interactive magnitude of these misconfigurations during acute abstinence is significantly linked to dependence severity. Collectively, the present findings underscore the need for increased examination of connectivity profile misconfigurations as a mechanism of SUD etiology and as a potential guide for identifying therapeutic intervention targets.

                Myelin sheaths in the CNS are generated by the tips of oligodendrocyte processes, which wrap axons to accelerate action potential conduction, provide metabolic support and control excitability. Here we identify a distinct mode of myelination, conserved between zebrafish, mouse and human, in which oligodendrocytes extend myelin along individual axons by linking myelin sheaths across nodes of Ranvier (NoR). By forming thin extensions that cross NoR, which we term paranodal bridges, multiple sheaths can be connected to the soma by a single cytoplasmic process. Extensive in vivo live imaging-based analyses, complemented by serial electron microscopic reconstruction of paranodal bridges, revealed that many oligodendrocytes use this strategy to generate longer stretches of myelin along individual axons. In the mouse somatosensory cortex, paranodal bridges were particularly prevalent along the highly branched axons of parvalbumin expressing (PV) interneurons, which enabled oligodendrocytes to extend myelin sheaths around axon bifurcations. Sheaths at the distal ends of these chains of myelin degenerated more frequently in aged mice, suggesting that they may be more vulnerable to the aging brain environment. This previously undescribed and evolutionarily conserved feature of oligodendrocytes extends myelin coverage of individual axons without new oligodendrogenesis, which may reduce metabolic demand and preserve the fidelity of action potential propagation at axon branch points.

                We report consistent increases in phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) expression in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (3xTg-AD) and related tauopathy (PS19), particularly in hippocampal astrocytes. Human single-cell RNA- sequencing data reveal a sequential increase of PHGDH expression in people with no, early, and late AD pathology, which is corroborated by protein mass spectrometry and immunohistochemical analyses of three independent cohorts. A sequential increase of PHGDH expression also correlates with increasing clinical AD symptoms and worsening cognitive decline in patients. The consistent increase of PHGDH expression in six AD cohorts (Mayo, ROSMAP, Mount Sinai, Baltimore, Amsterdam, and UCSD/UCI) corroborates with the recent report of PHGDH extracellular RNA in blood plasma as a candidate biomarker for early diagnosis of AD and offers a caution to the suggested use of L-serine as a potential therapy of AD.

                Memory, one of the hallmarks of human cognition, can be modified when humans voluntarily modulate single neuron or neural population activity using neurofeedback. However, it is currently unknown whether memory is facilitated or impaired after such neural perturbation. In this study, participants memorized objects while we trained them with abstract neurofeedback to modulate their brain activity patterns in the ventral visual stream to represent either faces or houses. The neurofeedback created an implicit face or house context in the brain while memorizing the objects. The results revealed that participants created associations between each memorized object and its implicit context solely due to the neurofeedback manipulation. Our findings shed light onto how memory formation can be influenced by synthetic memory tags with neurofeedback and advance our understanding of mnemonic processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task-specific effects of biological sex and sex hormones on object recognition memories in a 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion model of Parkinson's disease in adult male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                Many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience impairments in cognition and memory with few therapeutic options currently available to mitigate them. This has fueled interest in determining how factors including biological sex and sex hormones might modulate higher order function in PD. Previous studies have investigated this in female rats and in gonadally intact and gonadectomized males, with and without hormone replacement, that received bilateral neostriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions to model PD. Barnes maze and What Where When Episodic-like memory testing showed that 6-OHDA lesions disrupted spatial working and episodic memory functions in both sexes, and that in males, androgen-sensitive behaviors could be rescued in subjects where circulating androgen levels were diminished. Here we tested similar animal groups using the Novel Object Preference (NOP) and Object-in-Place (OiP) tasks. This revealed two entirely different patterns of sex and sex hormone influence. First, for both tasks, 6-ODHA lesions impaired object discrimination in males but not females. Further, for the NOP task, 6-OHDA lesions disrupted discrimination in males rats independently of hormone status. And finally, 6-OHDA lesions impaired OiP performance in males regardless of whether androgen levels were high or low but had no effect on discrimination in gonadectomized rats given 17{beta}-estradiol. Together with previous findings, these data identify the impacts of sex and sex hormones on cognition and memory in PD as behavioral task/behavioral domain specific. This specificity could explain why a cohesive clinical picture of endocrine impacts on higher order function in PD has remained elusive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conflict- and error-related theta activities are coupled to BOLD signals in different brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Both conflict and error processing have been linked to the midfrontal theta power (4-8 Hz) increase as indicated by EEG studies and greater hemodynamic activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) as indicated by fMRI studies. Conveniently, the source of the midfrontal theta power was estimated in or nearby aMCC. However, previous studies using concurrent EEG and fMRI recordings in resting-state or other cognitive tasks observed only a negative relationship between theta power and BOLD signal in the brain regions typically showing task-related deactivations. In this study, we used a simultaneous EEG-fMRI technique to investigate a trial-by-trial coupling between theta power and hemodynamic activity during the performance of two conflict tasks. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to denoise the EEG signal and select individual midfrontal EEG components, whereas group ICA was applied to fMRI data to obtain a functional parcellation of the frontal cortex. Using a linear mixed-effect model, theta power was coupled with the peak of hemodynamic responses from various frontal, cingulate, and insular cortical sites to unravel the potential brain sources that contribute to conflict- and error-related theta variability. Although several brain regions exhibited conflict-related increases in hemodynamic activity, the conflict pre-response theta showed only a negative correlation to BOLD signal in the midline area 9 (MA9), a region exhibiting conflict-sensitive deactivation. Conversely, and more expectedly, error-related theta showed a positive relationship to activity in the aMCC. Our results provide novel evidence suggesting that the amplitude of pre-response theta reflects the process of active inhibition that suppresses the MA9 activity. This process is affected independently by the stimulus congruency, reaction times variance, and is susceptible to the time-on-task effect. Finally, it predicts the commitment of an omission error. Together, our findings highlight that conflict- and error-related theta oscillations represent fundamentally different processes.

                Temporal sequences of neural activity are essential for driving well-timed behaviors, but the underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms remain elusive. We leveraged the well-defined architecture of the cerebellum, a brain region known to support temporally precise actions, to explore theoretically whether the experimentally observed diversity of short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) at the input layer could generate neural dynamics sufficient for subsecond temporal learning. Simulated synaptic input generated a diverse set of transient, firing patterns in granule cells (GCs) that provided a temporal basis set for learning precisely timed pauses of Purkinje cell activity associated with delayed eyelid conditioning and Bayesian interval estimation. The learning performance across time intervals was influenced by the temporal bandwidth of the GC basis, which was determined by the input layer synaptic properties. The ubiquity of STP throughout the brain positions it as a general, tunable cellular mechanism for sculpting neural dynamics and fine-tuning behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Awake responses suggest inefficient dense coding in the mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                The structure and function of the vertebrate retina have been extensively studied across species with an isolated, ex vivo preparation. Retinal function in vivo, however, remains elusive, especially in awake animals. Here we performed single-unit extracellular recordings in the optic tract of head-fixed mice to compare the output of awake, anesthetized, and ex vivo retinas. While the visual response properties were overall similar, we found that awake retinal output had 1) faster kinetics with less variability in the response latencies across different cell types; and 2) higher firing activity, by ~20 Hz on average, for both baseline and visually evoked responses. Notably, unlike the other conditions, many awake ON cells did not increase firing in response to light increments due to high baseline activity near saturation. Instead, they encoded light intensity fluctuations primarily by decreasing firing upon light decrements. In either condition, the visual message remains the same: the more spikes, the higher light intensity. The awake response patterns, however, violate efficient coding principles, predicting that sensory systems should favor firing patterns minimizing energy consumption. Our findings suggest that the retina employs dense coding in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding as suggested from previous ex vivo studies.

                In utero opioid exposure is associated with lower weight and a Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) at birth, along with longer-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and mood disorders. While NOWS is sometimes treated with continued opioids, clinical studies have not addressed if long-term neurobehavioral outcomes are worsened with continued postnatal exposure to opioids. In addition, pre-clinical studies comparing in utero only opioid exposure to continued post-natal opioid administration for withdrawal mitigation are lacking. Therefore, we implemented a rodent perinatal opioid exposure model of Oxycodone (Oxy) exposure for comparison of long-term consequences of Oxy exposure until birth (Short Oxy) to the impact of continued postnatal opioid exposure (Long Oxy) spanning gestation through birth and lactation. Short Oxy exposure was associated with a sex-specific increase in weight gain trajectory in adult male mice. Long Oxy exposure caused an increased weight gain trajectory in adult males, sex-dependent changes in morphine conditioned place preference, and alterations in nociceptive processing in females. Importantly, there was no evidence of long-term social behavioral deficits, anxiety, hyperactivity, or memory deficits following Short or Long Oxy exposure. Our findings suggest that offspring with prolonged opioid exposure experienced some long-term sequelae compared to pups with opioid cessation at birth. These results highlight the potential long-term consequences of opioid administration as a mitigation strategy for clinical NOWS symptomology and suggest alternatives should be explored.

Here we review: (1) subjective, behavioral and brain evidence for altered interoceptive processing in SUD, focusing on insular and anterior cingulate cortices (INS, ACC), key regions for interoceptive processing; (2) research highlighting links between mindfulness and brain function; and (3) extant brain research investigating mindfulness-based interventions in SUD. SUD tend to be characterized by heightened INS and ACC responses to drug cues but blunted interoceptive awareness and attenuated INS and ACC responses during tasks involving bodily attention and/or perturbations. In contrast, mindfulness interventions in healthy individuals are linked to enhanced INS and ACC responses and heightened interoceptive awareness. It is crucial for future research to identify: (1) whether mindfulness-based treatments are efficacious across substance classes; (2) what particular approaches and dosages show the largest effect sizes in enhancing INS and ACC function to non-drug stimuli and reducing responsivity to substance cues, thereby improving SUD treatment outcomes (reducing drug craving and relapse).</p>

	<p>It has been shown that learned temporal information can be exploited to help facilitate the target identification in the attentional blink task. Here, we tested whether similar exploitation also worked on short-term temporal information, even when it did not reliably predict the target onset. In two experiments, we randomly manipulated either the interval between targets (T1 and T2; Experiment 1) or the temporal regularity of stimulus presentation (Experiment 2) in each trial. The results revealed evidence of effects of immediate temporal experience mainly on T2 performances but also occasionally on T1 performances. In general, the accuracy of T2 was enhanced when a longer inter-target interval was explicitly processed in the preceding trial (Experiment 1) or the temporal regularity, regardless of being explicitly or implicitly processed, was present in the stimulus stream, especially after T1 (Experiment 2). These results suggest that, under high temporal uncertainty, both interval and rhythmic cues can still be exploited to regulate the allocation of processing resources, thus, modulating the target identification in the attentional blink task, consistent with the view of flexible attentional allocation, and further highlighting the importance of the interplay between temporal processing and attentional control in the conscious visual perception.</p>

	<p>p27 and p57 are tumor suppressors that are dysregulated in many cancers. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of p27 and p57 in ependymoma, with a secondary emphasis on cyclin D1, nestin, and Ki-67. Sixty-five patients diagnosed with ependymoma were included. Clinical and tumoral data were retrieved, and the expression of p27, p57, cyclin D1, nestin, and Ki-67 was measured. Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;chi;2 test was used to measure associations and the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier method was used for survival analysis. p27 underexpression was significantly associated with pseudopalisading necrosis in tumors with foci of necrosis (p = 0.004). Cyclin D1 overexpression was associated with intracranial (p = 0.044), recurrent (p = 0.022) and grade 3 tumors (p = 0.016); nestin overexpression was associated with supratentorial (p = 0.025), mitotically active (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and grade 3 tumors (p = 0.004); Ki-67 overexpression was associated with supratentorial (p = 0.044) and grade 3 tumors (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and the 3 main features of anaplasia. None of the markers were intercorrelated or predictive of overall survival. In conclusion, p27 underexpression in tumors with foci of necrosis signals a pseudopalisading pattern. Cyclin D1, nestin, and Ki-67 are useful markers in ependymoma, but evidence-based cutoff values are required to standardize this interpretation.</p>

	<p>This research integrates key concepts of Computational Neuroscience, including the Bienestock-CooperMunro (BCM) rule, Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity Rules (STDP), and the Temporal Difference Learning algorithm, with an important structure of Deep Learning (Convolutional Networks) to create an architecture with the potential of replicating observations of some cognitive experiments (particularly, those that provided some basis for sequential reasoning) while sharing the advantages already achieved by the previous proposals. In particular, we present Ring Model B, which is capable of associating visual with auditory stimulus, performing sequential predictions, and predicting reward from experience. Despite its simplicity, we considered such abilities to be a first step towards the formulation of more general models of prelinguistic reasoning.</p>

	<p>Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique. Magnetic fields induced by rPMS pass through almost all materials, and it has clinical applications for neurorehabilitation. However, the effects of rPMS through clothing and orthosis on induced movement and corticospinal excitability remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether rPMS induces movement and enhances corticospinal excitability through hand splint materials. rPMS was applied directly to the skin (L0) and through one (L1) or two (L2) layers of splint material in 14 healthy participants at 25-Hz, 2-s train per 6 s for a total of 20 min. rPMS was delivered to the forearm with the stimulus intensity set to 1.5-times the train intensity-induced muscle contractions under the L0 condition. We recorded induced wrist movements during rPMS and motor-evoked potentials of the extensor carpi radialis pre- and post-application. The results showed that rPMS induced wrist movements in L0 and L1, and it facilitated corticospinal excitability in L0 but not in L1 and L2. This suggests that rPMS can make electromagnetic induction on periphery even when applied over clothing and orthosis and demonstrates the potential clinical applications of this technique for neurorehabilitation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), cognitive impairments manifest through interactions between microscopic and macroscopic changes. On the microscale, a neurometabolic cascade alters neurotransmission, while on the macroscale diffuse axonal injury impacts the integrity of long-range connections. Large-scale brain network modeling allows us to make predictions across these spatial scales by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to investigate how microscale changes invisible to conventional neuroimaging influence large-scale brain dynamics. To this end, we analyzed structural and functional neuroimaging data from a well characterized sample of 44 adult TBI patients recruited from a regional trauma center, scanned at 1&ndash;2 weeks postinjury, and with follow-up behavioral outcome assessed 6 months later. Thirty-six age-matched healthy adults served as comparison participants. Using The Virtual Brain, we fit simulations of whole-brain resting-state functional MRI to the empirical static and dynamic functional connectivity of each participant. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis showed that patients with acute traumatic intracranial lesions had lower cortical regional inhibitory connection strengths than comparison participants, while patients without acute lesions did not differ from the comparison group. Further multivariate PLS analyses found correlations between lower semiacute regional inhibitory connection strengths and more symptoms and lower cognitive performance at a 6 month follow-up. Critically, patients without acute lesions drove this relationship, suggesting clinical relevance of regional inhibitory connection strengths even when traumatic intracranial lesions were not present. Our results suggest that large-scale connectome-based models may be sensitive to pathophysiological changes in semi-acute phase TBI patients and predictive of their chronic outcomes.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb<sup>+</sup>) and somatostatin-positive (Sst<sup>+</sup>) cells are the two largest subgroups of inhibitory interneurons. Studies in visual cortex indicate that synaptic connections between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells are common while connections between Sst<sup>+</sup> interneurons have not been observed. The inhibitory connectivity and kinetics of these two interneuron subpopulations, however, have not been characterized in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). Using fluorescence-guided paired recordings in mouse brain slices from interneurons and excitatory cells in layer 2/3 mEC, we found that, unlike neocortical measures, Sst<sup>+</sup> cells inhibit each other, albeit with a lower probability than Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells (18% vs 36% for unidirectional connections). Gap junction connections were also more frequent between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells than between Sst<sup>+</sup> cells. Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells inhibited each other with larger conductances, smaller decay time constants, and shorter delays. Similarly, synaptic connections between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> and excitatory cells were more likely and expressed faster decay times and shorter delays than those between Sst<sup>+</sup> and excitatory cells. Inhibitory cells exhibited smaller synaptic decay time constants between interneurons than on their excitatory targets. Inhibition between interneurons also depressed faster, and to a greater extent. Finally, inhibition onto layer 2 pyramidal and stellate cells originating from Pvalb<sup>+</sup> interneurons were very similar, with no significant differences in connection likelihood, inhibitory amplitude, and decay time. A model of short-term depression fitted to the data indicates that recovery time constants for refilling the available pool are in the range of 50&ndash;150 ms and that the fraction of the available pool released on each spike is in the range 0.2&ndash;0.5.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cross Talk between {alpha}7 and {alpha}3{beta}4 Nicotinic Receptors Prevents Their Desensitization in Human Chromaffin Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>The physical interaction and functional cross talk among the different subtypes of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in the various tissues is unknown. Here, we have investigated this issue between the only two nAChRs subtypes expressed, the &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 subtypes, in a human native neuroendocrine cell (the chromaffin cell) using electrophysiological patch-clamp, fluorescence, and Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. Our data show that &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 receptor subtypes require their mutual and maximal efficacy of activation to increase their expression, to avoid their desensitization, and therefore, to increase their activity. In this way, after repetitive stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh), &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 receptor subtypes do not desensitize, but they do with choline. The nicotinic current increase associated with the &alpha;3&beta;4 subtype is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, both receptor subtypes physically interact. Interaction and expression of both subtypes are reversibly reduced by tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatases inhibition, not by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, expression is greater in human chromaffin cells from men compared to women, but FRET efficiency is not affected. Together, our findings indicate that human &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 subtypes mutually modulate their expression and activity, providing a promising line of research to pharmacologically regulate their activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Desensitization of nicotinic receptors is accepted to occur with repetitive agonist stimulation. However, here we show that human native &alpha;3&beta;4 and &alpha;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes do not desensitize, and instead, increase their activity when they are activated by the physiological agonist acetylcholine (ACh). An indispensable requirement is the activation of the other receptor subtype with maximal efficacy, and the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to cooperate in the case of the &alpha;3&beta;4 current increase. Because choline is an &alpha;3&beta;4 partial agonist, it will act as a limiting factor of nicotinic currents enhancement in the absence of ACh, but in its presence, it will further potentiate &alpha;7 currents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Input and ACh Modulation Regulate Dendritic Ca2+ Spike Duration in Pyramidal Neurons, Directly Affecting Their Somatic Output</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nonlinear synaptic integration in dendrites is a fundamental aspect of neural computation. One such key mechanism is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike at the apical tuft of pyramidal neurons. Characterized by a plateau potential sustained for tens of milliseconds, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike amplifies excitatory input, facilitates somatic action potentials (APs), and promotes synaptic plasticity. Despite its essential role, the mechanisms regulating it are largely unknown. Using a compartmental model of a layer 5 pyramidal cell (L5PC), we explored the plateau and termination phases of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike under input current perturbations, long-step current-injections, and variations in the dendritic high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance (that occur during cholinergic modulation). We found that, surprisingly, timed excitatory input can shorten the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike duration while inhibitory input can either elongate or terminate it. A significant elongation also occurs when the high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<SUB>HVA</SUB>) conductance is increased. To mechanistically understand these phenomena, we analyzed the currents involved in the spike. The plateau and termination phases are almost exclusively controlled by the Ca<SUB>HVA</SUB> inward current and the I<SUB>m</SUB> outward K<sup>+</sup> current. We reduced the full model to a single-compartment model that faithfully preserved the responses of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike to interventions and consisted of two dynamic variables: the membrane potential and the K<sup>+</sup>-channel activation level. A phase-plane analysis of the reduced model provides testable predictions for modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike and reveals various dynamical regimes that explain the robust nature of the spike. Regulating the duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike significantly impacts the cell synaptic-plasticity window and, as we show, its input-output relationship.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pyramidal neurons are the cortex's principal projection neurons. In their apical tuft, dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes significantly impact information processing, synaptic plasticity, and the cell's input-output relationship. Therefore, it is essential to understand the mechanisms regulating them. Using a compartmental model of a layer 5 pyramidal cell (L5PC), we explored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike responses to synaptic perturbations and cholinergic modulation. We showed a counterintuitive phenomenon: early excitatory input shortens the spike, whereas weak inhibition elongates it. Also, we demonstrated that acetylcholine (ACh) extends the spike. Through a reduced model containing only the membrane potential and the K<sup>+</sup>-channel activation level, we explained these phenomena using a phase-plane analysis. Our work provides new information about the robustness of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike and its controlling mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contribution of G-Protein {alpha}-Subunits to Analgesia, Hyperalgesia, and Hyperalgesic Priming Induced by Subanalgesic and Analgesic Doses of Fentanyl and Morphine</a></h4>

              
                <p>While opioids produce both analgesia and side effects by action at &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs), at spinal and supraspinal sites, the potency of different opioids to produce these effects varies. While it has been suggested that these differences might be because of bias for signaling via &beta;-arrestin versus G-protein &alpha;-subunits (G&alpha;), recent studies suggest that G-protein-biased MOR agonists still produce clinically important side effects. Since bias also exists in the role of G&alpha; subunits, we evaluated the role of G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits in analgesia, hyperalgesia, and hyperalgesic priming produced by fentanyl and morphine, in male rats. We found that intrathecal treatment with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense (AS-ODN) for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2, G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3, and G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> markedly attenuated hyperalgesia induced by subanalgesic dose (sub-AD) fentanyl, while AS-ODN for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1, as well as G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2 and G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3, but not G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB>, prevented hyperalgesia induced by sub-AD morphine. AS-ODN for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1 and G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2 unexpectedly enhanced analgesia induced by analgesic dose (AD) fentanyl, while G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1 AS-ODN markedly reduced AD morphine analgesia. Hyperalgesic priming, assessed by prolongation of prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB>-induced hyperalgesia, was not produced by systemic sub-AD and AD fentanyl in G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3 and G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> AS-ODN-treated rats, respectively. In contrast, none of the G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> AS-ODNs tested affected priming induced by systemic sub-AD and AD morphine. We conclude that signaling by different G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits is necessary for the analgesia and side effects of two of the most clinically used opioid analgesics. The design of opioid analgesics that demonstrate selectivity for individual G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> may produce a more limited range of side effects and enhanced analgesia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Biased &mu;-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists that preferentially signal through G-protein &alpha;-subunits over &beta;-arrestins have been developed as an approach to mitigate opioid side effects. However, we recently demonstrated that biased MOR agonists also produce hyperalgesia and priming. We show that oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to different G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits play a role in hyperalgesia and analgesia induced by subanalgesic and analgesic dose (respectively), of fentanyl and morphine, as well as in priming. Our findings have the potential to advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in adverse effects of opioid analgesics that could assist in the development of novel analgesics, preferentially targeting specific G-protein &alpha;-subunits.</p>

                <p>Despite numerous studies examining the mechanisms of operant conditioning (OC), the diversity of OC plasticity loci and their synergism have not been examined sufficiently. In the well-characterized feeding neural circuit of <I>Aplysia</I>, <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> appetitive OC increases neuronal excitability and electrical coupling among several neurons leading to an increase in expression of ingestive behavior. Here, we used the <I>in vitro</I> analog of OC to investigate whether OC reduces the excitability of a neuron, B4, whose inhibitory connections decrease expression of ingestive behavior. We found OC decreased the excitability of B4. This change appeared intrinsic to B4 because it could be replicated with an analog of OC in isolated cultures of B4 neurons. In addition to changes in B4 excitability, OC decreased the strength of B4's inhibitory connection to a key decision-making neuron, B51. The OC-induced changes were specific without affecting the excitability of another neuron critical for feeding behavior, B8, or the B4-to-B8 inhibitory connection. A conductance-based circuit model indicated that reducing the B4-to-B51 synapse, or increasing B51 excitability, mediated the OC phenotype more effectively than did decreasing B4 excitability. We combined these modifications to examine whether they could act synergistically. Combinations including B51 synergistically enhanced feeding. Taken together, these results suggest modifications of diverse loci work synergistically to mediate OC and that some neurons are well suited to work synergistically with plasticity in other loci.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ways in which synergism of diverse plasticity loci mediate the change in motor patterns in operant conditioning (OC) are poorly understood. Here, we found that OC was in part mediated by decreasing the intrinsic excitability of a critical neuron of <I>Aplysia</I> feeding behavior, and specifically reducing the strength of one of its inhibitory connections that targets a key decision-making neuron. A conductance-based computational model indicated that the known plasticity loci showed a surprising level of synergism to mediate the behavioral changes associated with OC. These results highlight the importance of understanding the diversity, specificity and synergy among different types of plasticity that encode memory. Also, because OC in <I>Aplysia</I> is mediated by dopamine (DA), the present study provides insights into specific and synergistic mechanisms of DA-mediated reinforcement of behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Uniform and Nonuniform Nature of Slow and Rapid Scaling in Embryonic Motoneurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons regulate the strength of their synapses in response to a perturbation to stabilize neuronal signaling through a form of homeostatic plasticity known as synaptic scaling. The process of scaling has the potential to alter all of a cell's miniature postsynaptic current (mPSC) amplitudes by a single multiplicative factor (uniform scaling), and in doing so could change action potential-dependent or evoked synaptic strength by that factor. However, recent studies suggest that individual synapses scale with different scaling factors (nonuniform). This could complicate the simple multiplicative transform from mPSC scaling to the evoked response. We have previously identified a slow AMPAergic and GABAergic synaptic scaling in chick embryo motoneurons following 2 d <I>in vivo</I> perturbations inhibiting neuronal activity or GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R function, and now show a rapid form of scaling following NMDAR blockade <I>in vitro</I>. Slow GABAergic scaling appeared to be of a classical uniform pattern. Alternatively, other forms of rapid and slow scaling demonstrated a uniform and nonuniform component in their mPSC amplitude distributions. Slow and rapid AMPAergic scaling was mediated by insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors. The nonuniform pattern of scaling may contribute to the observed complexity of the changes in evoked responses. Scaling-induced changes in mPSC amplitudes were not associated with changes in probability of release (<I>Pr</I>). Together, our results demonstrate a new rapid form of scaling in embryonic motoneurons, that slow and rapid scaling is not purely uniform, and that upscaling does not translate to an increase in evoked responses in a simple manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Different forms of homeostatic plasticity are thought to play a critical role in maintaining neural function. For example, altering the amplitudes of spontaneous currents through a form of homeostatic plasticity known as synaptic scaling could affect evoked transmission; however, this is rarely tested. Here we demonstrate two forms of scaling and show that in many cases synaptic strength scales differently for distinct synapses within an embryonic motoneuron. These results have functional consequences for evoked synaptic strength and suggest that, like Hebbian plasticity, scaling can change relative synaptic strengths within a cell. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how different forms of homeostatic plasticity influence neuronal communication as the nascent spinal network is first established in the embryonic period.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Mechanism for Coding Depth from Motion Parallax in Area MT: Gain Modulation or Tuning Shifts?</a></h4>

              
                <p>There are two distinct sources of retinal image motion: objects moving in the world and observer movement. When the eyes move to track a target of interest, the retinal velocity of some object in the scene will depend on both eye velocity and that object's motion in the world. Thus, to compute the object's velocity relative to the head, a coordinate transformation must be performed by vectorially adding eye velocity and retinal velocity. In contrast, a very different interaction between retinal and eye velocity signals has been proposed to underlie estimation of depth from motion parallax, which involves computing the ratio of retinal and eye velocities. We examined how neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area of male macaques combine eye velocity and retinal velocity, to test whether this interaction is more consistent with a partial coordinate transformation (for computing head-centered object motion) or a multiplicative gain interaction (for computing depth from motion parallax). We find that some MT neurons show clear signatures of a partial coordinate transformation for computing head-centered velocity. Even a small shift toward head-centered velocity tuning can account for the observed depth-sign selectivity of MT neurons, including a strong dependence on speed preference that was previously unexplained. A formal model comparison reveals that the data from many MT neurons are equally well explained by a multiplicative gain interaction or a partial transformation toward head-centered tuning, although some responses can only be well fit by the coordinate transform model. Our findings shed new light on the neural computations performed in area MT, and raise the possibility that depth-sign selectivity emerges from a partial coordinate transformation toward representing head-centered velocity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Eye velocity signals modulate the responses of neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area to retinal image motion. Two different types of interactions between retinal and eye velocities have previously been considered: a vector addition computation for computing head-centered velocity, and a multiplicative gain interaction for computing depth from motion parallax. Whereas previous work favored a multiplicative gain interaction in MT, we demonstrate that some MT neurons show clear evidence of a partial shift toward coding head-centered velocity. Moreover, we demonstrate that even a small shift toward head coordinates is sufficient to account for the depth-sign selectivity observed previously in area MT, thus raising the possibility that a partial coordinate transformation may also provide a mechanism for computing depth from motion parallax.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predicting and Manipulating Cone Responses to Naturalistic Inputs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primates explore their visual environment by making frequent saccades, discrete and ballistic eye movements that direct the fovea to specific regions of interest. Saccades produce large and rapid changes in input. The magnitude of these changes and the limited signaling range of visual neurons mean that effective encoding requires rapid adaptation. Here, we explore how macaque cone photoreceptors maintain sensitivity under these conditions. Adaptation makes cone responses to naturalistic stimuli highly nonlinear and dependent on stimulus history. Such responses cannot be explained by linear or linear-nonlinear models but are well explained by a biophysical model of phototransduction based on well-established biochemical interactions. The resulting model can predict cone responses to a broad range of stimuli and enables the design of stimuli that elicit specific (e.g., linear) cone photocurrents. These advances will provide a foundation for investigating the contributions of cone phototransduction and post-transduction processing to visual function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We know a great deal about adaptational mechanisms that adjust sensitivity to slow changes in visual inputs such as the rising or setting sun. We know much less about the rapid adaptational mechanisms that are essential for maintaining sensitivity as gaze shifts around a single visual scene. We characterize how phototransduction in cone photoreceptors adapts to rapid changes in input similar to those encountered during natural vision. We incorporate these measurements into a quantitative model that can predict cone responses across a broad range of stimuli. This model not only shows how cone phototransduction aids the encoding of natural inputs but also provides a tool to identify the role of the cone responses in shaping those of downstream visual neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task-Specific Neural Representations of Generalizable Metacognitive Control Signals in the Human Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a critical role in cognitive control over different domains of tasks. The dACC activities uniformly represent task-generic intensities of control signals across different tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the dACC activities could also encode task identities of control signals across different tasks. If so, how the two types of control information are coherently organized in the dACC? Decision uncertainty is an internally-generated control signal by retrospective monitoring, namely, metacognition, even with no external feedback. We here investigated neural representations of decision uncertainty accompanying three decision-making tasks in the domains of perception, rule-based inference, and memory using trial-by-trial univariate and multivariate analyses on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired on human male and female healthy subjects. Our results demonstrated that the dACC represented decision uncertainty commonly across the three decision-making tasks. Further, the multivariate fMRI analyses revealed a mosaic form of neural representations of decision uncertainty across tasks in the dACC. The identity and intensity information was separately represented in two dissociable components, the high-dimensional pattern and the scalar magnitude, of the dACC multivoxel fMRI activities. Lastly, a follow-up behavioral experiment confirmed that this mosaic form of neural representations of parallelly existing decision uncertainty across different tasks should lead to mutual interferences more on the intensity, but less on the identity of control signals. Thus, our findings suggest that the dACC with the mosaic form of neural representations could provide task-generic and task-specific metacognitive control signals to guide appropriate control on different decision-making tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Metacognition is a form of cognitive control using internally generated decision uncertainty to guide behavior adjustment with no needs of external feedback. Decision uncertainty as a generalizable control signal is commonly encoded in the human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) accompanying different decision-making tasks. It remains unknown whether or not the task-specific control information is represented in the dACC. We here revealed that multivoxel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activities associated with decision uncertainty in the dACC concurrently represented the identity and intensity information. The mixtures of neural representations of decision uncertainty across different tasks should cause specific interferences on each other. Hence, the neural representations of control signals in the human dACC should be task-generic and task-specific.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Saturating Nonlinearities of Contrast Response in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response nonlinearities are ubiquitous throughout the brain, especially within sensory cortices where changes in stimulus intensity typically produce compressed responses. Although this relationship is well established in electrophysiological measurements, it remains controversial whether the same nonlinearities hold for population-based measurements obtained with human fMRI. We propose that these purported disparities are not contingent on measurement type and are instead largely dependent on the visual system state at the time of interrogation. We show that deploying a contrast adaptation paradigm permits reliable measurements of saturating sigmoidal contrast response functions (10 participants, 7 female). When not controlling the adaptation state, our results coincide with previous fMRI studies, yielding nonsaturating, largely linear contrast responses. These findings highlight the important role of adaptation in manifesting measurable nonlinear responses within human visual cortex, reconciling discrepancies reported in vision neuroscience, re-establishing the qualitative relationship between stimulus intensity and response across different neural measures and the concerted study of cortical gain control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nonlinear stimulus&ndash;response relationships govern many essential brain functions, ranging from the sensory to cognitive level. Certain core response properties previously shown to be nonlinear with nonhuman electrophysiology recordings have yet to be reliably measured with human neuroimaging, prompting uncertainty and reconsideration. The results of this study stand to reconcile these incongruencies in the vision neurosciences, demonstrating the profound impact adaptation can have on brain activation throughout the early visual cortex. Moving forward, these findings facilitate the study of modulatory influences on sensory processing (i.e., arousal and attention) and help establish a closer link between neural recordings in animals and hemodynamic measurements from human fMRI, resuming a concerted effort to understand operations in the mammalian cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons Are Required for Contending Strategy Selection While Solving Spatial Navigation Problems</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do animals adopt a given behavioral strategy to solve a recurrent problem when several effective strategies are available to reach the goal? Here we provide evidence that striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs) modulate their activity when mice must select between different strategies with similar goal-reaching effectiveness. Using a cell type-specific transgenic murine system, we show that adult SCIN ablation impairs strategy selection in navigational tasks where a goal can be independently achieved by adopting an allocentric or egocentric strategy. SCIN-depleted mice learn to achieve the goal in these tasks, regardless of their appetitive or aversive nature, in a similar way as controls. However, they cannot shift away from their initially adopted strategies, as control mice do, as training progresses. Our results indicate that SCINs are required for shaping the probability function used for strategy selection as experience accumulates throughout training. Thus, SCINs may be critical for the resolution of cognitive conflicts emerging when several strategies compete for behavioral control while adapting to environmental demands. Our findings may increase our understanding about the emergence of perseverative/compulsive traits in neuropsychiatric disorders with a reported SCIN reduction, such as Tourette and Williams syndromes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Selecting the best suited strategy to solve a problem is vital. Accordingly, available strategies must be compared across multiple dimensions, such as goal attainment effectiveness, cost&ndash;benefit trade-off, and cognitive load. The striatum is involved in strategy selection when strategies clearly diverge in their goal attainment capacity; however, its role whenever several strategies can be used for goal reaching&mdash;therefore making selection dependent on additional strategy dimensions&mdash;remains poorly understood. Here, we show that striatal cholinergic interneurons can signal strategy competition. Furthermore, they are required to adopt a given strategy whenever strategies with similar goal attainment capacity compete for behavioral control. Our study suggests that striatal cholinergic dysfunction may result in anomalous resolution of problems whenever complex cognitive valuations are required.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Effects of Endogenous and Exogenous Attention on Sensory Tuning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Covert spatial attention (without concurrent eye movements) improves performance in many visual tasks (e.g., orientation discrimination and visual search). However, both covert attention systems&mdash;endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary)&mdash;exhibit differential effects on performance in tasks mediated by spatial and temporal resolution suggesting an underlying mechanistic difference. We investigated whether these differences manifest in sensory tuning by assessing whether and how endogenous and exogenous attention differentially alter the representation of two basic visual dimensions&mdash;orientation and spatial frequency (SF). The same human observers detected a grating embedded in noise in two separate experiments (with endogenous or exogenous attention cues). Reverse correlation was used to infer the underlying neural representation from behavioral responses, and we linked our results to established neural computations via a normalization model of attention. Both endogenous and exogenous attention similarly improved performance at the attended location by enhancing the gain of all orientations without changing tuning width. In the SF dimension, endogenous attention enhanced the gain of SFs above and below the target SF, whereas exogenous attention only enhanced those above. Additionally, exogenous attention shifted peak sensitivity to SFs above the target SF, whereas endogenous attention did not. Both covert attention systems modulated sensory tuning via the same computation (gain changes). However, there were differences in the strength of the gain. Compared with endogenous attention, exogenous attention had a stronger orientation gain enhancement but a weaker overall SF gain enhancement. These differences in sensory tuning may underlie differential effects of endogenous and exogenous attention on performance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Covert spatial attention is a fundamental aspect of cognition and perception that allows us to selectively process and prioritize incoming visual information at a given location. There are two types: endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary). Both typically improve visual perception, but there are instances where endogenous improves perception but exogenous hinders perception. Whether and how such differences extend to sensory representations is unknown. Here we show that both endogenous and exogenous attention mediate perception via the same neural computation&mdash;gain changes&mdash;but the strength of the orientation gain and the range of enhanced spatial frequencies depends on the type of attention being deployed. These findings reveal that both attention systems differentially reshape the tuning of features coded in striate cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reduced Learning of Sound Categories in Dyslexia Is Associated with Reduced Regularity-Induced Auditory Cortex Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>A main characteristic of dyslexia is poor use of sound categories. We now studied within-session learning of new sound categories in dyslexia, behaviorally and neurally, using fMRI. Human participants (males and females) with and without dyslexia were asked to discriminate which of two serially-presented tones had a higher pitch. The task was administered in two protocols, with and without a repeated reference frequency. The reference condition introduces regularity, and enhances frequency sensitivity in typically developing (TD) individuals. Enhanced sensitivity facilitates the formation of "high" and "low" pitch categories above and below this reference, respectively. We found that in TDs, learning was paralleled by a gradual decrease in activation of the primary auditory cortex (PAC), and reduced activation of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are important for using sensory history. No such sensitivity was found among individuals with dyslexia (IDDs). Rather, IDDs showed reduced behavioral learning of stimulus regularities and no regularity-associated adaptation in the auditory cortex or in higher-level regions. We propose that IDDs' reduced cortical adaptation, associated with reduced behavioral learning of sound regularities, underlies their impoverished use of stimulus history, and consequently impedes their formation of rich sound categories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reading difficulties in dyslexia are often attributed to poor use of phonological categories. To test whether poor category use could result from poor learning of new sound categories in general, we administered an auditory discrimination task that examined the learning of new pitch categories above and below a repeated reference sound. Individuals with dyslexia (IDDs) learned categories slower than typically developing (TD) individuals. TD individuals showed adaptation to the repeated sounds that paralleled the category learning in their primary auditory cortex (PAC) and other higher-level regions. In dyslexia, no brain region showed such adaptation. We suggest that poor learning of sound statistics in sensory regions may underlie the poor representations of both speech and nonspeech categories in dyslexia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Direct Cochlear Recordings in Humans Show a Theta Rhythmic Modulation of Auditory Nerve Activity by Selective Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>The architecture of the efferent auditory system enables prioritization of strongly overlapping spatiotemporal cochlear activation patterns elicited by relevant and irrelevant inputs. So far, attempts at finding such attentional modulations of cochlear activity delivered indirect insights in humans or required direct recordings in animals. The extent to which spiral ganglion cells forming the human auditory nerve are sensitive to selective attention remains largely unknown. We investigated this question by testing the effects of attending to either the auditory or visual modality in human cochlear implant (CI) users (3 female, 13 male). Auditory nerve activity was directly recorded with standard CIs during a silent (anticipatory) cue-target interval. When attending the upcoming auditory input, ongoing auditory nerve activity within the theta range (5-8 Hz) was enhanced. Crucially, using the broadband signal (4-25 Hz), a classifier was even able to decode the attended modality from single-trial data. Follow-up analysis showed that the effect was not driven by a narrow frequency in particular. Using direct cochlear recordings from deaf individuals, our findings suggest that cochlear spiral ganglion cells are sensitive to top-down attentional modulations. Given the putatively broad hair-cell degeneration of these individuals, the effects are likely mediated by alternative efferent pathways compared with previous studies using otoacoustic emissions. Successful classification of single-trial data could additionally have a significant impact on future closed-loop CI developments that incorporate real-time optimization of CI parameters based on the current mental state of the user.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The efferent auditory system in principle allows top-down modulation of auditory nerve activity; however, evidence for this is lacking in humans. Using cochlear recordings in participants performing an audiovisual attention task, we show that ongoing auditory nerve activity in the silent cue-target period is directly modulated by selective attention. Specifically, ongoing auditory nerve activity is enhanced within the theta range when attending upcoming auditory input. Furthermore, over a broader frequency range, the attended modality can be decoded from single-trial data. Demonstrating this direct top-down influence on auditory nerve activity substantially extends previous works that focus on outer hair cell activity. Generally, our work could promote the use of standard cochlear implant electrodes to study cognitive neuroscientific questions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Factors Drive the Spatiotemporal Progression of Tau Pathology in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mechanisms underlying the initial accumulation of tau pathology across the human brain are largely unknown. We examined whether baseline factors including age, amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;), and neural activity predicted longitudinal tau accumulation in temporal lobe regions that reflect distinct stages of tau pathogenesis. Seventy cognitively normal human older adults (77 &plusmn; 6 years, 59% female) received two or more <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir (FTP) and <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET scans (mean follow-up, 2.5 &plusmn; 1.1 years) to quantify tau and (A&beta;). Linear mixed-effects models were used to calculate the slopes of FTP change in entorhinal cortex (EC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and inferior temporal gyrus (IT), and slopes of global PiB change. Thirty-seven participants underwent functional MRI to measure baseline activation. Older age predicted EC tau accumulation, and baseline EC tau levels predicted subsequent tau accumulation in EC and PHC. In IT, however, baseline EC tau interacted with A&beta; to predict IT tau accumulation. Higher baseline local activation predicted tau accumulation within EC and PHC, and higher baseline hippocampal activation predicted EC tau accumulation. Our findings indicate that factors predicting tau accumulation vary as tau progresses through the temporal lobe. Older age is associated with initial tau accumulation in EC, while baseline EC tau and neural activity drive tau accumulation within medial temporal lobe. A&beta; subsequently facilitates tau spread from medial to lateral temporal lobe. Our findings elucidate potential drivers of tau accumulation and spread in aging, which are critical for understanding Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To further understand the mechanisms leading to tau pathogenesis and spread, we tested whether baseline factors such as age, amyloid-&beta; pathology, and activation predicted longitudinal tau accumulation in cognitively normal older adults. We found that distinct mechanisms contribute to tau accumulation as tau progresses across the temporal lobe, with initial tau accumulation in entorhinal cortex driven by age and subsequent spread driven by neural activity and amyloid-&beta;. We demonstrate that higher baseline activation predicts increased longitudinal tau accumulation, providing novel evidence that activation-dependent tau production may occur in the human brain. Our findings support major hypotheses generated from preclinical research, and have important translational implications, suggesting that the reduction of hyperactivation may help prevent the development of tau pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurophysiological and Brain Structural Markers of Cognitive Frailty Differ from Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>With increasing life span and prevalence of dementia, it is important to understand the mechanisms of cognitive aging. Here, we focus on a subgroup of the population we term "cognitively frail," defined by reduced cognitive function in the absence of subjective memory complaints, or a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Cognitive frailty is distinct from cognitive impairment caused by physical frailty. It has been proposed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease, but may alternatively represent one end of a nonpathologic spectrum of cognitive aging. We test these hypotheses in humans of both sexes, by comparing the structural and neurophysiological properties of a community-based cohort of cognitive frail adults, to people presenting clinically with diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and community-based cognitively typical older adults. Cognitive performance of the cognitively frail was similar to those with mild cognitive impairment. We used a novel cross-modal paired-associates task that presented images followed by sounds, to induce physiological responses of novelty and associative mismatch, recorded by EEG/MEG. Both controls and cognitively frail showed stronger mismatch responses and larger temporal gray matter volume, compared with people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest that community-based cognitively frail represents a spectrum of normal aging rather than incipient Alzheimer's disease, despite similar cognitive function. Lower lifelong cognitive reserve, hearing impairment, and cardiovascular comorbidities might contribute to the etiology of the cognitive frailty. Critically, community-based cohorts of older adults with low cognitive performance should not be interpreted as representing undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The current study investigates the neural signatures of cognitive frailty in relation to healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease. We focus on the cognitive aspect of frailty and show that, despite performing similarly to the patients with mild cognitive impairment, a cohort of community-based adults with poor cognitive performance do not show structural atrophy or neurophysiological signatures of Alzheimer's disease. Our results call for caution before assuming that cognitive frailty represents latent Alzheimer's disease. Instead, the cognitive underperformance of cognitively frail adults could result in cumulative effects of multiple psychosocial risk factors over the lifespan, and medical comorbidities.</p>

                Background: Previous research has consistently shown the significant difference in outcome between cancerous and non-cancerous patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no studies have compared the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in hematologic cancers patients and solid cancers patients. Therefore, we analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 patients with hematological cancer and primary solid cancer worldwide through a meta-analysis and systematic review. Methods: This meta-analysis and systematic review included English language articles published between December 2019 – January 2021 from Pubmed and Google Scholar. The Newcastle Ottawa Score was used to assess the quality and bias of included studies. The outcome measures were case-fatality rate and critical care events for COVID-19 patients with cancer and comorbidities. Results: The initial search found 8910 articles, of 20 were included in the analysis. Critical care events and mortality were higher in the hematological than primary solid cancer group (relative risk (RR)=1.22 & 1.65; p <0.001). Conversely, mortality was lower in patients with two or fewer comorbidities (RR=0.57; p<0.001) and patients under the 75-year-old group (RR=0.53; p< 0.05). Conclusions: Hematologic malignancy, age, and the number of comorbidities are predictor factors for worse prognosis in COVID-19 infection.

                The long term functional and aesthetic impact of breast neoplasia treatment partly reflects the consequences of high dose irradiation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. This work, based on a case observed in our department and a review of the literature, aims to discuss certain secondary manifestations following breast irradiation and their therapeutic options. Our work reports the case of a premenopausal 46-year-old patient, treated for a right breast neoplasia. In July 2019, the patient underwent a Patey with simple postoperative follow-up. Histology substantiated the presence of an infiltrating ductal carcinoma SBRI. Mastectomy was followed by locoregional irradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. Thirteen months after the end of irradiation, the patient reconsulted for functional impotence and pain at the level of the right upper limb. The clinical examination showed cutaneous sclerosis and lymphedema. An X-ray showing the non-metastatic fracture of the clavicle. The patient underwent physiotherapy sessions with slight improvement on the functional level and clear improvement on the sensory level with progressive disappearance of pain. Therapeutic options for complications of breast irradiation include massage, bandages, and physical exercise, often used in combination. The precise localization of the tumor bed and the application of appropriate clinical target volumes and planning target volumes are essential, as these concepts are fundamental for partial breast irradiation and avoid the complications of radiotherapy.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Information processing in cortical circuits, including the hippocampus, relies on the dynamic control of neuronal activity by GABAergic interneurons (INs). INs form a heterogenous population with defined types displaying distinct morphological, molecular, and physiological characteristics. In the major input region of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG), a number of IN types have been described which provide synaptic inhibition to distinct compartments of excitatory principal cells (PrCs) and other INs. In this study, we perform an unbiased classification of GABAergic INs in the DG by combining in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, intracellular labeling, morphological analysis, and supervised cluster analysis to better define IN type diversity in this region. This analysis reveals that DG INs divide into at least 13 distinct morpho-physiological types which reflect the complexity of the local IN network and serve as a basis for further network analyses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Spatio-temporal characteristics of Tuberculosis in Ghana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The number of Tuberculosis (TB) cases or deaths is declining, however, the rate of decline is not adequate to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO's) mitigation. TB remains a public health problem in Ghana with a significant economic and health burden on its citizens and health care system.  Consequently, there is a need for further studies about the disease aimed at accelerating the rate of decline in cases. Methods:  The spatio-temporal characteristics of TB in Ghana using Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal regression models was analysed in this study. Data were obtained from Ghana National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) for the 10 regions of Ghana, collected over a six-year period. The study also examines some baseline predictors of TB infections to ascertain their effects on the TB risk across the ten regions in Ghana. Results: Hot-spots of TB cases are observed in the Upper East, Upper West, Volta, Western, and Central regions and low risk in the Northern, Ashanti, Greater Accra, Brong Ahafo, Eastern and Western regions. The results indicated a clustering of risk between neighboring regions. TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, awareness that TB is airborne, HIV prevalence, percentage of literacy, and high income are important predictors of  detection for this disease across the ten regions of Ghana. Conclusion: Most regions in Ghana have similar TB risks. A substantial reduction in TB cases  requires measures that will increase  detection, success and cure rates, awareness, knowledge about how this disease spreads as well adequate health facilities with easy access.

                Background: Hydranencephaly is a congenital abnormality of the central nervous system characterized by massive hemispheric necrosis and ventricular dilatation with most of the cerebral hemispheres being replaced by membranous sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can be one of the causes of hydranencephaly. The choice of therapy for hydranencephaly is a challenge because of poor prognosis, but now neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation may give new hope. Case report: We report a case of a female newborn born at term by cesarean section from a gravida 5, para 3, abortus 1 (G5P3A1) mother with suspected hydrocephalus. Head circumference was 35 cm at birth. The baby was born crying immediately, looked active, and did not appear cyanotic, but on the second day, the baby looked less active, moaned, showed acral cyanosis, and had a large fontanelle that was dilated and soft. Signs of hydrocephalus such as Macewen’s sign, setting sun phenomenon, and transillumination were found to be positive. Echocardiographic examination showed floppy interatrial septum and mild mitral regurgitation. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head showed hydranencephaly. The toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, and herpes simplex virus (TORCH) screening showed positive anti-CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG). The baby underwent a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt procedure with a head circumference of 36 cm before surgery. VP shunt was performed with an opening pressure of 15 cmH2O. Conclusions: After the VP shunt procedure, the baby's general condition improved with the head circumference within normal limits. The baby was discharged from the hospital after 16 days of treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimated number of deaths directly avoided because of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Colombia in 2021: an ecological, longitudinal observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Colombia’s national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines’ effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia’s strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bayes Lines Tool (BLT): a SQL-script for analyzing diagnostic test results with an application to SARS-CoV-2-testing [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The performance of diagnostic tests crucially depends on the disease prevalence, test sensitivity, and test specificity. However, these quantities are often not well known when tests are performed outside defined routine lab procedures which make the rating of the test results somewhat problematic. A current example is the mass testing taking place within the context of the world-wide SARS-CoV-2 crisis. Here, for the first time in history, laboratory test results have a dramatic impact on political decisions. Therefore, transparent, comprehensible, and reliable data is mandatory. It is in the nature of wet lab tests that their quality and outcome are influenced by multiple factors reducing their performance by handling procedures, underlying test protocols, and analytical reagents. These limitations in sensitivity and specificity have to be taken into account when calculating the real test results. As a resolution method, we have developed a Bayesian calculator, the Bayes Lines Tool (BLT), for analyzing disease prevalence, test sensitivity, test specificity, and, therefore, true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative numbers from official test outcome reports. The calculator performs a simple SQL (Structured Query Language) query and can easily be implemented on any system supporting SQL. We provide an example of influenza test results from California, USA, as well as two examples of SARS-CoV-2 test results from official government reports from The Netherlands and Germany-Bavaria, to illustrate the possible parameter space of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity consistent with the observed data. Finally, we discuss this tool’s multiple applications, including its putative importance for informing policy decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Fortuitous discovery of cor triatriatum sinister in a young adult [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Cor triatriatum is an extremely rare cardiac congenital malformation characterized by subdivision of the left atrium into two chambers. This division is due to the presence of an abnormal fibromuscular membrane interrupted by one or more openings that communicate the two chambers. The  size and number of those orifices is variable, affecting the age of onset of symptoms and their severity. Our case describes the fortuitous discovery of this pathology in a young adult in her forties, following the finding of atrial fibrillation during a preoperative assessment of a strangulated hernia. The cardiac ultrasound allowed in our case to invoke the diagnosis, confirmed thereafter with an angioscanner.  Surgical resection was not required in our patient who was put on medical treatment involving a beta-blocker to reduce atrial fibrillation and an anticoagulant treatment to decrease the thromboembolic risk, with a good clinical evolution. It seems therefore interesting to consider this uncommon pathology which may be latent for a long time, manifesting after some physiological or pathological situations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Bocavirus Infection Radiologically Resembling a Congestive Heart Failure in a Patient with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Case-Report [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a viral pathogen from the genus Bocaparvovirus (family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae) discovered in 2005. Most of available literature is about HBoV in children and adults with hematological malignancies and in otherwise healthy children with respiratory infections. Information regarding infection in the adult population with solid tumors is scarce. Case Report: We report the case of a 51-year-old male with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer undergoing chemotherapy treatment who presented with fever, dyspnea, dry cough, and pleuritic pain. Imaging techniques showed signs of congestive heart failure. Symptoms, laboratory tests and echocardiography revealed a more probable infectious etiology. Antibiotic therapy was started. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of nasopharyngeal exudate for respiratory viruses was positive for HBoV. The rest of the microbiological tests were negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Bacterial culture of BAL was negative while respiratory virus PCR confirmed positivity for HBoV. Antibiotic therapy was discontinued. The patient gradually recovered. Conclusions: Emerging infectious diseases are a notorious threat for immunocompromised populations such as solid tumor patients. This case is unique because to our knowledge this is the first case report article of HBoV in a solid tumor patient and because imaging techniques exhibited signs of congestive heart failure that did not correlate with the rest of the tests. It shows that unusual pathogens should be considered when managing serious clinical complications with uncommon presentations in cancer patients. Notable diagnostic efforts should be made to reach a diagnosis in these cases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain death debates: from bioethics to epistemology [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                50 years after its introduction, brain death remains controversial among scholars. The debates focus on one question: is brain death a good criterion for determining death? This question has been answered from various perspectives: medical, metaphysical, ethical, and legal or political. Most authors either defend the criterion as it is, propose some minor or major revisions, or advocate abandoning it and finding better solutions to the problems that brain death was intended to solve when it was introduced. In short, debates about brain death have been characterized by partisanship, for or against. Here I plead for a non-partisan approach that has been overlooked in the literature: the epistemological or philosophy of science approach. Some scholars claim that human death is a matter of fact, a biological phenomenon whose occurrence can be determined empirically, based on science. We should take this claim seriously, whether we agree with it or not. The question is: how do we know that human death is a scientific matter of fact? Taking the epistemological approach means, among other things, examining how the determination of human death became an object of scientific inquiry, exploring the nature of the brain death criterion itself, and analysing the meaning of its core concepts such as “irreversibility” and “functions”.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Near-term forecasting of companion animal tick paralysis incidence: An iterative ensemble model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicholas J. Clark, Tatiana Proboste, Guyan Weerasinghe, Ricardo J. Soares Magalhães</p>

Tick paralysis resulting from bites from <i>Ixodes holocyclus</i> and <i>I</i>. <i>cornuatus</i> is one of the leading causes of emergency veterinary admissions for companion animals in Australia, often resulting in death if left untreated. Availability of timely information on periods of increased risk can help modulate behaviors that reduce exposures to ticks and improve awareness of owners for the need of lifesaving preventative ectoparasite treatment. Improved awareness of clinicians and pet owners about temporal changes in tick paralysis risk can be assisted by ecological forecasting frameworks that integrate environmental information into statistical time series models. Using an 11-year time series of tick paralysis cases from veterinary clinics in one of Australia’s hotspots for the paralysis tick <i>Ixodes holocyclus</i>, we asked whether an ensemble model could accurately forecast clinical caseloads over near-term horizons. We fit a series of statistical time series (ARIMA, GARCH) and generative models (Prophet, Generalised Additive Model) using environmental variables as predictors, and then combined forecasts into a weighted ensemble to minimise prediction interval error. Our results indicate that variables related to temperature anomalies, levels of vegetation moisture and the Southern Oscillation Index can be useful for predicting tick paralysis admissions. Our model forecasted tick paralysis cases with exceptional accuracy while preserving epidemiological interpretability, outperforming a field-leading benchmark Exponential Smoothing model by reducing both point and prediction interval errors. Using online particle filtering to assimilate new observations and adjust forecast distributions when new data became available, our model adapted to changing temporal conditions and provided further reduced forecast errors. We expect our model pipeline to act as a platform for developing early warning systems that can notify clinicians and pet owners about heightened risks of environmentally driven veterinary conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Individual risk perception and empirical social structures shape the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Valeria d’Andrea, Riccardo Gallotti, Nicola Castaldo, Manlio De Domenico</p>

The dynamics of a spreading disease and individual behavioral changes are entangled processes that have to be addressed together in order to effectively manage an outbreak. Here, we relate individual risk perception to the adoption of a specific set of control measures, as obtained from an extensive large-scale survey performed via Facebook—involving more than 500,000 respondents from 64 countries—showing that there is a “one-to-one” relationship between perceived epidemic risk and compliance with a set of mitigation rules. We then develop a mathematical model for the spreading of a disease—sharing epidemiological features with COVID-19—that explicitly takes into account non-compliant individual behaviors and evaluates the impact of a population fraction of infectious risk-deniers on the epidemic dynamics. Our modeling study grounds on a wide set of structures, including both synthetic and more than 180 real-world contact patterns, to evaluate, in realistic scenarios, how network features typical of human interaction patterns impact the spread of a disease. In both synthetic and real contact patterns we find that epidemic spreading is hindered for decreasing population fractions of risk-denier individuals. From empirical contact patterns we demonstrate that connectivity heterogeneity and group structure significantly affect the peak of hospitalized population: higher modularity and heterogeneity of social contacts are linked to lower peaks at a fixed fraction of risk-denier individuals while, at the same time, such features increase the relative impact on hospitalizations with respect to the case where everyone correctly perceive the risks.

                Secondary localizations of cutaneous  metastases from endometrial cancer  are rarely observed  with a prevalence of 0.8% and can be indicative of deep pelvic cancer (ovarian or endometrial). The prognosis is usually poor, with skin metastases most often indicating  advanced disease. This work, based on a case observed in our department and a review of the literature, aims to highlight the existence of this dramatic form of cutaneous  extension of a common disease. Dermatologists are often consulted due to the non-specific nature of the lesions and should be aware of this entity. As with other cutaneous  metastases, an accurate diagnosis  is based on a the patient’s thorough medical and surgical history in conjunction with histopathology

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Treatment profiles and trajectories surrounding the diagnosis of major depressive disorder: a research protocol for a Danish register-based study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent illness that causes significant suffering and expenses at the personal and societal levels. The disorder is subject to heterogeneity reflected by diverse clinical phenotypes and assorted responses to treatment. Research on MDD treatments have focused on one treatment at a time, however many patients receive several different treatments. Considering the number of available treatment options, we hypothesize that it is possible to identify clinically meaningful groups of patients based on their psychiatric treatment. The objective of this study is therefore to identify psychiatric treatment profiles and trajectories of patients with major depressive disorder and, for the identified profiles and trajectories, to assess clinical and sociodemographic factors. Method: The study will be a population-based register study of patients with major depressive disorder in the Danish National Patient Register between 2011 and 2015. Using latent class analyses, we will identify homogenous groups of patients based on their psychiatric treatment patterns. These patterns constitute psychiatric treatment profiles which will be identified at six time-intervals, from 1.5 years before to 3 years after diagnosis of major depressive disorder. By cross-tabulating the identified treatment profiles, we will establish psychiatric treatment trajectories. Patients sharing profiles and trajectories will be characterized. Discussion: Identification of psychiatric treatment profiles and trajectories based on an unsupervised learning algorithm have the potential to reveal hidden patterns of psychiatric treatment. This will potentially pave the way for future studies of treatment combinations and a larger insight into the different courses of treatment. Furthermore, the assessment of clinical and sociodemographic factors may indicate different patient characteristics across treatment profiles and trajectories.

<p>P53 is typically degraded by proteasomes, with Mdm2 playing a significant role. Under tauopathy stress, pathogenic P-tau (<i>cis</i> P-tau, AT8, and AT100 P-tau) are formed in the neurites. They gradually moved from the neurites into the soma and nucleus. P-tau nuclear mislocalization is accompanied by p53 stabilization, bax, and cleaved caspase-3 formation, and significant nucleolar dispersion, ultimately leading to neuron death. <i>Cis</i>Pt, <i>Cis</i> P-tau; AT8, AT8 P-tau; AT100, AT100 P-tau; CBax, cleaved bax; CCasp3, cleaved caspase-3; Cytoc, Cytochrome c.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tau protein abnormalities are associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In tau-overexpressing SHSY5Y cells and iPSC-derived neuron models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), axonal tau translocates into the nuclear compartment, resulting in neuronal dysfunction. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms by which tau translocation results in neurodegeneration remain elusive thus far. We studied the nuclear displacement of different P-tau species [<i>Cis</i> phosphorylated Thr231-tau (<i>cis</i> P-tau), phosphorylated Ser202/Thr205-tau (AT8 P-tau), and phosphorylated Thr212/Ser214-tau (AT100 P-tau)] at various time points using starvation in primary cortical neurons and single severe TBI (ssTBI) in male mouse cerebral cortices as tauopathy models. While all P-tau species translocated into the somatodendritic compartment in response to stress, <i>cis</i> P-tau did so more rapidly than the other species. Notably, nuclear localization of P-tau was associated with p53 apoptotic stabilization and nucleolar stress, both of which resulted in neurodegeneration. In summary, our findings indicate that P-tau nuclear translocation results in p53-dependent apoptosis and nucleolar dispersion, which is consistent with neurodegeneration.</p>

                Transfer between cells is an unexpected addition to the mitochondrial life cycle. In this issue of Neuron, Van der Vlist et al. now provide evidence that M2-macrophages infiltrating sensory ganglia resolve pain by transferring particles containing mitochondria to neurons—thus boosting nociceptors back to normal function.

                Presynaptic active zones are megadalton-sized protein machines for spatiotemporal precision of neurotransmitter release. Tan et al. ablate active zones and rebuild their functions within synapses using small protein domains. RIM zinc fingers rendered undocked vesicles fusion competent, and Ca2+ triggering of release was restored by tethering this priming domain to Ca2+ channels.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current">The night brakes on fires are failing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature, Published online: 16 February 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00352-8">doi:10.1038/d41586-022-00352-8</a></p>Night-time is usually a crucial period when fires lose energy, limiting their size and severity, and helping people to control their spread. But rapid night-time warming over the past several decades, combined with global increases in fire intensity at night, suggest that the naturally occurring brakes on fires are weakening.
