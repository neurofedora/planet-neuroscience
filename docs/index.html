              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Npas4-mediated dopaminergic regulation of fear memory states</a></h4>

              
                Amygdala circuitry encodes associations between conditioned stimuli and aversive unconditioned stimuli, and also controls fear expression (Pape and Pare, 2010). However, whether and how irrelevant information for unpaired conditioned stimuli (CS-) is discretely processed, and how it was influenced by stress remain unknown. CS- memory is retrievable immediately after fear conditioning, but then becomes silent after memory consolidation in mice. Synaptic pathway from the lateral to the anterior basal amygdala gates the expression of CS- memory, depending upon Npas4-mediated Drd4 synthesis. The upregulation of Npas4-Drd4 axis, which is precluded by corticosterone, shifts functional states of neural engrams for CS- memory toward silent states and limits its retrievability. In here, we demonstrate the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the functional states of neural engrams, which can be switched or maintained, supporting discriminative memory.

	<p>Objective: We explored a novel model based on deep learning radiomics (DLR) to differentiate Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and normal control (NC) subjects. This model was validated in an exploratory study using tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) scans. Methods: In this study, we selected tau-PET scans from the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI), which included a total of 211 NC, 197 MCI, and 117 AD subjects. The dataset was divided into one training/validation group and one separate external group for testing. The proposed DLR model contained the following three steps: (1) pre-training of candidate deep learning models; (2) extraction and selection of DLR features; (3) classification based on support vector machine (SVM). In the comparative experiments, we compared the DLR model with three traditional models, including the SUVR model, traditional radiomics model, and a clinical model. Ten-fold cross-validation was carried out 200 times in the experiments. Results: Compared with other models, the DLR model achieved the best classification performance, with an accuracy of 90.76% &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.15% in NC vs. MCI, 88.43% &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.32% in MCI vs. AD, and 99.92% &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.51% in NC vs. AD. Conclusions: Our proposed DLR model had the potential clinical value to discriminate AD, MCI and NC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a Novel Axon Regeneration Role for Noncanonical Wnt Signaling in the Adult Retina after Injury</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways are essential for development and maintenance of the CNS. Whereas the roles of canonical Wnt pathways in neuronal survival and axonal regeneration in adult CNS have been described, the functions of noncanonical Wnt pathways are not well understood. Furthermore, the role of noncanonical Wnt ligands in the adult retina has not been investigated. Noncanonical Wnt signaling shares receptors with canonical Wnt ligands but functions through calcium and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Noncanonical ligands, such as the prototypic ligand Wnt5a, have varying effects in the developing CNS, including inhibiting or promoting axonal growth. To identify a role for noncanonical Wnt signaling in the developed retina after injury, we characterized the effect of Wnt5a on neurite outgrowth in cultured retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons and on axonal regeneration in the injured optic nerve in the mouse. Endogenous Wnt5a was upregulated after injury and exogenous Wnt5a significantly enhanced neurite growth of primary RGCs and led to extensive axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush (ONC) injury. Wnt5a also significantly increased RGC survival. Furthermore, Wnt5a induced phosphorylation of CamKII and JNK and induced expression of their downstream pathway components. Therefore, these results demonstrate for the first time that Wnt5a promotes axonal growth and protects RGCs in the adult retina.</p>

                Background Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) have been studied extensively to predict unfavourable outcomes in patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Shock index (SI) and modified shock index (MSI) are two new emerging parameters that incorporate BP and HR into their calculations, thereby improving the predictive value of each HR and BP alone in AMI patients. Thus, our aim was to determine the prognostic utility of SI and MSI in AMI patients. Methods We searched PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO Host, and Europe PMC from conception to May 2022. Studies were eligible if they evaluated the relationship of SI and MSI with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Results A total of 16 studies involving 80,195 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Our study revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality risk for patients with high SI and MSI compared to patients with low indices, regardless of the periods of outcomes, study population, or diverse cut-off values. Moreover, both increased SI and MSI also predicted higher major adverse cardiac events rates. Conclusions According to our findings, both SI and MSI in the emergency department can predict all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Given this growing body of evidence, as well as the fact that SI and MSI are very simple objective indices derived from two readily available vital signs, they should be used in daily clinical practice to risk stratify patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep learning prediction of chemical-induced dose-dependent and context-specific multiplex phenotype responses and its application to personalized alzheimer’s disease drug repurposing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by You Wu, Qiao Liu, Yue Qiu, Lei Xie</p>

Predictive modeling of drug-induced gene expressions is a powerful tool for phenotype-based compound screening and drug repurposing. State-of-the-art machine learning methods use a small number of fixed cell lines as a surrogate for predicting actual expressions in a new cell type or tissue, although it is well known that drug responses depend on a cellular context. Thus, the existing approach has limitations when applied to personalized medicine, especially for many understudied diseases whose molecular profiles are dramatically different from those characterized in the training data. Besides the gene expression, dose-dependent cell viability is another important phenotype readout and is more informative than conventional summary statistics (e.g., IC50) for characterizing clinical drug efficacy and toxicity. However, few computational methods can reliably predict the dose-dependent cell viability. To address the challenges mentioned above, we designed a new deep learning model, MultiDCP, to predict cellular context-dependent gene expressions and cell viability on a specific dosage. The novelties of MultiDCP include a knowledge-driven gene expression profile transformer that enables context-specific phenotypic response predictions of novel cells or tissues, integration of multiple diverse labeled and unlabeled omics data, the joint training of the multiple prediction tasks, and a teacher-student training procedure that allows us to utilize unreliable data effectively. Comprehensive benchmark studies suggest that MultiDCP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with unseen cell lines that are dissimilar from the cell lines in the supervised training in terms of gene expressions. The predicted drug-induced gene expressions demonstrate a stronger predictive power than noisy experimental data for downstream tasks. Thus, MultiDCP is a useful tool for transcriptomics-based drug repurposing and compound screening that currently rely on noisy high-throughput experimental data. We applied MultiDCP to repurpose individualized drugs for Alzheimer’s disease in terms of efficacy and toxicity, suggesting that MultiDCP is a potentially powerful tool for personalized drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nine quick tips for pathway enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Agapito</p>

Pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) is a computational biology method that identifies biological functions that are overrepresented in a group of genes more than would be expected by chance and ranks these functions by relevance. The relative abundance of genes pertinent to specific pathways is measured through statistical methods, and associated functional pathways are retrieved from online bioinformatics databases. In the last decade, along with the spread of the internet, higher availability of computational resources made PEA software tools easy to access and to use for bioinformatics practitioners worldwide. Although it became easier to use these tools, it also became easier to make mistakes that could generate inflated or misleading results, especially for beginners and inexperienced computational biologists. With this article, we propose nine quick tips to avoid common mistakes and to out a complete, sound, thorough PEA, which can produce relevant and robust results. We describe our nine guidelines in a simple way, so that they can be understood and used by anyone, including students and beginners. Some tips explain what to do before starting a PEA, others are suggestions of how to correctly generate meaningful results, and some final guidelines indicate some useful steps to properly interpret PEA results. Our nine tips can help users perform better pathway enrichment analyses and eventually contribute to a better understanding of current biology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-driven modelling captures dynamics of the circadian clock of Neurospora crassa</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amit Singh, Congxin Li, Axel C. R. Diernfellner, Thomas Höfer, Michael Brunner</p>

Eukaryotic circadian clocks are based on self-sustaining, cell-autonomous oscillatory feedback loops that can synchronize with the environment via recurrent stimuli (zeitgebers) such as light. The components of biological clocks and their network interactions are becoming increasingly known, calling for a quantitative understanding of their role for clock function. However, the development of data-driven mathematical clock models has remained limited by the lack of sufficiently accurate data. Here we present a comprehensive model of the circadian clock of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> that describe free-running oscillations in constant darkness and entrainment in light-dark cycles. To parameterize the model, we measured high-resolution time courses of luciferase reporters of morning and evening specific clock genes in WT and a mutant strain. Fitting the model to such comprehensive data allowed estimating parameters governing circadian phase, period length and amplitude, and the response of genes to light cues. Our model suggests that functional maturation of the core clock protein Frequency causes a delay in negative feedback that is critical for generating circadian rhythms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatiotemporal spread of Plasmodium falciparum mutations for resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine across Africa, 1990–2020</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer A. Flegg, Georgina S. Humphreys, Brenda Montanez, Taryn Strickland, Zaira J. Jacome-Meza, Karen I. Barnes, Jaishree Raman, Philippe J. Guerin, Carol Hopkins Sibley, Sabina Dahlström Otienoburu</p>
Background <p>Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended in Africa in several antimalarial preventive regimens including Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnant women (IPTp), Intermittent Preventive Treatment in infants (IPTi) and Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC). The effectiveness of SP-based preventive treatments are threatened in areas where <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> resistance to SP is high. The prevalence of mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase gene (<i>pfdhps</i>) can be used to monitor SP effectiveness. IPTi-SP is recommended only in areas where the prevalence of the <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation is below 50%. It has also been suggested that IPTp-SP does not have a protective effect in areas where the <i>pfdhps</i>581G mutation, exceeds 10%. However, <i>pfdhps</i> mutation prevalence data in Africa are extremely heterogenous and scattered, with data completely missing from many areas.</p> Methods and findings <p>The WWARN SP Molecular Surveyor database was designed to summarize dihydrofolate reductase (<i>pfdhfr)</i> and <i>pfdhps</i> gene mutation prevalence data. In this paper, <i>pfdhps</i> mutation prevalence data was used to generate continuous spatiotemporal surface maps of the estimated prevalence of the SP resistance markers <i>pfdhps</i>437G, <i>pfdhps</i>540E, and <i>pfdhps</i>581G in Africa from 1990 to 2020 using a geostatistical model, with a Bayesian inference framework to estimate uncertainty. The maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the <i>pfdhps</i>437G mutations across the entire continent over the last three decades. The <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation emerged from limited foci in East Africa to currently exceeding 50% estimated prevalence in most of East and South East Africa. <i>pfdhps</i>540E distribution is expanding at low or moderate prevalence in central Africa and a predicted focus in West Africa. Although the <i>pfdhps</i>581G mutation spread from one focus in East Africa in 2000, to exceeding 10% estimated prevalence in several foci in 2010, the predicted distribution of the marker did not expand in 2020, however our analysis indicated high uncertainty in areas where <i>pfdhps</i>581G is present. Uncertainty was higher in spatial regions where the prevalence of a marker is intermediate or where prevalence is changing over time.</p> Conclusions <p>The WWARN SP Molecular Surveyor database and a set of continuous spatiotemporal surface maps were built to provide users with standardized, current information on resistance marker distribution and prevalence estimates. According to the maps, the high prevalence of <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation was to date restricted to East and South East Africa, which is reassuring for continued use of IPTi and SMC in West Africa, but continuous monitoring is needed as the <i>pfdhps</i>540E distribution is expanding. Several foci where <i>pfdhps</i>581G prevalence exceeded 10% were identified. More data on the <i>pfdhps</i>581G distribution in these areas needs to be collected to guide IPTp-SP recommendations. Prevalence and uncertainty maps can be utilized together to strategically identify sites where increased surveillance can be most informative. This study combines a molecular marker database and predictive modelling to highlight areas of concern, which can be used to support decisions in public health, highlight knowledge gaps in certain regions, and guide future research.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Scelestial: Fast and accurate single-cell lineage tree inference based on a Steiner tree approximation algorithm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad-Hadi Foroughmand-Araabi, Sama Goliaei, Alice C. McHardy</p>

Single-cell genome sequencing provides a highly granular view of biological systems but is affected by high error rates, allelic amplification bias, and uneven genome coverage. This creates a need for data-specific computational methods, for purposes such as for cell lineage tree inference. The objective of cell lineage tree reconstruction is to infer the evolutionary process that generated a set of observed cell genomes. Lineage trees may enable a better understanding of tumor formation and growth, as well as of organ development for healthy body cells. We describe a method, Scelestial, for lineage tree reconstruction from single-cell data, which is based on an approximation algorithm for the Steiner tree problem and is a generalization of the neighbor-joining method. We adapt the algorithm to efficiently select a limited subset of potential sequences as internal nodes, in the presence of missing values, and to minimize cost by lineage tree-based missing value imputation. In a comparison against seven state-of-the-art single-cell lineage tree reconstruction algorithms—BitPhylogeny, OncoNEM, SCITE, SiFit, SASC, SCIPhI, and SiCloneFit—on simulated and real single-cell tumor samples, Scelestial performed best at reconstructing trees in terms of accuracy and run time. Scelestial has been implemented in C++. It is also available as an R package named RScelestial.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Host genotype controls ecological change in the leaf fungal microbiome</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Acer VanWallendael, Gian Maria Niccolo Benucci, Pedro Beschoren da Costa, Linnea Fraser, Avinash Sreedasyam, Felix Fritschi, Thomas E. Juenger, John T. Lovell, Gregory Bonito, David B. Lowry</p>

Leaf fungal microbiomes can be fundamental drivers of host plant success, as they contain pathogens that devastate crop plants and taxa that enhance nutrient uptake, discourage herbivory, and antagonize pathogens. We measured leaf fungal diversity with amplicon sequencing across an entire growing season in a diversity panel of switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). We also sampled a replicated subset of genotypes across 3 additional sites to compare the importance of time, space, ecology, and genetics. We found a strong successional pattern in the microbiome shaped both by host genetics and environmental factors. Further, we used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping and RNA sequencing to show that 3 cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (crRLKs) were linked to a genetic locus associated with microbiome structure. We confirmed GWAS results in an independent set of genotypes for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA markers. Fungal pathogens were central to microbial covariance networks, and genotypes susceptible to pathogens differed in their expression of the 3 crRLKs, suggesting that host immune genes are a principal means of controlling the entire leaf microbiome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Descriptive analysis of clinical and laboratory findings in relation to changes in SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics and cyclic threshold: a retrospective, single center observational study in patients treated with Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin combination ther</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cases of undiagnosed pneumonia have emerged, and sequencing of respiratory samples indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19.  Patients with higher viral load and lower Ct values tend to have progressive disease and severe lung injury. The objective of this study is to describe the clinical manifestation and disease outcomes of COVID-19 patients in relation to their Ct values. Methods: A retrospective, single center observational study was performed, including patients admitted to King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC) Riyadh between March 1st-29th, 2020 and have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The Ct value was identified to determine the viral load. All patients were treated according to KFSH&RC guidelines.  Patients were divided into HCQ/AZI and non HCQ/AZI treated groups. Results: There were many days where Ct values were not available. An attempt at imputing information for missing Ct values was made using logic.  The logic leads to an ordinal Ct score 1, 2, 3, or 4. As a result, complete Ct score profiles were available. There was no evidence of statistically significant difference between the two groups in regard to clinical severity, duration to negative test or changes in Ct values.  Conclusion: There is little knowledge known to the time profile of Ct values and their relation to disease course of COVID-19. This study provides insight on how Ct values might be used to determine treatment efficacy. As it might be difficult to obtain Ct values at all times, this study provides an imputation method that may be used with conservative statistical assumptions for analyses of Ct profiles.

                Background: Drinking coffee is known to have both positive and negative aftermath on periodontal health. The current study is aiming to systematically review the impact of coffee consumption on periodontal health status. Methods: An article search was carried out in two electronic databases (PUBMED and Web of Sciences). The assessment of the included articles were conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Data were analyzed qualitatively. Result: A total of 10 articles were included in this study. Most (5) of the studies discovered a negative correlation between coffee intake and periodontal health, while 4 other studies found the protective effect of daily coffee consumption against alveolar bone loss. Last, only one study found that coffee intake did not relate with periodontitis. Conclusion: The effect of coffee consumption on periodontal health was fragmented since coffee has complex components that may give either beneficial effects or negative impact on periodontal health.

                Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-morbidity is one of the rising public health problems. There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (≥200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. Conclusions: Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Electronic signature and attestation in conveyancing practice: A Malaysian legal perspective [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background  The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about an unprecedented disruption to global business activities. Physical face-to-face activities must be restricted due to movement control order (MCO). The clients are required to sign the documents physically in the presence of the solicitor who must subsequently attest to the signature of the clients. The issue arises whether electronic signature (e-signature) and attestation are permissible under the laws of Malaysia. The aim of this research was to study the legality of e-signature and attestation in conveyancing practice in Malaysia and subsequently to propose recommendations to overcome these issues.   Methods   This is qualitative study and not an empirical study. The data was collected by library-based research from various primary and secondary data sources, including case law in Malaysia, written statutes, publication of journal and article.   Results  The Digital Signatures Act 1997 (DSA) and the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 (ECA) have legalised e-signatures. The DSA is the law that governs the digital signatures in Malaysia. ECA has listed a few documents which are not legally accepted if signed electronically, namely Power of Attorney, the Wills and codicils, the Trusts, and negotiable instruments. However, with regards to the issue of attestation of these documents, there are no clear laws which govern the attestation. The legal issue arises when the lawyers who have attested these documents are liable to be called as witness under the Evidence Act 1950 to testify their signature if these documents are tendered as evidence in any court proceedings.   Conclusion  The laws in Malaysia have provided sufficient provisions for e-signatures but not the issue of attestation via online. Thus, it is suggested that there is a need for unique legal framework for attestation via online in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pre-Clinical Study: Immunohistochemical evaluation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 on rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) socket healing after application of platelet-rich fibrin with and without hydroxyapatite [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved wi</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tissue engineering technology has been used globally and proven to accelerate wound healing. This study aimed to analyse the effect of adding hydroxyapatite (HA) as a scaffold to platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) as a growth factor in accelerating the wound healing process as seen from the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Methods: This research is an animal experiment conducted on 18 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Rabbits were randomly divided into the following three groups of treatment: (G1) the application of PRF group, (G2) the application of PRF+HA group and (C) the control group without any application. Furthermore, each treatment group was split randomly into three groups of observation time. Periodontal tissue biopsy was performed to analyse the histopathological features that were examined on the basis of the level of MMP-13 immunoexpression. Results: MMP-13 immunoexpression in the PRF+HA group showed better histoscore results, indicating a substantial reduction in MMP-13 values compared with other groups. The healing process was shown to increase with increasing observation time (p<0.05), and the PRF+HA group outperformed the PRF and control groups. On day 3, MMP-13 exhibited a dark brown colour of Immunohistochemistry (IHC), which indicated an increase in the expression value of MMP-13 in the early stages of healing, namely, inflammation. On day 14, light brown IHC was seen, especially in group 2, as a reference that the remodeling process had begun. Conclusions: This study indicates that the administration of PRF and HA was capable of reducing the MMP-13 expression that significantly accelerates the socket healing process. Hydroxyapatite is an alloplastic material that has inherent bioactive properties that support osteoconduction, can bind MMPs, and showed faster healing results based on the observation time as documented by immunohistochemistry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of hydroxychloroquine adverse events in COVID-19 patients reported throughout Iraqi pharmacovigilance center in VigiBase™: A study based on WHO database [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hydroxychloroquine is a long-used medication, most commonly used to treat and prevent malaria, that also has anti-inflammatory and antiviral characteristics. Therefore, specialists have shown interest in the underlying mechanism of its antiviral activity. In vitro experiments have demonstrated its efficiency against SARS coronavirus, and in vitro and in vivo research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is being conducted. We aimed to investigate reports on adverse events of hydroxychloroquine submitted to the Iraqi Pharmacovigilance Centre and compare the incidence of these reported adverse events in Iraq to globally reported cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 using information component (IC)025 values. Methods: The reported adverse events of hydroxychloroquine to the national Pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase™ a WHO global database of reported potential side effects of medicinal products, were investigated qualitatively (age, sex, and severity) and quantitatively (using IC025) as a measure of the existence of new/altered safety information associated with hydroxychloroquine. Results: A total of 132 reports were found, with women representing 37.1% and men representing 60.6% of cases, while the rest were unidentified, with the predominant age groups ranging from 18–44 years old accounting for 47.4% of cases. The most reported adverse events were upper (17%) and lower abdomen pain (21%), nausea (14%), diarrhea (13%), and electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolongation (13%). There were 44 different drug-adverse reaction pairings in which the adverse reaction reports included more than one event. The IC025 value for the most widely reported adverse events showed a positive comparable value for upper (2/0.3) and lower abdominal pain (1.8/-0.0), palpitation (1.6/-0.4), and dyspepsia (1.1/0.6). There was a decreased value for IC025 in cases of ECG QT prolongation (3.5/5), diarrhea (0.3/0.8), abdominal discomfort (0.1/2), and oral fungal infection (-0.4/0.6). Conclusions: The IC025 helped determine the higher reporting rate of adverse events compared to the average global rates.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal fear engrams modulate ethanol‐induced maladaptive contextual generalization in mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The compounding symptomatology of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and co-occurring mental health disorders gives rise to interactions of maladaptive neurobiological processes, the etiology of which are elusive. Here, we devised an optogenetic strategy aimed at rescuing maladaptive fear processing in male c57BL/6 mice that underwent a chronic ethanol administration and forced abstinence paradigm. In the first experiment, we confirmed that fear acquisition and maladaptive contextual generalization was potentiated in ethanol-exposed mice during fear conditioning and exposure to a novel environment, respectively. In the second experiment, using an activity-dependent tet-tag system, we labeled the neural ensemble selectively activated by contextual fear conditioning in the dorsal hippocampus with an inhibitory opsin to attenuate behavioral dysfunctions resulting from ethanol exposure. We found that acute optogenetic perturbations during exposure to a novel environment suppressed maladaptive generalization in ethanol-exposed mice. These results provide further evidence for a crucial link between ethanol exposure and impaired fear memory processing by providing cellular and behavioral insights into the neural circuitry underlying AUD and maladaptive fear processing.</p>

                Vaughen et al. find that brain sphingolipids are degraded by glial-derived glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Glial gba1b knockout in Drosophila causes selective sphingolipid and phospholipid alterations, cyclic protein aggregates, and sleep loss. Specific sphingolipids fluctuate diurnally in the brain, and sphingolipid metabolism instructs structural remodeling of a key circadian circuit.

                Loss of blood-CNS barrier (BCNSB) function is a hallmark of neuroinflammatory diseases, including MS. Sun et al. show that ARF6-mediated crosstalk between IL-1β and ALK signaling induces presymptomatic endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), causing BCNSB disruption and disease progression in a mouse MS model. Inhibiting this pathway reverses EndoMT and disease severity, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy to treat MS.

                Duan et al. examine antibody and T-cell responses in Ad5-nCoV-vaccinated SARS-CoV-1 survivors six months after vaccination. They show that vaccination boosts neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-1 survivors but neutralization against VOCs is limited. SARS-CoV-1 survivors elicit a comparable SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response but a stronger SARS-CoV-1-specific T-cell response than naïve healthy individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Circadian oscillations in Trichoderma atroviride and the role of core clock components in secondary metabolism, development, and mycoparasitism against the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks are important for an individual’s fitness, and recent studies have underlined their role in the outcome of biological interactions. However, the relevance of circadian clocks in fungal-fungal interactions remains largely unexplored. We sought to characterize a functional clock in the biocontrol agent <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> to assess its importance in the mycoparasitic interaction against the phytopathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. By utilizing luciferase reporters to monitor the <i>T. atroviride</i> core-clock, we confirmed the existence of circadian oscillations of ~26h that are temperature-compensated and modulated by environmental cues such as light and temperature. Notably, the presence of such rhythms appears to be highly dependent on the nutritional composition of the media. Heterologous expression of the <i>T. atroviride</i> negative clock component (<i>tafrq</i>) in a clock null (<i>Δfrq</i>) strain of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> restored core clock function in the latter fungus, with the same period observed in <i>T. atroviride</i>, confirming the role of <i>tafrq</i> as a <i>bona fide</i> core-clock component. Confrontation assays between wild-type and clock mutant strains of <i>T. atroviride </i>and <i>B. cinerea</i>, in constant light or darkness, revealed an inhibitory effect of light on <i>T. atroviride's </i>mycoparasitic capabilities. Interestingly, when confrontation assays were performed under light/dark cycles, <i>T. atroviride's </i>overgrowth capacity was enhanced when inoculations were at dawn compared to dusk. Deleting the core-clock negative element FRQ in <i>B. cinerea</i>, but not in <i>T. atroviride</i>, was vital for the daily differential phenotype, suggesting that the <i>B. cinerea</i> clock has a more significant influence on the result of this interaction. Additionally, we observed that <i>T. atroviride</i> clock components modulate development and secondary metabolism in this fungus, affecting the production of several molecules, including volatile compounds, such as 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6-PP). Notably, we detected the rhythmic production of distinct <i>T. atroviride</i> volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which depended on its circadian clock. Thus, this study provides evidence on how clock components impact diverse aspects of <i>T. atroviride</i> lifestyle and how daily changes modulate fungal interactions and dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Th2 single-cell heterogeneity and clonal distribution at distant sites in helminth-infected mice</a></h4>

              
                Th2 cells provide effector functions in type 2 immune responses to helminths and allergens. Despite knowledge about molecular mechanisms of Th2 cell differentiation, there is little information on Th2 cell heterogeneity and clonal distribution between organs. To address this, we performed combined single-cell transcriptome and TCR clonotype analysis on murine Th2 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and lung after infection with <i>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</i> (Nb) as a human hookworm infection model. We find organ-specific expression profiles, but also populations with conserved migration or effector/resident memory signatures that unexpectedly cluster with potentially regulatory <i>Il10<sup>pos</sup>Foxp3<sup>neg</sup></i> cells. A substantial MLN subpopulation with an interferon response signature suggests a role for interferon-signaling in Th2 differentiation or diversification. Further RNA-inferred developmental directions indicate proliferation as a hub for differentiation decisions. Although the TCR repertoire is highly heterogeneous, we identified expanded clones and CDR3 motifs. Clonal relatedness between distant organs confirmed effective exchange of Th2 effector cells, although locally expanded clones dominated the response. We further cloned an Nb-specific TCR from an expanded clone in the lung effector cluster and describe surface markers that distinguish transcriptionally defined clusters. These results provide insights in Th2 cell subset diversity and clonal relatedness in distant organs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel processing, hierarchical transformations, and sensorimotor associations along the 'where' pathway</a></h4>

              
                Visually guided behaviors require the brain to transform ambiguous retinal images into object-level spatial representations and implement sensorimotor transformations. These processes are supported by the dorsal 'where' pathway. However, the specific functional contributions of areas along this pathway remain elusive due in part to methodological differences across studies. We previously showed that macaque caudal intraparietal (CIP) area neurons possess robust three-dimensional (3D) visual representations, carry choice- and saccade-related activity, and exhibit experience-dependent sensorimotor associations (Chang et al., 2020b). Here, we used a common experimental design to reveal parallel processing, hierarchical transformations, and the formation of sensorimotor associations along the 'where' pathway by extending the investigation to V3A, a major feedforward input to CIP. Higher-level 3D representations and choice-related activity were more prevalent in CIP than V3A. Both areas contained saccade-related activity that predicted the direction/timing of eye movements. Intriguingly, the time-course of saccade-related activity in CIP aligned with the temporally integrated V3A output. Sensorimotor associations between 3D orientation and saccade direction preferences were stronger in CIP than V3A, and moderated by choice signals in both areas. Together, the results explicate parallel representations, hierarchical transformations, and functional associations of visual and saccade-related signals at a key juncture in the 'where' pathway.

                One defining goal of microbiome research is to uncover mechanistic causation that dictates the emergence of structural and functional traits of microbiomes. However, the extraordinary degree of ecosystem complexity has hampered the realization of the goal. Here, we developed a systematic, complexity-reducing strategy to mechanistically elucidate the compositional and metabolic characteristics of microbiome by using the kombucha tea microbiome as an example. The strategy centered around a two-species core that was abstracted from but recapitulated the native counterpart. The core was convergent in its composition, coordinated on temporal metabolic patterns, and capable for pellicle formation. Controlled fermentations uncovered the drivers of these characteristics, which were also demonstrated translatable to provide insights into the properties of communities with increased complexity and altered conditions. This work unravels the pattern and process underlying the kombucha tea microbiome, providing a potential conceptual framework for mechanistic investigation of microbiome behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of early life stress and subsequent re-exposure to stress on neuronal activity in the lateral habenula</a></h4>

              
                Early life stress can result in depression in humans and depressive-like behaviour in rodents. In various animal models of depression, the lateral habenula (LHb) has been shown to become hyperactive immediately after early life stress. However, whether these pathological changes persist into adulthood is less well understood. Hence, we utilised the maternal separation (MS) model of depression to study how early life stress alters LHb physiology and depressive behaviour in adult mice. We find that only a weak depressive phenotype persists into adulthood which surprisingly is underpinned by LHb hypoactivity in acute slices, accompanied by alterations in both excitatory and inhibitory signalling. However, while we find the LHb to be less active at rest, we report that the neurons reside in a sensitised state where they are more responsive to re-exposure to stress in adulthood in the form of acute restraint, thus priming them to respond to aversive events with an increase in neuronal activity mediated by changes in glutamatergic transmission. These findings thus suggest that in addition to LHb hyperactivity, hypoactivity likely also promotes an adverse phenotype. Re-exposure to stress results in the reappearance of LHb hyperactivity offering a possible mechanism to explain how depression relapses occur following previous depressive episodes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stratification of responses to tDCS intervention in a healthy paediatric population based on resting-state EEG profiles</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with a wide variety of applications in both the clinical and cognitive psychology domains. As increasingly acknowledged, its effectiveness is subject dependent, which may lead to timely and costly treatments with ineffective results if this variability is not taken into account. We propose the usage of electroencephalography (EEG) for the analysis and prediction of individual responses to tDCS. In this context the application of machine learning can be of enormous help. We analysed resting-state EEG activity to identify subgroups of participants with an homogeneous electrophysiological profile and their response to different tDCS interventions. The study described herein, which focuses on healthy controls, was conducted within a clinical trial for the development of treatments based on tDCS for age-matched children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have studied a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled tDCS intervention in 56 healthy children and adolescents aged 10-17, applied in 2 parallel groups over 2 target regions, namely left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (lDLPFC) and right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (rIFG). Cognitive behavioural tasks were used to both activate particular brain areas during the stimulation and to assess the impact of the intervention afterwards. We have implemented an unsupervised learning approach to stratify participants based on their resting-state EEG spectral features before the tDCS application. We have then applied a correlational analysis to identify EEG profiles associated with tDCS subject response to the specific stimulation sites and the presence or not of concurrent tasks during the intervention. In the results we found specific digital electrophysiological profiles that can be associated to a positive response, whereas subjects with other profiles respond negatively or do not respond to the intervention. Findings suggest that unsupervised machine learning procedures, when associated with proper visualization features, can be successfully used to interpret and eventually to predict responses of individuals to tDCS treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psychological mechanisms of offset analgesia: The effect of expectancy manipulation</a></h4>

              
                A frequently used paradigm to quantify endogenous pain modulation is offset analgesia, which is defined as a disproportionate large reduction in pain following a small decrease in a heat stimulus. The aim of this study was to determine whether suggestion influences the magnitude of offset analgesia in healthy participants. A total of 102 participants were randomized into three groups (hypoalgesic group, hyperalgesic group, control group). All participants received four heat stimuli (two constant trials and two offset trials) to the ventral, non-dominant forearm while they were asked to rate their perceived pain using a computerized visual analogue scale. In addition, electrodermal activity was measured during each heat stimulus. Participants in both intervention groups were given a visual and verbal suggestion about the expected pain response in an hypoalgesic and hyperalgesic manner. The control group received no suggestion. In all groups, significant offset analgesia was provoked, indicated by reduced pain ratings (p < 0.001) and enhanced electrodermal activity level (p < 0.01). A significant group difference in the magnitude of offset analgesia was found between the three groups (F[2,94] = 4.81, p < 0.05). Participants in the hyperalgesic group perceived significantly more pain than the hypoalgesic group (p = 0.031) and the control group (p < 0.05). However, the electrodermal activity data did not replicate this trend (p > 0.05). The results of this study indicate that suggestion can be effective to reduce but not increase endogenous pain modulation quantified by offset analgesia in healthy participants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective Nigrostriatal Dopamine Excess Impairs Behaviors Linked to the Cognitive and Negative Symptoms of Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Excess dopamine release in the dorsal striatum (DS) is linked to psychosis. Antipsychotics are thought to work for positive symptoms by blocking striatal D2 dopamine receptors, but they lack efficacy for the negative and cognitive symptoms. Further, broadly increasing dopamine release improves cognitive function. These observations fueled the dogma that excess dopamine is not involved in negative and cognitive symptoms, but this has never been tested with dopamine pathway specificity. METHODS: We selectively re-expressed excitatory TRPV1 receptors in DS-projecting dopamine neurons of male and female Trpv1 knockout mice. We treated these mice with capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist) to selectively ac-tivate these neurons, validated this approach with fiber photometry, and assessed its effects on social and cogni-tive function. We combined this manipulation with antipsychotic treatment (haloperidol) and compared the path-way-specific manipulation to treatment with the non-selective dopamine releaser amphetamine. RESULTS: Selectively activating DS-projecting dopamine neurons increased DS (but not cortical) dopamine release and increased locomotor activity. Surprisingly, this manipulation also impaired behavioral processes linked to negative and cognitive symptoms (social drive and working memory). Haloperidol normalized locomo-tion, only partially rescued working memory, and had no effect on social interaction. By contrast, amphetamine increased locomotion but did not impair social interaction or working memory. CONCLUSIONS: Excess dopamine release, when restricted to the DS, causes behavioral deficits linked to negative and cognitive symptoms. Previous studies using non-selective approaches to release dopamine likely overlooked these contributions of excess dopamine to psychosis. Future therapies should address this disre-garded role for excess striatal dopamine in the treatment-resistant symptoms of psychosis.

                The mouse brain is by far the most intensively studied among mammalian brains, yet basic measures of its cytoarchitecture remain obscure. For example, quantifying cell numbers, and the interplay of sex-, strain-, and individual variability in cell density and volume is out of reach for many regions. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity project produces high-resolution full brain images of hundreds of brains. Although these were created for a different purpose, they reveal details of neuroanatomy and cytoarchitecture. Here, we used this population to systematically characterize cell density and volume for each anatomical unit in the mouse brain. We developed a deep neural network-based segmentation pipeline that uses the auto-fluorescence intensities of images to segment cell nuclei even within the densest regions, such as the dentate gyrus. We applied our pipeline to 537 brains of males and females from C57BL/6J and FVB.CD1 strains. Globally, we found that increased overall brain volume does not result in uniform expansion across all regions. Moreover, region-specific density changes are often negatively correlated with the volume of the region, therefore cell count does not scale linearly with volume. Many regions, including layer 2/3 across several cortical areas, showed distinct lateral bias. We identified the greatest strain-specific or sex-specific differences in the medial amygdala (MEA), bed nuclei (BST), lateral septum and olfactory system (e.g., MOB, AOB, TR) and prefrontal areas (e.g., ORB) - yet, inter-individual variability was always greater than the effect size of a single qualifier. We provide the results of this analysis as an accessible resource for the community.

                Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide. A polymorphism in FAAH (FAAH C385A) reduces FAAH expression, increases anandamide levels, and increases the risk of obesity. Nevertheless, some studies have found no association between FAAH C385A and obesity. We investigated whether the environmental context governs the impact of FAAH C385A on metabolic outcomes. Using a C385A knock-in mouse model, we found that under basal conditions, there was no effect of the FAAH C385A polymorphism on body weight or composition. By contrast, FAAH A/A mice are more susceptible to glucocorticoid-induced hyperphagia, weight gain, and activation of hypothalamic AMPK. AMPK inhibition occluded the amplified hyperphagic response to glucocorticoids in FAAH A/A mice. FAAH knockdown exclusively in AgRP neurons mimicked the exaggerated feeding response of FAAH A/A mice to glucocorticoids. FAAH A/A mice likewise presented exaggerated orexigenic responses to ghrelin, while FAAH knockdown in AgRP neurons blunted leptin anorectic responses. Together, the FAAH A/A genotype amplifies orexigenic responses and decreases anorexigenic responses, providing a putative mechanism explaining the diverging human findings.

                Failure of inhibiting fear in response to harmless stimuli contributes to anxiety disorders. Extinction training only temporarily suppresses fear memories in adults, but it is highly effective in juveniles. GABAergic parvalbumin-positive (PV+) cells restrict plasticity in adult brains, thus increasing PV+ cell plasticity could promote the suppression of fear memories following extinction training in adults. Histone deacetylase 2 (Hdac2) restrains both structural and functional synaptic plasticity; however, whether and how Hdac2 controls adult PV+ cell plasticity is unknown. Here, we report that Hdac2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition in PV+ cells attenuate spontaneous recovery of fear memory after fear extinction learning in adults. These manipulations promote a temporally restricted downregulation of Acan, a critical perineuronal net component expressed exclusively by PV+ cells in medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, we show that Acan transient downregulation before extinction training but after fear memory acquisition is sufficient to reduce spontaneous fear memory recovery in wild-type mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast, Efficient Multimodal Image Normalisation Tool (FEMINisT) for the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study: the FEMINisT ABCD Atlas</a></h4>

              
                The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aims to measure the trajectories of brain, cognitive, and emotional development. Cognitive and behavioural development during late childhood and adolescence have been associated with a myriad of microstructural and morphological alterations across the brain, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These associations may be strongly localised or spatially diffuse, therefore, it would be advantageous to analyse multimodal MRI data in concert, and across the whole brain. The ABCD study presents the unique challenge of integrating multimodal data from tens of thousands of scans at multiple timepoints, within a reasonable computation time. To address the need for a multimodal registration and atlas for the ABCD dataset, we present the synthesis of an ABCD atlas using the Fast and Efficient Multimodal Image Normalisation Tool (FEMINisT). The FEMINisT ABCD atlas was generated from baseline and two-year follow up imaging data using an iterative approach to synthesise a cohort-specific atlas from linear and nonlinear deformations of eleven channels of diffusion and structural MRI data. We evaluated the performance of FEMINisT against two widely used methods and show that FEMINisT achieves comparable alignment to current state-of-the-art multimodal registration, at a fraction of the computation time. To validate the use of the ABCD FEMINisT atlas in whole brain, voxelwise analysis, we replicate and expand on previously published region-of-interest analysis between diffusion MRI-derived measures and body mass index (BMI). We also report novel association between BMI and brain morphology derived from the registration deformations. We present the ABCD FEMINisT atlas as a publicly available resource to facilitate whole brain voxelwise analyses for the ABCD study.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Limbic progesterone receptors regulate spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Progesterone and its receptors (PRs) participate in mating and reproduction, but their role in spatial memory, which would aid in mate finding, is not understood. Male and female mice express PRs in regions that support spatial memory: the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. PRs were predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons in Pgr-Cre mice injected with AAV-delivered flexed tdTomato. Furthermore, segesterone, a specific PR agonist, activated neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the hippocampus. We assessed the PR function in these spatial memory circuit neurons by examining the performance of mice lacking this receptor (PRKO) in novel object recognition, object placement, and Y-maze alternation tasks. In the recognition test, wild-type littermates spent significantly more time exploring the new object than male PRKO mice. The EC-specific deletion of PRs was sufficient to induce a deficit in detecting familiar versus never experienced or new objects. We confirmed deficits in spatial memory of PRKO mice by testing them on the Y-maze forced alternation task. In contrast to spatial tasks, PR removal did not alter the response to fear conditioning. PRs also support spatial memory in female mice. These studies provide novel insights into the role of PR in facilitating spatial, declarative memory in males and females, which may help with finding reproductive partners.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct encoding and post-encoding representational formats contribute to episodic sequence memory formation</a></h4>

              
                In episodic encoding, an unfolding experience is rapidly transformed into a memory representation that binds separate episodic elements into a memory form to be later recollected. Here, we sought to investigate the representational format that accounts for successful memory formation of episodic sequences. We combined RSA and multivariate decoding analysis on scalp EEG recordings while healthy female (N = 17) and male (N = 13) human participants encoded trial-unique combinations of face-object-scene picture triplets that were subsequently recalled in a test. Our findings revealed an ongoing process of image category integration throughout sequence encoding, that this process accumulated as a function of picture order in the sequence and that the degree of picture category integration throughout sequence encoding was not associated with episodic retrieval. We also found that episodic sequences that were later remembered were associated with an increased trial-specific neural similarity between EEG patterns elicited during picture sequence encoding and in the offset period, thereby indicating that a rapid memory reinstatement at the episodic offset supported the rapid transformation of an episodic sequence into a bound memory representation. The present findings demonstrate the time course and the functional relevance of the different representational formats that take place during online encoding and immediate offline periods that support the formation of memories for episodic sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Can a short math video enhance the brain's mathematical networks?</a></h4>

              
                Many teaching websites, such as the Khan Academy, propose vivid videos illustrating a mathematical concept. Using fMRI, we asked whether watching such a video suffices to rapidly change the brain networks for mathematical knowledge. We capitalized on the finding that, when judging the truth of short spoken statements, distinct semantic regions activate depending on whether the statements bear on mathematical knowledge or on other domains of semantic knowledge. Here, participants answered such questions before and after watching a lively five-minute video which taught them the rudiments of a new domain. During the video, a distinct math-responsive network, comprising anterior intraparietal and inferior temporal nodes, showed inter-subject synchrony when viewing mathematics course rather than control courses in biology or law. However, this experience led to minimal subsequent changes in the activity of those domain-specific areas when answering questions on the same topics a few minutes later. All taught facts, whether mathematical or not, led to domain-general repetition enhancement, particularly prominent in the cuneus, posterior cingulate and posterior parietal cortices. We conclude that short videos do not suffice to induce a meaningful lasting change in the brain's math-responsive network, but merely engage domain-general regions possibly involved in episodic short-term memory.

                Flexible neural electrodes improve the recording longevity and quality of individual neurons by promoting tissue-electrode integration. However, the intracortical implantation of flexible electrodes inevitably induces tissue damage. Understanding the longitudinal neural and vascular recovery following the intracortical implantation is critical for the ever-growing applications of flexible electrodes in both healthy and disordered brains. Aged animals are of particular interest because they play a key role in modeling neurological disorders, but their tissue-electrode interface remains mostly unstudied. Here we integrate in-vivo two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recording to determine the time-dependent neural and vascular dynamics after the implantation of ultraflexible neural electrodes in aged mice. We find heightened angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in the first two weeks after implantation, which coincides with the rapid increase in local field potentials and unit activities detected by electrophysiological recordings. Vascular remodeling in shallow cortical layers preceded that in deeper layers, which often lasted longer than the recovery of neural signals. By six weeks post-implantation vascular abnormalities had subsided, resulting in normal vasculature and microcirculation. Putative cell classification based on firing pattern and waveform shows similar recovery time courses in fast-spiking interneurons and pyramidal neurons. These results elucidate how structural damages and remodeling near implants affecting recording efficacy, and support the application of ultraflexible electrodes in aged animals at minimal perturbations to endogenous neurophysiology.

                Mounting evidence suggests a role for the microbiome-gut-brain axis in amyloid-associated neurodegeneration, but the pathogenic changes induced by amyloids in the gastro-intestinal tract remain elusive. To scrutinize the early response to amyloids of human and bacterial origin, we challenged primary murine myenteric networks with A{beta}1-42 (vs a scrambled version of A{beta}1-42) and curli (vs culture medium), respectively, and performed shotgun RNA sequencing. Both amyloid types induced a transcriptional signature of DNA damage and cell cycle dysregulation. Using in vitro neurosphere-derived cultures and in vivo amyloid injections we found that enteric glia and smooth muscle cells were the most responsive cell types, showing increased proliferation, {gamma}H2AX burden and SOD2 levels after amyloid challenge. Consistent with this activated state, we identified a pro-inflammatory hub in the transcriptional profile of amyloid-stimulated myenteric networks. Enteric glia were the principal source of the associated cytokines, and in vivo, this was accompanied by an influx of immune cells. Together, these results shed new light on the intrinsic vulnerability of ENS cells to both amyloid species and position enteric glial cell activation as an early driver of neurodegenerative disease progression.

                Humans accumulate with age the dark-brown pigment neuromelanin inside specific neuronal groups. Neurons with the highest neuromelanin levels are particularly susceptible to degeneration in Parkinson's disease, especially dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), the loss of which leads to characteristic motor Parkinson's disease symptoms. In contrast to humans, neuromelanin does not appear spontaneously in most animals, including rodents, and Parkinson's disease is an exclusively human condition. Using humanized neuromelanin-producing rodents, we recently found that neuromelanin can trigger Parkinson's disease pathology when accumulated above a specific pathogenic threshold. Here, by taking advantage of this newly developed animal model, we assessed whether the intracellular buildup of neuromelanin that occurs with age can be slowed down in vivo to prevent or attenuate Parkinson's disease. Because neuromelanin derives from the oxidation of free cytosolic dopamine, we enhanced dopamine vesicular encapsulation in the SN of neuromelanin-producing rats by viral vector-mediated overexpression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). This strategy reduced the formation of potentially toxic oxidized dopamine species that can convert into neuromelanin and maintained intracellular neuromelanin levels below their pathogenic threshold. Decreased neuromelanin production was associated with an attenuation of Lewy body-like inclusion formation and a long-term preservation of dopamine homeostasis, nigrostriatal neuronal integrity and motor function in these animals. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic potential of modulating age-dependent intracellular neuromelanin production in vivo, thereby opening an unexplored path for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and, in a broader sense, brain aging.

                Cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach to recover loss of neurons and vision in patient retinas. So far, human photoreceptor transplants restored some visual function in degenerating mouse retina. Whether retinal cell transplants also integrate into human retina, and how to optimize this for different pathologies are still unknown. Here, we sought to determine if human retina organoids generated from pluripotent stem cells might assist cell replacement therapy development in a human-to-human setting. Models for intra- and subretinal cell transplantation strategies were explored: Photoreceptor donor cells carrying a transgenic fluorescent reporter were enriched from acutely dissociated human retinal organoids. Donor cells were precisely transplanted by microinjection into the retina of host organoids, but high cell numbers might require multiple injections posing potential damage. Alternatively, donor cells were transplanted in large numbers by placing them in subretinal-like contact to the apical organoid surface. Using postmitotic retinal organoids (age >170-days) as a source for donor cells and as hosts, we show that six weeks after subretinal-like transplantation, large clusters of photoreceptors reproducibly incorporate into the host retina. Transplanted clusters frequently are located within or across the host photoreceptor layer, include cone and rod photoreceptors, and become infiltrated by cell processes of host Muller glia, indicative of structural integration. Histological and ultrastructural data of virally-labeled photoreceptor transplants show characteristic morphological and structural features of polarized photoreceptors: inner segments and ribbon synapses, and donor-host cell contacts develop contributing to the retinal outer limiting membrane. These results demonstrate that human retinal organoids provide a preclinical research system for cell replacement therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Facilitation-inhibition control of motor neuronal persistent inward currents in young and older adults</a></h4>

              
                A well-coordinated control of motor neuronal persistent inward currents (PICs) via diffuse neuromodulation and local inhibition is essential to ensure motor units discharge at required times and frequencies. Current best estimates indicate that PICs are reduced in older adults; however, it is not yet known whether PIC facilitation-inhibition control is also altered with ageing. We investigated the responses of PICs to i) a remote handgrip contraction, which is believed to diffusely increase serotonergic input onto motor neurones, and ii) tendon vibration of the antagonist muscle, which elicits reciprocal inhibition, in both young and older adults. High-density surface electromyograms were collected from soleus and tibialis anterior of 18 young and 26 older adults during triangular-shaped plantar and dorsiflexion contractions to 20% (handgrip experiments) and 30% (vibration experiments) of maximum torque (rise-decline rate of 2%/s). The paired-motor-unit analysis was used to calculate {triangleup}F, which is assumed proportional to PICs strength. {Delta}F increased in both soleus (0.55pps, 16.0%) and tibialis anterior (0.42pps, 11.4%) during the handgrip contraction independent of age. Antagonist muscle tendon vibration reduced {Delta}F in soleus (0.28pps, 12.6%), independent of age, but less reduction was observed in older (0.42pps, 10.7%) than young adults (0.72pps, 17.8%) in tibialis anterior. Our data indicate a preserved ability of older adults to amplify PICs following a remote handgrip contraction, during which increased serotonergic input onto the motor neurones is expected, in both soleus and tibialis anterior. However, PIC deactivation in response to reciprocal inhibition was impaired with ageing in tibialis anterior yet preserved in soleus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Impact of Brief Monocular Retinal Inactivation on the Central Visual System During Postnatal Development</a></h4>

              
                During a critical period of postnatal life, monocular deprivation (MD) of kittens by eyelid closure reduces the size of neurons in layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) connected to the deprived eye, and shifts cortical ocular dominance in favor of the non-deprived eye, modeling deprivation amblyopia in humans. Following long-term MD, temporary retinal inactivation of the non-deprived eye with microinjection of tetrodotoxin can promote superior recovery from MD, and at older ages, in comparison to conventional occlusion therapy. This suggests that monocular inactivation (MI) is a more potent approach to producing neural plasticity than occlusion. In the current study we assessed the modification of neuron size in the dLGN as a means of measuring the impact of a brief period of MI imposed at different ages during postnatal development. The biggest impact of inactivation was observed when it occurred at the peak of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. The effect of MI was evident in both the binocular and monocular segments of the dLGN, distinguishing it from MD that produces changes only within the binocular segment. With increasing age, the capacity for inactivation to alter postsynaptic cell size diminished but was still significant beyond the classic critical period. In comparison to MD, inactivation consistently produced effects that were about double in magnitude, and inactivation exhibited efficacy to produce neural modifications at older ages than MD. Notwithstanding the large neural alterations precipitated by inactivation, its anatomical effects were remediated with a short period of binocular visual experience, and vision through the previously inactivated eye fully recovered after washout of TTX. Our results demonstrate that MI is a potent means of modifying the visual pathway, and does so beyond the age at which occlusion is effective. The magnitude and longevity of inactivation to evoke neural modification highlights its potential to ameliorate disorders of the visual system such as amblyopia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bidirectional and reciprocal control of astrocyte free calcium by modest fluctuations in external potassium</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes sense and respond to changes in the concentration of extracellular K+, and separately contribute to multiple physiological processes through Ca2+ dependent mechanisms. Yet, whether a modest change in [K+]o impacts astrocyte free Ca2+ remains unclear. Using relative or quantitative two-photon fluorescence Ca2+ imaging in acute brain slices or in vivo in the somatosensory cortex from Sprague Dawley rats and C57Bl/6 mice, we showed that changes to external K+ (+/- 1mM to 2.5mM) reciprocally controls the astrocyte Rhod-2 or OGB-1 Ca2+-dependent fluorescence in the soma, major processes and endfeet. The astrocyte Ca2+ decrease when [K+]o was elevated was sensitive to lowering the external concentration of Ca2+, Cl-, and HCO3-, but not Na+. Unexpectedly, the phenomenon was blocked by inhibiting K-Cl cotransport. Picrotoxin induced ictal neural activity drove an analogous decrease of astrocyte Ca2+. K+ mediated cerebral arteriole dilation in brain slices was also sensitive to inhibiting K-Cl cotransport as well as whole-cell patching a peri-arteriole astrocyte which perturbs normal Ca2+, Cl- and HCO3- concentration gradients. These data reveal subtle, bidirectional regulation of astrocyte free Ca2 via fluctuations of [K+]o within the physiological range.

                While depression and chronic pain are frequently comorbid, underlying neuronal circuits, and their relevance for the understanding of psychopathology, remain poorly defined. Here we show in mice that hyperactivity of the neuronal pathway linking the basolateral amygdala to the anterior cingulate cortex is essential for chronic pain-induced depression. In naive animals, we demonstrate that activation of this pathway is sufficient to trigger depressive-like behaviors, as well as transcriptomic alterations that recapitulate core molecular features of depression in the human brain. These alterations notably impact gene modules related to myelination and the oligodendrocyte lineage. Among these, we show that Sema4a, a hub gene significantly upregulated in both mice and humans in the context of altered mood, is necessary for the emergence of depressive-like behaviors. Overall, these results place the BLA-ACC pathway at the core of pain and depression comorbidity, and unravel the role of impaired myelination and Sema4a in mood control.

                Background: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) symptoms often emerge in adolescence. However, little is known about the functional organization of intrinsic brain networks in young people with BPD symptoms. Methods: In this study we collected resting-state fMRI data in a sample of adolescents and young adults with (nBPD = 40) and without BPD (nHC= 42) symptoms. Using a detailed cortico-limbic parcellation coupled with graph theoretical analyses, we tested for group and age-related differences in regional functional and effective connectivity (FC, EC) and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). We conducted a series of analyses that progressed from global network properties to focal tests of EC amongst nodes in Salience (SN) and Dorsal Attention Networks (DAN). Results: At the regional level, regularized regression analyses revealed a broad pattern of hyper-connectivity and heightened ALFF in R dorsal anterior insula (daIns), in addition to hypoconnectivity in R temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and decreased ALFF in multiple DAN regions. Furthermore, analyses of EC amongst daIns, TPJ, and DAN revealed that in BPD participants daIns exerts a heightened influence on TPJ and DAN regions. Finally, multivariate mediation models indicated that lower DANALFF was differentially predicted by EC from TPJ and daIns. Conclusions: Our findings provide converging evidence that heightened EC from daIns impairs network-wide ALFF in DAN both directly and indirectly via impaired TPJ functioning. We interpret this pattern of findings in line with an "attentional hijacking" account of borderline personality.

                Food is a powerful natural reinforcer that guides feeding decisions. The vagus nerve conveys internal sensory information from the gut to the brain about nutritional value; however, the cellular and molecular basis of macronutrient-specific reward circuits are poorly understood. Here, we monitor in vivo calcium dynamics to provide direct evidence of independent vagal sensing pathways for detection of dietary fats and sugars. Using activity-dependent genetic capture of nutrient-specific vagal neurons activated in response gut infusions, we demonstrate the existence of separate hard-wired reward circuits for fat and sugar that are necessary and sufficient for nutrient-specific reinforcement. Even after controlling for calories, combined activation of fat and sugar circuits increases dorsal striatal dopamine levels and overeating compared to fat or sugar alone. This work provides new insight on the complex sensory circuitry that mediates motivated behavior and suggests that a subconscious internal drive to consume obesogenic diets (e.g., those high in both fat and sugar) may impede conscious dieting efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">There is no fundamental trade-off between prediction accuracy and feature importance reliability</a></h4>

              
                There is significant interest in using neuroimaging data to predict behavior. The predictive models are often interpreted by the computation of feature importance, which quantifies the predictive relevance of an imaging feature. Tian and Zalesky (2021) suggest that feature importance estimates exhibit low test-retest reliability, pointing to a potential trade-off between prediction accuracy and feature importance reliability. This trade-off is counter-intuitive because both prediction accuracy and test-retest reliability reflect the reliability of brain-behavior relationships across independent samples. Here, we revisit the relationship between prediction accuracy and feature importance reliability in a large well-powered dataset across a wide range of behavioral measures. We demonstrate that, with a sufficient sample size, feature importance (operationalized as Haufe-transformed weights) can achieve fair to excellent test-retest reliability. More specifically, with a sample size of about 2600 participants, Haufe-transformed weights achieve average intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.75, 0.57 and 0.53 for cognitive, personality and mental health measures respectively. Haufe-transformed weights are much more reliable than original regression weights and univariate FC-behavior correlations. Intriguingly, feature importance reliability is strongly positively correlated with prediction accuracy across phenotypes. Within a particular behavioral domain, there was no clear relationship between prediction performance and feature importance reliability across regression algorithms. Finally, we show mathematically that feature importance reliability is necessary, but not sufficient, for low feature importance error. In the case of linear models, lower feature importance error leads to lower prediction error (up to a scaling by the feature covariance matrix). Overall, we find no fundamental trade-off between feature importance reliability and prediction accuracy.

                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disease, affecting more than 55 million people worldwide. AD is clinically characterized by a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions, which implicate the cholinergic system. Activity-induced neuroprotection based on gamma oscillation-audiovisual stimuli-is shown to be possible. Bulk RNA-seq data from treatment involving sensory stimuli were obtained, and bioinformatics analyses were performed. Activity-induced neuroprotection was found to be strongly associated with the downregulation of synaptic calcium signaling and cholinergic transmission. Candidate genes were screened in consultation with the Allen Brain Atlas Transcriptomics Explorer. We propose that Chrnb4 and Plcb4 are potential therapeutic targets for AD treatment. Chrnb4 has already been identified as a potential immune-relevant drug target gene using ontology inference, network analysis, and methylation signal, while multiple studies suggest that primary phospholipase C proteins play an integral role in inducing cell death in AD. Hence, both Chrnb4 and Plcb4 should be considered for future in vitro and in vivo studies as candidate genes.

                Animals that consume fermenting fruit or nectar are exposed to ethanol, thus increasing their risk of injury or predation. This risk is heightened in humans, who have actively fermented and imbibed alcohol for thousands of years. In this report, we show that the hormone FGF21, which is strongly induced by ethanol in murine and human liver, exerts sobering or "amethystic" effects on both arousal and motor coordination without changing ethanol catabolism. Mice lacking FGF21 take longer than wild-type littermates to recover their righting reflex and balance following ethanol exposure. Conversely, pharmacologic FGF21 administration reduces the time needed for mice to recover from ethanol-induced unconsciousness and ataxia. FGF21 mediates it amethystic effects by directly activating the noradrenergic nervous system, which regulates arousal and alertness. These results indicate that this FGF21 liver-brain pathway evolved to protect against ethanol-induced intoxication and that it might be targeted pharmaceutically for treating acute alcohol poisoning.

                Cerebral blood flow is important for the maintenance of brain function and its dysregulation has been implicated in Alzheimers disease (AD). Subpopulations of microglia have well-characterised associations with the vasculature in the central nervous system but the precise relationship between microglia and cells which exist on the vasculature is not yet clear. In this study we explored the relationship between microglia and pericytes, a vessel-resident cell type that has a major role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow and maintenance of the blood brain barrier. Using fixed tissue sections and in vivo live imaging, we discovered a subset of microglia that closely associated with pericytes, termed PEricyte-associated Microglia (PEM). PEM are present throughout all regions of the brain and spinal cord in NG2DsRed x CX3CR1+/GFP mice, and in the human frontal cortex. They reside adjacent to pericytes at all levels of the capillary tree and can maintain their position for at least 28 days. PEM associate with pericytes lacking astroglial endfeet coverage but are segregated from pericytes by capillary basement membranes and capillary vessel width is similarly increased beneath pericytes with or without an associated PEM. Deletion of the microglia fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) did not disrupt the association between pericytes and PEM, suggesting the association is not reliant on fractalkine signalling. Finally, we found that the proportion of microglia that are capillary-associated and PEM declines in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in AD, which is exacerbated by the APOE E3/E4 genotype. In summary, we identify and characterise a subpopulation of microglia that specifically associate with pericytes and find this population is reduced in the SFG in AD. This reduction may be a novel mechanism contributing to vascular dysfunction in diseases such as AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">'High-Density-SleepCleaner': An open-source, semi-automatic artifact removal routine tailored to high-density sleep EEG</a></h4>

              
                Background: With up to 256 channels, high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) has become essential to the sleep research field. The vast amount of data resulting from this magnitude of channels in overnight EEG recordings complicates the removal of artifacts. New Method: We present a new, semi-automatic artifact removal routine specifically designed for sleep hd-EEG recordings. By employing a graphical user interface (GUI), the user assesses epochs in regard to four sleep quality markers (SQMs). Based on their topography and underlying EEG signal, the user eventually removes artifactual values. To identify artifacts, the user is required to have basic knowledge of the typical (patho-)physiological EEG they are interested in, as well as artifactual EEG. The final output consists of a binary matrix (channels x epochs). Channels affected by artifacts can be restored in afflicted epochs using epoch-wise interpolation, a function included in the online repository. Results: The routine was applied in 54 overnight sleep hd-EEG recordings. The proportion of bad epochs highly depends on the number of channels required to be artifact-free. Between 95% and 100% of bad epochs could be restored using epoch-wise interpolation. We furthermore present a detailed examination of two extreme cases (with few and many artifacts). For both nights, the topography and cyclic pattern of delta power look as expected after artifact removal. Comparison with Existing Methods: Numerous artifact removal methods exist, yet their scope of application usually targets short wake EEG recordings. The proposed routine provides a transparent, practical, and efficient approach to identify artifacts in overnight sleep hd-EEG recordings. Conclusions: This method reliably identifies artifacts simultaneously in all channels and epochs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-state aperiodic neural activity as a novel objective marker of daytime somnolence</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives: Current assessment of excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) requires subjective measurements such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and/or resource intensive sleep laboratory investigations. Recent work 1,2 has called for more nonperformance based measures of EDS. One promising nonperformance based measure of EDS is the aperiodic component of electroencephalography (EEG). Aperiodic (nonoscillatory) activity reflects excitation/inhibition ratios of neural populations and is altered in various states of consciousness, and thus may be a potential biomarker of hypersomnolence. Methods: We retrospectively analysed EEG data from patients who underwent a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and determined whether aperiodic neural activity is predictive of EDS. Participants having undergone laboratory polysomnogram and next day MSLT were grouped into MSLT+ (n = 26) and MSLT- (n = 33) groups (mean sleep latency of < 8min and > 10min, respectively) and compared against a non-clinical (Control) group of participants (n = 26). Results: While the MSLT+ and MSLT- groups did not differ in their aperiodic activity, the Control group had a significantly flatter slope and larger offset compared to both MSLT+ and MSLT- groups. Logistic regression machine learning predicted group status (i.e., symptomatic, non-symptomatic) with 90% accuracy based on the aperiodic slope while controlling for age. Slow oscillation spindle coupling was also significantly stronger in the Control group relative to MSLT+ and MSLT- groups. Conclusions: Our results provide first evidence that aperiodic neural dynamics and sleep-based cross frequency coupling is predictive of EDS, thereby providing a novel avenue for basic and applied research in the study of sleepiness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A key role of the hippocampal P3 in the attentional blink</a></h4>

              
                The attentional blink (AB) refers to an impaired identification of target stimuli (T2), which are presented shortly after a prior target (T1) within a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream. It has been suggested that the AB is related to a failed transfer of T2 into working memory and that hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal (EC) cortex are regions crucial for this transfer. Since the event-related P3 component has been linked to inhibitory processes, we hypothesized that the hippocampal P3 elicited by T1 may impact on T2 processing within HC and EC. To test this hypothesis, we reanalyzed microwire data from 21 patients, who performed an RSVP task, during intracranial recordings for epilepsy surgery assessment (Reber et al., 2017). We identified T1-related hippocampal P3 components in the local field potentials (LFPs) and determined the temporal onset of T2 processing in HC/EC based on single-unit response onset activity. In accordance with our hypothesis, T1-related single-trial P3 amplitudes at the onset of T2 processing were clearly larger for unseen compared to seen T2-stimuli. Moreover, increased T1-related single-trial P3 peak latencies were found for T2[unseen] versus T2[seen] trials in case of lags 1 to 3, which was in line with our predictions. In conclusion, our findings support inhibition models of the AB and indicate that the hippocampal P3 elicited by T1 plays a central role in the AB.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Taking shortcuts: Great for travel, but not for reproducible methods sections</a></h4>

              
                Methods sections are often missing critical details needed to reproduce an experiment. Methodological shortcut citations, in which authors cite previous papers instead of describing the method in detail, may contribute to this problem. This meta-research study used three approaches to systematically examine the use of shortcut citations in neuroscience, biology and psychiatry. First, we examined papers to determine why authors use citations in the methods section and to assess how often shortcut citations were used. Common reasons for using citations in the methods section included explaining how something was done by citing a previous resource that used the method (methodological shortcut citation), giving credit or specifying what was used (who or what citation), and providing context or a justification (why citation). Next, we reviewed 15 papers to determine what can happen when readers follow shortcut citations to find methodological details. While shortcut citations can be used effectively, problems encountered included difficulty identifying or accessing the cited materials, missing or insufficient descriptions of the cited method, and chains of shortcut citations. Third, we examined journal policies. Fewer than one quarter of journals had policies describing how authors should report methods that have been described previously or asking authors to explain modifications of previously described methods. We propose that methodological shortcut citations should meet three criteria; cited resources should describe a method very similar to the authors' method, provide enough detail to allow others to implement the method, and be open access. We outline actions that authors and journals can take to use shortcut citations responsibly, while fostering a culture of open and reproducible methods reporting.

	<p>The use of metaplasticity-based intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocols including several stimulation blocks could be a possible approach to increasing stimulation effectiveness. Our aim was to investigate the neurophysiological effects of two protocols with a short and a long interval between blocks. Seventeen healthy volunteers received four protocols in a pseudorandomized order: iTBS 0-15 (two blocks of active iTBS of primary motor cortex (M1) separated by 15 min and a control stimulation block of the vertex in 60 min from the first block); iTBS 0-60 (active iTBS, a control block in 15 min, and an active block in 60 min); iTBS 0 (active iTBS and two control blocks with the same intervals); and Control (three control blocks). The motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured before the first and after the second and third blocks. We have shown no significant differences between the effects of the protocols on both the motor cortex excitability and the responder rates. No significant changes of MEPs were observed after all the protocols. The reliability for the responsiveness to a single block between two sessions was insignificant. Our data confirm low reproducibility of the response to iTBS and suggest that the use of repeated protocols does not increase the responder rates or neurophysiological effects of iTBS.</p>

	<p>To estimate network structures to discover the interrelationships among variables and distinguish the difference between networks. Three hundred and forty-eight stroke patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. A network analysis was used to investigate the association between those variables. A Network Comparison Test was performed to compare the correlation of variables between networks. Three hundred and twenty-five connections were identified, and 22 of these differed significantly between the high- and low-Functional Independence Measurement (FIM) groups. In the high-FIM network structure, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and length of stay (LOS) had associations with other nodes. However, there was no association with BDNF and LOS in the low-FIM network. In addition, the use of amantadine was associated with shorter LOS and lower FIM motor subscores in the high-FIM network, but there was no such connection in the low-FIM network. Centrality indices revealed that amantadine use had high centrality with others in the high-FIM network but not the low-FIM network. Coronary artery disease (CAD) had high centrality in the low-FIM network structure but not the high-FIM network. Network analysis revealed a new correlation of variables associated with stroke recovery. This approach might be a promising method to facilitate the discovery of novel factors important for stroke recovery.</p>

	<p>Posterior circulation aneurysms have been regarded as the most challenging for endovascular coiling and microsurgical occlusion. The role of microsurgical treatment is gradually being overlooked and diminishing in the trend of endovascular treatment. As microsurgical occlusion of posterior circulation aneurysms is decreasing, we present our relevant experience to evaluate treatment options and surgical approaches. A retrospective study was conducted in the Department of Neurosurgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between 2016 and 2021. Patients with posterior circulation aneurysms treated by clipping, bypass, and trapping were enrolled and followed up for at least six months. We included 50 patients carrying 53 posterior circulation aneurysms, 43 of whom had aneurysm ruptures. The posterior cerebral artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery were the most common aneurysm locations. Direct clipping was performed in 43 patients, while bypass and trapping was performed in six patients. The retrosigmoid, far-lateral, and midline or paramedian suboccipital approaches were performed for those aneurysms in the middle and lower thirds. Aneurysms in the upper third required the lateral supraorbital approach, pterional approach, subtemporal approach, and occipital craniotomy. The lateral supraorbital approach was utilized in seven patients for aneurysms above the posterior clinoid process. Thirty-four patients recovered well with modified Rankin score 0&amp;amp;ndash;3 at discharge. No patient experienced aneurysm recurrence during the mean follow-up period of 3.57 years. Microsurgery clipping and bypass should be considered in conjunction with endovascular treatment as a treatment option in posterior circulation aneurysms. The lateral supraorbital approach is a feasible, safe, and simple surgical approach for aneurysms above the posterior clinoid process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Theta-Phase Connectivity between Medial Prefrontal and Posterior Areas Underlies Novel Instructions Implementation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Implementing novel instructions is a complex and uniquely human cognitive ability, which requires the rapid and flexible conversion of symbolic content into a format that enables the execution of the instructed behavior. Preparing to implement novel instructions, as opposed to their mere maintenance, involves the activation of the instructed motor plans, and the binding of the action information to the specific context in which this should be executed. Recent evidence and prominent computational models suggest that this efficient configuration of the system might involve a central role of frontal theta oscillations in establishing top-down long-range synchronization between distant and task-relevant brain areas. In the present EEG study (human subjects, 30 females, 4 males), we demonstrate that proactively preparing for the implementation of novels instructions, as opposed to their maintenance, involves a strengthened degree of connectivity in the theta frequency range between medial prefrontal and motor/visual areas. Moreover, we replicated previous results showing oscillatory features associated specifically with implementation demands, and extended on them demonstrating the role of theta oscillations in mediating the effect of task demands on behavioral performance. Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that the modulation of connectivity patterns between frontal and task-relevant posterior brain areas is a core factor in the emergence of a behavior-guiding format from novel instructions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Elevated TNF-{alpha} Leads to Neural Circuit Instability in the Absence of Interferon Regulatory Factor 8</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor necessary for the maturation of microglia, as well as other peripheral immune cells. It also regulates the transition of microglia and other immune cells to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. <I>Irf8</I> is also a known risk gene for multiple sclerosis and lupus, and it has recently been shown to be downregulated in schizophrenia. While most studies have focused on IRF8-dependent regulation of immune cell function, little is known about how it impacts neural circuits. Here, we show by RNAseq from <I>Irf8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> male and female mouse brains that several genes involved in regulation of neural activity are dysregulated. We then show that these molecular changes are reflected in heightened neural excitability and a profound increase in susceptibility to lethal seizures in male and female <I>Irf8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Finally, we identify that TNF-&alpha; is elevated specifically in microglia in the CNS, and genetic or acute pharmacological blockade of TNF-&alpha; in the <I>Irf8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> CNS rescued the seizure phenotype. These results provide important insights into the consequences of IRF8 signaling and TNF-&alpha; on neural circuits. Our data further suggest that neuronal function is impacted by loss of IRF8, a factor involved in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we identify a previously unknown and key role for interferon regulator factor 8 (IRF8) in regulating neural excitability and seizures. We further determine that these effects on neural circuits are through elevated TNF-&alpha; in the CNS. As IRF8 has most widely been studied in the context of regulating the development and inflammatory signaling in microglia and other immune cells, we have uncovered a novel function. Further, IRF8 is a risk gene for multiple sclerosis and lupus, IRF8 is dysregulated in schizophrenia, and elevated TNF-&alpha; has been identified in a multitude of neurologic conditions. Thus, elucidating these IRF8 and TNF-&alpha;-dependent effects on brain circuit function has profound implications for understanding underlying, therapeutically relevant mechanisms of disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurotensin Release from Dopamine Neurons Drives Long-Term Depression of Substantia Nigra Dopamine Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Midbrain dopamine neurons play central physiological roles in voluntary movement, reward learning, and motivated behavior. Inhibitory signaling at somatodendritic dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) synapses modulates excitability of dopamine neurons. The neuropeptide neurotensin is expressed by many inputs to the midbrain and induces LTD of D2R synaptic currents (LTD<SUB>DA</SUB>); however, the source of neurotensin that is responsible for LTD<SUB>DA</SUB> is not known. Here we show, in brain slices from male and female mice, that LTD<SUB>DA</SUB> is driven by neurotensin released by dopamine neurons themselves. Optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons was sufficient to induce LTD<SUB>DA</SUB> in the substantia nigra, but not the VTA, and was dependent on neurotensin receptor signaling, postsynaptic calcium, and vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the postsynaptic cell. These findings reveal a novel form of signaling between dopamine neurons involving release of the peptide neurotensin, which may act as a feedforward mechanism to increase dopamine neuron excitability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine neurons in the midbrain play a critical role in reward learning and the initiation of movement. Aberrant dopamine neuron function is implicated in a range of diseases and disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, obesity, and substance use disorders. D2 receptor-mediated PSCs are produced by a rare form of dendrodendritic synaptic transmission between dopamine neurons. These D2 receptor-mediated PSCs undergo LTD following application of the neuropeptide neurotensin. Here we show that release of neurotensin by dopamine neurons themselves is sufficient to induce LTD of dopamine transmission in the substantia nigra. Neurotensin signaling therefore mediates a second form of interdopamine neuron communication and may provide a mechanism by which dopamine neurons maintain excitability when nigral dopamine is elevated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The MAP3Ks DLK and LZK Direct Diverse Responses to Axon Damage in Zebrafish Peripheral Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks) dual leucine kinase (DLK) and leucine zipper kinase (LZK) are essential mediators of axon damage responses, but their responses are varied, complex, and incompletely understood. To characterize their functions in axon injury, we generated zebrafish mutants of each gene, labeled motor neurons (MNs) and touch-sensing neurons in live zebrafish, precisely cut their axons with a laser, and assessed the ability of mutant axons to regenerate in larvae, before sex is apparent in zebrafish. DLK and LZK were required redundantly and cell autonomously for axon regeneration in MNs but not in larval Rohon&ndash;Beard (RB) or adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. Surprisingly, in <I>dlk lzk</I> double mutants, the spared branches of wounded RB axons grew excessively, suggesting that these kinases inhibit regenerative sprouting in damaged axons. Uninjured trigeminal sensory axons also grew excessively in mutants when neighboring neurons were ablated, indicating that these MAP3Ks are general inhibitors of sensory axon growth. These results demonstrate that zebrafish DLK and LZK promote diverse injury responses, depending on the neuronal cell identity and type of axonal injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The MAP3Ks DLK and LZK are damage sensors that promote diverse outcomes to neuronal injury, including axon regeneration. Understanding their context-specific functions is a prerequisite to considering these kinases as therapeutic targets. To investigate DLK and LZK cell-type-specific functions, we created zebrafish mutants in each gene. Using mosaic cell labeling and precise laser injury we found that both proteins were required for axon regeneration in motor neurons but, unexpectedly, were not required for axon regeneration in Rohon&ndash;Beard or DRG sensory neurons and negatively regulated sprouting in the spared axons of touch-sensing neurons. These findings emphasize that animals have evolved distinct mechanisms to regulate injury site regeneration and collateral sprouting, and identify differential roles for DLK and LZK in these processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Induction of Activity-Dependent Plasticity at Auditory Nerve Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Exposure to nontraumatic noise <I>in vivo</I> drives long-lasting changes in auditory nerve synapses, which may influence hearing, but the induction mechanisms are not known. We mimicked activity in acute slices of the cochlear nucleus from mice of both sexes by treating them with high potassium, after which voltage-clamp recordings from bushy cells indicated that auditory nerve synapses had reduced EPSC amplitude, quantal size, and vesicle release probability (<I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>). The effects of high potassium were prevented by blockers of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and protein kinase A. Treatment with the NO donor, PAPA-NONOate, also decreased <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>, suggesting NO plays a central role in inducing synaptic changes. To identify the source of NO, we activated auditory nerve fibers specifically using optogenetics. Strobing for 2 h led to decreased EPSC amplitude and <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>, which was prevented by antagonists against ionotropic glutamate receptors and NO synthase. This suggests that the activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors in postsynaptic targets of auditory nerve fibers drives release of NO, which acts retrogradely to cause long-term changes in synaptic function in auditory nerve synapses. This may provide insight into preventing or treating disorders caused by noise exposure.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory nerve fibers undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic properties in response to noise exposure <I>in vivo</I>, which may contribute to changes in hearing. Here, we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying induction of synaptic changes using high potassium and optogenetic stimulation <I>in vitro</I> and identified important signaling pathways using pharmacology. Our results suggest that auditory nerve activity drives postsynaptic depolarization through AMPA and NMDA receptors, leading to the release of nitric oxide, which acts retrogradely to regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. These experiments revealed that auditory nerve synapses are unexpectedly sensitive to activity and can show dramatic, long-lasting changes in a few hours that could affect hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency-Specific Modulation of Slow-Wave Neural Oscillations via Weak Exogeneous Extracellular Fields Reveals a Resonance Pattern</a></h4>

              
                <p>Single neurons often exhibit endogenous oscillatory activity centered around a specific frequency band. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can generate a weak oscillating extracellular field in the brain that causes subthreshold membrane potential shifts that can affect spike timing at the single neuron level. Many studies have now shown that the endogenous oscillation can be entrained when the tACS frequency matches that of the exogenous extracellular field. However, the effect of tACS on the amplitude of the endogenous oscillation has been less well studied. We investigated this by using exogenous extracellular fields to modulate slow-wave neural oscillations in the ketamine anesthetized male Wistar rat. We applied spatially broad extracellular fields of different frequencies while recording spiking activity from single neurons. The effect of the exogenous extracellular field on the slow-wave neural oscillation amplitude (NOA) followed a resonance pattern: large modulations were observed when the extracellular frequency matched the endogenous frequency of the neuron, while extracellular fields with frequencies far away from the endogenous frequency had little effect. No changes in spike-rate were observed for any of the extracellular fields applied. Our results demonstrate that in addition to the previously reported entrainment and Arnold tongue patterns, weak oscillating extracellular fields modulate the amplitude of the endogenous neural oscillation without any changes in spike-rate, and that this modulation follows a frequency-specific resonance pattern.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural activity often oscillates around specific endogenous frequencies. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a neuromodulation method which biases spike-times and alter endogenous activity. Most tACS studies focus on entrainment effects which occur when tACS and endogenous neural frequencies are matched. In this study we varied the frequency of the applied tACS and investigated its effect on amplitude of the neural oscillation. Our results revealed a resonance pattern where tACS frequencies close to the endogenous frequency caused an increase in neural oscillation amplitude (NOA) specifically at the applied tACS frequency, while applying tACS frequencies farther away caused little or no change in NOA. Furthermore, applying tACS at differing frequencies caused the amplitude of the neural oscillation at the prestimulation endogenous frequency to decrease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Age-Induced Changes in {micro}-Opioid Receptor Signaling in the Midbrain Periaqueductal Gray of Male and Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opioids have decreased analgesic potency (but not efficacy) in aged rodents compared with adults; however, the neural mechanisms underlying this attenuated response are not yet known. The present study investigated the impact of advanced age and biological sex on opioid signaling in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in the presence of chronic inflammatory pain. Assays measuring &micro;-opioid receptor (MOR) radioligand binding, GTPS binding, receptor phosphorylation, cAMP inhibition, and regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein expression were performed on vlPAG tissue from adult (2&ndash;3 months) and aged (16&ndash;18 months) male and female rats. Persistent inflammatory pain was induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Adult males exhibited the highest MOR binding potential (BP) and highest G-protein activation (activation efficiency ratio) in comparison to aged males and females (adult and aged). No impact of advanced age or sex on MOR phosphorylation state was observed. DAMGO-induced cAMP inhibition was highest in the vlPAG of adult males compared with aged males and females (adult and aged). vlPAG levels of RGS4 and RGS9-2, critical for terminating G-protein signaling, were assessed using RNAscope. Adult rats (both males and females) exhibited lower levels of vlPAG RGS4 and RGS9-2 mRNA expression compared with aged males and females. The observed age-related reductions in vlPAG MOR BP, G-protein activation efficiency, and cAMP inhibition, along with the observed age-related increases in RGS4 and RGS9-2 vlPAG expression, provide potential mechanisms whereby the potency of opioids is decreased in the aged population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hypothalamic Control of Forelimb Motor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to perform skilled arm movements is central to everyday life, as limb impairments in common neurologic disorders such as stroke demonstrate. Skilled arm movements require adaptation of motor commands based on discrepancies between desired and actual movements, called sensory errors. Studies in humans show that this involves predictive and reactive movement adaptations to the errors, and also requires a general motivation to move. How these distinct aspects map onto defined neural signals remains unclear, because of a shortage of equivalent studies in experimental animal models that permit neural-level insights. Therefore, we adapted robotic technology used in human studies to mice, enabling insights into the neural underpinnings of motivational, reactive, and predictive aspects of motor adaptation. Here, we show that forelimb motor adaptation is regulated by neurons previously implicated in motivation and arousal, but not in forelimb motor control: the hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurons (HONs). By studying goal-oriented mouse-robot interactions in male mice, we found distinct HON signals occur during forelimb movements and motor adaptation. Temporally-delimited optosilencing of these movement-associated HON signals impaired sensory error-based motor adaptation. Unexpectedly, optosilencing affected neither task reward or execution rates, nor motor performance in tasks that did not require adaptation, indicating that the temporally-defined HON signals studied here were distinct from signals governing general task engagement or sensorimotor control. Collectively, these results reveal a hypothalamic neural substrate regulating forelimb motor adaptation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to perform skilled, adaptable movements is a fundamental part of daily life, and is impaired in common neurologic diseases such as stroke. Maintaining motor adaptation is thus of great interest, but the necessary brain components remain incompletely identified. We found that impaired motor adaptation results from disruption of cells not previously implicated in this pathology: hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurons (HONs). We show that temporally confined HON signals are associated with skilled movements. Without these newly-identified signals, a resistance to movement that is normally rapidly overcome leads to prolonged movement impairment. These results identify natural brain signals that enable rapid and effective motor adaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maturational Indices of the Cognitive Control Network Are Associated with Inhibitory Control in Early Childhood</a></h4>

              
                <p>Goal-directed behavior crucially relies on our capacity to suppress impulses and predominant behavioral responses. This ability, called inhibitory control, emerges in early childhood with marked improvements between 3 and 4 years. Here, we ask which brain structures are related to the emergence of this critical ability. Using a multimodal approach, we relate the pronounced behavioral improvements in different facets of 3- and 4-year-olds' (<I>N</I> = 37, 20 female) inhibitory control to structural indices of maturation in the developing brain assessed with MRI. Our results show that cortical and subcortical structure of core regions in the adult cognitive control network, including the PFC, thalamus, and the inferior parietal cortices, is associated with early inhibitory functioning in preschool children. Probabilistic tractography revealed an association of frontoparietal (i.e., the superior longitudinal fascicle) and thalamocortical connections with early inhibitory control. Notably, these associations to brain structure were distinct for different facets of early inhibitory control, often referred to as motivational ("hot") and cognitive ("cold") inhibitory control. Our findings thus reveal the structural brain networks and connectivity related to the emergence of this core faculty of human cognition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The capacity to suppress impulses and behavioral responses is crucial for goal-directed behavior. This ability, called inhibitory control, develops between the ages of 3 and 4 years. The factors behind this developmental milestone have been debated intensely for decades; however, the brain structure that underlies the emergence of inhibitory control in early childhood is largely unknown. Here, we relate the pronounced behavioral improvements in inhibitory control between 3 and 4 years with structural brain markers of gray matter and white matter maturation. Using a multimodal approach that combines analyses of cortical surface structure, subcortical structures, and white matter connectivity, our results reveal the structural brain networks and connectivity related to this core faculty of human cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chemogenetic Disconnection between the Orbitofrontal Cortex and the Rostromedial Caudate Nucleus Disrupts Motivational Control of Goal-Directed Action</a></h4>

              
                <p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and its major downstream target within the basal ganglia&mdash;the rostromedial caudate nucleus (rmCD)&mdash;are involved in reward-value processing and goal-directed behavior. However, a causal contribution of the pathway linking these two structures to goal-directed behavior has not been established. Using the chemogenetic technology of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs with a crossed inactivation design, we functionally and reversibly disrupted interactions between the OFC and rmCD in two male macaque monkeys. We injected an adeno-associated virus vector expressing an inhibitory designer receptor, hM4Di, into the OFC and contralateral rmCD, the expression of which was visualized <I>in vivo</I> by positron emission tomography and confirmed by postmortem immunohistochemistry. Functional disconnection of the OFC and rmCD resulted in a significant and reproducible loss of sensitivity to the cued reward value for goal-directed action. This decreased sensitivity was most prominent when monkeys had accumulated a certain amount of reward. These results provide causal evidence that the interaction between the OFC and the rmCD is needed for motivational control of action on the basis of the relative reward value and internal drive. This finding extends the current understanding of the physiological basis of psychiatric disorders in which goal-directed behavior is affected, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In daily life, we routinely adjust the speed and accuracy of our actions on the basis of the value of expected reward. Abnormalities in these kinds of motivational adjustments might be related to behaviors seen in psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the current study, we show that the connection from the orbitofrontal cortex to the rostromedial caudate nucleus is essential for motivational control of action in monkeys. This finding expands our knowledge about how the primate brain controls motivation and behavior and provides a particular insight into disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder in which altered connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the striatum has been implicated.</p>

                <p>As humans are social beings, human behavior and cognition are fundamentally shaped by information provided by peers, making human subjective value for rewards prone to be manipulated by perceived social information. Even subtle nonverbal social information, such as others' eye gazes, can influence value assignment, such as food value. In this study, we investigate the neural underpinnings of how gaze cues modify participants' food value (both genders) by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. During the gaze-cuing task, food items were repeatedly presented either while others looked at them or while they were ignored by others. We determined participants' food values by assessing their willingness to pay before and after a standard gaze-cuing training. Results revealed that participants were willing to pay significantly more for food items that were attended to by others compared with the unattended to food items. Neural data showed that differences in subjective values between the two conditions were accompanied by enhanced activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and caudate after food items were attended to. Furthermore, the functional connectivity between the caudate and the angular gyrus precisely predicted the individual differences in the preference shift. Our results unveil the key neural mechanism underlying the influence of social cues on the subjective value of food and highlight the crucial role of social context in shaping subjective value for food rewards in human.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We investigated how social information like others' gaze toward foods affects individuals' food value. We found that individuals more often choose food items that were looked at by another person compared with food items that were ignored. Using neuroimaging, we showed that this increased value for attended to food items was associated with higher brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and caudate. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the caudate and the angular gyrus was associated with individual differences in values for food items that were attended to by others versus being ignored. These findings provide novel insights into how the brain integrates social information into food value and could suggest possible interventions like using gaze cuing to promote healthier food choices.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Spatial Reach of Neuronal Coherence and Spike-Field Coupling across the Human Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal coherence is thought to be a fundamental mechanism of communication in the brain, where synchronized field potentials coordinate synaptic and spiking events to support plasticity and learning. Although the spread of field potentials has garnered great interest, little is known about the spatial reach of phase synchronization, or neuronal coherence. Functional connectivity between different brain regions is known to occur across long distances, but the locality of synchronization across the neocortex is understudied. Here we used simultaneous recordings from electrocorticography (ECoG) grids and high-density microelectrode arrays to estimate the spatial reach of neuronal coherence and spike-field coherence (SFC) across frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices during cognitive tasks in humans. We observed the strongest coherence within a 2&ndash;3 cm distance from the microelectrode arrays, potentially defining an effective range for local communication. This range was relatively consistent across brain regions, spectral frequencies, and cognitive tasks. The magnitude of coherence showed power law decay with increasing distance from the microelectrode arrays, where the highest coherence occurred between ECoG contacts, followed by coherence between ECoG and deep cortical local field potential (LFP), and then SFC (i.e., ECoG &gt; LFP &gt; SFC). The spectral frequency of coherence also affected its magnitude. Alpha coherence (8&ndash;14 Hz) was generally higher than other frequencies for signals nearest the microelectrode arrays, whereas delta coherence (1&ndash;3 Hz) was higher for signals that were farther away. Action potentials in all brain regions were most coherent with the phase of alpha oscillations, which suggests that alpha waves could play a larger, more spatially local role in spike timing than other frequencies. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the spatial and spectral dynamics of neuronal synchronization, further advancing knowledge about how activity propagates across the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coherence is theorized to facilitate information transfer across cerebral space by providing a convenient electrophysiological mechanism to modulate membrane potentials in spatiotemporally complex patterns. Our work uses a multiscale approach to evaluate the spatial reach of phase coherence and spike-field coherence during cognitive tasks in humans. Locally, coherence can reach up to 3 cm around a given area of neocortex. The spectral properties of coherence revealed that alpha phase-field and spike-field coherence were higher within ranges &lt;2 cm, whereas lower-frequency delta coherence was higher for contacts farther away. Spatiotemporally shared information (i.e., coherence) across neocortex seems to reach farther than field potentials alone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altered Cortical Trigeminal Fields Excitability by Spreading Depolarization Revealed with in Vivo Functional Ultrasound Imaging Combined with Electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spreading depolarization, usually termed cortical spreading depression has been proposed as the pathophysiological substrate of migraine aura and as an endogenous trigger of headache pain. The links between neurovascular coupling and cortical craniofacial nociceptive activities modulated by SD were assessed by combining <I>in vivo</I> local field potential (LFP) recordings in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with functional ultrasound imaging of S1 and caudal insular (INS) cortices of anesthetized male rats. A single SD wave triggered in the primary visual cortex elicited an ipsilateral, quadriphasic hemodynamic and electrophysiological response in S1 with an early phase consisting of concomitant increases of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and LFPs. A transient hypoperfusion was then correlated with the beginning of the neuronal silence, followed by a strong increase of rCBV, whereas synaptic activities remained inhibited.</p>
<p>LFPs and rCBV recovery period was followed by a progressive increase in S1 and INS baseline activities and facilitation of cortical responses evoked by periorbital cutaneous receptive field stimulation. Sensitization of cortical ophthalmic fields by SD was bilateral, occurred with precise spatiotemporal profiles, and was significantly reduced by pretreatment with an NMDA antagonist. Combined high-resolution assessing of neurovascular coupling and electrophysiological activities has revealed a useful preclinical tool for deciphering central sensitization mechanisms involved in migraine attacks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A crucial unsolved issue is whether visual aura and migraine headache are parallel or sequential processes. Here, we show that a single spreading depolarization wave triggered from the primary visual cortex is powerful enough to elicit progressive, sustained increases of hemodynamic and sensory responses to percutaneous periorbital noxious stimuli recorded in S1 and insular ophthalmic fields. Sensitization of cortical ophthalmic fields by SD was bilateral, occurred with precise spatiotemporal profiles, and was significantly reduced by pretreatment with an NMDA antagonist. Combined high-resolution assessing of neurovascular coupling and electrophysiological activities has revealed a useful preclinical tool for deciphering central sensitization mechanisms involved in migraine attacks.</p>

                Background: Digital gangrene is a rare but serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It occurs usually in middle-aged patients with longer disease duration. Case: Herein we report the case of a 56-year-old man (with no history suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon, diabetes mellitus, smoking, trauma, infection, or chemical exposure), who presented with SLE and digital gangrene was among the first signs. He presented with a one-month history of joint pain, hair loss, photosensitivity, mouth ulcers, malar rash, dyspnea, and digital pain. Physical examination revealed painful and diffuse erythematous skin lesions in the extremities and back, as well as cyanosis in the fingers. We noted lymphocytopenia (600 cells/mm3), and an elevated C-reactive protein (15.1 mg/l) on laboratory tests. Immunological tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with Title 1:400. Pulmonary computed tomography revealed pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary function tests revealed the restrictive pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of SLE with lung involvement was retained. The immunological assessment in search of elements in favor of a vascular origin of the patient's skin lesions was negative. Treatment was initiated with 200 mg/day hydroxychloroquine. For dermal and pulmonary involvement, intravenous (IV) pulse therapy was used with methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/d for three consecutive days monthly) and cyclophosphamide (1 g/month). Calcium blocking agents were also prescribed. However, the lesions did not improve. The patient was given two infusions of rituximab (1 g) at a 14-day interval with a marked improvement of the majority of vasculitis lesions, and a partial improvement of dyspnea. Conclusions: Digital gangrene is a rare complication of late-onset SLE, especially as a primary manifestation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sherlock: an open-source data platform to store, analyze and integrate Big Data for computational biologists [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In the era of Big Data, data collection underpins biological research more than ever before. In many cases, this can be as time-consuming as the analysis itself. It requires downloading multiple public databases with various data structures, and in general, spending days preparing the data before answering any biological questions. Here, we introduce Sherlock, an open-source, cloud-based big data platform (https://earlham-sherlock.github.io/) to solve this problem. Sherlock provides a gap-filling way for computational biologists to store, convert, query, share and generate biology data while ultimately streamlining bioinformatics data management. The Sherlock platform offers a simple interface to leverage big data technologies, such as Docker and PrestoDB. Sherlock is designed to enable users to analyze, process, query and extract information from extremely complex and large data sets. Furthermore, Sherlock can handle different structured data (interaction, localization, or genomic sequence) from several sources and convert them to a common optimized storage format, for example, the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC). This format facilitates Sherlock’s ability to quickly and efficiently execute distributed analytical queries on extremely large data files and share datasets between teams. The Sherlock platform is freely available on GitHub, and contains specific loader scripts for structured data sources of genomics, interaction and expression databases. With these loader scripts, users can easily and quickly create and work with specific file formats, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or ORC. For computational biology and large-scale bioinformatics projects, Sherlock provides an open-source platform empowering data management, analytics, integration and collaboration through modern big data technologies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Serum levels of α1-antitrypsin, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 in Iraqi COVID-19 patients: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: More than half of the individuals diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been found to have high levels of interleukin (IL)-6. A recent report showed that more elevated serum IL-6 level predicts COVID-19 disease severity and patients’ clinical outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the serum levels of α1-antitrypsin (AAT), IL-1β, and IL-6 between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. Methods: During the data collection phase, 90 individuals were enrolled, 45 healthy controls, and 45 patients confirmed with COVID-19 using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at a specialized isolation hospital in Baghdad between November 2021 and March 2022. In this cross-sectional research, venous blood samples were taken, and serum was isolated and stored for quantitative ELISA measurements of AAT, IL-1β, and IL-6 (ELISA). IBM SPSS version 24 was used to analyze the data. Results: This study revealed a significant increase in the serum levels of AAT, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the COVID-19 patients' group compared to the healthy control group with p-values < 0.001 for each of these markers. Conclusions: AAT concentrations were higher during COVID-19; this elevation is essential during infection. IL-1β and IL-6 levels were also elevated during the infection period; however, dysregulated high levels may lead to cytokine release syndrome. Therefore, these three biomarkers can be regarded as diagnostically crucial parameters.

                COVID-19 has been infecting every continent and Indonesia had suffered greatly as it ranked first for confirmed cases in Southeast Asia region with almost 100,000 deaths. We summarized Indonesian population demographic, socio-behavior, multiple government policy and public health interventions contributed to the high mortality. Although the virulence of COVID-19 strain was found to be similar as other countries, it might be inaccurate due to the low amount of sequenced genome and publicly accessible data of the virus’ strain. As Indonesia recorded higher testing number than WHO’s target, there were imbalances of testing capacity between capital cities and remote areas, hence the actual case number would be larger. The availability of healthcare facilities and skilled healthcare workers were also dispersed unequally, causing Indonesian health systems near collapsing. Moreover, individual sense of urgency and hazard of the pandemic were low, as shown by the low compliance of wearing masks and social distancing. Even though Indonesia was unprepared early in the pandemic, currently these systems are being improved. Indonesia has experienced an extensive problem in conquering the pandemic, hence, the country needed a comprehensive approach from the government, citizens, even private sectors to cease the pandemic.

                Background: Choledochal cysts are dilated portions of the biliary tract that account for 1% of all benign biliary diseases. It is prevalent among Asian and female populations and the incidence is 1:100,000–150,000. Among the different types, only 15–35% of all choledochal cysts are type IV cysts, with type I being the most common representing 50–80%. Clinical presentation and therapy of biliary cysts (BC) differ depending on the type. Case: We present a case of a 2-year-old male who presented with non-specific symptoms of multiple episodes of vomiting. Laboratory investigations revealed raised alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. His symptoms of acute pancreatitis were resolved with conventional therapy. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed intra and extra-hepatic cystic biliary tree dilatation suggestive of choledochal cyst Type IV A. Conclusions: Choledochal cysts present with clinical features varying with age and anatomical variants and can pose challenges in management that can be addressed by surgery to avoid further complications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chromatin accessibility of primary human cancers ties regional mutational processes and signatures with tissues of origin</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oliver Ocsenas, Jüri Reimand</p>

Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are associated with DNA replication timing (RT) and chromatin accessibility (CA), however these observations are based on normal tissues and cell lines while primary cancer epigenomes remain uncharacterised. Here we use machine learning to model megabase-scale mutation burden in 2,500 whole cancer genomes and 17 cancer types via a compendium of 900 CA and RT profiles covering primary cancers, normal tissues, and cell lines. CA profiles of primary cancers, rather than those of normal tissues, are most predictive of regional mutagenesis in most cancer types. Feature prioritisation shows that the epigenomes of matching cancer types and organ systems are often the strongest predictors of regional mutation burden, highlighting disease-specific associations of mutational processes. The genomic distributions of mutational signatures are also shaped by the epigenomes of matched cancer and tissue types, with SBS5/40, carcinogenic and unknown signatures most accurately predicted by our models. In contrast, fewer associations of RT and regional mutagenesis are found. Lastly, the models highlight genomic regions with overrepresented mutations that dramatically exceed epigenome-derived expectations and show a pan-cancer convergence to genes and pathways involved in development and oncogenesis, indicating the potential of this approach for coding and non-coding driver discovery. The association of regional mutational processes with the epigenomes of primary cancers suggests that the landscape of passenger mutations is predominantly shaped by the epigenomes of cancer cells after oncogenic transformation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A spatial vaccination strategy to reduce the risk of vaccine-resistant variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiyun Zhang, Gabriela Lobinska, Michal Feldman, Eddie Dekel, Martin A. Nowak, Yitzhak Pilpel, Yonatan Pauzner, Baruch Barzel, Ady Pauzner</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the process of global vaccination against a novel virus can be a prolonged one. Social distancing measures, that are initially adopted to control the pandemic, are gradually relaxed as vaccination progresses and population immunity increases. The result is a prolonged period of high disease prevalence combined with a fitness advantage for vaccine-resistant variants, which together lead to a considerably increased probability for vaccine escape. A spatial vaccination strategy is proposed that has the potential to dramatically reduce this risk. Rather than dispersing the vaccination effort evenly throughout a country, distinct geographic regions of the country are sequentially vaccinated, quickly bringing each to effective herd immunity. Regions with high vaccination rates will then have low infection rates and vice versa. Since people primarily interact within their own region, spatial vaccination reduces the number of encounters between infected individuals (the source of mutations) and vaccinated individuals (who facilitate the spread of vaccine-resistant strains). Thus, spatial vaccination may help mitigate the global risk of vaccine-resistant variants.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptive search space pruning in complex strategic problems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ofra Amir, Liron Tyomkin, Yuval Hart</p>

People have limited computational resources, yet they make complex strategic decisions over enormous spaces of possibilities. How do people efficiently search spaces with combinatorially branching paths? Here, we study players’ search strategies for a winning move in a “k-in-a-row” game. We find that players use scoring strategies to prune the search space and augment this pruning by a “shutter” heuristic that focuses the search on the paths emanating from their previous move. This strong pruning has its costs—both computational simulations and behavioral data indicate that the shutter size is correlated with players’ blindness to their opponent’s winning moves. However, simulations of the search while varying the shutter size, complexity levels, noise levels, branching factor, and computational limitations indicate that despite its costs, a narrow shutter strategy is the dominant strategy for most of the parameter space. Finally, we show that in the presence of computational limitations, the shutter heuristic enhances the performance of deep learning networks in these end-game scenarios. Together, our findings suggest a novel adaptive heuristic that benefits search in a vast space of possibilities of a strategic game.

                Background: Physical therapy (PT) services can be essential for recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Maintaining an efficient healthcare service is achieved by ensuring the safety of a well-informed healthcare practitioner. This study aimed to assess the sources of knowledge, attitude, experience, and accessibility to the personal protective equipment (PPE) of the physical therapists working in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to survey on-duty PT practitioners using a web-based questionnaire. Licensed PT practitioners were invited to participate, and a sample of 424 therapists responded. The questionnaire comprised of 22 questions covering the demographic data and the following domains: sources of knowledge regarding the pandemic, experience, and attitude of the therapists during the pandemic, and accessibility to the PPE. Results: Around 83% of the participants (352) completed all the survey questions. Governmental websites were the most used source of knowledge (39%). Hand sanitization was implemented by the majority of participants (81%). Participants, mainly males and experienced therapist, were willing to treat COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 complications of prolonged ventilation and immobilization were successfully treated by 91.2% of participants who treated positive cases. About a third of the participants were part of COVID-19 management planning teams or received training to deal with the pandemic. Most of the necessary PPE was adequately accessible during the pandemic. Conclusions: Therapists implemented the recommended hygienic practices and had no problems accessing the necessary PPE. More efforts should target therapists’ education about the social media misleading information and involving the therapists in the pandemic management planning teams.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A special class of neurons in the hippocampal formation broadly known as the spatial cells, whose subcategories include place cells, grid cells, and head direction cells, are considered to be the building blocks of the brain's map of the spatial world. We present a general, deep learning-based modeling framework that describes the emergence of the spatial-cell responses and can also explain responses that involve a combination of path integration and vision. The first layer of the model consists of head direction (HD) cells that code for the preferred direction of the agent. The second layer is the path integration (PI) layer with oscillatory neurons: displacement of the agent in a given direction modulates the frequency of these oscillators. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the PI-cell responses showed the emergence of cells with grid-like spatial periodicity. We show that the Bessel functions could describe the response of these cells. The output of the PI layer is used to train a stack of autoencoders. Neurons of both the layers exhibit responses resembling grid cells and place cells. The paper concludes by suggesting the wider applicability of the proposed modeling framework beyond the two simulated studies.</p>

<p>This study investigated differences in the anterior and posterior insula observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder.

Differing connectivity was observed with frontal, parietal, cingulate, occipital, cerebellar, and temporal brain regions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Based on our current understanding of insular regions, effects of chronic alcohol use on the insula may affect the integration of sensory-motor, socio-emotional, and cognitive function. There is no comprehensive understanding about these differences in individuals with alcohol use disorder that accounts for both structural and functional differences related to chronic alcohol use. The purpose of this study was to investigate these variations in both the anterior and posterior insula in persons with alcohol use disorder. We investigated insula gray matter volume, morphometry, white matter structural connectivity, and resting state functional connectivity in 75 participants with alcohol use disorder (females = 27) and 75 age-matched healthy control participants (females = 39). Results indicated structural differences mostly in the anterior regions, while functional connectivity differences were observed in both the anterior and posterior insula in those with alcohol use disorder. Differing connectivity was observed with frontal, parietal, occipital, cingulate, cerebellar, and temporal brain regions. While these results align with prior studies showing differences primarily in anterior insular regions, they also contribute to the existing literature suggesting differences in anterior insular connectivity with brain regions shown to be engaged during higher cognitive and emotional tasks.</p>

                Combined retrograde regenerating axon tracing and Smart-Seq2 single-cell sequencing approaches revealed multiple pro-regeneration genes downstream of Pten deletion. Two of these genes, Anxa2 and Mpp1, also presented striking neuroprotection and visual function preservation in a mouse glaucoma model. Additionally, we established the role of tPA-Anxa2-ILK axis in neural repair.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">A neutralizing epitope on the SD1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike targeted following infection and vaccination.</a></h4>

              
                Seow et al. identify a class of broadly neutralizing antibodies that bind a conserved epitope on the spike subdomain 1 (SD1) and that are elicited following infection and vaccination. The SD1 epitope is occluded on spike prefusion structures suggesting binding to a conformational state of spike.
