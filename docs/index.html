              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Translational control of polyamine metabolism by CNBP is required for Drosophila locomotor function</a></h4>

              
                Microsatellite expansions of CCTG repeats in the cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (<i>CNBP</i>) gene leads to accumulation of toxic RNA and have been associated with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2). However, it is still unclear whether the dystrophic phenotype is also linked to CNBP decrease, a conserved CCHC-type zinc finger RNA-binding protein that regulates translation and is required for mammalian development. Here, we show that depletion of <i>Drosophila</i> CNBP in muscles causes ageing-dependent locomotor defects that are correlated with impaired polyamine metabolism. We demonstrate that the levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and polyamines are significantly reduced upon dCNBP depletion. Of note, we show a reduction of the CNBP-polyamine axis in muscles from DM2 patients. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that dCNBP controls polyamine metabolism through binding dOdc mRNA and regulating its translation. Remarkably, the locomotor defect of dCNBP-deficient flies is rescued by either polyamine supplementation or dOdc1 overexpression. We suggest that this dCNBP function is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates with relevant implications for CNBP-related pathophysiological conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microbiome-pathogen interactions drive epidemiological dynamics of antibiotic resistance: a modelling study applied to nosocomial pathogen control</a></h4>

              
                The human microbiome can protect against colonization with pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), but its impacts on the spread of antibiotic resistance are poorly understood. We propose a mathematical modelling framework for ARB epidemiology formalizing within-host ARB-microbiome competition, and impacts of antibiotic consumption on microbiome function. Applied to the healthcare setting, we demonstrate a trade-off whereby antibiotics simultaneously clear bacterial pathogens and increase host susceptibility to their colonization, and compare this framework with a traditional strain-based approach. At the population level, microbiome interactions drive ARB incidence, but not resistance rates, reflecting distinct epidemiological relevance of different forces of competition. Simulating a range of public health interventions (contact precautions, antibiotic stewardship, microbiome recovery therapy) and pathogens (<i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) highlights how species-specific within-host ecological interactions drive intervention efficacy. We find limited impact of contact precautions for Enterobacteriaceae prevention, and a promising role for microbiome-targeted interventions to limit ARB spread.

                Reconstruction of the North Atlantic jet stream (NAJ) presents a critical, albeit largely unconstrained, paleoclimatic target. Models suggest northward migration and changing variance of the NAJ under 21st-century warming scenarios, but assessing the significance of such projections is hindered by a lack of long-term observations.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Both nucleus reuniens and the anterior thalamic nuclei are densely interconnected with medial cortical and hippocampal areas, connections that reflect their respective contributions to learning and memory. To better appreciate their comparative roles, pairs of different retrograde tracers were placed in these two thalamic sites in adult rats. Both thalamic sites receive modest cortical inputs from layer V that contrasted with much denser projections from layer VI. Despite frequent overlap in layer VI, ventral prefrontal and anterior cingulate inputs to nucleus reuniens were concentrated in the deepest sublayer (VIb). Meanwhile, inputs to the anterior thalamic nuclei originated more evenly from both sublayers VIa and VIb, with the result that they were often located more superficially than the projections to nucleus reuniens. Again, while the many hippocampal (subiculum) neurons projecting to nucleus reuniens and the anterior thalamic nuclei were partially intermingled within the deep cellular parts of the subiculum, cells projecting to nucleus reuniens consistently tended to lie even deeper (i.e., immediately adjacent to the alveus). Variable numbers of double-labeled cells were present in those cortical and subicular portions where the two cell populations intermingled, though they remained in a minority. Our data also show how projections to these two thalamic sites are organized in opposing dorsal/ventral and rostral/caudal gradients across both the cortex and hippocampal formation. While the anterior thalamic nuclei are preferentially innervated by dorsal cortical sites, more ventral frontal sites preferentially reach nucleus reuniens. These anatomic differences may underpin the complementary cognitive functions of these two thalamic areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Non-invasive health prediction from visually observable features [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The unprecedented development of Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised the healthcare industry. In the next generation of healthcare systems, self-diagnosis will be pivotal to personalised healthcare services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new screening and diagnostic approaches like mobile health are well-positioned to reduce disease spread and overcome geographical barriers. This paper presents a non-invasive screening approach to predict the health of a person from visually observable features using machine learning techniques. Images like face and skin surface of the patients are acquired using camera or mobile devices and analysed to derive clinical reasoning and prediction of the person’s health. Methods: In specific, a two-level classification approach is presented. The proposed hierarchical model chooses a class by training a binary classifier at the node of the hierarchy. Prediction is then made using a set of class-specific reduced feature set. Results: Testing accuracies of 86.87% and 76.84% are reported for the first and second-level classification. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields favourable prediction results while greatly reduces the computational time. Conclusions: The study suggests that it is possible to predict the health condition of a person based on his/her face appearance using cost-effective machine learning approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Thalamic influence on slow wave slope renormalization during sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Slow waves are thought to mediate an overall reduction in synaptic strength during sleep. The specific contribution of the thalamus to this so-called synaptic renormalization is unknown. Thalamic stroke is associated with daytime sleepiness, along with changes to sleep electroencephalography and cognition making it a unique “experiment of nature” to assess the relationship between sleep rhythms, synaptic renormalization, and daytime functions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sleep was studied by polysomnography and high-density electroencephalography over 17 nights in patients with thalamic (n = 12) and 15 nights in patients with extra-thalamic (n = 11) stroke. Sleep electroencephalography overnight slow wave slope changes, and their relationship with subjective daytime sleepiness, cognition, and other functional tests were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thalamic and extra-thalamic patients did not differ in terms of age, sleep duration or apnea-hypopnea index. Conversely, overnight slope changes were reduced in a large cluster of electrodes in thalamic compared to extra-thalamic stroke patients. This reduction was related to increased daytime sleepiness. No significant differences were found in other functional tests between the two groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with thalamic stroke a reduction in overnight slow wave slope change and increased daytime sleepiness was found. Sleep- and wake-centered mechanisms for this relationship are discussed. Overall, this study suggests a central role of the thalamus in synaptic renormalization.</p>

                Background: Smoking is one of the top three causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Natural antioxidants including black cumin (Nigella sativa) may inhibit the pathogenesis of initial process of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of black cumin (Nigella sativa) in preventing endothelial dysfunction mainly through macrophage M1/M2 inflammatory response in cigarette smoked male Wistars. Methods: In total, 50 Wistar rats were randomly allocated to five experimental groups: two control groups, namely no intervention (K-) and exposure to smoke of 40 cigarettes each day (K+); and three treatment groups: rats given a dose of 0.3 g (P1), 0.6 g (P2) or 1.2 g (P3) black cumin per kilograms bodyweight/ day, respectively, and exposed to smoke of 40 cigarettes each day. After 28 days of cigarette smoke exposure, macrophage M1/M2 ratio was evaluated by counting total M1 and M2 in ten microscope field of view. Data were analysed by Mann-Whitney test. Results: The M1 / ​​M2 ratio on K (-) was 0.9 7 ± 0.9 8 (<1) which means M2 was dominant, while the M1 / ​​M2 ratio on K (+) was of 4.97 ± 3.42 (> 1) which means M1 dominant. There was no significant difference in the number of M1 count in treatment groups P1, P2, P3 (p value = 0.996; 0.170; 0.884, respectively) when compared with K+. Additionally, P2 group has the lower M1 number with the highest significance value when compared to K+. The number of M1 counts on P1 did not differ significantly when compared to P2 with p = 0.121 and P3 with p = 0.936. Conclusions: In sum, ethanol extract of black cumin prevents endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting increase in macrophages M1 / M2 ratio in rats Wistar exposed to sub-chronic cigarette smoke.

                <p>The frequency of CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells was recently reported to be increased in several inflammatory conditions. We report that in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells display a distinct pro-inflammatory phenotype with pathogenic properties. Anti-CD20 treatment virtually extinguished CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells, which may be important for its broad effectiveness. Dimethylfumarat dampened the activity of differentiated CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells, while fingolimod reduced their abundance only as part of its overall T cell suppressive capacity. Of note, natalizumab treatment increased the frequency of CD20<sup>+</sup> effector T cells, highlighting that widely-used MS therapeutics affect this pro-inflammatory T cell subset with assumed pathogenic potential surprisingly differentially.</p>

                Background: Sea grapes or  Caulerpa racemosa have a lot of phytochemical content, especially unsaturated fatty acids that are beneficial for health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sea grapes extract on blood glucose levels, total cholesterol-, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1α in male Wistar rats, which were given per-oral (p.o.) cholesterol- and carbohydrates fat-enriched diets (CFED). Methods: Forty male Wistar albino rats weighing between 200 – 250 g were used for this study. Animals were randomly distributed into four groups of ten animals each. Group A served as control (received standard dry pellet diet). Rats in group B were fed on CFED for 4 weeks.  Groups C and D were fed on CFED and were administered 150 and 450 mg/kg of  sea grapes extract (p.o.), respectively. Results: Group C rats indicated a blood glucose reduction and an increase in PGC-1α serum, in comparison to group D (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between group C and D in blood cholesterol reduction (high dose of the extract did not have significant effects) (p=0.222), and both groups had the same effect in lowering total cholesterol in rats. Conclusion: Sea grapes extract is proven to improve blood glucose, total cholesterol, and PGC-1α levels in rats fed with CFED.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterization of the NiRAN domain from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase provides insights into a potential therapeutic target against SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Abhisek Dwivedy, Richard Mariadasse, Mohammed Ahmad, Sayan Chakraborty, Deepsikha Kar, Satish Tiwari, Sankar Bhattacharyya, Sudipta Sonar, Shailendra Mani, Prafullakumar Tailor, Tanmay Majumdar, Jeyaraman Jeyakanthan, Bichitra Kumar Biswal</p>

Apart from the canonical fingers, palm and thumb domains, the RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) from the viral order <i>Nidovirales</i> possess two additional domains. Of these, the function of the Nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyl transferase domain (NiRAN) remains unanswered. The elucidation of the 3D structure of RdRp from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), provided the first ever insights into the domain organisation and possible functional characteristics of the NiRAN domain. Using <i>in silico</i> tools, we predict that the NiRAN domain assumes a kinase or phosphotransferase like fold and binds nucleoside triphosphates at its proposed active site. Additionally, using molecular docking we have predicted the binding of three widely used kinase inhibitors and five well characterized anti-microbial compounds at the NiRAN domain active site along with their drug-likeliness. For the first time ever, using basic biochemical tools, this study shows the presence of a kinase like activity exhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Interestingly, a well-known kinase inhibitor- Sorafenib showed a significant inhibition and dampened viral load in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. In line with the current global COVID-19 pandemic urgency and the emergence of newer strains with significantly higher infectivity, this study provides a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug target and potential lead compounds for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2.

                <p>by Maryam Aliee, Matt J. Keeling, Kat S. Rock</p>

<i>Gambiense</i> human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT, sleeping sickness) is one of several neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) where there is evidence of asymptomatic human infection but there is uncertainty of the role it plays in transmission and maintenance. To explore possible consequences of asymptomatic infections, particularly in the context of elimination of transmission—a goal set to be achieved by 2030—we propose a novel dynamic transmission model to account for the asymptomatic population. This extends an established framework, basing infection progression on a number of experimental and observation gHAT studies. Asymptomatic gHAT infections include those in people with blood-dwelling trypanosomes, but no discernible symptoms, or those with parasites only detectable in skin. Given current protocols, asymptomatic infection with blood parasites may be diagnosed and treated, based on observable parasitaemia, in contrast to many other diseases for which treatment (and/or diagnosis) may be based on symptomatic infection. We construct a model in which exposed people can either progress to either asymptomatic skin-only parasite infection, which would not be diagnosed through active screening algorithms, or blood-parasite infection, which is likely to be diagnosed if tested. We add extra parameters to the baseline model including different self-cure, recovery, transmission and detection rates for skin-only or blood infections. Performing sensitivity analysis suggests all the new parameters introduced in the asymptomatic model can impact the infection dynamics substantially. Among them, the proportion of exposures resulting in initial skin or blood infection appears the most influential parameter. For some plausible parameterisations, an initial fall in infection prevalence due to interventions could subsequently stagnate even under continued screening due to the formation of a new, lower endemic equilibrium. Excluding this scenario, our results still highlight the possibility for asymptomatic infection to slow down progress towards elimination of transmission. Location-specific model fitting will be needed to determine if and where this could pose a threat.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stochastic model of lignocellulosic material saccharification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric Behle, Adélaïde Raguin</p>

The processing of agricultural wastes towards extraction of renewable resources is recently being considered as a promising alternative to conventional biofuel production. The degradation of agricultural residues is a complex chemical process that is currently time intensive and costly. Various pre-treatment methods are being investigated to determine the subsequent modification of the material and the main obstacles in increasing the enzymatic saccharification. In this study, we present a computational model that complements the experimental approaches. We decipher how the three-dimensional structure of the substrate impacts the saccharification dynamics. We model a cell wall microfibril composed of cellulose and surrounded by hemicellulose and lignin, with various relative abundances and arrangements. This substrate is subjected to digestion by different cocktails of well characterized enzymes. The saccharification dynamics is simulated <i>in silico</i> using a stochastic procedure based on a Gillespie algorithm. As we additionally implement a fitting procedure that optimizes the parameters of the simulation runs, we are able to reproduce experimental saccharification time courses for corn stover. Our model highlights the synergistic action of enzymes, and confirms the linear decrease of sugar conversion when either lignin content or crystallinity of the substrate increases. Importantly, we show that considering the crystallinity of cellulose in addition to the substrate composition is essential to interpret experimental saccharification data. Finally, our findings support the hypothesis of xylan being partially crystalline.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An assembly-free method of phylogeny reconstruction using short-read sequences from pooled samples without barcodes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas K. F. Wong, Teng Li, Louis Ranjard, Steven H. Wu, Jeet Sukumaran, Allen G. Rodrigo</p>

A current strategy for obtaining haplotype information from several individuals involves short-read sequencing of pooled amplicons, where fragments from each individual is identified by a unique DNA barcode. In this paper, we report a new method to recover the phylogeny of haplotypes from short-read sequences obtained using pooled amplicons from a mixture of individuals, without barcoding. The method, AFPhyloMix, accepts an alignment of the mixture of reads against a reference sequence, obtains the single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) patterns along the alignment, and constructs the phylogenetic tree according to the SNP patterns. AFPhyloMix adopts a Bayesian inference model to estimate the phylogeny of the haplotypes and their relative abundances, given that the number of haplotypes is known. In our simulations, AFPhyloMix achieved at least 80% accuracy at recovering the phylogenies and relative abundances of the constituent haplotypes, for mixtures with up to 15 haplotypes. AFPhyloMix also worked well on a real data set of kangaroo mitochondrial DNA sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A statistical model for describing and simulating microbial community profiles</a></h4>

Many methods have been developed for statistical analysis of microbial community profiles, but due to the complex nature of typical microbiome measurements (e.g. sparsity, zero-inflation, non-independence, and compositionality) and of the associated underlying biology, it is difficult to compare or evaluate such methods within a single systematic framework. To address this challenge, we developed SparseDOSSA (Sparse Data Observations for the Simulation of Synthetic Abundances): a statistical model of microbial ecological population structure, which can be used to parameterize real-world microbial community profiles and to simulate new, realistic profiles of known structure for methods evaluation. Specifically, SparseDOSSA’s model captures marginal microbial feature abundances as a zero-inflated log-normal distribution, with additional model components for absolute cell counts and the sequence read generation process, microbe-microbe, and microbe-environment interactions. Together, these allow fully known covariance structure between synthetic features (i.e. “taxa”) or between features and “phenotypes” to be simulated for method benchmarking. Here, we demonstrate SparseDOSSA’s performance for 1) accurately modeling human-associated microbial population profiles; 2) generating synthetic communities with controlled population and ecological structures; 3) spiking-in true positive synthetic associations to benchmark analysis methods; and 4) recapitulating an end-to-end mouse microbiome feeding experiment. Together, these represent the most common analysis types in assessment of real microbial community environmental and epidemiological statistics, thus demonstrating SparseDOSSA’s utility as a general-purpose aid for modeling communities and evaluating quantitative methods. An open-source implementation is available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/sparsedossa2.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multilevel selection favors fragmentation modes that maintain cooperative interactions in multispecies communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gil J. B. Henriques, Simon van Vliet, Michael Doebeli</p>

Reproduction is one of the requirements for evolution and a defining feature of life. Yet, across the tree of life, organisms reproduce in many different ways. Groups of cells (e.g., multicellular organisms, colonial microbes, or multispecies biofilms) divide by releasing propagules that can be single-celled or multicellular. What conditions determine the number and size of reproductive propagules? In multicellular organisms, existing theory suggests that single-cell propagules prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations (e.g., cheaters). However, groups of cells, such as biofilms, sometimes contain multiple metabolically interdependent species. This creates a reproductive dilemma: small daughter groups, which prevent the accumulation of cheaters, are also unlikely to contain the species diversity that is required for ecological success. Here, we developed an individual-based, multilevel selection model to investigate how such multi-species groups can resolve this dilemma. By tracking the dynamics of groups of cells that reproduce by fragmenting into smaller groups, we identified fragmentation modes that can maintain cooperative interactions. We systematically varied the fragmentation mode and calculated the maximum mutation rate that communities can withstand before being driven to extinction by the accumulation of cheaters. We find that for groups consisting of a single species, the optimal fragmentation mode consists of releasing single-cell propagules. For multi-species groups we find various optimal strategies. With migration between groups, single-cell propagules are favored. Without migration, larger propagules sizes are optimal; in this case, group-size dependent fissioning rates can prevent the accumulation of cheaters. Our work shows that multi-species groups can evolve reproductive strategies that allow them to maintain cooperative interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Wireless power transfer with transmit diversity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Wireless power transfer is important for energizing and recharging the Internet-of-Things (IoT) cordlessly. Harnessing energy effectively from radio waves has become a crucial task. It is known that diversities at the transmitting antenna and waves (i.e. simultaneous continuous waves with center frequencies separated apart) can enhance the radio frequency (RF) to direct current (DC) energy conversion. What remains unknown is the extent of which the wave diversity enhances the conversion gain. This study attempts to examine the RF-to-DC conversion gain of applying wave diversity. This paper investigates the effects of wave diversity on the energy conversion efficiency, and contributes the analytical expression that relate the conversion efficiency to the diversity count, i.e. the number of simultaneously transmitted sinewaves. Methods: We adopted a theoretical approach to the problem. First, we derived and presented a theoretical model that incorporated different forms of transmit diversity, i.e. antenna and wave diversities. This model then connected a RF-to-DC energy conversion model resulting from polynomial fitting on circuit simulation results. With the availability of these two models, we determined the theoretical energy conversion gain of simultaneously transmitting multiple sinewaves. Results: The results showed that transmitting multiple sinewaves simultaneously yields diversity gain and higher energy conversion efficiency. Most importantly, the gain and conversion efficiency can now be theoretically quantified. For example, at certain RF power measured at the receiver circuit, the diversity gain of transmitting four sinewaves is 2.6 (as compared to transmitting single sinewave). In fact, both the diversity gain and conversion efficiency increased with the number of simultaneously transmitted sinewaves. In another example, the conversion efficiency of transmitting four sinewaves is 0.1 as compared to 0.075 of two sinewaves. Conclusions: In summary, this paper presents a novel analytical expression for wave diversity in the context of wireless power transfer.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spatial memory impairments are observed in people with Huntington's disease (HD), however, the domain of spatial memory has received little focus when characterizing the cognitive phenotype of HD. Spatial memory is traditionally thought to be a hippocampal-dependent function, while the neuropathology of HD centers on the striatum. Alongside spatial memory deficits in HD, recent neurocognitive theories suggest that a larger brain network is involved, including the striatum. We examined the relationship between hippocampal and striatal volumes and spatial memory in 36 HD gene expansion carriers, including premanifest (<i>n</i> = 24) and early manifest HD (<i>n</i> = 12), and 32 matched healthy controls. We assessed spatial memory with Paired Associates Learning, Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and the Virtual House task, which assesses three components of spatial memory: navigation, object location, and plan drawing. Caudate nucleus, putamen, and hippocampal volumes were manually segmented on T1-weighted MR images. As expected, caudate nucleus and putamen volumes were significantly smaller in the HD group compared to controls, with manifest HD having more severe atrophy than the premanifest HD group. Hippocampal volumes did not differ significantly between HD and control groups. Nonetheless, on average, the HD group performed significantly worse than controls across all spatial memory tasks. The spatial memory components of object location and recall of figural and topographical drawings were associated with striatal and hippocampal volumes in the HD cohort. We provide a case to include spatial memory impairments in the cognitive phenotype of HD, and extend the neurocognitive picture of HD beyond its primary pathology within the striatum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Interaction between Preterm White Matter Injury and Childhood Thalamic Growth</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine how preterm white matter injury (WMI) and long-term thalamic growth interact to predict 8-year neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A prospective cohort of 114 children born at 24 to 32 weeksʼ gestational age (GA) underwent structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging early in life (median 32 weeks), at term-equivalent age and at 8 years. Manual segmentation of neonatal WMI was performed on T1-weighted images and thalamic volumes were obtained using the MAGeT brain segmentation pipeline. Cognitive, motor, and visual-motor outcomes were evaluated at 8 years of age. Multivariable regression was used to examine the relationship among neonatal WMI volume, school-age thalamic volume, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>School-age thalamic volumes were predicted by neonatal thalamic growth rate, GA, sex, and neonatal WMI volume (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). After accounting for total cerebral volume, WMI volume remained associated with school-age thalamic volume (β = −0.31, <i>p</i> = 0.005). In thalamocortical tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA) at term-equivalent age interacted with early WMI volume to predict school-age thalamic volumes (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). School-age thalamic volumes and neonatal WMI interacted to predict full-scale IQ (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and adverse motor scores among those with significant WMI (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Visual-motor scores were predicted by thalamic volumes (<i>p</i> = 0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In very preterm-born children, neonatal thalamic growth and WMI volume predict school-age thalamic volumes. The emergence at term of an interaction between FA and WMI to impact school-age thalamic volume indicates dysmaturation as a mechanism of thalamic growth failure. Cognition is predicted by the interaction of WMI and thalamic growth, highlighting the need to consider multiple dimensions of brain injury in these children. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Bruxism is a disease with a multifactorial etiology. Its clinical manifestations are most often an unaesthetic smile with abraded tooth surfaces, temporomandibular disorders and muscle hyperactivity. Here we present a case of bruxism where proper articulation of the occlusal splint was performed using the T-scan Novus system. A patient with bruxism underwent treatment with stabilization splint made by 3D printer technology. Intraoral scanning was performed using Trios Color (3Shape), and the digital design was achieved using the 3Shape Dental system design - splint studio. Formlabs Form 2 printer with biocompatible resin Dental LT Clear Resin was used for printing. The T-Scan Novus system with software attached to it, version 9.1, was used for digital examination of the occlusion. A 2.7 mm thick occlusal splint was developed, and the software adapted the occlusion with antagonists. After adjustment with T-Scan Novus, a reduction in disocclusion time of the patient was achieved, which is a desired result in the treatment of bruxism. The position of the joint components was proven radiologically. The treatment of bruxism with splint therapy continues to be the main method of treatment. Using digital technology allows for more accurate constructions and precise balancing of occlusal relationships.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In situ cryo-ET structure of phycobilisome–photosystem II supercomplex from red alga</a></h4>

              
                Phycobilisome (PBS) is the main light-harvesting antenna in cyanobacteria and red algae. How PBS transfers the light energy to photosystem II (PSII) remains to be elucidated. Here we report the in situ structure of the PBS–PSII supercomplex from <i>Porphyridium purpureum</i> UTEX 2757 using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging. Our work reveals the organized network of hemiellipsoidal PBS with PSII on the thylakoid membrane in the native cellular environment. In the PBS–PSII supercomplex, each PBS interacts with six PSII monomers, of which four directly bind to the PBS, and two bind indirectly. Additional three ‘connector’ proteins also contribute to the connections between PBS and PSIIs. Two PsbO subunits from adjacent PSII dimers bind with each other, which may promote stabilization of the PBS–PSII supercomplex. By analyzing the interaction interface between PBS and PSII, we reveal that α<sup>LCM</sup> and ApcD connect with CP43 of PSII monomer and that α<sup>LCM</sup> also interacts with CP47' of the neighboring PSII monomer, suggesting the multiple light energy delivery pathways. The in situ structures illustrate the coupling pattern of PBS and PSII and the arrangement of the PBS–PSII supercomplex on the thylakoid, providing the near-native 3D structural information of the various energy transfer from PBS to PSII.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RNA splicing programs define tissue compartments and cell types at single cell resolution</a></h4>

              
                The extent splicing is regulated at single-cell resolution has remained controversial due to both available data and methods to interpret it. We apply the SpliZ, a new statistical approach, to detect cell-type-specific splicing in &gt;110K cells from 12 human tissues. Using 10x data for discovery, 9.1% of genes with computable SpliZ scores are cell-type-specifically spliced, including ubiquitously expressed genes <i>MYL6</i> and <i>RPS24</i>. These results are validated with RNA FISH, single-cell PCR, and Smart-seq2. SpliZ analysis reveals 170 genes with regulated splicing during human spermatogenesis, including examples conserved in mouse and mouse lemur. The SpliZ allows model-based identification of subpopulations indistinguishable based on gene expression, illustrated by subpopulation-specific splicing of classical monocytes involving an ultraconserved exon in <i>SAT1</i>. Together, this analysis of differential splicing across multiple organs establishes that splicing is regulated cell-type-specifically.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Addressing shortfalls of laboratory HbA1c using a model that incorporates red cell lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> does not always predict diabetes complications and our aim was to establish a glycaemic measure that better reflects intracellular glucose exposure in organs susceptible to complications. Six months of continuous glucose monitoring data and concurrent laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> were evaluated from 51 type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 80 type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Red blood cell (RBC) lifespan was estimated using a kinetic model of glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, allowing the calculation of person-specific adjusted HbA<sub>1c</sub> (aHbA<sub>1c</sub>). Median (IQR) RBC lifespan was 100 (86–102) and 100 (83–101) days in T1D and T2D, respectively. The median (IQR) absolute difference between aHbA<sub>1c</sub> and laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 3.9 (3.0–14.3) mmol/mol [0.4 (0.3–1.3%)] in T1D and 5.3 (4.1–22.5) mmol/mol [0.5 (0.4–2.0%)] in T2D. aHbA<sub>1c</sub> and laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> showed clinically relevant differences. This suggests that the widely used measurement of HbA<sub>1c</sub> can underestimate or overestimate diabetes complication risks, which may have future clinical implications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comparison of transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II across eukaryotic species</a></h4>

              
                The preinitation complex (PIC) for transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II is composed of general transcription factors that are highly conserved. However, analysis of ChIP-seq datasets reveals kinetic and compositional differences in the transcriptional initiation process among eukaryotic species. In yeast, Mediator associates strongly with activator proteins bound to enhancers, but it transiently associates with promoters in a form that lacks the kinase module. In contrast, in human, mouse, and fly cells, Mediator with its kinase module stably associates with promoters, but not with activator-binding sites. This suggests that yeast and metazoans differ in the nature of the dynamic bridge of Mediator between activators and Pol II and the composition of a stable inactive PIC-like entity. As in yeast, occupancies of TBP and associated factors (Tafs) at mammalian promoters are not strictly correlated. This suggests that within PICs, TFIID is not a monolithic entity, and multiple forms of TBP affect initiation at different classes of genes. TFIID in flies, but not yeast and mammals, interacts strongly at regions downstream of the initiation site, consistent with the importance of downstream promoter elements in that species. Lastly, Taf7 and the mammalian-specific Med26 subunit of Mediator also interact near the Pol II pause region downstream of the PIC, but only in subsets of genes and often not together. Species-specific differences in PIC structure and function are likely to affect how activators and repressors affect transcriptional activity.

                Astrocytes are key regulators of brain homeostasis, which is essential for proper cognitive function. The role of cytoskeletal dynamics in this critical regulatory process is unknown. Here we find that actin is dynamic in certain subcellular regions, especially near the cell boundary. Our results further indicate that actin dynamics concentrates into hotspot regions that selectively respond to certain chemophysical stimuli, specifically the homeostatic challenges of ion or water concentration increases. Substrate topography makes actin dynamics more frequent yet weaker, and it also alters actin network structure. Superresolution images analyzed with a filament extraction algorithm demonstrate that surface topography is associated with a predominant perpendicular alignment of actin filaments near the cell boundary whereas flat substrates result in an actin cortex mainly parallel to the cell boundary. Thus, actin structure and dynamics together integrate information from different aspects of the environment that might steer the operation of neural cell networks.

	<p>Nocardia brain abscess is relatively rare, accounting for about 1–2% of all brain abscesses, and its mortality rate is three times higher than of other types of bacterial brain abscesses; thus, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Nocardia brain abscess generally occurs in immunodeficient patients. We report a case of Nocardia farcinica brain abscess in a multiple myeloma patient treated with proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib and ixazomib), cyclophosphamide, and corticosteroid. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, together with drainage of the brain abscess. Regular brain MRI follow-ups showed that intracranial lesions were gradually absorbed and improved.</p>

	<p>The ability to rapidly process others’ emotional signals is crucial for adaptive social interactions. However, to date it is still unclear how observing emotional facial expressions affects the reactivity of the human motor cortex. To provide insights on this issue, we employed single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate corticospinal motor excitability. Healthy participants observed happy, fearful and neutral pictures of facial expressions while receiving TMS over the left or right motor cortex at 150 and 300 ms after picture onset. In the early phase (150 ms), we observed an enhancement of corticospinal excitability for the observation of happy and fearful emotional faces compared to neutral expressions specifically in the right hemisphere. Interindividual differences in the disposition to experience aversive feelings (personal distress) in interpersonal emotional contexts predicted the early increase in corticospinal excitability for emotional faces. No differences in corticospinal excitability were observed at the later time (300 ms) or in the left M1. These findings support the notion that emotion perception primes the body for action and highlights the role of the right hemisphere in implementing a rapid and transient facilitatory response to emotional arousing stimuli, such as emotional facial expressions.</p>

	<p>Object sounds can enhance the attentional selection and perceptual processing of semantically-related visual stimuli. However, it is currently unknown whether crossmodal semantic congruence also affects the post-perceptual stages of information processing, such as short-term memory (STM), and whether this effect is modulated by the object consistency with the background visual scene. In two experiments, participants viewed everyday visual scenes for 500 ms while listening to an object sound, which could either be semantically related to the object that served as the STM target at retrieval or not. This defined crossmodal semantically cued vs. uncued targets. The target was either in- or out-of-context with respect to the background visual scene. After a maintenance period of 2000 ms, the target was presented in isolation against a neutral background, in either the same or different spatial position as in the original scene. The participants judged the same vs. different position of the object and then provided a confidence judgment concerning the certainty of their response. The results revealed greater accuracy when judging the spatial position of targets paired with a semantically congruent object sound at encoding. This crossmodal facilitatory effect was modulated by whether the target object was in- or out-of-context with respect to the background scene, with out-of-context targets reducing the facilitatory effect of object sounds. Overall, these findings suggest that the presence of the object sound at encoding facilitated the selection and processing of the semantically related visual stimuli, but this effect depends on the semantic configuration of the visual scene.</p>

	<p>Educational systems around the world encourage students to engage in programming activities, but programming learning is one of the most challenging learning tasks. Thus, it was significant to explore the factors related to programming learning. This study aimed to identify computer programming e-learners’ personality traits, self-reported cognitive abilities and learning motivating factors in comparison with other e-learners. We applied a learning motivating factors questionnaire, the Big Five Inventory—2, and the SRMCA instruments. The sample consisted of 444 e-learners, including 189 computer programming e-learners, the mean age was 25.19 years. It was found that computer programming e-learners demonstrated significantly lower scores of extraversion, and significantly lower scores of motivating factors of individual attitude and expectation, reward and recognition, and punishment. No significant differences were found in the scores of self-reported cognitive abilities between the groups. In the group of computer programming e-learners, extraversion was a significant predictor of individual attitude and expectation; conscientiousness and extraversion were significant predictors of challenging goals; extraversion and agreeableness were significant predictors of clear direction; open-mindedness was a significant predictor of a diminished motivating factor of punishment; negative emotionality was a significant predictor of social pressure and competition; comprehension-knowledge was a significant predictor of individual attitude and expectation; fluid reasoning and comprehension-knowledge were significant predictors of challenging goals; comprehension-knowledge was a significant predictor of clear direction; and visual processing was a significant predictor of social pressure and competition. The SEM analysis demonstrated that personality traits (namely, extraversion, conscientiousness, and reverted negative emotionality) statistically significantly predict learning motivating factors (namely, individual attitude and expectation, and clear direction), but the impact of self-reported cognitive abilities in the model was negligible in both groups of participants and non-participants of e-learning based computer programming courses; χ² (34) = 51.992, p = 0.025; CFI = 0.982; TLI = 0.970; NFI = 0.950; RMSEA = 0.051 [0.019–0.078]; SRMR = 0.038. However, as this study applied self-reported measures, we strongly suggest applying neurocognitive methods in future research.</p>

     alt="Comparing axon regeneration in male and female mice after peripheral nerve injury"/>
<p>In the mammalian peripheral nervous system, axon regeneration occurs spontaneously after injury. This study examined if axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury was sex dependent and found that the extent of axon regeneration was indistinguishable in male and female mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that many genes associated with neurite outgrowth were commonly induced in the two sexes, despite that a majority of genes were sex-dependently induced by injury. Therefore, although male and female mice exhibit similar axon regeneration, the mechanisms involved might not be identical.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate after injury. By contrast, spontaneous axon regeneration occurs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) due to a supportive PNS environment and an increase in the intrinsic growth potential induced by injury via cooperative activation of multifaceted biological pathways. This study compared axon regeneration and injury responses in C57BL/6 male and female mice after sciatic nerve crush (SNC) injury. The extent of axon regeneration <i>in vivo</i> was indistinguishable in male and female mice when observed at 3 days after SNC injury, and primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from injured, male and female mice extended axons to a similar length. Moreover, the induction of selected regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), such as <i>Atf3</i>, <i>Sprr1a</i>, <i>Gap43</i>, <i>Sox11</i>, <i>Jun</i>, <i>Gadd45a</i>, and <i>Smad1</i> were comparable in male and female DRGs when assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the RNA-seq analysis of male and female DRGs revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SNC groups compared to sham-operated groups included many common genes associated with neurite outgrowth. However, we also found that a large number of genes in the DEGs were sex dependent, implicating the involvement of distinct gene regulatory network in the two sexes following peripheral nerve injury. In conclusion, we found that male and female mice mounted a comparable axon regeneration response and many RAGs were commonly induced in response to SNC. However, given that many DEGs were sex-dependently expressed, future studies are needed to investigate whether they contribute to peripheral axon regeneration, and if so, to what extent.</p>

     alt="Neuroimmunological complications arising from chemotherapy-induced gut toxicity and opioid exposure in female dark agouti rats"/>
<p>5-Fluorouracil-induced gut toxicity resulted in a main neuroimmunological effect in the thoracic region with carprofen ameliorating this effect. Buprenorphine and tramadol increased astrocyte reactivity marker expression, yet decreased thoracic IL-1beta expression. Understanding the peripheral-to-central complications arising in chemotherapy-induced toxicities and analgesic treatments may elucidate potential mechanisms contributing to the central complications arising from chemotherapy.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cancer patients may experience symptom clusters, including chemotherapy-induced (CI) gut toxicity (CIGT) and cognitive impairment. Analgesic selection for pain associated with CIGT is difficult as opioids induce glial reactivity and unwanted side effects. This study quantified central glial reactivity and proinflammatory effects in rats with CIGT using three mechanistically different analgesics. Regional adaptations were indicative of immune-to-brain signaling routes. Utilizing a 5-fluorouracil-induced GT (5IGT) rat model and analgesic intervention (carprofen (CAR), buprenorphine (BUP), and tramadol (TRAM)), spinal and brain neuroimmune modulation was examined via microglial, astrocyte, and proinflammatory (cluster of differentiation molecule 11b; CD11b, glial fibrillary associated protein; GFAP, and interleukin-1 beta; IL1β) reactivity marker expression changes by western blot analysis. 5IGT significantly increased thoracic GFAP (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and IL-1β (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) expression, CAR and BUP ameliorated these effects. BUP and TRAM with 5-FU synergistically increased hippocampal GFAP expression. CAR administered with 5IGT significantly elevated hippocampal and thoracic CD11b expression levels (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The neuroimmune responses observed in this study suggest activation of peripheral-to-central immune signaling pathways. We speculate that the opioid-induced hippocampal changes inferred a humorally mediated mechanism, whereas thoracic neuroimmune modifications indicated activation of an indirect neural route. Although TRAM ameliorated 5IGT-intestinal inflammation, this opioid presents complications relating to bodyweight and regional glial dysregulation (neuroinflammation) and may not be optimal in the management of pain associated with 5IGT. The chemotherapy-induced gut-derived neuroimmune consequences observed suggest a potential mechanistic contribution to central components of the cancer symptom cluster experience, while the opioid-related glial changes have implications for optimal pain management in this setting warranting further investigation.</p>

<p>Mice were subjected to the acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference, and fecal samples were collected at each phase.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The gut–brain axis provides a pathway for the interaction between gut microbiota and methamphetamine (METH) addiction. However, the gut microbial signatures during different phases of METH use remain unclear. In the present study, we established models of acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male mice and detected the gut microbiome profiles of the fecal samples at the three phases by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results revealed that the richness of the gut microbiome increased following repeated METH administration, and it decreased after 4 weeks of abstinence. The microbial richness remained at a low level after one METH challenge at the reinstatement phase. The abundance of several genera including <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> differentially altered among phases of METH-induced CPP. The co-occurrence networks of the gut microbiome became weaker and more unstable during the development of METH-induced CPP at the extinction and reinstatement phases. Notably, the predicted gene functions of short-chain fatty acid metabolism, which were correlated with the abundance of <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, were found differentially enriched among phases of METH-induced CPP. Our findings highlight a potential association between perturbations of the gut microbiome and different phases of METH use.</p>

<p>The differential effects of osteopontin on major functions of primary resting and activated astrocytes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The glycoprotein osteopontin is highly upregulated in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as ischemic stroke. Osteopontin regulates cell growth, cell adhesion, homeostasis, migration, and survival of various cell types. Accordingly, osteopontin is considered an essential regulator of regeneration and repair in the ischemic milieu. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the CNS and play significant roles in health and disease. Astrocytes are involved in homeostasis, promote neuroprotection, and regulate synaptic plasticity. Upon activation, astrocytes may adopt different phenotypes, termed A1 and A2. The direct effects of osteopontin on astrocytes, especially in distinct activation states, are yet unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate the impact of osteopontin on resting and active astrocytes. We established an inflammatory <i>in vitro</i> model of activated (A1) primary astrocytes derived from neonatal wistar rats by exposure to a distinct combination of proinflammatory cytokines. To model ischemic stroke <i>in vitro</i>, astrocytes were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence or absence of osteopontin. Osteopontin modulated the activation phenotype by attenuating A1- and restoring A2-marker expression without compromising the active astrocytes’ immunocompetence. Osteopontin promoted the proliferation of active and the migration of resting astrocytes. Following transient OGD, osteopontin mitigated the delayed ongoing death of primary astrocytes, promoting their survival. Data suggest that osteopontin differentially regulates essential functions of resting and active astrocytes and confirm a significant regulatory role of osteopontin in an <i>in vitro</i> ischemia model. Furthermore, the data suggest that osteopontin constitutes a promising target for experimental therapies modulating neuroregeneration and repair.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) has been shown to improve vestibular function potentially via stochastic resonance, however, it remains unknown how central vestibular nuclei process these signals. <i>In vivo</i> work applying electrical stimuli to the vestibular apparatus of animals has shown changes in neuronal discharge at the level of the primary vestibular afferents and hair cells. This study aimed to determine the cellular impacts of stochastic, sinusoidal, and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli on individual medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons of male and female C57BL/6 mice. All stimuli increased the irregularity of MVN neuronal discharge, while differentially affecting neuronal gain. This suggests that the heterogeneous MVN neuronal population (marked by differential expression of ion channels), may influence the impact of electrical stimuli on neuronal discharge. Neuronal subtypes showed increased variability of neuronal firing, where Type A and B neurons experienced the largest gain changes in response to stochastic and sinusoidal stimuli. Type C neurons were the least affected regarding neuronal firing variability and gain changes. The membrane potential (MP) of neurons was altered by sinusoidal and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli, with Type B and C neuronal MP significantly affected. These results indicate that GVS-like electrical stimuli impact MVN neuronal discharge differentially, likely as a result of heterogeneous ion channel expression.</p>

<p>The use of transgenic TRAP*TB mice permitted visualization of neurons active during a first stage experimental condition (red) as well as neurons active during a second stage condition (green).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain undergoes rapid, dramatic, and reversible transitioning between states of wakefulness and unconsciousness during natural sleep and in pathological conditions such as hypoxia, hypotension, and concussion. Transitioning can also be induced pharmacologically using general anesthetic agents. The effect is selective. Mobility, sensory perception, memory formation, and awareness are lost while numerous housekeeping functions persist. How is selective transitioning accomplished? Classically a handful of brainstem and diencephalic “arousal nuclei” have been implicated in driving brain-state transitions on the grounds that their net activity systematically varies with brain state. Here we used transgenic targeted recombination in active populations mice</p>

<p>Overexpression of WT α-syn and the mutant α-syn A30P promotes the increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in mitochondria and the reduction in contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, disrupting the IP3R-GRP75 interaction. Disruption of mitochondria-associated ER membranes causes a reduction in calcium transfer from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are formed by close and specific components in the contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which participate in several cell functions, including lipid metabolism, autophagy, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Particularly, the presence of α-synuclein (α-syn) in MAMs was previously demonstrated, indicating a physical interaction among some proteins in this region and a potential involvement in cell dysfunctions. MAMs alterations are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and contribute to the pathogenesis features. Here, we investigated the effects of α-syn on MAMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to mitochondria in WT- and A30P α-syn-overexpressing SH-SY5Y or HEK293 cells. We observed that α-syn potentiates the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ<sub>m</sub>) loss induced by rotenone, increases mitophagy and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload. Additionally, in α-syn-overexpressing cells, we found a reduction in ER–mitochondria contact sites through the impairment of the GRP75–IP3R interaction, however, with no alteration in VDAC1–GRP75 interaction. Consequently, after Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, α-syn-overexpressing cells demonstrated a reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering by mitochondria, suggesting a deregulation in MAM activity. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of the α-syn/MAMs/Ca<sup>2+</sup> axis that potentially affects cell functions in PD.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairments are characteristics of patients with white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and hypoperfusion is currently a relatively recognized mechanism of WMHs. Brain activity is closely coupled to the regulation of local blood flow. This study aimed to investigate the abnormal local brain activity of patients with WMHs from the viewpoint of the static amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (sALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF). Seventy-four patients with WMHs and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Based on the Fazekas scale, patients with WMHs were further divided into a mild WMH group (<i>n</i> = 33, Fazekas score 1–2) and moderate-severe WMH group (<i>n</i> = 41, Fazekas score 3–6). The sALFF and dALFF values were calculated separately and neuropsychological tests including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Trail Making Test (TMT), and Boston Naming Test (BNT) were completed by all participants. Patients with WMHs showed increased sALFF and dALFF values in the bilateral thalamus and decreased performance in the MoCA test, AVLT-immediate, AVLT-delay, AVLT-recognition, TMT-A, and BNT. The dALFF values in the bilateral thalamus was correlated with the MoCA in HCs. The sALFF values in the bilateral thalamus correlated with TMT-B in patients with WMHs. Patients with WMHs showed abnormal brain activity and decreased functional stability of the bilateral thalamus, which may be a potential mechanism of decreased executive function.</p>

                Mitochondrial defects are tightly linked to axon degeneration, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In C. elegans, PVQ axons that lack mitochondria degenerate spontaneously with age. Using an unbiased genetic screen, we found that cell-specific activation of CaMKII/UNC-43 suppresses axon degeneration due to loss of mitochondria. Unexpectedly, CaMKII/UNC-43 protects against degeneration through the conserved Sarm1/TIR-1-ASK1/NSY-1 MAPK pathway. In addition, we show that disrupting a trafficking complex composed of calsyntenin/CASY-1, Mint/LIN-10, and kinesin suppresses axon degeneration. Further analysis indicates that disruption of this trafficking complex activates the CaMKII-Sarm1-MAPK pathway through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Our findings identify CaMKII as a pivot point between mitochondrial defects and axon degeneration, describe how it is regulated in this context, and uncover a surprising neuroprotective role for the Sarm1-ASK1 pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-encoding modulation of spatial memory by a GABAA-agonist</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the role of the post-encoding period for consolidation of self-centered (egocentric) and world-centered (allocentric) spatial memory in neurologically normal human subjects. We used the GABAA-ergic anesthetic propofol to transiently modulate neural activity during the early stage of spatial memory consolidation. A total of 52 patients undergoing minor surgery learned to navigate to a target in a five-armed maze derived from animal experiments immediately prior to injection of propofol (early group) or more than 60 minutes before injection (late group). Two hundred and forty minutes after anesthesia, subjects were tested for memory-guided navigation. Our results show a selective impairment of memory-guided navigation in the early group and near-normal performance in the late group. Both egocentric and allocentric navigation were affected, albeit with distinct error patterns. In the egocentric condition, early group patients navigated significantly more often to a wrong alley of the maze but showed normal navigation times, thus suggesting a deficit mainly for memory of sequences of path segments. By contrast, in the allocentric condition, early group patients mostly navigated to the correct alley of the maze but showed a significant increase in detours and prolonged navigation times, thus suggesting a weakened representation of the relationship between landmarks. We conclude that presumably hippocampus-dependent networks contribute to early consolidation of representations underlying both egocentric and allocentric memory-guided navigation. Distinct aspects of these representations are susceptible to GABAA-ergic modulation within a post-encoding time-window of less than 60 minutes, indicating a redistribution and reconfiguration of spatial memory networks early during consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Drosophila TMEM184B ortholog Tmep ensures proper locomotion by restraining ectopic firing at the neuromuscular junction</a></h4>

              
                TMEM184B is a putative seven-pass membrane protein that promotes axon degeneration after injury. TMEM184B mutation causes aberrant neuromuscular architecture and sensory and motor behavioral defects in mice. The mechanism through which TMEM184B causes neuromuscular defects is unknown. We employed Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the function of the TMEM184B ortholog, Tmep (CG12004) at the neuromuscular junction. We show that Tmep is required for full adult viability and efficient larval locomotion. Tmep mutant larvae have a reduced body contraction rate compared to controls, with stronger deficits in females. Surviving adult Tmep mutant females show bang sensitivity, a phenotype associated with epileptic seizures. In recordings from body wall muscles, Tmep mutants show substantial hyperexcitability, with many post-synaptic potentials fired in response to a single stimulation, consistent with a role for Tmep in restraining synaptic excitability. Neuromuscular junctions in Tmep mutants show modest structural defects and satellite boutons, which could also contribute to poor locomotor performance. Tmep is expressed in endosomes and synaptic vesicles within motor neurons, suggesting a possible role in synaptic membrane trafficking. Using RNAi knockdown, we show that Tmep is required in motor neurons for proper larval locomotion and excitability. Locomotor defects can be rescued by presynaptic knock-down of endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels or by reducing evoked release probability, suggesting that excess synaptic activity drives behavioral deficiencies. Our work establishes a critical function for the TMEM184B ortholog Tmep in the regulation of synaptic transmission and locomotor behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A DROSOPHILA CIRCUIT FOR HABITUATION OVERRIDE</a></h4>

              
                Habituated animals retain a latent capacity for robust engagement with familiar stimuli. In most instances, the ability to override habituation is best explained by postulating: (a) that habituation arises from the potentiation of inhibitory inputs onto stimulus-encoding assemblies; and (b) fast habituation override occurs through disinhibition. Previous work has shown that inhibitory plasticity contributes to specific forms of olfactory and gustatory habituation in Drosophila. Here we analyze how exposure to a novel stimulus causes override of gustatory (proboscis-extension reflex or ''PER'') habituation. While brief sucrose contact with tarsal hairs causes na[i]ve Drosophila to extend their proboscis, persistent tarsal exposure to sucrose reduces PER to subsequent sucrose stimuli. We show that in so habituated animals, either brief exposure of the proboscis to yeast or direct thermogenetic activation of sensory neurons restores the PER response to tarsal sucrose stimulation. Similar override of PER habituation can also be induced by brief thermogenetic activation of a population of TH (Tyrosine-Hydroxylase) positive neurons, a subset of which send projections to the SEZ. Significantly, sensory-neuron induced habituation override requires transmitter release from these TH-positive cells. Treatments that cause override specifically influence the habituated state, with no effect on the na[i]ve sucrose response across a range of concentrations. Taken together, these and other findings are consistent with a model in which novel taste stimuli trigger activity in dopaminergic neurons which, directly or indirectly, inhibit GABAergic cells that drive PER habituation. The implications of these findings for general mechanisms of attentional and sensory override of habituation are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PV neurons improve cortical complex scene analysis by enhancing timing-based coding</a></h4>

              
                Cortical representations underlying a wide range of cognitive abilities, which employ both rate and spike timing-based coding, emerge from underlying cortical circuits with a tremendous diversity of cell types. However, cell-type specific contributions to cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigate the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli, e.g., natural sounds, images, odors or vibrations, which are highly dynamic in time, competing with stimuli at other locations in space. PV neurons are thought to play a fundamental role in sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based codes, and the robustness of such temporal representations to spatial competition, have not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm; integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of novel spike-distance metrics, to dissect the contributions of PV neurons towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that PV neurons improve cortical discrimination of dynamic naturalistic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting by enhancing rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing reproducibility. Moreover, this temporal representation is maintained in the face of competing stimuli at other spatial locations, providing a robust code for complex scene analysis. These findings provide novel insights into the specific contributions of PV neurons in cortical coding of complex scenes.

	<p>Studies on parental interaction in the context of ASD has mainly focused on mothers, even if fathers and their children seem to form close and supportive relationships that may have unique effects on child development. Given the impact of ASD symptoms on a child’s ability to interact with significant others, recent findings strengthen the importance of including caregivers during treatment to guarantee a better adaptation to the child’s impairments. Despite this, fathers are scarcely involved, and interventions seem to not be tailored to their interactive characteristics and needs. For this reason, a systematic review was conducted to investigate fathers and children with ASD behaviors during interaction. This review found 12 observational studies that identified social, cognitive, and affective interactive modalities in father–child dyads through three psychology-focused journal databases: PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus. The significant variation in both sample size and in the measures used to assess dyadic outcomes limits the ability of this work to make robust recommendations for intervention. Despite this, the results revealed characteristic behaviors of this dyad that consequently allow specific targets to be worked on during intervention. In fact, from fathers’ individual strengths and weaknesses, it is possible to implement interventions that are complementary with maternal characteristics from the perspective of personalized and optimized treatment.</p>

	<p>Fast rhythms excess is a hallmark of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). To implement innovative, non-pharmacological, neurostimulation interventions to restore cortical-cortical interactions, we need to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Here, we investigated effective connectivity on source-level resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals in 15 PD participants and 10 healthy controls. First, we fitted multivariate auto-regressive models to the EEG source waveforms. Second, we estimated causal connections using Granger Causality, which provide information on connections’ strength and directionality. Lastly, we sought significant differences connectivity patterns between the two populations characterizing the network graph features—i.e., global efficiency and node strength. Causal brain networks in PD show overall poorer and weaker connections compared to controls quantified as a reduction of global efficiency. Motor areas appear almost isolated, with a strongly impoverished information flow particularly from parietal and occipital cortices. This striking isolation of motor areas may reflect an impaired sensory-motor integration in PD. The identification of defective nodes/edges in PD network may be a biomarker of disease and a potential target for future interventional trials.</p>

	<p>Neuropathic pain (NP) is a chronic, debilitating, and resistant form of pain. The onset rate of NP following spinal cord injuries (SCI) is high and may reduce the quality of life more than the sensorimotor loss itself. The long-term ineffectiveness of current treatments in managing symptoms and counteracting maladaptive plasticity highlights the need to find alternative therapeutic approaches. Virtual reality (VR) is possibly the best way to administer the specific illusory or reality-like experience and promote behavioral responses that may be effective in mitigating the effects of long-established NP. This approach aims to promote a more systematic adoption of VR-related techniques in pain research and management procedures, highlighting the encouraging preliminary results in SCI. We suggest that the multisensory modulation of the sense of agency and ownership by residual body signals may produce positive responses in cases of brain-body disconnection. First, we focus on the transversal role embodiment and how multisensory and environmental or artificial stimuli modulate illusory sensations of bodily presence and ownership. Then, we present a brief overview of the use of VR in healthcare and pain management. Finally, we discus research experiences which used VR in patients with SCI to treating NP, including the most recent combinations of VR with further stimulation techniques.</p>

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by hallmark impairments in social functioning. Nevertheless, nonsocial cognition, including hippocampus-dependent spatial reasoning and episodic memory, is also commonly impaired in ASD. ASD symptoms typically emerge between 12 and 24 months of age, a time window associated with critical developmental events in the hippocampus. Despite this temporal overlap and evidence of hippocampal structural abnormalities in ASD individuals, relatively few human studies have focused on hippocampal function in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The language network supports both lexical access and sentence generation during language production</a></h4>

              
                A network of left frontal and temporal brain regions has long been implicated in language comprehension and production. However, because of relatively fewer investigations of language production, the precise role of this 'language network' in production-related cognitive processes remains debated. Across four fMRI experiments that use picture naming/description to mimic the translation of conceptual representations into words and sentences, we characterize the response of the language regions to production demands. In line with prior studies, sentence production elicited strong responses throughout the language network. Further, we report three novel results. First, we demonstrate that production-related responses in the language network are robust to output modality (speaking vs. typing). Second, the language regions respond to both lexical access and sentence-generation demands. This pattern implies strong integration between lexico-semantic and combinatorial processes, mirroring the picture that has emerged in language comprehension. Finally, some have previously hypothesized the existence of production-selective mechanisms given that syntactic encoding is a critical part of sentence production, whereas comprehension is possible even when syntactic cues are degraded or absent. Contrary to this hypothesis, we find no evidence of brain regions that selectively support sentence generation. Instead, language regions respond overall more strongly during production than during comprehension, which suggests that production incurs a greater cost for the language network. Together, these results align with the idea that language comprehension and production draw on the same knowledge representations, which are stored in the language-selective network and are used both to interpret linguistic input and generate linguistic output.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Ventrolateral Anterior Temporal Lobe is Commonly Engaged by Both Mental State Inference and Semantic Association Tasks</a></h4>

              
                A key challenge for neurobiological models of social cognition is to elucidate whether brain regions are specialised for that domain. In recent years, discussion surrounding the role of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) epitomises such debates; some argue it is part of a domain-specific network for social processing, while others claim it is a domain-general hub for semantic representation. In the present study, we used ATL-optimised fMRI to map the contribution of different ATL structures to a variety of paradigms frequently used to probe a crucial social ability, namely theory of mind (ToM). Using multiple tasks enables a clearer attribution of activation to ToM as opposed to idiosyncratic features of stimuli. Further, we directly explored whether these same structures are also activated by a non-social task probing semantic representations. We revealed that common to all of the tasks was activation of a key ventrolateral ATL region that is typically invisible to standard fMRI. This constitutes novel evidence in support of the view that the ventrolateral ATL contributes to social cognition via a domain-general role in the retrieval of conceptual knowledge, and against claims of a specialised social function.

                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) gates alcohol self-administration in rodents. The major source of BDNF in the striatum is the cortex, and we recently found that BDNF-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (vlOFC) extend axonal projections to the DLS. We therefore hypothesized that BDNF in the vlOFC to DLS circuit moderates alcohol intake. We show that overexpression of BDNF in the vlOFC, which activates BDNF signaling in the DLS, is sufficient to attenuate voluntary consumption and seeking of 20% alcohol in the home cage using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Overexpressing BDNF in the vlOFC had no effect on the consumption of a sweetened saccharin solution. In addition, BDNF overexpression in the neighboring motor cortex did not alter alcohol intake. Finally, pathway-specific overexpression of BDNF in DLS-projecting vlOFC neurons significantly reduced alcohol intake and preference. Overall, BDNF in the vlOFC, and specifically in a vlOFC-DLS pathway, keeps alcohol drinking in moderation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulation related artifacts and a multipurpose template-based offline removal solution for a novel sensing-enabled deep brain stimulation device</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundThe Medtronic "Percept" is the first FDA approved deep brain stimulation (DBS) device with sensing capabilities during active stimulation. Its real-world signal recording properties have yet to be fully described.

ObjectiveThis study details sources of artifact (and potential mitigations) in local field potential (LFP) signals collected by the Percept, and assesses the potential impact of artifact on the future development of adaptive DBS (aDBS) using this device.

MethodsLFP signals were collected from seven subjects in both experimental and clinical settings. The presence of artifacts and their effect on the spectral content of neural signals were evaluated in both the stimulation ON and OFF states using three distinct offline artifact removal techniques.

ResultsTemplate subtraction successfully removed multiple sources of artifact, including 1) electrocardiogram (ECG), 2) non-physiologic polyphasic artifacts, and 3) ramping related artifacts seen when changing stimulation amplitudes. ECG removal from stimulation ON (at 0 mA) signals recovered the spectral shape seen when OFF stimulation (averaged difference in normalized power in theta, alpha, and beta bands [&le;] 3.5%). ECG removal using singular value decomposition was similarly successful, though required subjective researcher input. QRS interpolation produced similar recovery of beta-band signal, but resulted in residual low-frequency artifact.

ConclusionsArtifacts present when stimulation is enabled notably affected the spectral properties of sensed signals using the Percept. Multiple discrete artifacts could be successfully removed offline using an automated template subtraction method. The presence of unrejected artifact likely influences online power estimates, with the potential to affect aDBS algorithm performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structured random receptive fields enable informative sensory encodings</a></h4>

              
                The brain must represent the outside world in a way that enables an animal to survive and thrive. In early sensory systems, populations of neurons have a variety of receptive fields that are structured to detect features in input statistics. Alongside this structure, experimental recordings consistently show that these receptive fields also have a great deal of unexplained variability, which has often been ignored in classical models of sensory neurons. In this work, we model neuronal receptive fields as random samples from probability distributions in two sensory modalities, using data from insect mechanosensors and from neurons of mammalian primary visual cortex (V1). In particular, we build generative receptive field models where our random distributions are Gaussian processes with covariance functions that match the second-order statistics of experimental receptive data. We show theoretical results that these random feature neurons effectively perform randomized wavelet transform on the inputs in the temporal domain for mechanosensory neurons and spatial domain for V1 neurons. Such a transformation removes irrelevant components in the inputs, such as high-frequency noise, and boosts the signal. We demonstrate that these random feature neurons produce better learning from fewer training samples and with smaller networks in a variety of artificial tasks. The random feature model of receptive fields provides a unifying, mathematically tractable framework to understand sensory encodings across both spatial and temporal domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning neural decoders without labels using multiple data streams</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in neural decoding have accelerated the development of brain-computer interfaces aimed at assisting users with everyday tasks such as speaking, walking, and manipulating objects. However, current approaches for training neural decoders commonly require large quantities of labeled data, which can be laborious or infeasible to obtain in real-world settings. One intriguing alternative uses self-supervised models that share self-generated pseudo-labels between two data streams; such models have shown exceptional performance on unlabeled audio and video data, but it remains unclear how well they extend to neural decoding. Here, we learn neural decoders without labels by leveraging multiple simultaneously recorded data streams, including neural, kinematic, and physiological signals. Specifically, we apply cross-modal, self-supervised deep clustering to decode movements from brain recordings; these decoders are compared to supervised and unimodal, self-supervised models. We find that sharing pseudo-labels between two data streams during training substantially increases decoding performance compared to unimodal, self-supervised models, with accuracies approaching those of supervised decoders trained on labeled data. Next, we develop decoders trained on three modalities that match or slightly exceed the performance of supervised models, achieving state-of-the-art neural decoding accuracy. Cross-modal decoding is a flexible, promising approach for robust, adaptive neural decoding in real-world applications without any labels.

                BACKGROUNDHabituation is defined as a progressive decline in response to repeated exposure to a familiar and predictable stimulus and is highly conserved across species. Disrupted habituation is a signature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In rodents, habituation is observed in neural, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to repeated exposure to the predictable and moderately intense stress or restraint. We previously demonstrated that lesions to the posterior division of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (pPVT) impairs habituation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and specific neural connections among the pPVT and other brain regions that underlie habituation are unknown.

METHODSBehavioral and neuroendocrine habituation was assessed in adult male Sprague-Dawley restraints using the repeated restraint paradigm. Pan neuronal and Cre-dependent Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) were used to chemogenetically inhibit the pPVT and the subpopulation of pPVT neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), respectively. Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expression was knocked down in the pPVT using siRNA directed towards Arc. Golgi staining was used to assess structural plasticity of pPVT neurons. Local field potential recordings were used to assess coherent neural activity between the pPVT and mPFC. The attentional set-shifting task was used to assess mPFC-dependent behavior.

RESULTSHere, we show that Arc promotes habituation by increasing stress-induced spinogenesis in the pPVT, increasing coherent neural activity with the mPFC, and improving mPFC-mediated cognitive flexibility.

CONCLUSIONOur results demonstrate that Arc induction in the pPVT regulates habituation to repeated restraint and mPFC function.

One Sentence SummaryWe demonstrate that Arc in the posterior division of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus promotes habituation to repeated stress by increasing dendritic spines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Working memory performance is tied to stimulus complexity</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is the cognitive capability to maintain and process information over short periods. Recent behavioral and computational studies have shown that increased visual information of the presented stimulus material is associated with enhanced working memory performance. However, the underlying neural correlates of this association are unknown. To identify how stimuli of different visual information levels affect working memory performance, we conducted behavioral experiments and single unit recordings in the avian analog of the prefrontal cortex, the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL). On the behavioral level, we confirmed that feature-rich complex stimuli demonstrated higher working memory performance compared to feature-poor simple stimuli. This difference was reflected by distinct neural coding patterns at the single unit level. For complex stimuli, we found a highly multiplexed neuronal code. During the sample presentation, NCL neurons initially reflected both visual and value-related features of the presented stimuli that switched to a representation of the upcoming choice during a delay period. When processing simple stimuli, NCL neurons did not multiplex and represented the upcoming choice already during stimulus presentation and throughout the delay period. It is conceivable that the maintenance of the upcoming choice in working memory was prolonged for simple stimuli due to the early choice representation. This possibly resulted in increased decay of the working memory trace ultimately leading to a decrease in performance. In conclusion, we found that increases in stimulus complexity are associated with increased neuronal multiplexing of the working memory representation. This could possibly allow for a facilitated read-out of the neural code resulting in further enhancements of working memory performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in-vivo validation of ESI methods with focal sources</a></h4>

              
                Electrical source imaging (ESI) aims at reconstructing the electrical brain activity from measurements of the electric field on the scalp. Even though the localization of single focal sources should be relatively straightforward, different methods provide diverse solutions due to the different underlying assumptions. Furthermore, their input parameter(s) further affects the solution provided by each method, making localization even more challenging. In addition, validations and comparisons are typically performed either on synthetic data or through post-operative outcomes, in both cases with considerable limitations.

We use an in-vivo high-density EEG dataset recorded during intracranial single pulse electrical stimulation, in which the true sources are substantially dipolar and their locations are known. We compare ten different ESI methods under multiple choices of input parameters, to assess the accuracy of the best reconstruction, as well as the impact of the parameters on the localization performance.

Best reconstructions often fall within 1 cm from the true source, with more accurate methods outperforming less accurate ones by 1 cm, on average. Expectedly, dipolar methods tend to outperform distributed methods. Sensitivity to input parameters varies widely between methods. Depth weighting played no role for three out of six methods implementing it. In terms of regularization parameters, for several distributed methods SNR=1 unexpectedly turned out to be the best choice among the tested ones.

Our data show similar levels of accuracy of ESI techniques when applied to "conventional" (32 channels) and dense (64, 128, 256 channels) EEG recordings.

Overall findings reinforce the importance that ESI may have in the clinical context, especially when applied to identify the surgical target in potential candidates for epilepsy surgery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral and Neurostructural changes associated with Chronic Amygdala Hyperactivation</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundThe amygdala (AMY) is a key brain region of the limbic system that plays a critical role in emotion processing and stress response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies identified abnormal AMY activation in psychiatric illnesses including major depressive disorder (MDD). Stress exposure is a major precipitating factor of MDD episodes which are associated with AMY hyperactivity. Preclinical studies using of pharmacologic, opto- and chemogenetic approaches to activate AMY neurons have consistently demonstrated that acute AMY hyperactivation induces anxiety-like behaviors in mice. However, it remains unknown if chronic hyperactivation of the amygdala (cHOA) is sufficient to induce chronic stress-like deficits or is a susceptibility factor for chronic stress-induced behavioral, volumetric and synaptic deficits.

MethodsUsing designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) approach, basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons of Camk2a-cre mice infected with a virus driving the expression of the Gq-coupled DREADD were activated with clozapine-N-oxide (in drink water for 5 weeks). Mice were then exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS; 1X/day for 1hr) for 2 weeks. All mice were behaviorally assessed in the Phenotyper (PT), and sucrose consumption tests (SCT) each week and in the novelty supressed feeding (NSF, once at the end of the experiment). Animals were then perfused for ex vivo-MRI and puncta density analysis.

ResultsWe found that mice with cHOA displayed a progressive increase in baseline anxiety-like deficits in the PT test and slightly more marked deficits following CRS compared to controls, but not statistically different from animals subjected to CRS alone. Also, cHOA did not exacerbate CRS effect in the NSF. No significant cAH effect was found in the SCT before or after CRS. MRI analysis revealed no statistical charges between groups, while increased synaptic puncta density was found in cHOA mice subjected to CRS compared to cHOA or CRS alone.

ConclusionWe demonstrate that cAH is sufficient to induce anxiety and may exacerbate CRS effects on anxiety and synaptic measures. Results also suggest that cHOA was not sufficient to induce depressive-like behavior and was not a vulnerability factor for stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Altogether, our findings imply that a strong causal link between AMY hyperactivity and elevated anxiety, but not depressive-like behaviors and provide critical information to clinical research focused on using AMY activity level as a biomarker in stress-related illnesses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dense cortical input to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus mediates aversive signaling</a></h4>

              
                AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) encodes negative reward prediction error (RPE) and plays an important role in guiding behavioral responding to aversive stimuli. While initial studies describing the RMTg revealed the presence of cortical afferents, the density and distribution of this input has not been explored in detail. In addition, the functional consequences of cortical modulation of RMTg signaling are only just beginning to be investigated. The current study anatomically and functionally characterizes cortical input to the RMTg in rats. Findings from this work reveal dense input spanning the entire medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insular cortex. Afferents were most dense in the dorsomedial subregion of the PFC (dmPFC), an area which has also been implicated in both RPE signaling and aversive responding. RMTg-projecting dmPFC neurons originate in layer V and collateralize extensively throughout the brain. In-situ mRNA hybridization further revealed that neurons in this circuit are predominantly D1 receptor-expressing with a high degree of D2 receptor colocalization. Optogenetic stimulation of dmPFC terminals in the RMTg drives avoidance, and cFos expression is enhanced in this neural circuit during exposure to aversive stimuli. Exposure to such aversive stimuli results in significant physiological and structural plasticity suggestive of a loss of top-down modulation of RMTg-mediated signaling. Altogether, these data reveal the presence of a prominent cortico-subcortical projection involved in adaptive behavioral responding and provide a foundation for future work aimed at exploring alterations in circuit function in diseases characterized by deficits in cognitive control over the balance between reward and aversion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine biases sensitivity to personal goals and social influence in self-control over everyday desires</a></h4>

              
                People regularly give in to daily temptations in spite of conflict with personal goals. To test hypotheses about neuropharmacological influences on self-control, we used positron emission tomography to measure dopamine D2-like receptors (D2R) and experience sampling surveys to naturalistically track daily desires outside the laboratory in everyday life in a sample of 103 adults. Higher D2R availability in the ventral striatum was associated with increased sensitivity to personal goal conflict but not desire strength in deciding whether to attempt to resist a desire. The influence of D2Rs on sensitivity to personal goal conflict depended on whether desires were experienced in a social context. D2R availability in the midbrain (but not the ventral striatum) influenced whether desires were enacted. These findings provide unique evidence that the dopamine system influences decision making and regulatory behavior and provides new insights into how these mechanisms interact with personal goals and social contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticothalamic Projections Gate Alpha Rhythms in the Pulvinar</a></h4>

              
                Two types of corticothalamic (CT) terminals reach the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and their distribution varies according to the hierarchical level of the cortical area they originate from. While type 2 terminals are more abundant at lower hierarchical levels, terminals from higher cortical areas mostly exhibit type 1 axons. Such terminals also evoke different excitatory postsynaptic potential dynamic profiles, presenting facilitation for type 1 and depression for type 2. As the pulvinar is involved in the oscillatory regulation between intercortical areas, fundamental questions about the role of these different terminal types in the neuronal communication throughout the cortical hierarchy are yielded. Our theoretical results support that the co-action of the two types of terminals produces different oscillatory rhythms in pulvinar neurons. More precisely, terminal types 1 and 2 produce alpha-band oscillations at a specific range of connectivity weights. Such oscillatory activity is generated by an unstable transition of the balanced state networks properties that it is found between the quiescent state and the stable asynchronous spike response state. While CT projections from areas 17 and 21a are arranged in the model as the empirical proportion of terminals types 1 and 2, the actions of these two cortical connections are antagonistic. As area 17 generates low-band oscillatory activity, cortical area 21a shifts pulvinar responses to stable asynchronous spiking activity and vice-versa when area 17 produces an asynchronous state. To further investigate such oscillatory effects through corticothalamo-cortical projections, the transthalamic pathway, we created a cortical feedforward network of two cortical areas, 17 and 21a, with CT connections to a pulvinar-like network. With this model, the transthalamic pathway propagates alpha waves from the pulvinar to area 21a. This oscillatory transfer ceases when reciprocal connections from area 21a reach the pulvinar, closing the cortico-thalamic loop. Taken together, results of our model suggest that the pulvnar shows a bi-stable spiking activity, oscillatory or regular asynchronous spiking, whose responses are gated by the different activation of cortico-pulvinar projections from lower to higher-order areas such as areas 17 and 21a.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep-Learning-Based Accelerated and Noise-Suppressed Estimation (DANSE) of quantitative Gradient Recalled Echo (qGRE) MRI metrics associated with Human Brain Neuronal Structure and Hemodynamic Properties</a></h4>

              
                PurposeTo introduce a Deep-Learning-Based Accelerated and Noise-Suppressed Estimation (DANSE) method for reconstructing quantitative maps of biological tissue cellular-specific, R2t* and hemodynamic-specific, R2' from Gradient-Recalled-Echo (GRE) MRI data with multiple gradient-recalled echoes.

MethodsDANSE method adapts supervised learning paradigm to train a convolutional neural network for robust estimation of R2t* and R2' maps free from the adverse effects of macroscopic (B0) magnetic field inhomogeneities directly from the GRE magnitude images without utilizing phase images. The corresponding ground-truth maps were generated by means of a voxel-by-voxel fitting of a previously-developed biophysical quantitative GRE (qGRE) model accounting for tissue, hemodynamic and B0-inhomogeneities contributions to GRE signal with multiple gradient echoes using nonlinear least square (NLLS) algorithm.

ResultsWe show that the DANSE model efficiently estimates the aforementioned brain maps and preserves all features of NLLS approach with significant improvements including noise-suppression and computation speed (from many hours to seconds). The noise-suppression feature of DANSE is especially prominent for data with SNR characteristic for typical GRE data (SNR~50), where DANSE-generated R2t* and R2' maps had three times smaller errors than that of NLLS method.

ConclusionsDANSE method enables fast reconstruction of magnetic-field-inhomogeneity-free and noise-suppressed quantitative qGRE brain maps. DANSE method does not require any information about field inhomogeneities during application. It exploits spatial patterns in the qGRE MRI data and previously-gained knowledge from the biophysical model, thus producing clean brain maps even in the environments with high noise levels. These features along with fast computational speed can lead to broad qGRE clinical and research applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deficits in decision-making induced by parietal cortex inactivation are compensated at two time scales</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decisions arise through the transformation of samples of evidence into a commitment to a proposition or plan of action. Such transformation is thought to involve cortical circuits capable of computation over time scales associated with working memory, attention, and planning. Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) are thought to play a role in all of these functions, and much of what is known about the neurobiology of decision making has been influenced by studies of LIP and its network of cortical and subcortical connections. However a causal role of neurons in LIP remains controversial. We used pharmacological and chemogenetic methods to inactivate LIP in one hemisphere of four rhesus monkeys. Inactivation produced clear biases in decisions, but the effects dissipated despite the persistence of neural inactivation, implying compensation by other unaffected areas. Compensation occurs on a rapid times scale, within an experimental session, and more gradually, across sessions. The findings resolve disparate studies and inform interpretation of focal perturbations of brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kinase activity profiling identifies putative downstream targets of cGMP/PKG signaling in inherited retinal neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that lead to photoreceptor cell death and eventually blindness. IRDs are characterised by a high genetic heterogeneity, making it imperative to design mutation-independent therapies. Mutations in a number of IRD disease genes have been associated with a rise of cyclic 3,5-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in photoreceptors. Accordingly, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has emerged as a new potential target for the mutation-independent treatment of IRDs. However, the substrates of PKG and the downstream degenerative pathways triggered by its activity have yet to be determined. Here, we performed kinome activity profiling of different murine organotypic retinal explant cultures (diseased rd1 and wild-type controls) using multiplex peptide microarrays to identify proteins whose phosphorylation was significantly altered by PKG activity. In addition, we tested the downstream effect of a known PKG inhibitor CN03 in these organotypic retina cultures. Among the PKG substrates were potassium channels belonging to the Kv1 family (KCNA3, KCNA6), Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1), DNA topoisomerase 2- (TOP2A), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (F263), and the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate 2 (GRIK2). The retinal expression of these PKG targets was further confirmed by immunofluorescence and could be assigned to various neuronal cell types, including photoreceptors, horizontal cells, and ganglion cells. Taken together, this study confirmed the key role of PKG in photoreceptor cell death and identified new downstream targets of cGMP/PKG signalling that will improve the understanding of the degenerative mechanisms underlying IRDs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Horizontal connectivity in V1 : Prediction of coherence in contour and motion integration</a></h4>

              
                This study demonstrates the functional importance of the Surround context relayed laterally in V1 by the horizontal connectivity, in controlling the latency and the gain of the cortical response to the feedforward visual drive. We report here four main findings : 1) a centripetal apparent motion sequence results in a shortening of the spiking latency of V1 cells, when the orientation of the local inducer and the global motion axis are both co-aligned with the RF orientation preference; 2) this contextual effects grows with visual flow speed, peaking at 150-250 degrees per second until matching the propagation speed of horizontal connectivity (0.15-0.25 mm/ms); 3) For this speed range, axial sensitivity of V1 cells is tilted by 90 degrees to become co-aligned with the orientation preference axis; 4) the modulation strength by the surround context correlates with the spatiotemporal coherence of the apparent motion flow. Our results suggest an internally-generated binding process, linking local (orientation /position) and global (motion/direction) features as early as V1. This long-range diffusion process constitutes a plausible substrate in V1 of the human psychophysical bias in speed estimate for collinear motion. Since demonstrated in the anesthetized cat, this novel form of contextual control of the cortical transfer function is a built-in property in V1, whose expression does not require behavioral attention and top-down control from higher cortical areas. We propose that horizontal connectivity participates to the propagation of an internal prediction wave, linking contour co-alignment and global axial motion at an apparent speed in the range of saccadic-like eye-movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probing neuropeptide volume transmission in vivo by a novel all-optical approach</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides are essential signaling molecules in the nervous system involved in modulating neural circuits and behavior. Although hypothesized to signal via volume transmission through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), remarkably little is known about their extrasynaptic diffusion. Here, we developed an all-optical approach to probe neuropeptide volume transmission in mouse neocortex. To control neuropeptide release, we engineered photosensitive nanovesicles with somatostatin-14 (SST) that is released with near-infrared light stimulation. To detect SST, we created a new cell-based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporter (CNiFER) using the SST2 GPCR. Under two-photon imaging, we determined the time to activate SST2R at defined distances as well as the maximal distance and loss rate for SST volume transmission in neocortex. Importantly, we determined that SST transmission is significantly faster in neocortex with a chemically degraded extracellular matrix, a diseased condition indicated in neuroinflammation and Parkinsons disease. These new neurotechnologies can reveal important biological signaling processes previously not possible, and provide new opportunities to investigate volume transmission in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic brain activity during associative learning examined with MEG/fMRI co-processing</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundDue to limitations of individual neuroimaging methods we examine spatial and temporal contributions to self-generation using multimodality imaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) within the Bayesian framework Multiple Sparse Priors (MSP).

New Method24 healthy participants performed an fMRI and MEG paired-associate learning task. FMRI data were processed within Group ICA fMRI Toolbox. Independent components (ICs) were temporally sorted by task time series (|r|>0.30 threshold identified task-related ICs). Task-positive ("generate") ICs were retained as spatial priors for MEG analyses. MEG data were processed by averaging trials to increase the signal-to-noise ratio within subjects and with an event-related theta power approach. MEG source reconstructions were constrained within the task-positive ICs for both analytical approaches.

ResultsFor fMRI, five networks were identified as task-related. Four ICs underlying active generation spanned bilateral parietal, orbitofrontal, medial frontal and superior temporal regions, and occipital lobe. FMRI-constrained MEG source reconstructions yielded early visual cortex activity followed by left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) recruitment to coalesce in the left inferior temporal lobe. For the event-related theta approach, reconstructions showed a progression of activity from bilateral temporal areas to left OFC and middle temporal gyrus, followed by right IFG.

Comparison with Existing MethodsMSP analyses informed by fMRI produced more focused regional activity than reconstructions without priors suggesting increased attention and maintenance when selecting relevant semantic information during active generation.

ConclusionsConstraining MEG source reconstruction to fMRI priors during active generation implicates interconnected fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal networks across time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying microstructural changes in diffusion MRI; How to break parameter degeneracy</a></h4>

              
                Biophysical models that attempt to infer real-world quantities from data usually have many free parameters. This over-parameterisation can result in degeneracies in model inversion and render parameter estimation ill-posed. However, often, we are not interested in estimating the parameters per se, but rather in identifying changes in parameters between experimental conditions (e.g. patients vs controls). Here we present a Bayesian framework to make inference on changes in the parameters of biophysical models even when model inversion is degenerate, which we refer to as Bayesian EstimatioN of CHange (BENCH). We infer the parameter changes in two steps; First, we train models that can estimate the pattern of change in the measurements given any hypothetical change in the parameters using simulations. Next, for any pair of real data sets, we use these pre-trained models to estimate the probability that an observed difference in the data is caused by each model of change. The approach is general and particularly useful for biophysical models with parameter degeneracies. In this paper, we apply the approach in the context of microstructural modelling of diffusion MRI data, where the models are usually over-parameterised and not invertible without injecting strong assumptions. Using simulations, we show that in the context of the standard model for diffusion our approach is able to identify changes in microstructural parameters from multi-shell diffusion MRI data. We also apply our approach to a subset of subjects from the UK-Biobank Imaging to identify the dominant standard model parameter change in areas of white matter hyperintensities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-fat diet feeding reduces the expression of Rab3a, Rab3gap1, and Rab3Gap2 genes that are pivotal to neuronal exocytosis.</a></h4>

              
                The Rab3A and Rab3gaps are essential to the Ca+2-dependent neuronal exocytosis in the hypothalamus. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) controls food intake and energy expenditure. We have earlier described that the high-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces an obesity phenotype with high leptin production and alteration of proteins related to endosome sorting, and ubiquitination in the ARC of mice. In this study, real-time PCR data analysis revealed that HFD feeding decreases significantly Rab3a, Rab3gap1, and Rab3gap2 transcript levels in the ARC when compared to the group receiving a control diet. The decrease of Rab3gap1/2 transcript levels in the ARC was strongly associated with an increase in plasma leptin. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that HFD feeding could be altering the general network of endosome compartmentalization in the ARC of mice, contributing to a failure in exocytosis and receptor recycling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole brain mapping of glutamate in adult and old primates at 11.7T</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate is the amino acid with the highest cerebral concentration. It plays a central role in brain metabolism. It is also the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in multiple cognitive functions. Alterations of the glutamatergic system may contribute to the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders. For example, changes of glutamate availability are reported in rodents and humans during Alzheimers and Huntingtons diseases, epilepsy as well as during aging.

Most studies evaluating cerebral glutamate have used invasive or spectroscopy approaches focusing on specific brain areas. Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer imaging of glutamate (gluCEST) is a recently developed imaging technique that can map glutamate distribution in the entire brain with higher sensitivity and at higher resolution than previous techniques. It thus has strong potential clinical applications to assess glutamate changes in the brain. High field is a key condition to perform gluCEST images with a meaningful signal to noise ratio. Thus, even if some studies started to evaluate gluCEST in humans, most studies focused on rodent models that can be imaged at high magnetic field.

In particular, systematic characterization of gluCEST contrast distribution throughout the whole brain has never been performed in humans or non-human primates. Here, we characterized for the first time the distribution of the glutamate index in the whole brain and in large-scale networks of mouse lemur primates at 11.7 Tesla. Because of its small size, this primate can be imaged in high magnetic field systems. It is widely studied as a model of cerebral aging or Alzheimers disease. We observed high gluCEST contrast in cerebral regions such as the nucleus accumbens, septum, basal forebrain, cortical areas 24 and 25. Age-related alterations of this biomarker were detected in the nucleus accumbens, septum, basal forebrain, globus pallidus, hypophysis, cortical areas 24, 21, 6 and in olfactory bulbs. An age-related gluCEST contrast decrease was also detected in specific neuronal networks, such as fronto-temporal and evaluative limbic networks. These results outline regional differences of gluCEST contrast and strengthen its potential to provide new biomarkers of cerebral function in primates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Laminar microcircuitry of visual cortex producing attention-associated electric fields</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive operations are widely studied by measuring electric fields through EEG and ECoG. However, despite their widespread use, the component neural circuitry giving rise to these signals remains unknown. Specifically, the functional architecture of cortical columns which results in attention-associated electric fields has not been explored. Here we detail the laminar cortical circuitry underlying an attention-associated electric field often measured over posterior regions of the brain in humans and monkeys. First, we identified visual cortical area V4 as one plausible contributor to this attention-associated electric field through inverse modeling of cranial EEG in macaque monkeys performing a visual attention task. Next, we performed laminar neurophysiological recordings on the prelunate gyrus and identified the electric-field-producing dipoles as synaptic activity in distinct cortical layers of area V4. Specifically, activation in the extragranular layers of cortex resulted in the generation of the attention-associated dipole. Feature selectivity of a given cortical column determined the overall contribution to this electric field. Columns selective for the attended feature contributed more to the electric field than columns selective for a different feature. Lastly, the laminar profile of synaptic activity generated by V4 was sufficient to produce an attention-associated signal measurable outside of the column. These findings suggest that the top-down recipient cortical layers produce an attention-associated electric field capable of being measured extracranially and the relative contribution of each column depends upon the underlying functional architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reproductive neuronal circuitry in adaptive changes of energy balance</a></h4>

              
                The crosstalk between metabolism and reproduction is essential for species survival. When dysfunctional, this interaction may decrease reproductive efficiency, but in physiological conditions of high energy demands, e.g., pregnancy and lactation, it is highly beneficial. Females display adaptive responses that assure offspring survival and health, including increased food intake and suppression of the reproductive function. Some of these physiological responses are modulated by leptin actions in neuronal pathways that are still unclear. The hypothalamic ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) is a key integrative node of metabolic cues and reproductive status, comprised of either leptin-depolarized or -hyperpolarized neurons. Here, we show that the subset of leptin-hyperpolarized neurons coexpresses dopamine transporter (DAT) and prolactin receptor. DAT expression is higher in prepubertal conditions, when reproductive function is suppressed. These neurons innervate AgRP presynaptic terminals and may potentiate their inhibitory actions on reproduction. We further applied a mathematical model to reconcile our new findings with the current literature and to verify if those neurons are putative components of the metabolic control of reproduction. In our model, leptin-depolarized PMv neurons project to and directly stimulate kisspeptin and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Leptin-hyperpolarized PMv DAT neurons are directly stimulated by prolactin and project to inhibitory control sites. During conditions of high prolactin levels, i.e., late pregnancy and lactation, this pathway may overcome the former, facilitating AgRP actions in the suppression of the reproductive function. Our model also predicts that overstimulation of this pathway may underlie earlier puberty and reproductive deficits observed in conditions of metabolic dysfunction.

Significance StatementWomen with excess or low energy stores (e.g., obesity or anorexia) have reproductive deficits, including altered puberty onset, disruption of reproductive cycles and decreased fertility. If able to conceive, they show higher risks of miscarriages and preterm birth. The hypothalamic circuitry controlling the interplay between metabolism and reproduction is undefined. Neurons in the ventral premammillary nucleus express leptin receptor and project to reproductive control sites. Those neurons are essentially glutamatergic, but functionally and phenotypically heterogeneous. They either depolarize or hyperpolarize in response to leptin. We show that leptin-hyperpolarized neurons coexpress dopamine transporter and prolactin receptor, and project to AgRP inhibitory output. Computational modeling was applied to build a neuronal network integrating metabolism and reproduction in typical and dysfunctional physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A curved manifold orients rotational dynamics in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Controlling arm movements requires complex, time-varying patterns of muscle activity 1,2. Accordingly, the responses of neurons in motor cortex are complex, time-varying, and heterogeneous during reaching 2-4. When examined at the population level, patterns of neural activity evolve over time according to dynamical rules 5,6. During reaching, these rules have been argued to be "rotational" 7 or variants thereof 8,9, containing coordinated oscillations in the spike rates of individual neurons. While these models capture key aspects of the neural responses, they fail to capture others - accounting for only 20-50% of the neural response variance. Here, we consider a broader class of dynamical models. We find that motor cortex dynamics take an unexpected form: there were 3-4 rotations at fixed frequencies in M1 and PMd explaining more than 90% of neural responses, but these rotations occurred in different portions of state space when movements differ. These rotations appear to reflect a curved manifold of fixed points in state space, around which dynamics are locally rotational. These fixed-frequency rotations obeyed a simple relationship with movement: the orientation of rotations in motor cortex activity were related almost linearly to the movement the animal made, allowing linear decoding of reach kinematic time-courses on single trials. This model constitutes a fundamentally novel way to consider pattern generation: like placing a record player in a large bowl, the frequency of activity is fixed, but the location of motor cortex activity on a curved manifold sets the orientation of locally-rotational dynamics. This system simplifies motor control, helps reconcile conflicting frameworks for interpreting motor cortex, and enables greatly improved neural decoding.

                Understanding the neuronal basis of epileptiform activity is a major challenge in neurology. Interictal epileptiform discharges are associated with fast ripples (FRs, >200 Hz) in the local field potential (LFP) and are a promising marker of the epileptogenic zone. Here, by using a novel hybrid macro-micro depth electrode, combining classic depth recording of LFP and two or three tetrodes enabling up to 15 neurons in local circuits to be recorded simultaneously, we have characterized neuronal responses to FRs on the same hybrid and other electrodes targeting other brain regions. While FRs were associated with increased neuronal activity in local circuits only, they were followed by inhibition in large-scale networks. Neuronal responses to FRs were homogeneous in local networks but differed across brain areas. Similarly, post-FR inhibition varied across recording locations and subjects and was shorter than typical inter-FR intervals, suggesting that this inhibition is a fundamental refractory process for the networks. These findings demonstrate that FRs engage local and global networks and point to network features that pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A linear neural circuit for light avoidance in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural circuits underlie behaviour is challenging even in the era of the connectome because it requires a combined approach encompassing anatomical and functional analyses. This is exemplified in studying the circuit underlying the light-avoidance behaviour displayed by the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. While this behaviour is robust and the nervous system relatively simple, only bits and pieces of the circuit have been delineated. Indeed, some studies resulted in contradicting conclusions regarding the contributions of various neuronal types to this behaviour. Here we devise trans-Tango MkII, a new version of the transsynaptic circuit tracing and manipulation tool trans-Tango. We implement trans-Tango MkII in anatomical tracing and combine it with circuit epistasis analysis. We use neuronal inhibition to test necessity of particular neuronal types for light-avoidance. We complement these experiments by selective neuronal activation to examine sufficiency in rescuing light-avoidance deficiencies exhibited by photoreceptor mutants. Together, our studies reveal a four-order, linear circuit for light avoidance behaviour connecting the light-detecting photoreceptors with a pair of neuroendocrine cells via two types of clock neurons. Our combined approach could be readily expanded to other larval circuits. Further, this strategy provides the framework for studying more complex nervous systems and behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateralized phenotypic differences in females in the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Clinical evidence indicates that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often show differential outcomes of comorbid conditions dependent on the lateralization of the seizure focus. However, whether a left or right seizure focus produces differential effects on comorbid outcomes has not been investigated in a rodent model of chronic recurrent seizures. Here, we used the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE to determine whether targeting of left or right dorsal hippocampus for injection produces different outcomes in hippocampal sclerosis, body weight gain, and multiple measures of reproductive endocrine dysfunction in female mice. At one, two, and four months after injection, in vivo measurements of estrous cycles and weight were followed by ex vivo examination of hippocampal sclerosis, circulating ovarian hormone and corticosterone levels, ovarian morphology, and pituitary gene expression. IHKA mice with right-targeted injection (IHKA-R) showed greater granule cell dispersion and pituitary Fshb expression compared to mice with left-targeted injection (IHKA-L). By contrast, pituitary expression of Lhb and Gnrhr were higher in IHKA-L mice compared to IHKA-R, but these values were not different from respective saline-injected controls. IHKA-L mice also showed an increased rate of weight gain compared to IHKA-R mice. Disruptions to estrous cyclicity, however, were similar in both IHKA-L and IHKA-R mice. These findings indicate that although major reproductive endocrine dysfunction phenotypes present similarly after targeting left or right dorsal hippocampus in the IHKA model of TLE, distinct latent mechanisms based on lateralization of seizure focus may contribute to produce similar emergent reproductive endocrine outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ON/OFF domains shape receptive fields in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                In higher mammals, thalamic afferents to primary visual cortex (area V1) segregate according to their responses to increases (ON) or decreases (OFF) in luminance. This organization induces columnar, ON/OFF domains postulated to provide a scaffold for the emergence of orientation tuning. To further test this idea, we asked whether ON/OFF domains exist in mouse V1 -- a species containing orientation tuned, simple cells, like those found in other mammals. Here we show that mouse V1 is indeed parceled into ON/OFF domains. Revealingly, fluctuations in the relative density ON/OFF neurons on the cortical surface mirror fluctuations in the relative density of ON/OFF receptive field centers on the visual field. In each cortical volume examined, the average of simple-cell receptive fields correlates with the difference between the average of ON and OFF receptive fields. Moreover, the local diversity of simple-cell receptive fields is explained by a model in which neurons linearly combine a small number of ON and OFF signals available in their cortical neighborhoods. Altogether, these findings indicate that ON/OFF domains originate in fluctuations of the spatial density of ON/OFF inputs on the visual field which, in turn, shapes the structure of receptive fields.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of vestibular stimulation on gait stability and variability</a></h4>

              
                Vestibular information modulates muscle activity during gait, presumably to contribute stability, because noisy electrical vestibular stimulation perturbs gait stability. An important mechanism to stabilize gait in the mediolateral direction is to coordinate foot placement based on a sensory estimate of the trunk center of mass state, to which vestibular information appears to contribute. We, therefore expected that noisy vestibular stimulation would decrease the correlation between foot placement and trunk center of mass state. Moreover, as vestibular modulation of muscle activity during gait depends on step width, we expected stronger effects for narrow-base than normal walking, and smaller effects for wide-base walking. In eleven healthy subjects we measured the kinematics of the trunk (as a proxy of the center of mass), and feet, while they walked on a treadmill in six conditions, including three different step widths: control (preferred step width), narrow-base (steps smaller than hip width), and wide-base (with steps greater than hip width). The three conditions were conducted with and without a bipolar electrical stimulus, applied behind the ears (5 mA). Walking with EVS reduced gait stability but increased the foot placement to center of mass correlation in different step width conditions. The narrow-base walking was the most stable condition and showed a stronger correlation between foot placement and center of mass state. We argue that EVS destabilized gait, but that this was partially compensated for by tightened control over foot placement, which would require successful use of other than vestibular sensory inputs, to estimate center of mass movement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kif11 overexpression rescues cognition, long-term potentiation, and spine defects in mouse and cell models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Competitive inhibition of kinesin motor proteins by amyloid-beta (A{beta}) may contribute to alterations in the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton that can disrupt plasticity mechanisms required for learning and memory, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), thus contributing to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of the microtubule motor protein KIF11 (Kinesin-5/Eg5) will rescue A{beta}-mediated synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments. We found that overexpression of Kif11 prevented spatial learning and LTP deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD and rescued A{beta}-mediated decreases in postsynaptic dendritic spine density in neuronal cultures. Together, these data suggest that KIF11 function is important for preserving synaptic structures and functions that are critical for learning and memory and for protection against A{beta}-mediated loss of cognition in AD.

                The expansion of the cerebral cortex is one of the most distinctive changes in the evolution of the human brain. Cortical expansion and related increases in cortical folding may have contributed to emergence of our capacities for high-order cognitive abilities. Molecular analysis of humans, archaic hominins, and non-human primates has allowed identification of chromosomal regions showing evolutionary changes at different points of our phylogenetic history. In this study, we assessed the contributions of genomic annotations spanning 30 million years to human sulcal morphology measured via MRI in more than 18,000 participants from the UK Biobank. We found that variation within brain-expressed human gained enhancers, regulatory genetic elements that emerged since our last common ancestor with Old World monkeys, explained more trait heritability than expected for the left and right calloso-marginal posterior fissures and the right central sulcus. Intriguingly, these are sulci that have been previously linked to the evolution of locomotion in primates and later on bipedalism in our hominin ancestors.

	<p>Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter that plays a key role in neuropsychiatric illness. Sex differences in dopaminergic signaling have been acknowledged for decades and have been linked to sex-specific heterogeneity in both dopamine-related behaviours as well as in various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the overall number of studies that have evaluated sex differences in dopamine signaling, both in health and in these disorders, is low. This review will bring together what is known regarding sex differences in innate dopamine receptor expression and function, as well as highlight the known sex-specific roles of dopamine in addiction, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Due to differences in prognosis, diagnosis, and symptomatology between male and female subjects in disorders that involve dopamine signaling, or in responses that utilize pharmacological interventions that target dopamine receptors, understanding the fundamental sex differences in dopamine receptors is of vital importance for the personalization of therapeutic treatment strategies.</p>

	<p>Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) brings together neurodegenerative pathologies whose main characteristic is to start with a progressive language disorder. PPA diagnosis is often delayed in non-specialised clinical settings. With the technologies’ development, new writing parameters can be extracted, such as the writing pressure on a touch pad. Despite some studies having highlighted differences between patients with typical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and healthy controls, writing parameters in PPAs are understudied. The objective was to verify if the writing pressure in different linguistic and non-linguistic tasks can differentiate patients with PPA from patients with AD and healthy subjects. Patients with PPA (n = 32), patients with AD (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 26) were included in this study. They performed a set of handwriting tasks on an iPad® digital tablet, including linguistic, cognitive non-linguistic, and non-cognitive non-linguistic tasks. Average and maximum writing pressures were extracted for each task. We found significant differences in writing pressure, between healthy controls and patients with PPA, and between patients with PPA and AD. However, the classification of performances was dependent on the nature of the tasks. These results suggest that measuring writing pressure in graphical tasks may improve the early diagnosis of PPA, and the differential diagnosis between PPA and AD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>When discussing procedural learning, it is now routine to consider both online and offline influences for skill acquisition. This is because it is commonly assumed that the evolution of a novel skill memory continues well after practice is over. Indeed, factors impacting offline contributions to skill memory development such as sleep and exercise have garnered considerable research interest in recent years. This is partly because of their capacity to foster postpractice consolidation, a process that has been identified as critical to moving a skill memory from a labile to more stable or elaborate form. While uncovering the potency of non-practice factors to facilitate consolidation is undoubtedly important, the present opinion is designed to remind the reader that a practice schedule, organized to challenge the learner, can, in and of itself, be effective in supporting consolidation resulting in significant gains in long-term skill retention.</p>

                Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) type 1 is a rare hereditary metabolic disorder resulting in accumulation of calcium oxalate in several organs, including the heart. Cardiac oxalosis in PH is poorly described in the medical literature. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 and end-stage renal failure who presented with syncope related to a paroxysmal third-degree atrioventricular block. The patient benefited from the implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker with a good outcome. Conduction blocks in case of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 are exceptional; in fact, less than five reports have previously been published in the medical literature. With this case, we would like to highlight the need for regular and careful monitoring of cardiac status in patients treated for primary oxalosis, especially when renal function is impaired.

                Background: In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented volume of almost 3,000 clinical trials registered worldwide. We aimed to describe the COVID-19 clinical trial research agenda in Germany during the first year of the pandemic. Methods: We identified randomized clinical trials assessing interventions to treat or prevent COVID-19 that were registered in 2020 and recruited or planned to recruit participants in Germany. We requested recruitment information from trial investigators as of April 2021. Results: In 2020, 65 trials were completely (n=27) or partially (n=38) conducted in Germany. Most trials investigated interventions to treat COVID-19 (86.2%; 56/65), in hospitalized patients (67.7%; 44/65), with industry funding (53.8%; 35/65). Few trials were completed (21.5%; 14/65). Overall, 187,179 participants were planned to be recruited (20,696 in Germany), with a median number of 106 German participants per trial (IQR 40 to 345).  From the planned German participants, 13.4%  were recruited (median 15 per trial (IQR 0 to 44). Conclusions: The overall German contribution to the worldwide COVID-19 clinical trial research agenda was modest. Few trials delivered urgently needed evidence. Most trials did not meet recruitment goals. Evaluation and international comparison of the challenges for conducting clinical trials in Germany is needed.

                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be also considered.    Results: Here we show that genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from closely related coronaviruses are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for virus replication, host cell invasion, and host immune response. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2, we identify two sites: one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other at the end of the spike gene past its critical domain junction; for SARS-CoV-1, one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a directed passage model for viral constructs, including virus replicase, in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Model and data together allow us to infer a hypothetical tripartite genome assembly scheme for the synthetic biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.   Conclusions: These results provide evidence that the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, but not that of RaTG13 and all other closest SARS coronavirus family members identified, are carriers of distinct homology signals that might point to large-scale genomic editing during a passage of directed replication and chromosomal integration inside genetically modified yeast cells.

                Background – Recently, there have been attempts to develop mHealth applications for asthma self-management. However, there is a lack of applications that can offer accurate predictions of asthma exacerbation using the weather triggers and demographic characteristics to give tailored response to users. This paper proposes an optimised Deep Neural Network Regression (DNNR) model to predict asthma exacerbation based on personalised weather triggers. Methods – With the aim of integrating weather, demography, and asthma tracking, an mHealth application was developed where users conduct the Asthma Control Test (ACT) to identify the chances of their asthma exacerbation. The asthma dataset consists of panel data from 10 users that includes 1010 ACT scores as the target output. Moreover, the dataset contains 10 input features which include five weather features (temperature, humidity, air-pressure, UV-index, wind-speed) and five demography features (age, gender, outdoor-job, outdoor-activities, location). Results – Using the DNNR model on the asthma dataset, a score of 0.83 was achieved with Mean Absolute Error (MAE)=1.44 and Mean Squared Error (MSE)=3.62. It was recognised that, for effective asthma self-management, the prediction errors must be in the acceptable loss range (error<0.5). Therefore, an optimisation process was proposed to reduce the error rates and increase the accuracy by applying standardisation and fragmented-grid-search. Consequently, the optimised-DNNR model (with 2 hidden-layers and 50 hidden-nodes) using the Adam optimiser achieved a 94% accuracy with MAE=0.20 and MSE=0.09. Conclusions – This study is the first of its kind that recognises the potentials of DNNR to identify the correlation patterns among asthma, weather, and demographic variables. The optimised-DNNR model provides predictions with a significantly higher accuracy rate than the existing predictive models and using less computing time. Thus, the optimisation process is useful to build an enhanced model that can be integrated into the asthma self-management for mHealth application.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Characterizing the Genetic Architecture of Parkinson's Disease in Latinos</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This work was undertaken in order to identify Parkinson's disease (PD) risk variants in a Latino cohort, to describe the overlap in the genetic architecture of PD in Latinos compared to European-ancestry subjects, and to increase the diversity in PD genome-wide association (GWAS) data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped and imputed 1,497 PD cases and controls recruited from nine clinical sites across South America. We performed a GWAS using logistic mixed models; variants with a <i>p</i>-value &lt;1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> were tested in a replication cohort of 1,234 self-reported Latino PD cases and 439,522 Latino controls from 23andMe, Inc. We also performed an admixture mapping analysis where local ancestry blocks were tested for association with PD status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One locus, <i>SNCA</i>, achieved genome-wide significance (<i>p</i>-value &lt;5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>); rs356182 achieved genome-wide significance in both the discovery and the replication cohorts (discovery, G allele: 1.58 OR, 95% CI 1.35–1.86, <i>p</i>-value 2.48 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; 23andMe, G allele: 1.26 OR, 95% CI 1.16–1.37, <i>p</i>-value 4.55 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). In our admixture mapping analysis, a locus on chromosome 14, containing the gene <i>STXBP6</i>, achieved significance in a joint test of ancestries and in the Native American single-ancestry test (<i>p</i>-value &lt;5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). A second locus on chromosome 6, containing the gene <i>RPS6KA2</i>, achieved significance in the African single-ancestry test (<i>p</i>-value &lt;5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrated the importance of the <i>SNCA</i> locus for the etiology of PD in Latinos. By leveraging the demographic history of our cohort via admixture mapping, we identified two potential PD risk loci that merit further study. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:353–365</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Subicular Caspase‐1 Contributes to Pharmacoresistance in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Unidentified mechanisms largely restrict the viability of effective therapies in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Our previous study revealed that hyperactivity of the subiculum is crucial for the genesis of pharmacoresistance in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we examined the role of subicular caspase-1, a key neural pro-inflammatory enzyme, in pharmacoresistant TLE.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that the expression of activated caspase-1 in the subiculum, but not the CA1, was upregulated in pharmacoresistant amygdaloid-kindled rats. Early overexpression of caspase-1 in the subiculum was sufficient to induce pharmacoresistant TLE in rats, whereas genetic ablation of caspase-1 interfered with the genesis of pharmacoresistant TLE in both kindled rats and kainic acid-treated mice. The pro-pharmacoresistance effect of subicular caspase-1 was mediated by its downstream inflammasome-dependent interleukin-1β. Further electrophysiological results showed that inhibiting caspase-1 decreased the excitability of subicular pyramidal neurons through influencing the excitation/inhibition balance of presynaptic input. Importantly, a small molecular caspase-1 inhibitor CZL80 attenuated seizures in pharmacoresistant TLE models, and decreased the neuronal excitability in the brain slices obtained from patients with pharmacoresistant TLE.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the subicular caspase-1-interleukin-1β inflammatory pathway as a novel alternative mechanism hypothesis for pharmacoresistant TLE, and present caspase-1 as a potential target. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:377–390</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Lewy Body–like Inclusions in Human Midbrain Organoids Carrying Glucocerebrosidase and α‐Synuclein Mutations</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We utilized human midbrain-like organoids (hMLOs) generated from human pluripotent stem cells carrying glucocerebrosidase gene (<i>GBA1)</i> and α-synuclein (α-syn; <i>SNCA)</i> perturbations to investigate genotype-to-phenotype relationships in Parkinson disease, with the particular aim of recapitulating α-syn– and Lewy body–related pathologies and the process of neurodegeneration in the hMLO model.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated and characterized hMLOs from <i>GBA1</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> and <i>SNCA</i> overexpressing isogenic embryonic stem cells and also generated Lewy body–like inclusions in <i>GBA1/SNCA</i> dual perturbation hMLOs and conduritol-b-epoxide–treated <i>SNCA</i> triplication hMLOs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified for the first time that the loss of glucocerebrosidase, coupled with wild-type α-syn overexpression, results in a substantial accumulation of detergent-resistant, β-sheet–rich α-syn aggregates and Lewy body–like inclusions in hMLOs. These Lewy body–like inclusions exhibit a spherically symmetric morphology with an eosinophilic core, containing α-syn with ubiquitin, and can also be formed in Parkinson disease patient–derived hMLOs. We also demonstrate that impaired glucocerebrosidase function promotes the formation of Lewy body–like inclusions in hMLOs derived from patients carrying the <i>SNCA</i> triplication.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, the data indicate that our hMLOs harboring 2 major risk factors (glucocerebrosidase deficiency and wild-type α-syn overproduction) of Parkinson disease provide a tractable model to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms for progressive Lewy body formation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Psychoses affecting people with epilepsy increase disease burden and diminish quality of life. We characterized postictal psychosis, which comprises about one quarter of epilepsy-related psychoses, and has unknown causation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a case–control cohort study including patients diagnosed with postictal psychosis, confirmed by psychiatric assessment, with available data regarding epilepsy, treatment, psychiatric history, psychosis profile, and outcomes. After screening 3,288 epilepsy patients, we identified 83 with psychosis; 49 had postictal psychosis. Controls were 98 adults, matched by age and epilepsy type, with no history of psychosis. Logistic regression was used to investigate clinical factors associated with postictal psychosis; univariate associations with a <i>p</i> value &lt; 0.20 were used to build a multivariate model. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia were calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cases were more likely to have seizure clustering (odds ratio [OR] = 7.59, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), seizures with a recollected aura (OR = 2.49, <i>p =</i> 0.013), and a family history of psychiatric disease (OR = 5.17, <i>p</i> = 0.022). Cases showed predominance of right temporal epileptiform discharges (OR = 4.87, <i>p</i> = 0.007). There was no difference in epilepsy duration, neuroimaging findings, or antiseizure treatment between cases and controls. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia in an extended cohort of postictal psychosis cases (n = 58) were significantly higher than in 1,366 epilepsy controls (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 3%, <i>p</i> = 6 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), but not significantly different from 945 independent patients with schizophrenia (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.1%<i>, p</i> = 0.775).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Postictal psychosis occurs under particular circumstances in people with epilepsy with a heightened genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, illustrating how disease biology (seizures) and trait susceptibility (schizophrenia) may interact to produce particular outcomes (postictal psychosis) in a common disease.

                <p>At present, resilience refers to a highly heterogeneous concept with ill-defined determinants, mechanisms, and outcomes. This call for action argues for the need to define resilience as a person-centered multidimensional metric, informed by a dynamic lifespan perspective and combining observational and interventional experimental studies to identify specific neural markers and correlated behavioral measures. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the urgent need of such an effort with the ultimate goal of defining a new vital sign, an individual index of resilience, as a life-long metric with the capacity to predict an individual's risk for disability in the face of a stressor, insult, injury, or disease.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Histology reveals that early active multiple sclerosis lesions can be classified into 3 main interindividually heterogeneous but intraindividually stable immunopathological patterns of active demyelination (patterns I–III). In patterns I and II, a T-cell- and macrophage-associated demyelination is suggested, with pattern II only showing signs of a humoral immune response. Pattern III is characterized by inflammatory lesions with an oligodendrocyte degeneration. Patterns suggest pathogenic heterogeneity, and we postulated that they have distinct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates that may serve as biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated in an international collaborative retrospective cohort study the MRI lesion characteristics of 789 conventional prebiopsy and follow-up MRIs in relation to their histopathologically classified immunopathological patterns (n = 161 subjects) and lesion edge features (n = 112).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A strong association of a ringlike enhancement and a hypointense T2-weighted (T2w) rim with patterns I and II, but not pattern III, was observed. Only a fraction of pattern III patients showed a ringlike enhancement, and this was always atypical. Ringlike enhancement and T2w rims colocalized, and ringlike enhancement showed a strong association with macrophage rims as shown by histology. A strong concordance of MRI lesion characteristics, meaning that different lesions showed the same features, was found when comparing biopsied and nonbiopsied lesions at a given time point, indicating lesion homogeneity within individual patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We provide robust evidence that MRI characteristics reflect specific morphological features of multiple sclerosis immunopatterns and that ringlike enhancement and T2w hypointense rims might serve as a valuable noninvasive biomarker to differentiate pathological patterns of demyelination.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal Changes in Hippocampal Network Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is connected to 2 distinct cortical brain networks, the posterior–medial and the anterior–temporal networks, involving different medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. The aim of this study was to assess the functional alterations of these 2 networks, their changes over time, and links to cognition in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed MTL connectivity in 53 amyloid-β–positive patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia and 68 healthy elderly controls, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. First, we compared the functional connectivity of the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks within the control group to highlight their specificities. Second, we compared the connectivity of these networks between groups, and between baseline and 18-month follow-up in patients. Third, we assessed the association in the connectivity changes between the 2 networks, and with cognitive performance.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found decreased connectivity in patients specifically between the hippocampus and the posterior–medial network, together with increased connectivity between several MTL subregions and the anterior–temporal network. Moreover, changes in the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks were interrelated such that decreased MTL–posterior–medial connectivity was associated with increased MTL–anterior–temporal connectivity. Finally, both MTL–posterior–medial decrease and MTL–anterior–temporal increase predicted cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that longitudinal connectivity changes in the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal hippocampal networks are linked together and that they both contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. These results shed light on the critical role of the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and clinical symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Genomic Insights into Myasthenia Gravis Identify Distinct Immunological Mechanisms in Early and Late Onset Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify disease relevant genes and explore underlying immunological mechanisms that contribute to early and late onset forms of myasthenia gravis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel genomic methodology to integrate genomewide association study (GWAS) findings in myasthenia gravis with cell-type specific information, such as gene expression patterns and promotor-enhancer interactions, in order to identify disease-relevant genes. Subsequently, we conducted additional genomic investigations, including an expression quantitative analysis of 313 healthy people to provide mechanistic insights.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified several genes that were specifically linked to early onset myasthenia gravis including <i>TNIP1</i>, <i>ORMDL3</i>, <i>GSDMB</i>, and <i>TRAF3</i>. We showed that regulators of toll-like receptor 4 signaling were enriched among these early onset disease genes (fold enrichment = 3.85, <i>p</i> = 6.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). In contrast, T-cell regulators <i>CD28</i> and <i>CTLA4</i> were exclusively linked to late onset disease. We identified 2 causal genetic variants (rs231770 and rs231735; posterior probability = 0.98 and 0.91) near the <i>CTLA4</i> gene. Subsequently, we demonstrated that these causal variants result in low expression of <i>CTLA4</i> (rho = −0.66, <i>p</i> = 1.28 × 10<sup>−38</sup> and rho = −0.52, <i>p</i> = 7.01 × 10<sup>−22</sup>, for rs231735 and rs231770, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The disease-relevant genes identified in this study are a unique resource for many disciplines, including clinicians, scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The distinct immunological pathways linked to early and late onset myasthenia gravis carry important implications for drug repurposing opportunities and for future studies of drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Targeted tDCS Mitigates Dual‐Task Costs to Gait and Balance in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among older adults, the ability to stand or walk while performing cognitive tasks (ie, dual-tasking) requires coordinated activation of several brain networks. In this multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, and sham-controlled study, we examined the effects of modulating the excitability of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) and the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) on dual-task performance “costs” to standing and walking.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-seven older adults without overt illness or disease completed 4 separate study visits during which they received 20 minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) optimized to facilitate the excitability of the L-DLPFC and SM1 simultaneously, or each region separately, or neither region (sham). Before and immediately after stimulation, participants completed a dual-task paradigm in which they were asked to stand and walk with and without concurrent performance of a serial-subtraction task.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>tDCS simultaneously targeting the L-DLPFC and SM1, as well as tDCS targeting the L-DLPFC alone, mitigated dual-task costs to standing and walking to a greater extent than tDCS targeting SM1 alone or sham (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). Blinding efficacy was excellent and participant subjective belief in the type of stimulation received (real or sham) did not contribute to the observed functional benefits of tDCS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results demonstrate that in older adults, dual-task decrements may be amenable to change and implicate L-DPFC excitability as a modifiable component of the control system that enables dual-task standing and walking. tDCS may be used to improve resilience and the ability of older results to walk and stand under challenging conditions, potentially enhancing everyday functioning and reducing fall risks.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Gut Microbiome Signatures of Risk and Prodromal Markers of Parkinson Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function, and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α-/β-diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND (Tübingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study participants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among risk and prodromal markers, physical inactivity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α-diversity. Physical inactivity, sex, constipation, possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β-diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical inactivity showed an interaction effect. Among other factors, age and urate-lowering medication were associated with α- and β-diversity. Constipation was highest in individuals with the Firmicutes-enriched enterotype, and physical inactivity was most frequent in the <i>Bacteroides</i>-enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the <i>Prevotella</i>-enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical inactivity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history, and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome-dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is not recommended for acute stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and a large volume of irreversibly injured tissue (“core”). Perfusion imaging may identify a subset of patients with large core who benefit from MT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared two cohorts of LVO-related patients with large core (&gt;50 ml on diffusion-weighted-imaging or CT-perfusion using RAPID), available perfusion imaging, and treated within 6 hours from onset by either MT + Best Medical Management (BMM) in one prospective study, or BMM alone in the pre-MT era from a prospective registry. Primary outcome was 90-day modified Rankin Scale ≤2. We searched for an interaction between treatment group and amount of penumbra as estimated by the mismatch ratio (MMRatio = critical hypoperfusion/core volume).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, 107 patients were included (56 MT + BMM and 51 BMM): Mean age was 68 ± 15 years, median core volume 99 ml (IQR: 72–131) and MMRatio 1.4 (IQR: 1.0–1.9). Baseline clinical and radiological variables were similar between the two groups, except for a higher intravenous thrombolysis rate in the BMM group. The MMRatio strongly modified the clinical outcome following MT (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001 for continuous MMRatio); MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcome in patients with, but not in those without, MMRatio&gt;1.2 (adjusted OR [95% CI] = 6.8 [1.7–27.0] vs 0.7 [0.1–6.2], respectively). Similar findings were present for MMRatio ≥1.8 in the subgroup with core ≥70 ml. Parenchymal hemorrhage on follow-up imaging was more frequent in the MT + BMM group regardless of the MMRatio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Perfusion imaging may help select which patients with large core should be considered for MT. Randomized studies are warranted. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:417–427</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to determine in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) whether intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG is associated with outcomes reflecting inflammatory activity and chronic worsening.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared cerebrospinal fluid analysis, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data, and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels at baseline and follow-up in 530 patients with relapsing MS. Patients were categorized by the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB) and intrathecal synthesis of IgG and IgM (intrathecal fraction [IF]: IgG<sub>IF</sub> and IgM<sub>IF</sub>). Relationships with the time to first relapse, sNfL concentrations, T2-weighted (T2w) lesions, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and time to initiation of high-efficacy therapy were analyzed in covariate-adjusted statistical models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>By categorical analysis, in patients with IgM<sub>IF</sub> the median time to first relapse was 28 months shorter and MSSS on average higher by 1.11 steps compared with patients without intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Moreover, patients with IgM<sub>IF</sub> had higher sNfL concentrations, more new/enlarging T2w lesions, and higher total T2w lesion counts (all <i>p</i> ≤ 0.01). These associations were absent or equally smaller in patients who were positive for only OCGB or OCGB/IgG<sub>IF</sub>. Furthermore, quantitative analyses revealed that in patients with IgM<sub>IF</sub> ≥ median, the time to first relapse and to initiation of high-efficacy therapy was shorter by 32 and by 203 months, respectively (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), in comparison to patients with IgM<sub>IF</sub> &lt; median. Dose-dependent associations were also found for IgM<sub>IF</sub> but not for IgG<sub>IF</sub> with magnetic resonance imaging-defined disease activity and sNfL.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This large study supports the value of intrathecal IgM synthesis as an independent biomarker of disease activity and severity in relapsing MS. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:477–489</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) assess the individual genetic propensity to a condition by combining sparse information scattered across genetic loci, often displaying small effect sizes. Most PRSs are constructed in European-ancestry populations, limiting their use in other ethnicities. Here we constructed and validated a PRS for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) in Caribbean Hispanics (CH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a CH discovery (n = 4,312) and independent validation sample (n = 1,850) to construct an ancestry-specific PRS (“CH-PRS”) and evaluated its performance alone and with other predictors using the area under curve (AUC) and logistic regression (strength of association with LOAD and statistical significance). We tested if CH-PRS predicted conversion to LOAD in a subsample with longitudinal data (n = 1,239). We also tested the CH-PRS in an independent replication CH cohort (n = 200) and brain autopsy cohort (n = 33). Finally, we tested the effect of ancestry on PRS by using European and African American discovery cohorts to construct alternative PRSs (“EUR-PRS”, “AA-PRS”).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full model (LOAD ~ CH-PRS + sex + age + <i>APOE-ɛ4)</i>, achieved an AUC = 74% (OR<sub>CH-PRS</sub> = 1.51 95%CI = 1.36–1.68), raising to &gt;75% in <i>APOE-ɛ4</i> non-carriers. CH-PRS alone achieved an AUC = 72% in the autopsy cohort, raising to AUC = 83% in full model. Higher CH-PRS was significantly associated with clinical LOAD in the replication CH cohort (OR = 1.61, 95%CI = 1.19–2.17) and significantly predicted conversion to LOAD (HR = 1.93, CI = 1.70–2.20) in the longitudinal subsample. EUR-PRS and AA-PRS reached lower prediction accuracy (AUC = 58% and 53%, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Enriching diversity in genetic studies is critical to provide an effective PRS in profiling LOAD risk across populations. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:366–376</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the Alzheimer's disease metabolite signature through magnetic resonance spectroscopy in adults with Down syndrome and its relation with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cortical thickness.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 118 adults with Down syndrome from the Down Alzheimer Barcelona Imaging Initiative and 71 euploid healthy controls from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration cohort. We measured the levels of myo-inositol (a marker of neuroinflammation) and N-acetyl-aspartate (a marker of neuronal integrity) in the precuneus using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We investigated the changes with age and along the disease continuum (asymptomatic, prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's disease dementia stages). We assessed the relationship between these metabolites and Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio, phosphorylated tau-181, neurofilament light (NfL), and YKL-40 cerebrospinal fluid levels as well as amyloid positron emission tomography uptake using Spearman correlations controlling for multiple comparisons. Finally, we computed the relationship between cortical thickness and metabolite levels using Freesurfer.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Asymptomatic adults with Down syndrome had a 27.5% increase in the levels of myo-inositol, but equal levels of N-acetyl-aspartate compared to euploid healthy controls. With disease progression, myo-inositol levels increased, whereas N-acetyl-aspartate levels decreased in symptomatic stages of the disease. Myo-inositol was associated with amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration markers, mainly at symptomatic stages of the disease, whereas N-acetyl-aspartate was related to neurodegeneration biomarkers in symptomatic stages. Both metabolites were significantly associated with cortical thinning, mainly in symptomatic participants.</p>

                <p>The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has contributed to more than 163 million confirmed infections and 3.3 million deaths worldwide. The severity of the pandemic has led to an unprecedented effort to develop multiple effective vaccines. Due to excellent safety and efficacy data from clinical trials, several vaccines were approved. We report a case series of postvaccinal encephalitis in temporal correlation to vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. The diagnostic criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis were fulfilled. Our patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids. The incidence has been estimated to be approximately 8 per 10 million vaccine doses. Complication of postvaccinal encephalitis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination still appear to be very rare, but need to be diagnosed and treated adequately. Large pooled data from observational epidemiologic studies are necessary to verify causality. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:506–511</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evaluating the effectiveness of ensemble voting in improving the accuracy of consensus signals produced by various DTWA algorithms from step-current signals generated during nanopore sequencing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Smith, Rachel Chan, Maaz Khurram, Paul M. K. Gordon</p>

Nanopore sequencing device analysis systems simultaneously generate multiple picoamperage current signals representing the passage of DNA or RNA nucleotides ratcheted through a biomolecule nanopore array by motor proteins. Squiggles are a noisy and time-distorted representation of an underlying nucleotide sequence, “gold standard model”, due to experimental and algorithmic artefacts. Other research fields use dynamic time warped<i>-</i>space averaging <i>(DTWA)</i> algorithms to produce a consensus signal from multiple time-warped sources while preserving key features distorted by standard, linear-averaging approaches. We compared the ability of <i>DTW</i> Barycentre averaging (<i>DBA</i>), minimize mean (<i>MM</i>) and stochastic sub-gradient descent (<i>SSG) DTWA</i> algorithms to generate a consensus signal from squiggle-space ensembles of RNA molecules <i>Enolase</i>, <i>Sequin R1-71-1</i> and <i>Sequin R2-55-3</i> without knowledge of their associated gold standard model. We propose techniques to identify the leader and distorted squiggle features prior to <i>DTWA</i> consensus generation. New visualization and warping-path metrics are introduced to compare consensus signals and the best estimate of the “true” consensus, the study’s gold standard model. The <i>DBA</i> consensus was the best match to the gold standard for both <i>Sequin</i> studies but was outperformed in the <i>Enolase</i> study. Given an underlying common characteristic across a squiggle ensemble, we objectively evaluate a novel “voting scheme” that improves the local similarity between the consensus signal and a given fraction of the squiggle ensemble. While the gold standard is not used during voting, the increase in the match of the final voted-on consensus to the underlying <i>Enolase</i> and <i>Sequin</i> gold standard sequences provides an indirect success measure for the proposed voting procedure in two ways: First is the decreased least squares warped distance between the final consensus and the gold model, and second, the voting generates a final consensus length closer to known underlying RNA biomolecule length. The results suggest considerable potential in marrying squiggle analysis and <i>voted-on DTWA</i> consensus signals to provide low-noise, low-distortion signals. This will lead to improved accuracy in detecting nucleotides and their deviation model due to chemical modifications (a.k.a. epigenetic information). The proposed combination of ensemble voting and <i>DTWA</i> has application in other research fields involving time-distorted, high entropy signals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolò Gozzi, Paolo Bajardi, Nicola Perra</p>

The promise of efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is fulfilled and vaccination campaigns have started worldwide. However, the fight against the pandemic is far from over. Here, we propose an age-structured compartmental model to study the interplay of disease transmission, vaccines rollout, and behavioural dynamics. We investigate, via in-silico simulations, individual and societal behavioural changes, possibly induced by the start of the vaccination campaigns, and manifested as a relaxation in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We explore different vaccination rollout speeds, prioritization strategies, vaccine efficacy, as well as multiple behavioural responses. We apply our model to six countries worldwide (Egypt, Peru, Serbia, Ukraine, Canada, and Italy), selected to sample diverse socio-demographic and socio-economic contexts. To isolate the effects of age-structures and contacts patterns from the particular pandemic history of each location, we first study the model considering the same hypothetical initial epidemic scenario in all countries. We then calibrate the model using real epidemiological and mobility data for the different countries. Our findings suggest that early relaxation of safe behaviours can jeopardize the benefits brought by the vaccine in the short term: a fast vaccine distribution and policies aimed at keeping high compliance of individual safe behaviours are key to mitigate disease resurgence.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Networks of Causal Linkage Between Eigenmodes Characterize Behavioral Dynamics of Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik Saberski, Antonia K. Bock, Rachel Goodridge, Vitul Agarwal, Tom Lorimer, Scott A. Rifkin, George Sugihara</p>

Behavioral phenotyping of model organisms has played an important role in unravelling the complexities of animal behavior. Techniques for classifying behavior often rely on easily identified changes in posture and motion. However, such approaches are likely to miss complex behaviors that cannot be readily distinguished by eye (e.g., high-dimensional dynamics). To explore this issue, we focus on the model organism <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, where behaviors have been extensively recorded and classified. Using a dynamical systems lens, we identify high-dimensional, non-linear causal relationships between four basic shapes that describe worm motion (eigenmodes, also called “eigenworms”). We find relationships between all pairs of eigenmodes, but the timescales of the interactions vary between pairs and across individuals. Using these varying timescales, we create “interaction profiles” to represent an individual’s behavioral dynamics. As desired, these profiles are able to distinguish well-known behavioral states: i.e., the profiles for foraging individuals are distinct from those of individuals exhibiting an escape response. More importantly, we find that interaction profiles can distinguish high dimensional behaviors among divergent mutant strains that were previously classified as phenotypically similar. Specifically, we find it is able to detect phenotypic behavioral differences not previously identified in strains related to dysfunction of hermaphrodite-specific neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chromosomal neighbourhoods allow identification of organ specific changes in gene expression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rishi Das Roy, Outi Hallikas, Mona M. Christensen, Elodie Renvoisé, Jukka Jernvall</p>

Although most genes share their chromosomal neighbourhood with other genes, distribution of genes has not been explored in the context of individual organ development; the common focus of developmental biology studies. Because developmental processes are often associated with initially subtle changes in gene expression, here we explored whether neighbouring genes are informative in the identification of differentially expressed genes. First, we quantified the chromosomal neighbourhood patterns of genes having related functional roles in the mammalian genome. Although the majority of protein coding genes have at least five neighbours within 1 Mb window around each gene, very few of these neighbours regulate development of the same organ. Analyses of transcriptomes of developing mouse molar teeth revealed that whereas expression of genes regulating tooth development changes, their neighbouring genes show no marked changes, irrespective of their level of expression. Finally, we test whether inclusion of gene neighbourhood in the analyses of differential expression could provide additional benefits. For the analyses, we developed an algorithm, called DELocal that identifies differentially expressed genes by comparing their expression changes to changes in adjacent genes in their chromosomal regions. Our results show that DELocal removes detection bias towards large changes in expression, thereby allowing identification of even subtle changes in development. Future studies, including the detection of differential expression, may benefit from, and further characterize the significance of gene-gene neighbour relationships.

                Background: This article aims to explore the factors associated with Dubowitz neurological examination scores in preterm new-borns.       Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in which forty preterm new-borns were evaluated by using the Dubowitz neurological examination on their first outpatient visit following hospital discharge. A questionnaire was also deployed to explore parental variables.       Results: Preterm new-borns with low scores in the Dubowitz neurological examination were born at an even lower gestational age, required longer hospitalisation, and had more indicators for orotracheal intubation. Positive correlations between the subdomains of the Dubowitz neurological examination with birthweight, mother's age, Apgar score at 5 min, maternal and paternal education, and income were also significant. Linear regression analyses explained 26% of the of the Dubowitz neurological examination global score, retaining birthweight, income, and father’s age as significant predictors. Conclusions: Early, appropriated neurological assessments of preterm infants are critical to detect risk factors that may underpin developmental delays.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Cerebral venous thrombosis revealing celiac disease [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy resulting from intolerance of an individual genetically predisposed to gluten. It has a large clinical polymorphism ranging from a classic digestive clinical presentation due to the malabsorption syndrome to extra-intestinal symptoms. Among the hematologic abnormalities, venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) has been reported, and they are most often located in the abdomen or lower limbs, but the cerebral localization was exceptionally described. We report a case of CD revealed by cerebral thrombophlebitis. A 44-year-old patient with no medical history and no drug intake, presented with hemiplegia followed by a status epilepticus in a context of apyrexia, initially hospitalized in intensive care. Magnetic imaging resonance displayed a cerebral venous thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus requiring anticoagulant treatment, then transferred to our department for the etiological investigation. On questioning, the patient reported chronic diarrhea and weight loss with no other associated symptoms. The examination revealed an underweight patient with pale conjunctiva, improvement of her deficit symptoms, and no other abnormalities. Laboratory tests noted biological signs of malabsorption. The thrombophilia assessment revealed a protein C deficiency with a slight increase in anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-Beta 2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies. Immunological tests noted positives anti-transglutaminase and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies. Duodenal biopsy demonstrated villous atrophy. After ruling out the other causes of VTE, the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to CD was retained. Early diagnosis and treatment of CD improves the quality-of-life for patients and may spare them various long-term or even fatal complications.
