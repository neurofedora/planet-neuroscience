                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Patch-clamp instruments including amplifier circuits and pipettes affect the recorded voltage signals. We hypothesized that realistic and complete <I>in silico</I> representation of recording instruments together with detailed morphology and biophysics of small recorded structures will reveal signal distortions and provide a tool that predicts native, instrument-free electrical signals from distorted voltage recordings. Therefore, we built a model that was verified by small axonal recordings. The model accurately recreated actual action potential (AP) measurements with typical recording artefacts and predicted the native electrical behavior. The simulations verified that recording instruments substantially filter voltage recordings. Moreover, we revealed that instrumentation directly interferes with local signal generation depending on the size of the recorded structures, which complicates the interpretation of recordings from smaller structures, such as axons. However, our model offers a straightforward approach that predicts the native waveforms of fast voltage signals and the underlying conductances even from the smallest neuronal structures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Localizing Microemboli within the Rodent Brain through Block-Face Imaging and Atlas Registration</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain microinfarcts are prevalent in humans, however because of the inherent difficulty of identifying and localizing individual microinfarcts, brain-wide quantification is impractical. In mice, microinfarcts have been created by surgically introducing microemboli into the brain, but a major limitation of this model is the absence of automated methods to identify and localize individual occlusions. We present a novel and semi-automated workflow to identify the anatomic location of fluorescent emboli (microspheres) within the mouse brain through histologic processing and atlas registration. By incorporating vibratome block-face imaging with the QuickNII brain registration tool, we show that the anatomic location of microspheres can be accurately registered to brain structures within the Allen mouse brain (AMB) atlas (e.<I>g</I>., somatomotor areas, hippocampal region, visual areas, etc.). Compared with registering images of slide mounted sections to the AMB atlas, microsphere location was more accurately determined when block-face images were used. As a proof of principle, using this workflow we compared the distribution of microspheres within the brains of mice that were either perfused or immersion fixed. No significant effect of perfusion on total microsphere number or location was detected. In general, microspheres were distributed brain-wide, with the largest density found in the thalamus. In sum, our block-face imaging workflow enables efficient characterization of the widespread distribution of fluorescent microemboli, facilitating future investigation into the impact of microinfarct load and location on brain health.</p>

                Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been necessary to deliver mental health care using technologies (e-mental health). But there have been difficulties in its application. Quantitative systematic reviews such as meta-analysis doesn’t allow us to fully identify and properly describe this subject. Thus, our study has two main objectives: a) "to determine what evidence is available for synchronous e-mental health implementation"; and b) "to develop a framework informed by a realist analysis for the implementation of synchronous e-mental health". Methods: We will search MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science databases from 1st January 2015 to September 2020, with no language restriction. A systematic review with a narrative description and a realist synthesis will be conducted. Primary studies relating to adults with common mental health problems using any type of mobile mental health intervention that includes a synchronic component and communication with a mental health professional will be included. For the analysis, we will make a realist synthesis of the systematic reviews, using a grounded theory approach with an emergent approach to synthesize the information, prioritizing the systematic reviews with a lower risk of bias in the AMSTAR-2 tool. The realist synthesis will be based on the interpretation, integration, and inference of the evaluated elements and the generation of hypotheses to better understand the implementation process of synchronous e-mental health. Finally, we will present the overall assessment in a Summary of Qualitative Findings table. Conclusion: Our results will allow a better understanding of the facilitator and limitations in implementing e-mental health.

This study addresses this problem by profiling cellulose-degrading bacteria and archaea in the selective cellulose cultures of two samples of the eastern subterranean termite (Reticulitermes flavipes) and one soil sample collected at the same location as one of the termite samples. Methods: All the cultures were examined for cell concentration and remaining cellulose after the culture was completed. The 16S rRNA pyrotag sequencing method was used to identify the prokaryotic microbiota for the three cultures and one termite colony without culture. The MOTHUR, SSU-ALIGN, RDPTools, phyloseq, and other R packages were used for sequence and statistical analyses. Results: Biochemical analyses of the cultures suggested high efficiency of cellulose degradation. Comparative analyses between the cultured and uncultured termite gut microbiota revealed a significant difference. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were found to be the two most abundant phyla of cellulose-degrading bacteria from the three cultures, but different classes within each phylum dominated the different samples. Shared and sample-specific cellulose-degrading taxa, including a core set of taxa across all the cultures, were identified. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the importance of using selective cellulose culture to study the cellulose-degrading microbial community. It also revealed that the cellulose-degrading microbiota in the eastern subterranean termite is significantly influenced by the microbiota in the surrounding soil environment. Biochemical analyses showed that the microbial communities enriched from all the selective cultures were efficient in degrading cellulose, and a core set of bacteria have been identified as targets for further functional analyses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Translation, validity and reliability of the Danish version of the Adolescent Insomnia Questionnaire [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Adolescent Insomnia Questionnaire (AIQ), English version, is the only validated screening measure developed specifically to identify insomnia symptoms in adolescents. To date, no specific screening tool for adolescent insomnia is present in Danish language. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the AIQ in a sample of Danish adolescents. Methods: The AIQ underwent a process of forward-backward translation and pilot testing. Subsequently, data were collected at baseline and two-week follow-up from adolescents aged 11-19, who completed both the AIQ and an available adult measure of insomnia (the Athens Insomnia Scale, AIS). The internal consistency, test-retest reliability and convergent validity were assessed. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify the latent factors underlying the questionnaire. Results: At baseline 185 adolescents (18% males and 82% females, mean age 16.0 years) and 102 (55.1%) at two-week follow-up completed the questionnaires. The AIQ showed excellent internal consistency for the total score (Cronbach's a: 0.88) and good convergent validity with the AIS total score (Pearson’s correlation value= 0.86, P<0.001). The test-retest reliability at two weeks was very satisfactory (ICC coefficient = 0.89; 95% CI 0.84, 0.92). Results from the exploratory factor analysis identified a three-model solution corresponding to the same three-model solution identified within the original development sample. Conclusions: The Danish version of the AIQ demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency, test-retest reliability and validity, which supports its use as a screening tool for the identification of insomnia symptoms in adolescents, including Danish-speaking adolescents.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using de novo assembly to identify structural variation of eight complex immune system gene regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jia-Yuan Zhang, Hannah Roberts, David S. C. Flores, Antony J. Cutler, Andrew C. Brown, Justin P. Whalley, Olga Mielczarek, David Buck, Helen Lockstone, Barbara Xella, Karen Oliver, Craig Corton, Emma Betteridge, Rachael Bashford-Rogers, Julian C. Knight, John A. Todd, Gavin Band</p>

Driven by the necessity to survive environmental pathogens, the human immune system has evolved exceptional diversity and plasticity, to which several factors contribute including inheritable structural polymorphism of the underlying genes. Characterizing this variation is challenging due to the complexity of these loci, which contain extensive regions of paralogy, segmental duplication and high copy-number repeats, but recent progress in long-read sequencing and optical mapping techniques suggests this problem may now be tractable. Here we assess this by using long-read sequencing platforms from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, supplemented with short-read sequencing and Bionano optical mapping, to sequence DNA extracted from CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a single European individual identified as HV31. We use this data to build a <i>de novo</i> assembly of eight genomic regions encoding four key components of the immune system, namely the human leukocyte antigen, immunoglobulins, T cell receptors, and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. Validation of our assembly using k-mer based and alignment approaches suggests that it has high accuracy, with estimated base-level error rates below 1 in 10 kb, although we identify a small number of remaining structural errors. We use the assembly to identify heterozygous and homozygous structural variation in comparison to GRCh38. Despite analyzing only a single individual, we find multiple large structural variants affecting core genes at all three immunoglobulin regions and at two of the three T cell receptor regions. Several of these variants are not accurately callable using current algorithms, implying that further methodological improvements are needed. Our results demonstrate that assessing haplotype variation in these regions is possible given sufficiently accurate long-read and associated data. Continued reductions in the cost of these technologies will enable application of these methods to larger samples and provide a broader catalogue of germline structural variation at these loci, an important step toward making these regions accessible to large-scale genetic association studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A novel artificial intelligence-based approach for identification of deoxynucleotide aptamers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frances L. Heredia, Abiel Roche-Lima, Elsie I. Parés-Matos</p>

The selection of a DNA aptamer through the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) method involves multiple binding steps, in which a target and a library of randomized DNA sequences are mixed for selection of a single, nucleotide-specific molecule. Usually, 10 to 20 steps are required for SELEX to be completed. Throughout this process it is necessary to discriminate between true DNA aptamers and unspecified DNA-binding sequences. Thus, a novel machine learning-based approach was developed to support and simplify the early steps of the SELEX process, to help discriminate binding between DNA aptamers from those unspecified targets of DNA-binding sequences. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach to identify aptamers were implemented based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). NLP method (CountVectorizer) was used to extract information from the nucleotide sequences. Four ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines) were trained using data from the NLP method along with sequence information. The best performing model was Support Vector Machines because it had the best ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. In our model, an Accuracy (A) of 0.995, the fraction of samples that the model correctly classified, and an Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC) of 0.998, the degree by which a model is capable of distinguishing between classes, were observed. The developed AI approach is useful to identify potential DNA aptamers to reduce the amount of rounds in a SELEX selection. This new approach could be applied in the design of DNA libraries and result in a more efficient and faster process for DNA aptamers to be chosen during SELEX.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Improving the understanding of cytoneme-mediated morphogen gradients by in silico modeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adrián Aguirre-Tamaral, Isabel Guerrero</p>

Morphogen gradients are crucial for the development of organisms. The biochemical properties of many morphogens prevent their extracellular free diffusion, indicating the need of an active mechanism for transport. The involvement of filopodial structures (cytonemes) has been proposed for morphogen signaling. Here, we describe an <i>in silico</i> model based on the main general features of cytoneme-meditated gradient formation and its implementation into Cytomorph, an open software tool. We have tested the spatial and temporal adaptability of our model quantifying Hedgehog (Hh) gradient formation in two <i>Drosophila</i> tissues. Cytomorph is able to reproduce the gradient and explain the different scaling between the two epithelia. After experimental validation, we studied the predicted impact of a range of features such as length, size, density, dynamics and contact behavior of cytonemes on Hh morphogen distribution. Our results illustrate Cytomorph as an adaptive tool to test different morphogens gradients and to generate hypotheses that are difficult to study experimentally.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A multi-approach and multi-scale platform to model CD4+ T cells responding to infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kenneth Y. Wertheim, Bhanwar Lal Puniy, Alyssa La Fleur, Ab Rauf Shah, Matteo Barberis, Tomáš Helikar</p>

Immune responses rely on a complex adaptive system in which the body and infections interact at multiple scales and in different compartments. We developed a modular model of CD4+ T cells, which uses four modeling approaches to integrate processes at three spatial scales in different tissues. In each cell, signal transduction and gene regulation are described by a logical model, metabolism by constraint-based models. Cell population dynamics are described by an agent-based model and systemic cytokine concentrations by ordinary differential equations. A Monte Carlo simulation algorithm allows information to flow efficiently between the four modules by separating the time scales. Such modularity improves computational performance and versatility and facilitates data integration. We validated our technology by reproducing known experimental results, including differentiation patterns of CD4+ T cells triggered by different combinations of cytokines, metabolic regulation by IL2 in these cells, and their response to influenza infection. In doing so, we added multi-scale insights to single-scale studies and demonstrated its predictive power by discovering switch-like and oscillatory behaviors of CD4+ T cells that arise from nonlinear dynamics interwoven across three scales. We identified the inflamed lymph node’s ability to retain naive CD4+ T cells as a key mechanism in generating these emergent behaviors. We envision our model and the generic framework encompassing it to serve as a tool for understanding cellular and molecular immunological problems through the lens of systems immunology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mitochondrial RNase H1 activity regulates R-loop homeostasis to maintain genome integrity and enable early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lingling Cheng, Wenjie Wang, Yao Yao, Qianwen Sun</p>

Plant mitochondrial genomes undergo frequent homologous recombination (HR). Ectopic HR activity is inhibited by the HR surveillance pathway, but the underlying regulatory mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that the mitochondrial RNase H1 AtRNH1B impairs the formation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) and participates in the HR surveillance pathway in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. AtRNH1B suppresses ectopic HR at intermediate-sized repeats (IRs) and thus maintains mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. The RNase H1 AtRNH1C is restricted to the chloroplast; however, when cells lack AtRNH1B, transport of chloroplast AtRNH1C into the mitochondria secures HR surveillance, thus ensuring the integrity of the mitochondrial genome and allowing embryogenesis to proceed. HR surveillance is further regulated by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein ORGANELLAR SINGLE-STRANDED DNA BINDING PROTEIN1 (OSB1), which decreases the formation of R-loops. This study uncovers a facultative dual targeting mechanism between organelles and sheds light on the roles of RNase H1 in organellar genome maintenance and embryogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Degranulation enhances presynaptic membrane packing, which protects NK cells from perforin-mediated autolysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Li, Jordan S. Orange</p>

Natural killer (NK) cells kill a target cell by secreting perforin into the lytic immunological synapse, a specialized interface formed between the NK cell and its target. Perforin creates pores in target cell membranes allowing delivery of proapoptotic enzymes. Despite the fact that secreted perforin is in close range to both the NK and target cell membranes, the NK cell typically survives while the target cell does not. How NK cells preferentially avoid death during the secretion of perforin via the degranulation of their perforin-containing organelles (lytic granules) is perplexing. Here, we demonstrate that NK cells are protected from perforin-mediated autolysis by densely packed and highly ordered presynaptic lipid membranes, which increase packing upon synapse formation. When treated with 7-ketocholesterol, lipid packing is reduced in NK cells making them susceptible to perforin-mediated lysis after degranulation. Using high-resolution imaging and lipidomics, we identified lytic granules themselves as having endogenously densely packed lipid membranes. During degranulation, lytic granule–cell membrane fusion thereby further augments presynaptic membrane packing, enhancing membrane protection at the specific sites where NK cells would face maximum concentrations of secreted perforin. Additionally, we found that an aggressive breast cancer cell line is perforin resistant and evades NK cell–mediated killing owing to a densely packed postsynaptic membrane. By disrupting membrane packing, these cells were switched to an NK-susceptible state, which could suggest strategies for improving cytotoxic cell-based cancer therapies. Thus, lipid membranes serve an unexpected role in NK cell functionality protecting them from autolysis, while degranulation allows for the inherent lytic granule membrane properties to create local ordered lipid “shields” against self-destruction.

Spratt and colleagues show that loss of Scn2a-encoded NaV1.2 channels in mouse prefrontal pyramidal cells can paradoxically increase excitability due to NaV1.2’s distinct role in regulating somatodendritic excitability, independent of action potential electrogenesis in the axon.

                Conventional wisdom suggests that the inadequacy of voltage-gated sodium channels impairs intrinsic neuronal excitability. Zhang et al. report that a severe deficiency of the NaV1.2 channel unexpectedly results in hyperexcitability of striatal medium spiny neurons with an elevated voltage threshold.

                Long-term synaptic depression in the hippocampus is accomplished by the endocytic removal of AMPA type-glutamate receptors from the synaptic membrane. Brachet et al. identify the motor protein machinery that associates with the receptors after internalization. This association prevents receptors from returning to synapses and ensures persistent synaptic depression.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Slow AMPA receptors in hippocampal principal cells</a></h4>

              
                Pampaloni et al. identify slow AMPA receptors in the hippocampus. Synaptic responses from slow AMPA receptors are distributed in a mosaic fashion across CA1 pyramidal cells. Slow AMPA responses provide massive depolarization that can trigger an action potential from a single stimulation and produce short-term potentiation from a purely postsynaptic locus.

                MECII-originating type 2 dentate spikes (DSM) promote dominance of CA1 slow (∼40-Hz) over mid-frequency (∼80-Hz) gamma oscillations when CA1 represents non-local recollections. Dvorak et al. show that DSM coordinates cofiring within DG, CA3, and CA1 networks and optimizes discharge timing between DG and CA1 for information transfer during memory recall.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Feature-based attention processes in primate prefrontal cortex do not rely on feature similarity</a></h4>

              
                Stalter et al. characterize the effects of feature-based attention on PFC neurons' tuning while monkeys switch attention based on two coupled features. Although PFC neurons experience strong gain modulation in response to attentional demands, neuronal gain modulation is not bound to the tuning preferences of neurons. This finding contradicts the feature-similarity gain model.

                Wang et al. find that variation in the spatial learning/memory capability of inbred mice correlates with the induction of hippocampal miR-466f-3p expression. This varied upregulation of miR-466f-3p and downregulation of its target, MEF2A, are mediated by randomized activation of a CREB signaling axis in individual mice upon environmental stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Repeated nuclear translocations underlie photoreceptor positioning and lamination of the outer nuclear layer in the mammalian retina</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptors occupy a defined layer in the retina. Aghaizu et al. show that mammalian rod and cone photoreceptors use repeated, dynein-1-driven apically directed nuclear translocations for fine-positioning and retention within this layer. Dynein 1 disruption in photoreceptors results in ectopic displacement beyond the photoreceptor layer and impaired synapse formation.

                Chew et al. uncover a critical role of the conserved Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in neuronal pruning during development. Nrf2-Keap1 signaling is activated via cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of CncC/Nrf2, dependent on importin and ecdysone signaling. The pathway regulates pruning independent of its canonical antioxidant response pathway, acting instead through a proteasomal degradation pathway.

                How the chromatin abundance of SMC complexes is regulated remains poorly understood. Psakhye and Branzei identify SUMO protease Ulp2 as a guardian of cohesin, condensin, and Smc5/6 complexes against SUMO-chain-targeted turnover. The authors show that the essential role of Pds5 cohesin subunit is to antagonize SUMO chains jointly with Ulp2.

                Microexons play crucial roles in neuronal function but pose mechanistic challenges to the spliceosome. Choudhary et al. reveal that PRP-40, a core spliceosomal component, is required for microexon inclusion in C. elegans and mammalian cells. PRP-40 is proposed as a mediator of intron definition for exons refractory to exon definition.

                Oxidative stress ubiquitously challenges cellular homeostasis. Renaudin et al. show that oxidative stress impairs RNase H1 recruitment via 8-oxoguanine accumulation, eliciting unscheduled RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) that block mtDNA replication. These findings define the mechanism underlying a specific molecular consequence of oxidative stress, with links to aging-related human diseases.

While green infrastructure has the potential to decrease air pollution and provide other benefits to human health, vegetation alone cannot resolve health disparities related to air pollution injustice. We discuss how unequal access to green infrastructure can limit air quality improvements for marginalized communities and provide strategies to move forward.

Here, the authors show that the vortex bound states coupling to magnetic impurities provides an axial electron-hole asymmetry on a much longer scale, and that the direction of the asymmetry depends on the band character of the superconducting material.

                The discovery of a drug requires over a decade of intensive research and financial investments – and still has a high risk of failure. To reduce this burden, we developed the NICEdrug.ch resource, which incorporates 250,000 bioactive molecules, and studied their enzymatic metabolic targets, fate, and toxicity. NICEdrug.ch includes a unique fingerprint that identifies reactive similarities between drug–drug and drug–metabolite pairs. We validated the application, scope, and performance of NICEdrug.ch over similar methods in the field on golden standard datasets describing drugs and metabolites sharing reactivity, drug toxicities, and drug targets. We use NICEdrug.ch to evaluate inhibition and toxicity by the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil, and suggest avenues to alleviate its side effects. We propose shikimate 3-phosphate for targeting liver-stage malaria with minimal impact on the human host cell. Finally, NICEdrug.ch suggests over 1300 candidate drugs and food molecules to target COVID-19 and explains their inhibitory mechanism for further experimental screening. The NICEdrug.ch database is accessible online to systematically identify the reactivity of small molecules and druggable enzymes with practical applications in lead discovery and drug repurposing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pharmacological rescue of impaired mitophagy in Parkinson’s disease-related LRRK2 G2019S knock-in mice</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, yet the biological mechanisms involved in its aetiology are poorly understood. Evidence links this disorder with mitochondrial dysfunction and/or impaired lysosomal degradation – key features of the autophagy of mitochondria, known as mitophagy. Here, we investigated the role of LRRK2, a protein kinase frequently mutated in PD, in this process in vivo. Using mitophagy and autophagy reporter mice, bearing either knockout of LRRK2 or expressing the pathogenic kinase-activating G2019S LRRK2 mutation, we found that basal mitophagy was specifically altered in clinically relevant cells and tissues. Our data show that basal mitophagy inversely correlates with LRRK2 kinase activity in vivo. In support of this, use of distinct LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in cells increased basal mitophagy, and a CNS penetrant LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, GSK3357679A, rescued the mitophagy defects observed in LRRK2 G2019S mice. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that pathogenic LRRK2 directly impairs basal mitophagy, a process with strong links to idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, and demonstrates that pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 is a rational mitophagy-rescue approach and potential PD therapy.

                Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer death, and its mortality is associated with metastasis and chemoresistance. We demonstrate that oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells are sensitized to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Oxaliplatin-resistant cells exhibited transcriptional downregulation of caspase-10, but this had minimal effects on TRAIL sensitivity following CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of caspase-10 in parental cells. Sensitization effects in oxaliplatin-resistant cells were found to be a result of increased DR4, as well as significantly enhanced DR4 palmitoylation and translocation into lipid rafts. Raft perturbation via nystatin and resveratrol significantly altered DR4/raft colocalization and TRAIL sensitivity. Blood samples from metastatic CRC patients were treated with TRAIL liposomes, and a 57% reduction of viable circulating tumor cells (CTCs) was observed. Increased DR4/lipid raft colocalization in CTCs was found to correspond with increased oxaliplatin resistance and increased efficacy of TRAIL liposomes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the role of lipid rafts in primary CTCs.

                Conditional expression of genes and observation of phenotype remain central to biological discovery. Current methods enable either on/off or imprecisely controlled graded gene expression. We developed a 'well-tempered' controller, WTC846, for precisely adjustable, graded, growth condition independent expression of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Controlled genes are expressed from a strong semisynthetic promoter repressed by the prokaryotic TetR, which also represses its own synthesis; with basal expression abolished by a second, 'zeroing' repressor. The autorepression loop lowers cell-to-cell variation while enabling precise adjustment of protein expression by a chemical inducer. WTC846 allelic strains in which the controller replaced the native promoters recapitulated known null phenotypes (CDC42, TPI1), exhibited novel overexpression phenotypes (IPL1), showed protein dosage-dependent growth rates and morphological phenotypes (CDC28, TOR2, PMA1 and the hitherto uncharacterized PBR1), and enabled cell cycle synchronization (CDC20). WTC846 defines an 'expression clamp' allowing protein dosage to be adjusted by the experimenter across the range of cellular protein abundances, with limited variation around the setpoint.

                The evolution of influenza viruses is fundamentally shaped by within-host processes. However, the within-host evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses remain incompletely understood, in part because most studies have focused on infections in healthy adults based on single timepoint data. Here, we analysed the within-host evolution of 82 longitudinally-sampled individuals, mostly young children, infected with A/H1N1pdm09 or A/H3N2 viruses between 2007 and 2009. For A/H1N1pdm09 infections during the 2009 pandemic, nonsynonymous minority variants were more prevalent than synonymous ones. For A/H3N2 viruses in young children, early infection was dominated by purifying selection. As these infections progressed, nonsynonymous variants typically increased in frequency even when within-host virus titres decreased. Unlike the short-lived infections of adults where <i>de novo </i>within-host variants are rare, longer infections in young children allow for the maintenance of virus diversity via mutation-selection balance creating potentially important opportunities for within-host virus evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Physiological and motion signatures in static and time-varying functional connectivity and their subject identifiability</a></h4>

              
                Human brain connectivity yields significant potential as a noninvasive biomarker. Several studies have used fMRI-based connectivity fingerprinting to characterize individual patterns of brain activity. However, it is not clear whether these patterns mainly reflect neural activity or the effect of physiological and motion processes. To answer this question, we capitalize on a large data sample from the Human Connectome Project and rigorously investigate the contribution of the aforementioned processes on functional connectivity (FC) and time-varying FC, as well as their contribution to subject identifiability. We find that head motion, as well as heart rate and breathing fluctuations, induce artifactual connectivity within distinct resting-state networks and that they correlate with recurrent patterns in time-varying FC. Even though the spatiotemporal signatures of these processes yield above-chance levels in subject identifiability, removing their effects at the preprocessing stage improves identifiability, suggesting a neural component underpinning the inter-individual differences in connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selective dephosphorylation by PP2A-B55 directs the meiosis I - meiosis II transition in oocytes</a></h4>

              
                Meiosis is a specialized cell cycle that requires sequential changes to the cell division machinery to facilitate changing functions. To define the mechanisms that enable the oocyte-to-embryo transition, we performed time-course proteomics in synchronized sea star oocytes from prophase I through the first embryonic cleavage. Although we find that protein levels are broadly stable, our analysis reveals that dynamic waves of phosphorylation underlie each meiotic stage. We find that the phosphatase PP2A-B55 is reactivated at the meiosis I/II transition resulting in the preferential dephosphorylation of threonine residues. Selective dephosphorylation is critical for directing the MI / MII transition as altering PP2A-B55 substrate preferences disrupts key cell cycle events after meiosis I. In addition, threonine to serine substitution of a conserved phosphorylation site in the substrate INCENP prevents its relocalization at anaphase I. Thus, through its inherent phospho-threonine preference, PP2A-B55 imposes specific phosphoregulated behaviors that distinguish the two meiotic divisions.

                An important goal for vision science is to develop quantitative models of the representation of visual signals at post-receptoral sites. To this end, we develop the quadratic color model (QCM) and examine its ability to account for the BOLD fMRI response in human V1 to spatially-uniform, temporal chromatic modulations that systematically vary in chromatic direction and contrast. We find that the QCM explains the same, cross-validated variance as a conventional general linear model, with far fewer free parameters. The QCM generalizes to allow prediction of V1 responses to a large range of modulations. We replicate the results for each subject and find good agreement across both replications and subjects. We find that within the LM cone contrast plane, V1 is most sensitive to L-M contrast modulations and least sensitive to L+M contrast modulations. Within V1, we observe little to no change in chromatic sensitivity as a function of eccentricity.

                Human vision has striking radial asymmetries, with performance on many tasks varying sharply with stimulus polar angle. Performance is generally better on the horizontal than vertical meridian, and on the lower than upper vertical meridian, and these asymmetries decrease gradually with deviation from the vertical meridian. Here we report cortical magnification at a fine angular resolution around the visual field. This precision enables comparisons between cortical magnification and behavior, between cortical magnification and retinal cell densities, and between cortical magnification in twin pairs. We show that cortical magnification in human primary visual cortex, measured in 163 subjects, varies substantially around the visual field, with a pattern similar to behavior. These radial asymmetries in cortex are larger than those found in the retina, and they are correlated between monozygotic twin pairs. These findings indicate a tight link between cortical topography and behavior, and suggest that visual field asymmetries are partly heritable.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endomembrane targeting of human OAS1 p46 augments antiviral activity</a></h4>

              
                Many host RNA sensors are positioned in the cytosol to detect viral RNA during infection. However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from cellular innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the <i>OAS1</i> splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform correlates with protection from severe COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests that early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1-p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.

                Epoxide hydrolases (EHs) regulate cellular homeostasis through hydrolysis of epoxides to less-reactive diols. The first discovered EH was EPHX1, also known as mEH. EH functions remain partly unknown, and no pathogenic variants have been reported in humans. We identified two de novo variants located in EPHX1 catalytic site in patients with a lipoatrophic diabetes characterized by loss of adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and multiple organ dysfunction. Functional analyses revealed that these variants led to the protein aggregation within the endoplasmic reticulum and to a loss of its hydrolysis activity. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated <i>EPHX1</i> knockout (KO) abolished adipocyte differentiation and decreased insulin response. This KO also promoted oxidative stress and cellular senescence, an observation confirmed in patient-derived fibroblasts. Metreleptin therapy had a beneficial effect in one patient. This translational study highlights the importance of epoxide regulation for adipocyte function and provides new insights into the physiological roles of EHs in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CLAMP and Zelda function together to promote Drosophila zygotic genome activation</a></h4>

              
                During the essential and conserved process of zygotic genome activation (ZGA), chromatin accessibility must increase to promote transcription. <i>Drosophila</i> is a well-established model for defining mechanisms that drive ZGA. Zelda (ZLD) is a key pioneer transcription factor (TF) that promotes ZGA in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. However, many genomic loci that contain GA-rich motifs become accessible during ZGA independent of ZLD. Therefore, we hypothesized that other early TFs that function with ZLD have not yet been identified, especially those that are capable of binding to GA-rich motifs such as CLAMP. Here, we demonstrate that <i>Drosophila </i>embryonic development requires maternal CLAMP to: 1) activate zygotic transcription; 2) increase chromatin accessibility at promoters of specific genes that often encode other essential TFs; 3) enhance chromatin accessibility and facilitate ZLD occupancy at a subset of key embryonic promoters. Thus, CLAMP functions as a pioneer factor which plays a targeted yet essential role in ZGA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Instability in NAD+ metabolism leads to impaired cardiac mitochondrial function and communication</a></h4>

              
                Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes initiate (mt)DNA repair mechanisms and use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) as energy source. Prolonged PARP activity can drain cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> reserves, leading to de-regulation of important molecular processes. Here, we provide evidence of a pathophysiological mechanism that connects mtDNA damage to cardiac dysfunction via reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and loss of mitochondrial function and communication. Using a transgenic model, we demonstrate that high levels of mice cardiomyocyte mtDNA damage cause a reduction in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels due to extreme DNA repair activity, causing impaired activation of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent SIRT3. In addition, we show that myocardial mtDNA damage in combination with high dosages of nicotinamideriboside (NR) causes an inhibition of sirtuin activity due to accumulation of nicotinamide (NAM), in addition to irregular cardiac mitochondrial morphology. Consequently, high doses of NR should be used with caution, especially when cardiomyopathic symptoms are caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and instability of mtDNA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex in reward valuation and future thinking during intertemporal choice</a></h4>

              
                Intertemporal choices require trade-offs between short-term and long-term outcomes. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) damage causes steep discounting of future rewards (delay discounting [DD]) and impoverished episodic future thinking (EFT). The role of vmPFC in reward valuation, EFT, and their interaction during intertemporal choice is still unclear. Here, 12 patients with lesions to vmPFC and 41 healthy controls chose between smaller-immediate and larger-delayed hypothetical monetary rewards while we manipulated reward magnitude and the availability of EFT cues. In the EFT condition, participants imagined personal events to occur at the delays associated with the larger-delayed rewards. We found that DD was steeper in vmPFC patients compared to controls, and not modulated by reward magnitude. However, EFT cues downregulated DD in vmPFC patients as well as controls. These findings indicate that vmPFC integrity is critical for the valuation of (future) rewards, but not to instill EFT in intertemporal choice.

                Background: Functional [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-fPET) is a new approach for measuring glucose uptake in the human brain. The goal of FDG-fPET is to maintain a constant plasma supply of radioactive FDG in order to track, with high temporal resolution, the dynamic uptake of glucose during neuronal activity that occurs in response to a task or at rest. FDG-fPET has most often been applied in simultaneous BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET (blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI fluorodeoxyglucose functional positron emission tomography) imaging. BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET provides the capability to image the two primary sources of energetic dynamics in the brain, the cerebrovascular haemodynamic response and cerebral glucose uptake. Findings: In this Data Note, we describe an open access dataset, Monash DaCRA fPET-fMRI, which contrasts three radiotracer administration protocols for FDG-fPET: bolus, constant infusion, and hybrid bolus/infusion. Participants (n=5 in each group) were randomly assigned to each radiotracer administration protocol and underwent simultaneous BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET scanning while viewing a flickering checkerboard. The Bolus group received the full FDG dose in a standard bolus administration; the Infusion group received the full FDG dose as a slow infusion over the duration of the scan, and the Bolus-Infusion group received 50% of the FDG dose as bolus and 50% as constant infusion. We validate the dataset by contrasting plasma radioactivity, grey matter mean uptake, and task-related activity in the visual cortex. Conclusions: The Monash DaCRA fPET-fMRI dataset provides significant re-use value for researchers interested in the comparison of signal dynamics in fPET, and its relationship with fMRI task-evoked activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating the Contribution of White Matter Hyperintensities and Cortical Thickness to Empathy in Neurodegenerative and Cerebrovascular Diseases</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Change in empathy is an increasingly recognised symptom of neurodegenerative diseases and contributes to caregiver burden and patient distress. Empathy impairment has been associated with brain atrophy but its relationship to white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the relationships amongst WMH, brain atrophy, and empathy deficits in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Methods: 513 participants with Alzheimers Disease/Mild Cognitive Impairment, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Parkinsons Disease, or Cerebrovascular Disease (CVD) were included. Empathy was assessed using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. WMH were measured using a semi-automatic segmentation and FreeSurfer was used to measure cortical thickness. Results: A heterogeneous pattern of cortical thinning was found between groups, with FTD showing thinning in frontotemporal regions and CVD in left superior parietal, left insula, and left postcentral. Results from both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that several variables were associated with empathy, particularly cortical thickness in the fronto-insulo-temporal and cingulate regions, sex(female), global cognition, and right parietal and occipital WMH. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cortical atrophy and WMH may be associated with empathy deficits in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Future work should consider investigating the longitudinal effects of WMH and atrophy on empathy deficits in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Membrane channel hypothesis of lysosomal permeabilization by beta-amyloid</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia affecting millions of people. Neuronal death in AD is initiated by oligomeric amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides. Recently, we proposed the amyloid degradation toxicity hypothesis, which explains multiple major observations associated with AD - such as autophagy failure and a decreased metabolism. According to the hypothesis, the key event in the cellular toxicity of amyloid is the formation of non-selective membrane channels in lysosomal membranes by amyloid fragments that are produced by the digestion of A{beta} previously absorbed by endocytosis. Electrophysiological data suggest that amyloid-formed channels have different sizes, which can be explained by the fact that barrel-shaped amyloid aggregates which create channels can consist of different number of monomers. To estimate the ability of channels to leak molecules of various molecular weights, we modeled the channels as saline-filled cylinders in non-conductive membranes that pass spheres with a density of average globular proteins. As a basis, we used the conductance distribution taken from the previously published experimental dataset, in which single channels with a conductance reaching one nanosiemens were registered. Our calculations show that channels with a giant conductance can allow for passing macromolecules such as lysosomal cathepsins implicated in the activation of apoptosis. The formation of giant channels is disproportionally promoted in an acidic environment. Also, amyloid fragments leaking from permeabilized lysosomes can reach the internal leaflet of the plasma membrane and permeabilize it. We conclude that while dissipation of the proton gradient by any - even the smallest amyloid channel - readily explains lysosomal failure, the relatively rare events of lysosomal permeabilization to large macromolecules can be an alternative mechanism of cellular death induced by exposure to A{beta}.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Photorealistic reconstruction of visual texture from EEG signals</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in brain decoding have made it possible to classify image categories based on neural activity. Increasing numbers of studies have further attempted to reconstruct the image itself. However, because images of objects and scenes inherently involve spatial layout information, the reconstruction usually requires retinotopically organized neural data with high spatial resolution, such as fMRI signals. In contrast, spatial layout does not matter in the perception of 'texture', which is known to be represented as spatially global image statistics in the visual cortex. This property of 'texture' enables us to reconstruct the perceived image from EEG signals, which have a low spatial resolution. Here, we propose an MVAE-based approach for reconstructing texture images from visual evoked potentials measured from observers viewing natural textures such as the textures of various surfaces and object ensembles. This approach allowed us to reconstruct images that perceptually resemble the original textures with a photographic appearance. A subsequent analysis of the dynamic development of the internal texture representation in the VGG network showed that the reproductivity of texture rapidly improves at 200 ms latency in the lower layers but improves more gradually in the higher layers. The present approach can be used as a method for decoding the highly detailed 'impression' of sensory stimuli from brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Eelbrain: A Python toolkit for time-continuous analysis with temporal response functions</a></h4>

              
                Even though human experience unfolds continuously in time, it is not strictly linear; instead, it entails cascading processes building hierarchical cognitive structures. For instance, during speech perception, humans transform a continuously varying acoustic signal into phonemes, words, and meaning, and these levels all have different, interdependent temporal structures. Deconvolution analysis has recently emerged as a promising tool for disentangling electrophysiological brain responses related to such complex models of perception. Here we introduce the Eelbrain Python toolkit, which makes this kind of analysis easy and accessible. We demonstrate its use, using continuous speech as a sample paradigm, with a freely available EEG dataset of audiobook listening. A companion GitHub repository provides the complete source code for the analysis, from raw data to group level statistics. More generally, we advocate a hypothesis-driven approach in which the experimenter specifies a hierarchy of time-continuous representations that are hypothesized to have contributed to brain responses, and uses those as predictor variables for the electrophysiological signal. This is analogous to a multiple regression problem, but with the addition of the time dimension. The deconvolution analysis decomposes the brain signal into distinct responses associated with the different predictor variables by estimating a multivariate temporal response function (mTRF), quantifying the influence of each predictor on brain responses as a function of time(-lags). This allows asking two questions about the predictor variables: 1) Is there a significant neural representation corresponding to this predictor variable? And if so, 2) what are the temporal characteristics of the neural response associated with it? Thus, different predictor variables can be systematically combined and evaluated to jointly model neural processing at multiple hierarchical levels. We discuss applications of this approach, including the potential for linking algorithmic/representational theories at different cognitive levels to brain responses through appropriate linking models.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Enhanced cerebellar oscillations have recently been identified in essential tremor (ET) patients as a key pathophysiological change. Since ET is considered a heterogeneous group of diseases, we investigated whether cerebellar oscillations differ in ET subtypes (familial vs. sporadic). This study aims to determine cerebellar physiology in familial and sporadic ET. Using surface electroencephalogram, we studied cerebellar physiology in 40 ET cases (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 22 familial and <em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 18 sporadic) and 20 age-matched controls. Both familial and sporadic ET cases had an increase in the intensity of cerebellar oscillations when compared to controls. Interestingly, cerebellar oscillations correlated with tremor severity in familial ET but not in sporadic ET. Our study demonstrated that ET cases have enhanced cerebellar oscillations, and the different relationships between cerebellar oscillations and tremor severity in familial and sporadic ET suggest diverse cerebellar pathophysiology.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Dendrites shape inputs and integration of depolarization that controls neuronal activity in the nervous system. Neuron pathologies can damage dendrite architecture and cause abnormalities in morphologies after injury. Dendrite regeneration can be quantified by various parameters, including total dendrite length and number of dendrite branches using manual or automated image analysis approaches. However, manual quantification is tedious and time consuming and automated approaches are often trained using wildtype neurons, making them poorly suited for analysis of genetically manipulated or injured dendrite arbors. In this study, we tested how well automated image analysis software performed on class IV <em class="a-plus-plus">Drosophila</em> neurons, which have several hundred individual dendrite branches. We applied each software to automatically quantify features of uninjured neurons and neurons that regenerated new dendrites after injury. Regenerated arbors exhibit defects across multiple features of dendrite morphology, which makes them challenging for automated pipelines to analyze. We compared the performances of three automated pipelines against manual quantification using Simple Neurite Tracer in ImageJ: one that is commercially available (Imaris) and two developed by independent research groups (DeTerm and Tireless Tracing Genie). Out of the three software tested, we determined that Imaris is the most efficient at reconstructing dendrite architecture, but does not accurately measure total dendrite length even after intensive manual editing. Imaris outperforms both DeTerm and Tireless Tracing Genie for counting dendrite branches, and is better able to recreate previous conclusions from this same dataset. This thorough comparison of strengths and weaknesses of each software demonstrates their utility for analyzing regenerated neuron phenotypes in future studies.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Adult brainstem gliomas (BSGs) are rare central nervous system tumours characterized by a highly heterogeneous clinical course. Median survival times range from 11 to 84 months. Beyond surgery, no treatment standard has been established. We investigated clinical and radiological data to assess prognostic features providing support for treatment decisions.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">34 BSG patients treated between 2000 and 2019 and aged ≥ 18 years at the time of diagnosis were retrospectively identified from the databases of the two largest Austrian Neuro-Oncology centres. Clinical data including baseline characteristics, clinical disease course, applied therapies, the outcome as well as neuroradiological and neuropathological findings were gathered and analysed. The tumour apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), volumetry of contrast-enhancing and non-contrast-enhancing lesions were determined on magnetic resonance imaging scans performed at diagnosis.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The median age at diagnosis was 38.5 years (range 18–71 years). Tumour progression occurred in 26/34 (76.5%) patients after a median follow up time of 19 months (range 0.9–236.2). Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 24.1 months (range 0.9–236.2; 95% CI 18.1–30.1) and 14.5 months (range 0.7–178.5; 95% CI 5.1–23.9), respectively. Low-performance status, high body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis and WHO grading were associated with shorter PFS and OS at univariate analysis (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05, log rank test, respectively). ADC values below the median were significantly associated with shorter OS (14.9 vs 44.2 months, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.018).</p>

	<p>There are two well-known hypotheses regarding hemispheric lateralization of emotions. The Right Hemisphere Hypothesis (RHH) postulates that emotions and associated display behaviors are a dominant and lateralized function of the right hemisphere. The Valence Hypothesis (VH) posits that negative emotions and related display behaviors are modulated by the right hemisphere and positive emotions and related display behaviors are modulated by the left hemisphere. Although both the RHH and VH are supported by extensive research data, they are mutually exclusive, suggesting that there may be a missing factor in play that may provide a more accurate description of how emotions are lateralization in the brain. Evidence will be presented that provides a much broader perspective of emotions by embracing the concept that emotions can be classified into primary and social types and that hemispheric lateralization is better explained by the Emotion-type Hypothesis (ETH). The ETH posits that primary emotions and related display behaviors are modulated by the right hemisphere and social emotions and related display behaviors are modulated by the left hemisphere.</p>

	<p>Aging coincides with a decline in map learning ability, but it is unclear to what extent different aspects of the mental representation are susceptible. The present study aimed to investigate knowledge about landmarks, their positions and distances (categorical and distance relations, respectively) in relation to aging as well as cognitive functioning (measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), visuospatial abilities, and self-reported wayfinding inclinations. Thirty young adults and 60 older adults (30 aged 63–74 and 30 aged 75–86) learned a map, freely recalled the landmarks and performed a map drawing task (considering the number of landmarks missing, position accuracy and distance accuracy). Before that, older participants were also assessed regarding their general cognitive functioning (MoCA) and a series of visuospatial measures. The results show age-related differences among adults in recalling landmarks and in both categorical and distance relations, with a worsening of performance of old-olds only in the former. Older adults’ MoCA score related to accuracy in the three measures, and an additional role of spatial anxiety was found for distance accuracy. Above and beyond the age-related decline, the quality of older people’s spatial mental representation is related to higher general cognitive level and lower spatial anxiety.</p>

	<p>Virtual reality (VR)-based therapies are widely used in stroke rehabilitation. Although various studies have used VR techniques for bilateral upper limb training, most have been only semi-immersive and have only been performed in an artificial environment. This study developed VR content and protocols based on activities of daily living to provide immersive VR-based bilateral arm training (VRBAT) for upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients. Twelve patients with chronic stroke were randomized to a VRBAT group or a normal bilateral arm training (NBAT) group and attended 30-min training sessions five times a week for four weeks. At the end of the training, there was a significant difference in upper limb function in both groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and in the upper limb function sensory test for proprioception in the NBAT group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). There was no significant between-group difference in upper limb muscle activity after training. The relative alpha and beta power values for electroencephalographic measurements were significantly improved in both groups. These findings indicate that both VRBAT and NBAT are effective interventions for improving upper limb function and electroencephalographic activity in patients with chronic stroke.</p>

	<p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the target of a variety of immune-mediated disorders, usually classified as presynaptic and postsynaptic, according to the site of the antigenic target and consequently of the neuromuscular transmission alteration. Although less common than the classical autoimmune postsynaptic myasthenia gravis, presynaptic disorders are important to recognize due to the frequent association with cancer. Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome is due to a presynaptic failure to release acetylcholine, caused by antibodies to the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. Acquired neuromyotonia is a condition characterized by nerve hyperexcitability often due to the presence of antibodies against proteins associated with voltage-gated potassium channels. This review will focus on the recent developments in the autoimmune presynaptic disorders of the NMJ.</p>

                Background: Delayed cerebral ischemia and cerebral vasospasm remain the leading causes of poor outcome in survivors of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Refractory cerebral vasospasms can be treated with endovascular vasodilator therapy, which can either be performed in conscious sedation or general anesthesia. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of the anesthesia modality on long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular vasodilator therapy due to cerebral vasospasm and hypoperfusion. Methods: Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were retrospectively analyzed at time of discharge from the hospital and six months after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was assessed 24 hours before, immediately before, immediately after, and 24 hours after endovascular vasodilator therapy, and at discharge and six months. Interventional parameters such as duration of intervention, choice and dosage of vasodilator and number of arteries treated were also recorded. Results: A total of 98 patients were included in this analysis and separated into patients who had interventions in conscious sedation, general anesthesia and a mix of both. Neither mRS at discharge nor at six months showed a significant difference for functionally independent outcomes (mRS 0-2) between groups. NIHSS before endovascular vasodilator therapy was significantly higher in patients receiving interventions in general anesthesia but did not differ anymore between groups six months after the initial bleed. Conclusion: This study did not observe a difference in outcome whether patients underwent endovascular vasodilator therapy in general anesthesia or conscious sedation for refractory cerebral vasospasms. Hence, the choice should be made for each patient individually.

                Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung is an uncommon subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Even in the early stages, pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) has a dismal prognosis when compared to other kinds of NSCLC with a mean survival of 9–12 months and a five-year survival rate of around 20%. We present the case of a 68-year-old woman with a two-month history of shortness of breath and cough. Initial computed tomography (CT) scan showed features of interstitial lung disease with chronic obstructive airway changes. After 34 months, the patient’s condition worsened with newer complaints of sore throat and hemoptysis. A repeat CT scan showed a ∼49x38x59mm size lesion in the superior segment of the left lower lobe. A core needle biopsy was performed, which revealed tumor cells consisting of irregular tubules and sarcomatoid components. The patient was started on chemotherapy. Unfortunately, she succumbed to her disease. Our case highlights the aggressiveness of PSC.

                Reports of non-replicable research demand new methods of research data management. Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are suggested as tools to improve the documentation of research data and make them universally accessible. In a self-guided approach, we introduced the open-source ELN eLabFTW into our life-science lab group and, after using it for a while, think it is a useful tool to overcome hurdles in ELN introduction by providing a combination of properties making it suitable for small life-science labs, like ours. We set up our instance of eLabFTW, without any further programming needed. Our efforts to embrace open data approach by introducing an ELN fits well with other institutional organized ELN initiatives in academic research and our goals towards data quality management.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model checking via testing for direct effects in Mendelian Randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yangqing Deng, Wei Pan</p>

It is of great interest and potential to discover causal relationships between pairs of exposures and outcomes using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to deal with hidden confounding in observational studies. Two most popular approaches are Mendelian randomization (MR), which usually use independent genetic variants/SNPs across the genome, and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) (or their generalizations) using cis-SNPs local to a gene (or some genome-wide and likely dependent SNPs), as IVs. In spite of their many promising applications, both approaches face a major challenge: the validity of their causal conclusions depends on three critical assumptions on valid IVs, and more generally on other modeling assumptions, which however may not hold in practice. The most likely as well as challenging situation is due to the wide-spread horizontal pleiotropy, leading to two of the three IV assumptions being violated and thus to biased statistical inference. More generally, we’d like to conduct a goodness-of-fit (GOF) test to check the model being used. Although some methods have been proposed as being robust to various degrees to the violation of some modeling assumptions, they often give different and even conflicting results due to their own modeling assumptions and possibly lower statistical efficiency, imposing difficulties to the practitioner in choosing and interpreting varying results across different methods. Hence, it would help to directly test whether any assumption is violated or not. In particular, there is a lack of such tests for TWAS. We propose a new and general GOF test, called TEDE (TEsting Direct Effects), applicable to both correlated and independent SNPs/IVs (as commonly used in TWAS and MR respectively). Through simulation studies and real data examples, we demonstrate high statistical power and advantages of our new method, while confirming the frequent violation of modeling (including valid IV) assumptions in practice and thus the importance of model checking by applying such a test in MR/TWAS analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical framework for place coding in the auditory system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex D. Reyes</p>

In the auditory system, tonotopy is postulated to be the substrate for a place code, where sound frequency is encoded by the location of the neurons that fire during the stimulus. Though conceptually simple, the computations that allow for the representation of intensity and complex sounds are poorly understood. Here, a mathematical framework is developed in order to define clearly the conditions that support a place code. To accommodate both frequency and intensity information, the neural network is described as a space with elements that represent individual neurons and clusters of neurons. A mapping is then constructed from acoustic space to neural space so that frequency and intensity are encoded, respectively, by the location and size of the clusters. Algebraic operations -addition and multiplication- are derived to elucidate the rules for representing, assembling, and modulating multi-frequency sound in networks. The resulting outcomes of these operations are consistent with network simulations as well as with electrophysiological and psychophysical data. The analyses show how both frequency and intensity can be encoded with a purely place code, without the need for rate or temporal coding schemes. The algebraic operations are used to describe loudness summation and suggest a mechanism for the critical band. The mathematical approach complements experimental and computational approaches and provides a foundation for interpreting data and constructing models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Topology-preserving smoothing of retinotopic maps</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yanshuai Tu, Duyan Ta, Zhong-Lin Lu, Yalin Wang</p>

Retinotopic mapping, i.e., the mapping between visual inputs on the retina and neuronal activations in cortical visual areas, is one of the central topics in visual neuroscience. For human observers, the mapping is obtained by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals of cortical responses to slowly moving visual stimuli on the retina. Although it is well known from neurophysiology that the mapping is topological (i.e., the topology of neighborhood connectivity is preserved) within each visual area, retinotopic maps derived from the state-of-the-art methods are often not topological because of the low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution of fMRI. The violation of topological condition is most severe in cortical regions corresponding to the neighborhood of the fovea (e.g., < 1 degree eccentricity in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset), significantly impeding accurate analysis of retinotopic maps. This study aims to directly model the topological condition and generate topology-preserving and smooth retinotopic maps. Specifically, we adopted the Beltrami coefficient, a metric of quasiconformal mapping, to define the topological condition, developed a mathematical model to quantify topological smoothing as a constrained optimization problem, and elaborated an efficient numerical method to solve the problem. The method was then applied to V1, V2, and V3 simultaneously in the HCP dataset. Experiments with both simulated and real retinotopy data demonstrated that the proposed method could generate topological and smooth retinotopic maps.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-throughput Interpretation of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor Short-read Sequencing Data with PING</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wesley M. Marin, Ravi Dandekar, Danillo G. Augusto, Tasneem Yusufali, Bianca Heyn, Jan Hofmann, Vinzenz Lange, Jürgen Sauter, Paul J. Norman, Jill A. Hollenbach</p>

The <i>killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor</i> (<i>KIR)</i> complex on chromosome 19 encodes receptors that modulate the activity of natural killer cells, and variation in these genes has been linked to infectious and autoimmune disease, as well as having bearing on pregnancy and transplant outcomes. The medical relevance and high variability of <i>KIR</i> genes makes short-read sequencing an attractive technology for interrogating the region, providing a high-throughput, high-fidelity sequencing method that is cost-effective. However, because this gene complex is characterized by extensive nucleotide polymorphism, structural variation including gene fusions and deletions, and a high level of homology between genes, its interrogation at high resolution has been thwarted by bioinformatic challenges, with most studies limited to examining presence or absence of specific genes. Here, we present the PING (Pushing Immunogenetics to the Next Generation) pipeline, which incorporates empirical data, novel alignment strategies and a custom alignment processing workflow to enable high-throughput <i>KIR</i> sequence analysis from short-read data. PING provides <i>KIR</i> gene copy number classification functionality for all <i>KIR</i> genes through use of a comprehensive alignment reference. The gene copy number determined per individual enables an innovative genotype determination workflow using genotype-matched references. Together, these methods address the challenges imposed by the structural complexity and overall homology of the <i>KIR</i> complex. To determine copy number and genotype determination accuracy, we applied PING to European and African validation cohorts and a synthetic dataset. PING demonstrated exceptional copy number determination performance across all datasets and robust genotype determination performance. Finally, an investigation into discordant genotypes for the synthetic dataset provides insight into misaligned reads, advancing our understanding in interpretation of short-read sequencing data in complex genomic regions. PING promises to support a new era of studies of KIR polymorphism, delivering high-resolution <i>KIR</i> genotypes that are highly accurate, enabling high-quality, high-throughput <i>KIR</i> genotyping for disease and population studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Circadian rhythm shows potential for mRNA efficiency and self-organized division of labor in multinucleate cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leif Zinn-Brooks, Marcus L. Roper</p>

Multinucleate cells occur in every biosphere and across the kingdoms of life, including in the human body as muscle cells and bone-forming cells. Data from filamentous fungi suggest that, even when bathed in a common cytoplasm, nuclei are capable of autonomous behaviors, including division. How does this potential for autonomy affect the organization of cellular processes between nuclei? Here we analyze a simplified model of circadian rhythm, a form of cellular oscillator, in a mathematical model of the filamentous fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>. Our results highlight a potential role played by mRNA-protein phase separation to keep mRNAs close to the nuclei from which they originate, while allowing proteins to diffuse freely between nuclei. Our modeling shows that syncytism allows for extreme mRNA efficiency—we demonstrate assembly of a robust oscillator with a transcription rate a thousand-fold less than in comparable uninucleate cells. We also show self-organized division of the labor of mRNA production, with one nucleus in a two-nucleus syncytium producing at least twice as many mRNAs as the other in 30% of cycles. This division can occur spontaneously, but division of labor can also be controlled by regulating the amount of cytoplasmic volume available to each nucleus. Taken together, our results show the intriguing richness and potential for emergent organization among nuclei in multinucleate cells. They also highlight the role of previously studied mechanisms of cellular organization, including nuclear space control and localization of mRNAs through RNA-protein phase separation, in regulating nuclear coordination.

                Introduction: COVID-19 can be worsened by hyper-production of cytokines accompanied by increased level of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between a set of cytokines and the markers of the oxidative stress. Methods: The levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL8, IL-10, VEGF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1α, MCP-1 and EGF were determined by using High Sensitivity Evidence Investigator™ Biochip Array technology. The oxidative stress parameters (d-ROM, PAT, OS index) were measured in serum on FRAS5 analytical photometric system. Results: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, MCP-1 and EGF were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the patients with severe COVID-19 with increased levels of IL-2, IFN-g, TNF-a and IL-1α. The d-ROM, OS index, and PAT were significantly higher (p<0.05) in severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 demonstrated the strongest correlation with all of the markers of the oxidative stress, d-ROM (r=0.9725, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.5000, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.9593, p=0.012). Similar behavior was evidenced between IFN-g and d-ROM (r=0.4006, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.6030, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.4298, p=0.012). Conclusion: The oxidative stress markers show good correlation with the tested cytokines which can be measured at the beginning of the disease in a primary care setting to predict the course of COVID-19.

                Background: Sea grapes or  Caulerpa racemosa have a lot of phytochemical content, especially unsaturated fatty acids that are beneficial for health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sea grapes extract on blood glucose levels, total cholesterol-, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1α in male Wistar rats, which were given per-oral (p.o.) cholesterol- and carbohydrates fat-enriched diets (CFED). Methods: Forty male Wistar albino rats weighing between 200 – 250 g were used for this study. Animals were randomly distributed into four groups of ten animals each. Group A served as control (received standard dry pellet diet). Rats in group B were fed on CFED for 4 weeks.  Groups C and D were fed on CFED and were administered 150 and 450 mg/kg of  sea grapes extract (p.o.), respectively. Results: Group C rats indicated a blood glucose reduction and an increase in PGC-1α serum, in comparison to group D (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between group C and D in blood cholesterol reduction (high dose of the extract did not have significant effects) (p=0.222), and both groups had the same effect in lowering total cholesterol in rats. Conclusion: Sea grapes extract is proven to improve blood glucose, total cholesterol, and PGC-1α levels in rats fed with CFED.

     alt="The complex synaptic pathways onto a looming-detector neuron revealed using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM)"/>
<p>We traced two trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons, in separate larval locusts from their synpases with the LGMD1 in the lobula complex (LOX) through the 2<sup>nd</sup> optic chiasm (OCH2) back into the medulla. In the medulla we found not only downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron but also a feedback loop with TmA neurons making outputs and receiving inputs.


</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of locusts to detect looming stimuli and avoid collisions or predators depends on a neuronal circuit in the locust's optic lobe. Although comprehensively studied for over three decades there are still major questions about the computational steps of this circuit. We used 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae of Locusta migratoria to describe the connection between the lobula giant movement detector 1 (LGMD1) neuron in the lobula complex and the upstream neuropil, the medulla. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the connecting neurons termed trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons and their synaptic connectivity. This enabled us to trace neurons over several hundred micrometers between the medulla and the lobula complex while identifying their synapses. We traced two different TmA neurons, each from a different individual, from their synapses with the LGMD in the lobula complex up into the medulla and describe their synaptic relationships. There is not a simple downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron onto these TmA neurons; there is also a feedback loop in place with TmA neurons making outputs as well as receiving inputs. More than one type of neuron shapes the signal of the TmA neurons in the medulla. We found both columnar and trans-columnar neurons connected with the traced TmA neurons in the medulla. These findings indicate that there are computational steps in the medulla that have not been included in models of the neuronal pathway for looming detection.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic distribution and inferior colliculus projection pattern of inhibitory and excitatory cell types in the lateral superior olive of Mongolian gerbils"/>
<p>In situ hybridization was used to identify inhibitory and excitatory principal neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) of Mongolian gerbil. Inhibitory LSO neurons were less numerous and projected contralaterally. One third of excitatory neurons projected ipsilaterally and were biased to the low-frequency limb of the LSO. This projection appears species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sound localization critically relies on brainstem neurons that compare information from the two ears. The conventional role of the lateral superior olive (LSO) is extraction of intensity differences; however, it is increasingly clear that relative timing, especially of transients, is also an important function. Cellular diversity within the LSO that is not well understood may underlie its multiple roles. There are glycinergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory principal neurons in the LSO, however, there is some disagreement regarding their relative distribution and projection pattern. Here we employ <i>in situ</i> hybridization to definitively identify transmitter types combined with retrograde labeling of projections to the inferior colliculus (IC) to address these questions. Excitatory LSO neurons were more numerous (76%) than inhibitory ones. A smaller proportion of inhibitory neurons were IC-projecting (45% vs. 64% for excitatory) suggesting that inhibitory LSO neurons may have more projections to other regions such the lateral lemniscus or more distributed IC projections. Inhibitory LSO neurons almost exclusively projected ipsilaterally making up a sizeable proportion (41%) of the transmitter type-labeled ipsilateral IC projection from LSO and exhibited a moderate low frequency bias (10% difference H-L). Two thirds of excitatory neurons projected contralaterally and had a slight high frequency bias (4%). One third of excitatory LSO neurons projected ipsilaterally to the IC and these cells were strongly biased toward the low frequency limb of the LSO (37%). This projection appears to be species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing suggesting that this may be a specialization for such ability.</p>

     alt="A schizophrenia risk factor induces marked anatomical deficits at GABAergic-dopaminergic synapses in the rat ventral tegmental area: essential evidence for new targeted therapies"/>
<p><b>Hypothesis:</b> Synaptic changes occur within a midbrain GABA-dopamine circuit of male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor.</p>
<p><b>Outcomes:</b> In the offspring of MIA dams, markedly smaller inhibitory synapses were observed for non-triadic (classic) and newly discovered triadic synapses. These changes could contribute to well documented striatal hyperdopaminergia. The findings provide a new therapeutic target.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To develop new therapies for schizophrenia, evidence accumulated over decades highlights the essential need to investigate the GABAergic synapses that presynaptically influence midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Since current technology restricts these studies to animals, and evidence accumulated in recent decades indicates a developmental origin of schizophrenia, we investigated synaptic changes in male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. Using a novel combination of lentiviruses, peroxidase-immunogold double-labeling, three-dimensional serial section transmission electron microscopy and stereology, we observed clear anatomical alterations in synaptic inputs on dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA). These changes relate directly to a characteristic feature of schizophrenia: increased dopamine release. In 3-month-old and 14-month-old MIA rats, we found a marked decrease in the volume of presynaptic GABAergic terminals from the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), and in the length of the synapses they made, when innervating pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In MIA rats in the long-term, we also discovered a decrease in the volume of the post-synaptic density (PSD) and in the maximum thickness of the PSD at the same synapses. These marked deficits were evident in conventional GABA-dopamine synapses and in synaptic triads that we discovered involving asymmetric synapses that innervated RMTg GABAergic presynaptic terminals, which in turn innervated pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In triads, the PSD thickness of asymmetric synapses was significantly decreased in MIA rats in the long-term cohort. The extensive anatomical deficits provide a potential basis for new therapies targeted at synaptic inputs on midbrain pVTA dopaminergic neurons, in contrast to current striatum-targeted anti-psychotic drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep learning detects cardiotoxicity in a high-content screen with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                Drug-induced cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are major causes of drug attrition. To decrease late-stage drug attrition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries need to establish biologically relevant models that use phenotypic screening to detect drug-induced toxicity <i>in vitro</i>. In this study, we sought to rapidly detect patterns of cardiotoxicity using high-content image analysis with deep learning and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). We screened a library of 1280 bioactive compounds and identified those with potential cardiotoxic liabilities in iPSC-CMs using a single-parameter score based on deep learning. Compounds demonstrating cardiotoxicity in iPSC-CMs included DNA intercalators, ion channel blockers, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin-dependent kinase, and multi-kinase inhibitors. We also screened a diverse library of molecules with unknown targets and identified chemical frameworks that show cardiotoxic signal in iPSC-CMs. By using this screening approach during target discovery and lead optimization, we can de-risk early-stage drug discovery. We show that the broad applicability of combining deep learning with iPSC technology is an effective way to interrogate cellular phenotypes and identify drugs that may protect against diseased phenotypes and deleterious mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrasting effects of Western vs. Mediterranean diets on monocyte inflammatory gene expression and social behavior in a primate model</a></h4>

              
                Dietary changes associated with industrialization substantially increase the prevalence of chronic diseases, such as obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, major contributors to the public health burden. The high prevalence of these chronic diseases is often attributed to an 'evolutionary mismatch' between human physiology and modern nutritional environments. Western diets enriched with foods that were scarce throughout human evolutionary history (e.g., simple sugars and saturated fats) promote inflammation and disease relative to diets more akin to ancestral human hunter-gatherer diets, such as a Mediterranean diet. Peripheral blood monocytes, precursors to macrophages and important mediators of innate immunity and inflammation, are sensitive to the environment and may represent a critical intermediate in the pathway linking diet to disease. We evaluated the effects of 15 months of whole diet manipulations mimicking human Western or Mediterranean diet patterns on monocyte polarization using a well-established model of human health, the cynomolgus macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>). Monocyte transcriptional profiles differed markedly between the two diets, with 40% of transcripts showing differential expression (FDR &lt; 0.05). Monocytes from Western diet consumers were polarized toward a more proinflammatory phenotype. Compared to the Mediterranean diet, the Western diet shifted the co-expression of 445 gene pairs, including small RNAs and transcription factors associated with metabolism and adiposity in humans, and dramatically altered behavior. For example, Western-fed individuals were more anxious and less socially integrated compared to the Mediterranean-fed subjects. These behavioral changes were also associated with some of the effects of diet on gene expression, suggesting an interaction between diet, central nervous system activity, and monocyte gene expression. The results of this study provide new insights into evolutionary mismatch at the molecular level and uncover new pathways through which Western diets alter monocyte polarization toward a proinflammatory phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An oscillating computational model can track pseudo-rhythmic speech by using linguistic predictions</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillations putatively track speech in order to optimize sensory processing. However, it is unclear how isochronous brain oscillations can track pseudo-rhythmic speech input. Here we propose that oscillations can track pseudo-rhythmic speech when considering that speech time is dependent on content-based predictions flowing from internal language models. We show that temporal dynamics of speech are dependent on the predictability of words in a sentence. A computational model including oscillations, feedback, and inhibition is able to track pseudo-rhythmic speech input. As the model processes, it generates temporal phase codes, which are a candidate mechanism for carrying information forward in time. The model is optimally sensitive to the natural temporal speech dynamics and can explain empirical data on temporal speech illusions. Our results suggest that speech tracking does not have to rely only on the acoustics but could also exploit ongoing interactions between oscillations and constraints flowing from internal language models.

                Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires potent and low-cost therapeutics. We identified a series of single-domain antibodies (i.e., nanobody), <i>Nanosota-1</i>, from a camelid nanobody phage display library. Structural data showed that <i>Nanosota-1</i> bound to the oft-hidden receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking viral receptor ACE2. The lead drug candidate possessing an Fc tag (<i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i>) bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD ~3000 times more tightly than ACE2 did and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus ~160 times more efficiently than ACE2 did. Administered at a single dose, <i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i> demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy against live SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hamster and mouse models. Unlike conventional antibodies, <i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i> was produced at high yields in bacteria and had exceptional thermostability. Pharmacokinetic analysis of <i>Nanosota-1C-F</i>c documented an excellent <i>in vivo</i> stability and a high tissue bioavailability. As effective and inexpensive drug candidates, <i>Nanosota-1</i> may contribute to the battle against COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of splicing factor SRSF1 is required for development and cilia function</a></h4>

              
                Shuttling RNA-binding proteins coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic steps of gene expression. The SR family proteins regulate RNA splicing in the nucleus and a subset of them, including SRSF1, shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm affecting post-splicing processes. However, the physiological significance of this remains unclear. Here, we used genome editing to knock-in a nuclear retention signal (NRS) in <i>Srsf1 </i>to create a mouse model harboring an SRSF1 protein that is retained exclusively in the nucleus. <i>Srsf1<sup>NRS/NRS </sup></i>mutants displayed small body size, hydrocephalus and immotile sperm, all traits associated with ciliary defects. We observed reduced translation of a subset of mRNAs and decreased abundance of proteins involved in multiciliogenesis, with disruption of ciliary ultrastructure and motility in cells and tissues derived from this mouse model. These results demonstrate that SRSF1 shuttling is used to reprogram gene expression networks in the context of high cellular demands, as observed here, during motile ciliogenesis.

                    implications for evolutionary trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Copy number variation (CNV) through gene or chromosome amplification provides a route for rapid phenotypic variation and supports long-term evolution of gene functions. Although the evolutionary importance of CNV is known, little is understood about how genetic background influences CNV tolerance. Here, we measured fitness costs of over 4,000 over-expressed genes in 15 <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strains representing different lineages, to explore natural variation in tolerating gene overexpression (OE). Strain-specific effects dominated the fitness costs of gene OE. We report global differences in the consequences of gene OE, independent of the amplified gene, as well as gene-specific effects that were dependent on the genetic background. Natural variation in the response to gene OE could be explained by several models, including strain-specific physiological differences, resource limitations, and regulatory sensitivities. This work provides new insight on how genetic background influences tolerance to gene amplification and the evolutionary trajectories accessible to different backgrounds.

                Some remarkable animal species require an opposite-sex partner for their sexual development but discard the partner’s genome before gamete formation, generating hemi-clonal progeny in a process called hybridogenesis. Here, we discovered a similar phenomenon, termed pseudosexual reproduction, in a basidiomycete human fungal pathogen, <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, where exclusive uniparental inheritance of nuclear genetic material was observed during bisexual reproduction. Analysis of strains expressing fluorescent reporter proteins revealed instances where only one of the parental nuclei was present in the terminal sporulating basidium. Whole-genome sequencing revealed the nuclear genome of the progeny was identical with one or the other parental genome. Pseudosexual reproduction was also detected in natural isolate crosses where it resulted in mainly <i>MAT</i>a progeny, a bias observed in <i>Cryptococcus</i> ecological distribution as well. The mitochondria in these progeny were inherited from the <i>MAT</i>&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; parent, resulting in nuclear-mitochondrial genome exchange. The meiotic recombinase Dmc1 was found to be critical for pseudosexual reproduction. These findings reveal a novel, and potentially ecologically significant, mode of eukaryotic microbial reproduction that shares features with hybridogenesis in animals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interpreting wide-band neural activity using convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Rapid progress in technologies such as calcium imaging and electrophysiology has seen a dramatic increase in the size and extent of neural recordings. Even so, interpretation of this data requires considerable knowledge about the nature of the representation and often depends on manual operations. Decoding provides a means to infer the information content of such recordings but typically requires highly processed data and prior knowledge of the encoding scheme. Here, we developed a deep-learning framework able to decode sensory and behavioral variables directly from wide-band neural data. The network requires little user input and generalizes across stimuli, behaviors, brain regions, and recording techniques. Once trained, it can be analyzed to determine elements of the neural code that are informative about a given variable. We validated this approach using electrophysiological and calcium-imaging data from rodent auditory cortex and hippocampus as well as human electrocorticography (ECoG) data. We show successful decoding of finger movement, auditory stimuli, and spatial behaviors – including a novel representation of head direction - from raw neural activity.

                Histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) is mediated by six different lysine methyltransferases. Amongst these enzymes SET domain containing 1b (SETD1B) has been linked to syndromic intellectual disability but its role in the postnatal brain has not been studied yet. Here we employ mice that lack Setd1b from excitatory neurons of the postnatal forebrain and combine neuron-specific ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches to elucidate its role in neuronal gene expression. We observe that SETD1B controls the expression of genes with a broad H3K4me3 peak at their promoters that represent neuronal enriched genes linked to learning and memory function. Comparative analysis to corresponding data from conditional Kmt2a and Kmt2b knockout mice suggests that this function is specific to SETD1B. Moreover, postnatal loss of Setd1b leads to severe learning impairment, suggesting that SETD1B-mediated regulation of H3K4me levels in postnatal neurons is critical for cognitive function.

                Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), consisting of transcription factors and their target cis- regulatory sequences, control neurogenesis and cell fate specification in the developing central nervous system, but their organization is poorly characterized. In this study, we performed integrated single-cell RNA- and scATAC-seq analysis in both mouse and human retina to profile dynamic changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and transcription factor footprinting during retinal neurogenesis. We identified multiple interconnected, evolutionarily-conserved GRNs consisting of cell type-specific transcription factors that both activate expression of genes within their own network and often inhibit expression of genes in other networks. These GRNs control state transitions within primary retinal progenitors that underlie temporal patterning, regulate the transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. We confirmed the prediction of this analysis that the NFI transcription factors Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix selectively activate expression of genes that promote late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors. We also used GRNs to identify additional transcription factors that promote (Insm1/2) and inhibit (Tbx3, Tcf7l1/2) rod photoreceptor specification in postnatal retina. This study provides an inventory of cis- and trans-acting factors that control retinal development, identifies transcription factors that control the temporal identity of retinal progenitors and cell fate specification, and will potentially guide cell-based therapies aimed at replacing retinal neurons lost due to disease.

                Recent studies suggest that the Zona Incerta (ZI) plays a role in fear learning and recall. However, there is a clear gap in knowledge as to whether the ZI can encode fear evoking threats and cues that predict them. Here, we subject mice to a classical fear conditioning paradigm while recording the in-vivo calcium dynamics of ZI neurons. We observed that ZI neurons can encode not only a fear evoking stimulus, but can also learn to encode predictive cues, associate them with the unconditioned fear evoking stimulus, and discriminate them from neutral non-predictive cues. While the ZI across all mice learned to become mainly excited by fear predictive cues, only mice that did not generalize fear became largely inhibited by non-predictive cues and better discriminated the two. Together, we provide extensive evidence that the ZI differentially encode fear predictive and non-predictive cues in a generalization dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ageing-associated myelin dysfunction drives amyloid deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, shows a strict age-dependency, but why ageing constitutes the main risk factor for this disease is still poorly understood. Brain ageing affects oligodendrocytes and the structural integrity of myelin sheaths, the latter associated with secondary neuroinflammation. Since oligodendrocytes support axonal and neuronal health, we hypothesised that ageing-associated loss of myelin integrity could be an upstream risk factor for neuronal amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition, the primary neuropathological hallmark of AD. Here, we show that in AD mouse models different genetically induced defects of myelin integrity or demyelinating injuries are indeed potent drivers of amyloid deposition in vivo, quantified by whole brain light sheet microscopy. Conversely, the lack of myelin in the forebrain provides protection against plaque deposition. Mechanistically, we find that myelin dysfunction causes the accumulation of the A{beta} producing machinery within axonal swellings and increases cortical amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. Surprisingly, AD mice with dysfunctional myelin lack plaque-corralling microglia but show a disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like signature as revealed by bulk and single cell transcriptomics. These activated microglia, however, are primarily engaged with myelin, preventing the protective reactions of microglia to A{beta} plaques. Our data suggest a working model, in which age-dependent structural defects of myelin promote plaque formation, directly and indirectly, and are thus an upstream AD risk factor. Improving oligodendrocyte health and myelin integrity could be a promising target to delay AD.

                Neural circuits can produce similar activity patterns from vastly different combinations of channel and synaptic conductances. These conductances are tuned for specific activity patterns but might also reflect additional constraints, such as metabolic cost or robustness to perturbations. How do such constraints influence the range of permissible conductances? Here, we investigate how metabolic cost affects the parameters of neural circuits with similar activity in a model of the pyloric network of the crab Cancer borealis. We use a novel machine learning method to identify a range of network models that can generate activity patterns matching experimental data. We find that neural circuits can consume largely different amounts of energy despite similar circuit activity. We then study how circuit parameters get constrained by minimizing energy consumption and identify circuit parameters that might be subject to metabolic tuning. Finally, we investigate the interaction between metabolic cost and temperature robustness. We show that metabolic cost can vary across temperatures, but that robustness to temperature changes does not necessarily incur an increased metabolic cost. Our analyses show that, despite metabolic efficiency and temperature robustness constraining circuit parameters, neural systems can generate functional, efficient, and robust network activity with widely disparate sets of conductances.

Average-reward, putatively encoded by tonic dopamine, serves in existing reinforcement learning theory as the stationary opportunity cost of time. However, environmental context and the cost of deliberation therein often varies in time and is hard to infer and predict. Here, we define a non-stationary opportunity cost of deliberation arising from performance variation on multiple timescales. Estimated from reward history, this cost readily adapts to reward-relevant changes in context and suggests a generalization of average-reward reinforcement learning (AR-RL) to account for non-stationary contextual factors. We use this deliberation cost in a simple decision-making heuristic called Performance-Gated Deliberation, which approximates AR-RL and is consistent with empirical results in both cognitive and systems decision-making neuroscience. We propose that deliberation cost is implemented directly as urgency, a previously characterized neural signal effectively controlling the speed of the decision-making process. We use behaviour and neural recordings from non-human primates in a non-stationary random walk prediction task to support our results. We make readily testable predictions for both neural activity and behaviour and discuss how this proposal can facilitate future work in cognitive and systems neuroscience of reward-driven behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Privacy-preserving harmonization via distributed ComBat</a></h4>

              
                Challenges in clinical data sharing and the need to protect data privacy have led to the development and popularization of methods that do not require directly transferring patient data. In neuroimaging, integration of data across multiple institutions also introduces unwanted biases driven by scanner differences. These scanner effects have been shown by several research groups to severely affect downstream analyses. To facilitate the need of removing scanner effects in a distributed data setting, we introduce distributed ComBat, an adaptation of a popular harmonization method for multivariate data that borrows information across features. We present our fast and simple distributed algorithm and show that it yields equivalent results using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Our method enables harmonization while ensuring maximal privacy protection, thus facilitating a broad range of downstream analyses in functional and structural imaging studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetrical adaptations to increases and decreases in environmental volatility</a></h4>

              
                Humans adapt their learning strategies to changing environments by estimating the volatility of the reinforcement conditions. Here, we examine how volatility affects learning and the underlying functional brain organizations using a probabilistic reward reversal learning task. We found that the order of conditions was critically important; participants adjusted learning rate going from volatile to stable, but not from stable to volatile, environments. Subjective volatility of the environment was encoded in the striatal reward system and its dynamic connections with the prefrontal control system. Flexibility, which captures the dynamic changes of network modularity in the brain, was higher in the environmental transition from volatile to stable than from stable to volatile. These findings suggest that behavioral adaptations and dynamic brain organizations in transitions between stable and volatile environments are asymmetric, providing critical insights into the way that people learn under uncertainty.

                Treatments for amblyopia focus on vision therapy and patching of one eye. Predicting the success of these methods remains difficult, however. Recent research has used binocular rivalry to monitor visual cortical plasticity during occlusion therapy, leading to a successful prediction of the recovery rate of the amblyopic eye. The underlying mechanisms and their relation to neural homeostatic plasticity are not known. Here we propose a spiking neural network to explain the effect of shortterm monocular deprivation on binocular rivalry. The model reproduces perceptual switches as observed experimentally. When one eye is occluded, inhibitory plasticity changes the balance between the eyes and leads to longer dominance periods for the eye that has been deprived. The model suggests that homeostatic inhibitory plasticity is a critical component of the observed effects and might play an important role in the recovery from amblyopia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-Task Brain Network Reconfiguration is Inversely Associated with Human Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Intelligence describes the general cognitive ability level of a person. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in psychological science and is crucial for effective adaption of behavior to varying environmental demands. Changing external task demands have been shown to induce reconfiguration of functional brain networks. However, whether neural reconfiguration between different tasks is associated with intelligence has not yet been investigated. We used fMRI data from 812 subjects to show that higher scores of general intelligence are related to less brain network reconfiguration between resting state and seven different tasks as well as to network reconfiguration between tasks. This association holds for all functional brain networks except the motor system, and replicates in two independent samples (N = 138, N = 184). Our findings suggest that the intrinsic network architecture of individuals with higher general intelligence scores is closer to the network architecture as required by various cognitive demands. Multi-task brain network reconfiguration may, therefore, reflect the neural equivalent of the behavioral positive manifold, i.e., the essence of the concept of general intelligence. Finally, our results support neural efficiency theories of cognitive ability and reveal insights into human intelligence as an emergent property from a distributed multi-task brain network.
