              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of neural progenitor cells and their progeny reveals long distance migration in the developing octopus brain</a></h4>

              
                Cephalopods have evolved nervous systems that parallel the complexity of mammalian brains in terms of neuronal numbers and richness in behavioral output. How the cephalopod brain develops has only been described at the morphological level, and it remains unclear where the progenitor cells are located and what molecular factors drive neurogenesis. Using histological techniques, we located dividing cells, neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons in <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> embryos. Our results indicate that an important pool of progenitors, expressing the conserved bHLH transcription factors <i>achaete-scute</i> or <i>neurogenin</i>, is located outside the central brain cords in the lateral lips adjacent to the eyes, suggesting that newly formed neurons migrate into the cords. Lineage-tracing experiments then showed that progenitors, depending on their location in the lateral lips, generate neurons for the different lobes, similar to the squid <i>Doryteuthis pealeii</i>. The finding that octopus newborn neurons migrate over long distances is reminiscent of vertebrate neurogenesis and suggests it might be a fundamental strategy for large brain development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An evidence-based 3D reconstruction of Asteroxylon mackiei, the most complex plant preserved from the Rhynie chert</a></h4>

              
                The Early Devonian Rhynie chert preserves the earliest terrestrial ecosystem and informs our understanding of early life on land. However, our knowledge of the 3D structure, and development of these plants is still rudimentary. Here we used digital 3D reconstruction techniques to produce the first well-evidenced reconstruction of the structure and development of the rooting system of the lycopsid <i>Asteroxylon mackiei</i>, the most complex plant in the Rhynie chert. The reconstruction reveals the organisation of the three distinct axis types – leafy shoot axes, root-bearing axes, and rooting axes – in the body plan. Combining this reconstruction with developmental data from fossilised meristems, we demonstrate that the <i>A. mackiei</i> rooting axis – a transitional lycophyte organ between the rootless ancestral state and true roots – developed from root-bearing axes by anisotomous dichotomy. Our discovery demonstrates how this unique organ developed and highlights the value of evidence-based reconstructions for understanding the development and evolution of the first complex vascular plants on Earth.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Superspreaders drive the largest outbreaks of hospital onset COVID-19 infections</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 is notable both for its rapid spread, and for the heterogeneity of its patterns of transmission, with multiple published incidences of superspreading behaviour. Here, we applied a novel network reconstruction algorithm to infer patterns of viral transmission occurring between patients and health care workers (HCWs) in the largest clusters of COVID-19 infection identified during the first wave of the epidemic at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK. Based upon dates of individuals reporting symptoms, recorded individual locations, and viral genome sequence data, we show an uneven pattern of transmission between individuals, with patients being much more likely to be infected by other patients than by HCWs. Further, the data were consistent with a pattern of superspreading, whereby 21% of individuals caused 80% of transmission events. Our study provides a detailed retrospective analysis of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and sheds light on the need for intensive and pervasive infection control procedures.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to estimate the incidence of cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis (CVT) within 1 month from first dose administration and the frequency of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as the underlying mechanism after vaccination with BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273, in Germany.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A web-based questionnaire was e-mailed to all departments of neurology. We requested a report of cases of CVT occurring within 1 month of a COVID-19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of 9 German states.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were younger than 60 years. Fifty-three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%) vaccination, and none after mRNA-1273 vaccination. After 7,126,434 first vaccine doses, the incidence rate of CVT within 1 month from first dose administration was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–0.78) per 100,000 person-months (which corresponds to a risk of CVT within the first 31 days of 0.55 per 100,000 individuals) for all vaccines and 1.52 (95% CI = 1.00–2.21) for ChAdOx1 (after 2,320,535 ChAdOx1 first doses). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (95% CI = 3.46–34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA-based vaccines and 3.14 (95% CI = 1.22–10.65) for females compared to non-females. In 26 of 45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Given an incidence of 0.02 to 0.15 per 100,000 person-months for CVT in the general population, these findings point toward a higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, a disease that, despite treatment with antibiotics, still is associated with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Diffuse brain swelling is a leading cause of morbidity in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. We hypothesized that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) disrupt cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport by the glymphatic system and contribute to edema formation in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used DNase I treatment to disrupt NETs and then assessed glymphatic function by cisterna magna injections of CSF tracers in a rat model of <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our analysis showed that CSF influx into the brain parenchyma, as well as CSF drainage to the cervical lymph nodes, was significantly reduced in the rat model of <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. Degrading NETs by DNase treatment restored glymphatic transport and eliminated the increase in brain weight in the rats. In contrast, first-line antibiotic treatment had no such effect on restoring fluid dynamics.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that CSF accumulation is responsible for cerebral edema formation and identifies the glymphatic system and NETs as possible new treatment targets in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neuronal population activity in the hippocampal CA3 subfield is implicated in cognitive brain functions such as memory processing and spatial navigation. However, because of its deep location in the brain, the CA3 area has been difficult to target with modern calcium imaging approaches. Here, we achieved chronic two-photon calcium imaging of CA3 pyramidal neurons with the red fluorescent calcium indicator R-CaMP1.07 in anesthetized and awake mice. We characterize CA3 neuronal activity at both the single-cell and population level and assess its stability across multiple imaging days. During both anesthesia and wakefulness, nearly all CA3 pyramidal neurons displayed calcium transients. Most of the calcium transients were consistent with a high incidence of bursts of action potentials (APs), based on calibration measurements using simultaneous juxtacellular recordings and calcium imaging. In awake mice, we found state-dependent differences with striking large and prolonged calcium transients during locomotion. We estimate that trains of &gt;30 APs over 3 s underlie these salient events. Their abundance in particular subsets of neurons was relatively stable across days. At the population level, we found that co-activity within the CA3 network was above chance level and that co-active neuron pairs maintained their correlated activity over days. Our results corroborate the notion of state-dependent spatiotemporal activity patterns in the recurrent network of CA3 and demonstrate that at least some features of population activity, namely co-activity of cell pairs and likelihood to engage in prolonged high activity, are maintained over days.</p>

Nevertheless, whether GABA acts distally on presynaptic terminals, evoking presynaptic inhibition is unknown. Here, we begin to address this problem by measuring presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in preBo&#x0308;tC neurons, under rhythmic and non-rhythmic conditions, with two variants of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs). Organotypic slice cultures from newborn mice, containing the preBo&#x0308;tC, were drop-transduced with jGCaMP7s, or injected with jGCaMP7f-labeling commissural preBo&#x0308;tC neurons. Then, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging combined with whole-cell patch-clamp or field stimulation was obtained from inspiratory preBo&#x0308;tC neurons. We found that rhythmically active neurons expressed synchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in soma, proximal and distal dendritic regions, and punctate synapse-like structures. Expansion microscopy revealed morphologic characteristics of bona fide synaptic boutons of the en passant and terminal type. Under non-rhythmic conditions, we found that bath application of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor agonist muscimol, and local microiontophoresis of GABA, reduced action potential (AP)-evoked and field stimulus-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in presynaptic terminals in inspiratory neurons and commissural neurons projecting to the contralateral preBo&#x0308;tC. In addition, under rhythmic conditions, network rhythmic activity was suppressed by muscimol, while the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist bicuculline completely re-activated spontaneous activity. These observations demonstrate that the preBo&#x0308;tC includes neurons that show GABAergic inhibition of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and presynaptic inhibition may play a role in the network activity that underlies breathing.</p>

                The term “noetic” comes from the Greek word noēsis/noētikos that means inner wisdom, direct knowing, intuition, or implicit understanding. Strong cultural taboos exist about sharing these experiences. Thus, many may not feel comfortable transparently discussing or researching these topics, despite growing evidence that these experiences may be real. The study’s objective was to qualitatively evaluate first-hand accounts of noetic experiences. 521 English-speaking adults from around the world completed an online survey that collected demographic data and four open-ended questions about noetic experiences. Thematic analysis was used to characterize the data. The ten most used codes were expressing to or sharing with others, impacting decision-making, intuition/”just knowing,” meditation/hypnosis, inner visions, setting intentions/getting into the “state,” healing others, writing for self, and inner voice. There were five main themes identified: 1. Ways of Engagement; 2. Ways of Knowing; 3. Types of Information; 4. Ways of Affecting; and 5. Ways of Expressing. Subthemes. Future research will include investigating the nuances of these themes and also establishing standardized methods for evaluating them. This would also then inform curricula and therapies to support people in these experiences.

                Adolescents engage cognitively, emotionally, and behaviorally with smartphones. Growing evidence suggests they struggle to interact with them in moderation, which has been framed in relation to behavioral addiction as problematic mobile phone use. This study contextualized 13-15 year-old adolescents’ self-awareness of problematic mobile phone use. Focus groups were conducted with 11 adolescents who assessed themselves using the problematic use of mobile phones scale. The authors used interpretative phenomenological epistemology as a guiding framework. Audio recordings were analyzed qualitatively using a constant comparison approach. Students agreed or strongly agreed with multiple dimensions of the problematic mobile phone use construct. Four major themes emerged in relation to circumstances, factors, processes, constraints, and opportunities: drivers of excessive smartphone use, with family or friends, barriers to healthier smartphone use, and nighttime habits. Adolescents’ assessment of perceived proper versus problematic mobile phone can inform hypotheses targeted at improving overall wellness and developing healthy habits in adolescence that carry over into young adulthood and beyond.

                Background: Overgrowth syndromes are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by excessive body growth - localized or generalized - commonly associated with various malformities and an increased oncological risk. Case report: Here we present the case of a 59-years old man, employed in an office, who suffers from an asymmetric overgrowth of the lower limbs. Currently the patient presents malformations of the lower left limb (hip, knee and ankle), evident on the articular and periarticular level, where there are diffuse exostoses. This case discusses the main occupational concerns relating to the patient’s workspace at a high floor level that could create critical issues in the event of an emergency exodus. Given the impossibility of placing the patient in heavy manual activities, employment is limited to office activities. Adjustments were carried out at the patient’s workstation, and thus the patient has been recognized as fit to work. Increased frequency of breaks were prescribed in order to allow the physiological alternation of postures. Conclusions: In cases of overgrowth syndromes, the exact identification of the limitations presented by the patient and observations about ambulatory functions must be carefully evaluated in order to modulate the work environment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epigenetic instability may alter cell state transitions and anticancer drug resistance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anshul Saini, James M. Gallo</p>

Drug resistance is a significant obstacle to successful and durable anti-cancer therapy. Targeted therapy is often effective during early phases of treatment; however, eventually cancer cells adapt and transition to drug-resistant cells states rendering the treatment ineffective. It is proposed that cell state can be a determinant of drug efficacy and manipulated to affect the development of anticancer drug resistance. In this work, we developed two stochastic cell state models and an integrated stochastic-deterministic model referenced to brain tumors. The stochastic cell state models included transcriptionally-permissive and -restrictive states based on the underlying hypothesis that epigenetic instability mitigates lock-in of drug-resistant states. When moderate epigenetic instability was implemented the drug-resistant cell populations were reduced, on average, by 60%, whereas a high level of epigenetic disruption reduced them by about 90%. The stochastic-deterministic model utilized the stochastic cell state model to drive the dynamics of the DNA repair enzyme, methylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT), that repairs temozolomide (TMZ)-induced O6-methylguanine (O6mG) adducts. In the presence of epigenetic instability, the production of MGMT decreased that coincided with an increase of O6mG adducts following a multiple-dose regimen of TMZ. Generation of epigenetic instability via epigenetic modifier therapy could be a viable strategy to mitigate anticancer drug resistance.

Ash, Rebecca Hoyd, Rohan Ahluwalia, Andrew Zhang, Shaoke Lou, Donghoon Lee, Jing Zhang, Carolyn Presley, Ann Greene, Matthew Stults-Kolehmainen, Laura M. Nally, Julien S. Baker, Lisa M.

The development of mobile-health technology has the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine. Biomedical sensors (e.g. wearables) can assist with determining treatment plans for individuals, provide quantitative information to healthcare providers, and give objective measurements of health, leading to the goal of precise phenotypic correlates for genotypes. Even though treatments and interventions are becoming more specific and datasets more abundant, measuring the causal impact of health interventions requires careful considerations of complex covariate structures, as well as knowledge of the temporal and spatial properties of the data. Thus, interpreting biomedical sensor data needs to make use of specialized statistical models. Here, we show how the Bayesian structural time series framework, widely used in economics, can be applied to these data. This framework corrects for covariates to provide accurate assessments of the significance of interventions. Furthermore, it allows for a time-dependent confidence interval of impact, which is useful for considering individualized assessments of intervention efficacy. We provide a customized biomedical adaptor tool, MhealthCI, around a specific implementation of the Bayesian structural time series framework that uniformly processes, prepares, and registers diverse biomedical data. We apply the software implementation of MhealthCI to a structured set of examples in biomedicine to showcase the ability of the framework to evaluate interventions with varying levels of data richness and covariate complexity and also compare the performance to other models. Specifically, we show how the framework is able to evaluate an exercise intervention’s effect on stabilizing blood glucose in a diabetes dataset. We also provide a future-anticipating illustration from a behavioral dataset showcasing how the framework integrates complex spatial covariates. Overall, we show the robustness of the Bayesian structural time series framework when applied to biomedical sensor data, highlighting its increasing value for current and future datasets.

                <p>by Tatsuya Haga, Tomoki Fukai</p>

Our cognition relies on the ability of the brain to segment hierarchically structured events on multiple scales. Recent evidence suggests that the brain performs this event segmentation based on the structure of state-transition graphs behind sequential experiences. However, the underlying circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper we propose an extended attractor network model for graph-based hierarchical computation which we call the Laplacian associative memory. This model generates multiscale representations for communities (clusters) of associative links between memory items, and the scale is regulated by the heterogenous modulation of inhibitory circuits. We analytically and numerically show that these representations correspond to graph Laplacian eigenvectors, a popular method for graph segmentation and dimensionality reduction. Finally, we demonstrate that our model exhibits chunked sequential activity patterns resembling hippocampal theta sequences. Our model connects graph theory and attractor dynamics to provide a biologically plausible mechanism for abstraction in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysis of protrusion dynamics in amoeboid cell motility by means of regularized contour flows</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Schindler, Ted Moldenhawer, Maike Stange, Valentino Lepro, Carsten Beta, Matthias Holschneider, Wilhelm Huisinga</p>

Amoeboid cell motility is essential for a wide range of biological processes including wound healing, embryonic morphogenesis, and cancer metastasis. It relies on complex dynamical patterns of cell shape changes that pose long-standing challenges to mathematical modeling and raise a need for automated and reproducible approaches to extract quantitative morphological features from image sequences. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework and a computational method for obtaining smooth representations of the spatiotemporal contour dynamics from stacks of segmented microscopy images. Based on a Gaussian process regression we propose a one-parameter family of regularized contour flows that allows us to continuously track reference points (virtual markers) between successive cell contours. We use this approach to define a coordinate system on the moving cell boundary and to represent different local geometric quantities in this frame of reference. In particular, we introduce the local marker dispersion as a measure to identify localized membrane expansions and provide a fully automated way to extract the properties of such expansions, including their area and growth time. The methods are available as an open-source software package called AmoePy, a Python-based toolbox for analyzing amoeboid cell motility (based on time-lapse microscopy data), including a graphical user interface and detailed documentation. Due to the mathematical rigor of our framework, we envision it to be of use for the development of novel cell motility models. We mainly use experimental data of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> to illustrate and validate our approach.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Plant pathogens convergently evolved to counteract redundant nodes of an NLR immune receptor network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lida Derevnina, Mauricio P. Contreras, Hiroaki Adachi, Jessica Upson, Angel Vergara Cruces, Rongrong Xie, Jan Skłenar, Frank L. H. Menke, Sam T. Mugford, Dan MacLean, Wenbo Ma, Saskia Hogenhout, Aska Goverse, Abbas Maqbool, Chih-Hang Wu, Sophien Kamoun</p>

In plants, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing proteins can form receptor networks to confer hypersensitive cell death and innate immunity. One class of NLRs, known as NLR required for cell death (NRCs), are central nodes in a complex network that protects against multiple pathogens and comprises up to half of the NLRome of solanaceous plants. Given the prevalence of this NLR network, we hypothesised that pathogens convergently evolved to secrete effectors that target NRC activities. To test this, we screened a library of 165 bacterial, oomycete, nematode, and aphid effectors for their capacity to suppress the cell death response triggered by the NRC-dependent disease resistance proteins Prf and Rpi-blb2. Among 5 of the identified suppressors, 1 cyst nematode protein and 1 oomycete protein suppress the activity of autoimmune mutants of NRC2 and NRC3, but not NRC4, indicating that they specifically counteract a subset of NRC proteins independently of their sensor NLR partners. Whereas the cyst nematode effector SPRYSEC15 binds the nucleotide-binding domain of NRC2 and NRC3, the oomycete effector AVRcap1b suppresses the response of these NRCs via the membrane trafficking-associated protein NbTOL9a (Target of Myb 1-like protein 9a). We conclude that plant pathogens have evolved to counteract central nodes of the NRC immune receptor network through different mechanisms. Coevolution with pathogen effectors may have driven NRC diversification into functionally redundant nodes in a massively expanded NLR network.

                Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, categorized into various subtypes. Post-infection IBS may be attributed to the release of cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB), which cross-reacts with the adhesion protein vinculin responsible for normal intestinal contractility. Objective: This study aims to identify anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin levels in IBS patients compared to healthy control. Subjects and methods: This retrospective case-control study was conducted on 100 subjects with IBS, as determined by a questionnaire based on Rome III criteria, recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Tropical Medicine at Mansoura University Hospital from January 2019 to January 2020. Results: Anti-vinculin and anti-CdtB levels were significantly elevated in patients with IBS (1.58±0.496, 2.47±0.60)  when compared to control subjects (1.13±0.249ng/ml, 2.1±0.24 ng/ml), respectively with P=0.001 for both.  Anti-vinculin level was significantly higher in the IBS-D subtype than the other subtypes (P=0.001) while, Anti-CdtB was significantly elevated in IBS-C, IBS-D subgroups compared to control subjects (P=0.001). Conclusion: Findings of the present study support the hypothesis that IBS results from post-infectious disorders initiated by bacterial enteritis. A hypothesis could be applied to all IBS subgroups. On the other hand. These biomarkers might reflect the post-infectious state's severity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although plasmapheresis is a treatment option for patients with autoimmune neurological diseases, treatment response varies greatly among patients. The main objective of this study was to find out if biological/immune traits correlate with a beneficial response.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We thoroughly analyzed immune phenotypes in paired blood samples from a cohort of 31 patients with multiple sclerosis before and after plasmapheresis, in parallel with clinical evaluation of treatment response.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The frequency of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells was persistently higher in those who obtained benefit from plasmapheresis (responders) than non-responders. The Th1 cell frequency before plasmapheresis provided a high predictive value for beneficial response, achieving AUC of 0.902. Plasmapheresis treatment decreased inflammation-related gene expressions in Th1 cells. Meanwhile, <i>IFNG</i> expression in Th1 cells positively correlated with the frequency of CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells, of which a pathogenic role has been suggested in several autoimmune diseases. In line with this, <i>in vitro</i> experiments showed that CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells would increase in response to exogenous IFN-γ compared to IL-4, and secrete high amounts of IgG. B cell receptor analysis indicated that clonal expansion of CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells takes place in patients with multiple sclerosis. Interestingly, CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells, which showed unique gene expression profile, decreased after plasmapheresis treatment along with all the immunoglobulin subsets in the circulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, we postulate that Th1 cell - CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cell axis is involved in treatment response to plasmapheresis, giving us clues to better understanding of complicated pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and getting closer to a personalized therapy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL-1A -889C>T (rs1800587), TNF-A -238G>A (rs361525), and VDR TaqI (rs731236) on susceptibility to herniated nucleus pulposus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 appro</a></h4>

              
                Background: The pathogenesis of herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) is complex and may involve the wide variety of gene polymorphism. However, the reports from the existing studies are inconclusive. The objective of this study was to determine the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1A), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-A), and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes on the susceptibility to herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP). Methods: Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science) were searched as of April 1 st, 2021. Authors, publication year, targeted genes, genotype and allele frequency in each case and control groups were collected. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the publication quality. The pooled estimates of association of IL-1A -889C>T (rs1800587), TNF-A -238G>A (rs361525), and VDR TaqI (rs731236) and susceptibility to HNP were assessed using Z test. Results: We screened 3,067 unique studies for eligibility and three, two and nine case-control studies on IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A -238G>A, and VDR TaqI were included, respectively, in our meta-analysis. The studies consisting 369 HNP cases and 433 controls for IL-1A -889C>T, 252 cases and 259 controls for TNF-A -238G>A and 1130 cases and 2096 controls for VDR TaqI. Our pooled estimates indicated that there was no significant association of those SNPs with the susceptibility to HNP in any genotype, dominant model, recessive model, or allele comparations. Conclusion: Although individual studies suggested the important role of gene expression dysregulation associated with SNPs in IL-1A, TNF-A, and VDR, our data indicated that IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A -238G>A, and VDR TaqI had weak association with HNP susceptibility in both genotypes and allele distributions. However, since heterogeneity was identified among studies included in this meta-analysis, further meta-analysis with a larger population and subgroup analysis on specific population are warranted to support this finding.

                Background: Contributing factors for improved survival of human adipocytes mesenchymal stem cells (h-AMSCs) cultured through hypoxia preconditioning, in example apoptosis inhibition involving BCL2 and HSP27 expression, trigger signal expression (VEGF), SCF expression, OCT-4 expression, and CD44+ expression. The objective if this study was to explain the mechanism and role of hypoxic preconditioning and the optimal duration of hypoxic preconditioning exposure to improve survival of h-AMSCs. Methods: An experimental laboratory explorative study (in vitro) with hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs cultures. This research was conducted through four stages. First, isolation of h-AMSCs culture from adipose tissue of patients. Second, the characterization of h-AMSCs from adipose tissue by phenotype (flowcytometry) through CD44+, CD90+ and CD45-expression before being pre-conditioned for hypoxic treatment. Third, the hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs culture (in vitro) was performed with an oxygen concentration of 1% for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Fourth, observation of survival from h-AMSCs culture was tested on the role of CD44+, VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, HSP27 with Flowcytometry and apoptotic inhibition by Tunnel Assay method. Results: The result of regression test showed that time difference had an effect on VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=-0.482) and hypoxia condition also influenced VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=0.774). The result of path analysis showed that SCF had effect on OCT-4 expression (p<0.001; β=0.985). The regression test results showed that time effects on HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.398) and hypoxia precondition also affects HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.847). Pathway analysis showed that BCL2 expression inhibited apoptosis (p=0.030; β=-0.442) and HSP27 expression also inhibited apoptosis (p<0,001;β=-0.487). Conclusion: Hypoxic preconditioning of h-AMSC culture has proven to increase the expression of VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, and BCL2 and HSP27. This study demonstrated and explained the existence of a new mechanism of increased h-AMSC survival in cultures with hypoxic preconditioning (O2 1%) via VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, and HSP 27.

                Backgroundː Hepatic lipase (HL) plays a very important role in lipoprotein catabolism. The aim of this study was to measure both HL activity and ApoB100/ApoAI ratio changes in cell secretions by incubating HepG2 cells with various amounts of glucose. Methodsː HepG2 cells were cultured in low-, normal- or high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (1, 4.5 and 10g/L, respectively). HL activities were determined using the Hepatic Lipase Detection Kit (cat. no. A067) from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). Levels of ApoAI and ApoB100 were measured with commercial sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (cat#: H0123 and H0124) from ShangHai MEIXUAN Biological Science and Technology Ltd (Shanghai, China). Experiments were repeated six times for each assay. Resultsː Pearson’s correlation coefficient results showed that ApoB100 and ApoB100/ApoAI ratio have positive and significant correlations with HL activity, and ApoAI has a negative and significant correlation with HL activity. Conclusionsː Glucose may increase or decrease ApoB100/ApoAI ratio through upregulation or downregulation of hepatic lipase activity, which suggests a new regulatory pathway in lipoprotein catabolism. This finding may lead to novel therapeutic ways for diagnosis and treatment for coronary artery disease.

     alt="The effects of orexin-A and orexin receptors on anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in a male rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder"/>
<p>Single prolonged stress (SPS) rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. SPS reduced the expression levels of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and increased the expression levels of OX1R in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Moreover, the intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated anxiety-like behaviors, improved the reduction of locomotor activity in SPS rats, and partly restored OX1R levels in the mPFC. Therefore, the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in post-traumatic stress disorder.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Orexin neurons play an important role in stress-related mental disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety- and depression-related symptoms commonly occur in combination with PTSD. However, the role of the orexin system in mediating alterations in these affective symptoms remains unclear. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. In the present study, we investigated anxiety- and depression-related behavioral changes using the elevated plus maze, the sucrose preference test, and the open field test in male rats with single prolonged stress (SPS) induced-PTSD. The expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the mPFC was detected and quantified by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that the SPS rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. Furthermore, SPS resulted in reductions in the expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and the increased the expression of OX1R in the mPFC. The intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated behavioral changes in SPS rats and partly restored the increased levels of OX1R in the mPFC. These results suggest that the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in PTSD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Probing mechanisms of visual spatial attention in mice</a></h4>

              
                The role of spatial attention for visual perception has been thoroughly studied in primates, but less so in mice. Several behavioral tasks in mice reveal spatial attentional effects, with similarities to observations in primates. Pairing these tasks with large-scale, cell-type-specific techniques could enable deeper access to underlying mechanisms, and help define the utility and limitations of resolving attentional effects on visual perception and neural activity in mice. In this Review, we evaluate behavioral and neural evidence for visual spatial attention in mice; assess how specializations of the mouse visual system and behavioral repertoire impact interpretation of spatial attentional effects; and outline how several measurement and manipulation techniques in mice could precisely test and refine models of attentional modulation across scales.

                Macrophages undergo programmatic changes with age leading to altered cytokine polarization and immune dysfunction, shifting these critical immune cells from protective sentinels to disease promoters. The molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage inflammaging are poorly understood. Using an unbiased RNA-seq approach, we identified <i>Mir146b</i> as a microRNA whose expression progressively and unidirectionally declined with age in thioglycollate-elicited murine macrophages. <i>Mir146b</i> deficiency led to altered macrophage cytokine expression and reduced mitochondrial metabolic activity, two hallmarks of cellular aging. Single cell RNA sequencing identified patterns of altered inflammation and interferon gamma signaling in <i>Mir146b</i> deficient macrophages. Identification of <i>Mir146b </i>as a potential regulator of macrophage aging provides novel insights into immune dysfunction associated with aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrated single-cell analysis unveils diverging immune features of COVID-19, influenza, and other community-acquired pneumonia</a></h4>

              
                The exact immunopathophysiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) remains clouded by a general lack of relevant disease controls. The scarcity of single-cell investigations in the broader population of patients with CAP renders it difficult to distinguish immune features unique to COVID-19 from the common characteristics of a dysregulated host response to pneumonia. We performed integrated single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a matched cohort of eight patients with COVID-19, eight patients with CAP caused by Influenza A or other pathogens, and four non-infectious control subjects. Using this balanced, multi-omics approach, we describe shared and diverging transcriptional and phenotypic patterns—including increased levels of type I interferon-stimulated natural killer cells in COVID-19, cytotoxic CD8 T EMRA cells in both COVID-19 and influenza, and distinctive monocyte compositions between all groups—and thereby expand our understanding of the peripheral immune response in different etiologies of pneumonia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An oomycete effector subverts host vesicle trafficking to channel starvation-induced autophagy to the pathogen interface</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic cells deploy autophagy to eliminate invading microbes. In turn, pathogens have evolved effector proteins to counteract antimicrobial autophagy. How adapted pathogens co-opt autophagy for their own benefit is poorly understood. The Irish famine pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> secretes the effector protein PexRD54 that selectively activates an unknown plant autophagy pathway that antagonizes antimicrobial autophagy at the pathogen interface. Here, we show that PexRD54 induces autophagosome formation by bridging vesicles decorated by the small GTPase Rab8a with autophagic compartments labeled by the core autophagy protein ATG8CL. Rab8a is required for pathogen-triggered and starvation-induced but not antimicrobial autophagy, revealing specific trafficking pathways underpin selective autophagy. By subverting Rab8a-mediated vesicle trafficking, PexRD54 utilizes lipid droplets to facilitate biogenesis of autophagosomes diverted to pathogen feeding sites. Altogether, we show that PexRD54 mimics starvation-induced autophagy to subvert endomembrane trafficking at the host-pathogen interface, revealing how effectors bridge distinct host compartments to expedite colonization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Urocortin-3 neurons in the mouse perifornical area promote infant-directed neglect and aggression</a></h4>

              
                While recent studies have uncovered dedicated neural pathways mediating the positive control of parenting, the regulation of infant-directed aggression and how it relates to adult-adult aggression is poorly understood. Here we show that <i>urocortin-3</i> (<i>Ucn3</i>)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamic perifornical area (PeFA<i><sup>Ucn3</sup></i>) are activated during infant-directed attacks in males and females, but not other behaviors. Functional manipulations of PeFA<i><sup>Ucn3</sup></i> neurons demonstrate the role of this population in the negative control of parenting in both sexes. PeFA<i><sup>Ucn3</sup></i> neurons receive input from areas associated with vomeronasal sensing, stress, and parenting, and<sup> </sup>send<sup> </sup>projections to hypothalamic and limbic areas. Optogenetic activation of PeFA<i><sup>Ucn3</sup></i><sup> </sup>axon terminals in these regions triggers various aspects of infant-directed agonistic responses, such as neglect, repulsion and aggression. Thus, PeFA<i><sup>Ucn3</sup></i> neurons emerge as a dedicated circuit component controlling infant-directed neglect and aggression, providing a new framework to understand the positive and negative regulation of parenting in health and disease.

                Microglia, the brain's resident myeloid cells, play central roles in brain defense, homeostasis, and disease. Using a prolonged colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor (CSF1Ri) approach, we report an unprecedented level of microglial depletion and establish a model system that achieves an empty microglial niche in the adult brain. We identify a myeloid cell that migrates from the subventricular zone and associated white matter areas. Following CSF1Ri, these amoeboid cells migrate radially and tangentially in a dynamic wave filling the brain in a distinct pattern, to replace the microglial-depleted brain. These repopulating cells are enriched in disease-associated microglia genes and exhibit similar phenotypic and transcriptional profiles to white matter-associated microglia. Our findings shed light on the overlapping and distinct functional complexity and diversity of myeloid cells of the CNS and provide new insight into repopulating microglia function and dynamics in the mouse brain.

                The biophysical properties of sensory neurons are influenced by their morphometric and morphological features, whose precise measurements require high-quality volume electron microscopy (EM). However, systematic surveys of nanoscale characteristics for identified neurons are scarce. Here, we characterize the morphology of <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) across the majority of genetically identified sensory hairs. By analyzing serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) images of cryofixed antennal tissues, we compile an extensive morphometric dataset based on 122 reconstructed 3D models for 33 of the 40 identified antennal ORN types. Additionally, we observe multiple novel features - including extracellular vacuoles within sensillum lumen, intricate dendritic branching, mitochondria enrichment in select ORNs, novel sensillum types, and empty sensilla containing no neurons - which raise new questions pertinent to cell biology and sensory neurobiology. Our systematic survey is critical for future investigations into how the size and shape of sensory neurons influence their responses, sensitivity and circuit function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Emergence of a smooth interface from growth of a dendritic network against a mechanosensitive contractile material</a></h4>

              
                Structures and machines require smoothening of raw materials. Self-organized smoothening guides cell and tissue morphogenesis, and is relevant to advanced manufacturing. Across the syncytial Drosophila embryo surface, smooth interfaces form between expanding Arp2/3-based actin caps and surrounding actomyosin networks, demarcating the circumferences of nascent dome-like compartments used for pseudo-cleavage. We found that forming a smooth and circular boundary of the surrounding actomyosin domain requires Arp2/3 in vivo. To dissect the physical basis of this requirement, we reconstituted the interacting networks using node-based models. In simulations of actomyosin networks with local clearances in place of Arp2/3 domains, rough boundaries persisted when myosin contractility was low. With addition of expanding Arp2/3 network domains, myosin domain boundaries failed to smoothen, but accumulated myosin nodes and tension. After incorporating actomyosin mechanosensitivity, Arp2/3 network growth locally induced a surrounding contractile actomyosin ring that smoothened the interface between the cytoskeletal domains, an effect also evident in vivo. In this way, a smooth structure can emerge from the lateral interaction of irregular active materials.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interferon receptor-deficient mice are susceptible to eschar-associated rickettsiosis</a></h4>

              
                Arthropod-borne rickettsial pathogens cause mild and severe human disease worldwide. The tick-borne pathogen <i>Rickettsia parkeri </i>elicits skin lesions (eschars) and disseminated disease in humans; however, inbred mice are generally resistant to infection. We report that intradermal infection of mice lacking both interferon receptors (<i>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></i>;<i>Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></i>) with as few as 10 <i>R. parkeri</i> elicits eschar formation and disseminated, lethal disease. Similar to human infection, eschars exhibited necrosis and inflammation, with bacteria primarily found in leukocytes. Using this model, we find that the actin-based motility factor Sca2 is required for dissemination from the skin to internal organs, and the outer membrane protein OmpB contributes to eschar formation. Immunizing <i>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></i>;<i>Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice with <i>sca2</i> and <i>ompB</i> mutant <i>R. parkeri</i> protects against rechallenge, revealing live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Thus, <i>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></i>;<i>Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice are a tractable model to investigate rickettsiosis, virulence factors, and immunity. Our results further suggest that discrepancies between mouse and human susceptibility may be due to differences in interferon signaling.

                The basolateral amygdala plays a crucial role in memory consolidation yet the general neural mechanism remains elusive. Basolateral amygdala neurons were recorded from freely-moving rats as they interacted with different ethological stimuli: male or female rats, a moving toy and food. Over 20% of neurons showed highly tuned event-specific responses to a single class of stimuli. Firing persisted in 30% of these responsive cells for minutes after the removal of the eliciting stimulus. Neural information flowed directionally from event-specific neurons to less specific neurons with changes in connection strength after removal of the stimulus. We propose that the basolateral amygdala identifies specific ethological events, with circuit-wide activity driven by the event-specific neurons during and after the termination of those events likely facilitating active short-term memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stretching and squeezing of neuronal log firing rate distribution by psychedelic and intrinsic brain state transitions</a></h4>

              
                How psychedelic drugs change the activity of cortical neuronal populations and whether such changes are specific to transition into the psychedelic brain state or shared with other brain state transitions is not well understood. Here, we used Neuropixels probes to record from large populations of neurons in prefrontal cortex of mice given the psychedelic drug TCB-2. Drug ingestion significantly stretched the distribution of log firing rates of the population of recorded neurons. This phenomenon was previously observed across transitions between sleep and wakefulness, which suggested that stretching of the log-rate distribution can be triggered by different kinds of brain state transitions and prompted us to examine it in more detail. We found that modulation of the width of the log-rate distribution of a neuronal population occurred in multiple areas of the cortex and in the hippocampus even in awake drug-free mice, driven by intrinsic fluctuations in their arousal level. Arousal, however, did not explain the stretching of the log-rate distribution by TCB-2. In both psychedelic and naturally occurring brain state transitions, the stretching or squeezing of the log-rate distribution of an entire neuronal population reflected concomitant changes in two subpopulations, with one subpopulation undergoing a downregulation and often also stretching of its neurons' log-rate distribution, while the other subpopulation undergoes upregulation and often also a squeeze of its log-rate distribution. In both subpopulations, the stretching and squeezing were a signature of a greater relative impact of the brain state transition on the rates of the slow-firing neurons. These findings reveal a generic pattern of reorganisation of neuronal firing rates by different kinds of brain state transitions.

                In this paper, the process of building a model for predicting human brain activity under video viewing conditions was described as a part of an entry into the Algonauts Project 2021 Challenge. The model was designed to predict brain activity measured using functional MRI (fMRI) by weighted linear summations of the spatiotemporal visual features that appear in the video stimuli (video features). Two types of video features were used: (1) motion-energy features designed based on neurophysiological findings, and (2) features derived from a space-time vision transformer (TimeSformer). To utilize the features of various video domains, the features of the TimeSformer models pre-trained using several different movie sets were combined. Through these model building and validation processes, results showed that there is a certain correspondence between the hierarchical representation of the TimeSformer model and the hierarchical representation of the visual system in the brain. The motion-energy features are effective in predicting brain activity in the early visual areas, while TimeSformer-derived features are effective in higher-order visual areas, and a hybrid model that uses motion energy and TimeSformer features is effective for predicting whole brain activity.

                A class of neurons showing bidirectional tuning in a two-compartment environment was recently discovered in dysgranular retrosplenial cortex (dRSC). We investigated here whether these neurons possess a more general environmental symmetry-encoding property, potentially useful in representing complex spatial structure. We report that directional tuning of dRSC neurons reflected environment symmetry in onefold, twofold and fourfold-symmetric environments: this was the case not just globally, but also locally within each sub-compartment. Thus, these cells use environmental cues to organize multiple directional tuning curves, which perhaps sometimes combine via interaction with classic head direction cells. A consequence is that both local and global environmental symmetry are simultaneously encoded even within local sub-compartments, which may be important for cognitive mapping of the space beyond immediate perceptual reach.

                There are currently no preventive or disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's Disease (PD). Failures in clinical trials necessitate a re-evaluation of existing pre-clinical models in order to adopt systems that better recapitulate underlying disease mechanisms and better predict clinical outcomes. In recent years, models utilizing patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as attractive models to recapitulate disease-relevant neuropathology in vitro without exogenous overexpression of disease-related pathologic proteins. Here, we utilized iPSCs derived from patients with early-onset PD and dementia phenotypes that harbored either a point mutation (A53T) or multiplication at the Alpha-synuclein/SNCA gene locus. We generated a three-dimensional (3D) cortical neurosphere culture model to better mimic the tissue microenvironment of the brain. We extensively characterized the differentiation process using quantitative PCR, Western immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Differentiation and aging of the neurospheres revealed alterations in fatty acid profiles and elevated total and pathogenic phospho-Alpha-synuclein levels in both A53T and the triplication lines compared to their isogenic control lines. Furthermore, treatment of the neurospheres with a small molecule inhibitor of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) attenuated the protein accumulation and aberrant fatty acid profile phenotypes. Our findings suggest that the 3D cortical neurosphere model is a useful tool to interrogate targets for PD and amenable to test small molecule therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shared responsibility decreases the sense of agency in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Distributing responsibility across several individuals in social decisions helps minimize a burden of responsibility for consequences of decisions. Here we investigated the neural expression of this effect using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants performed a reward-based learning decision-making task in contexts where their sense of responsibility over outcomes decreased with group size. An MEG outcome processing effect was reduced as a function of decreasing responsibility at 200ms post outcome onset and centred over parietal and precentral brain regions. During social decisions, prior to outcome revelation, a motor preparation signature at 500ms after stimulus onset was attenuated. A boost in responsibility for positive outcomes in social contexts was associated with increased activity in regions related to social and reward processing. Together, these results show that sharing responsibility with others reduces agency through an influence on pre-outcome motor preparation and post-outcome processing, affording an opportunity for flexibility in credit for positive outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Online self-evaluation of fMRI-based neurofeedback performance</a></h4>

              
                This study explores the subjective evaluation of supplementary motor area (SMA) regulation performance in a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) task. In fMRI-NF, people learn how to self-regulate their brain activity by performing mental actions to achieve a certain target level of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activation. This setup offers the possibility to study performance monitoring in the absence of somatosensory feedback. Here, we studied two types of self-evaluation expressed before receiving neurofeedback: performance predictions and perceived confidence in the prediction judgement. We hypothesized that throughout learning, participants would (1) improve the precision of their performance predictions about the actual changes in their BOLD response, and (2) that reported confidence would progressively increase with improved metacognitive precision. Participants completed three sessions of SMA regulation in a 7T fMRI scanner, performing a drawing motor imagery task. During each trial, they modulated their mental drawing strategy to achieve one of two different levels of target fMRI signal change. They then reported a performance prediction and their confidence in the prediction before receiving delayed BOLD-activation feedback. Results show that participants' performance predictions improved with learning throughout the three sessions, and that these improvements were not driven exclusively by their knowledge of previous performance. Confidence reports on the other hand showed no change throughout training and did not differentiate between the better and worse predictions. In addition to shedding light on mechanisms of internal monitoring during neurofeedback training, these results also point to a dissociation between self-evaluation of performance and corresponding reported confidence in the presence of feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probing the orientation specificity of excitatory and inhibitory circuitries in the primary motor cortex with multi-channel TMS</a></h4>

              
                Background: The electric field orientation is a crucial parameter for optimizing the excitation of neuronal tissue in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Yet, the effects of stimulus orientation on the short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) paradigms are poorly known, mainly due to significant technical challenges in manipulating the TMS-induced stimulus orientation within milliseconds. Objective: Our aim is to assess the effect of the TMS-induced stimulus orientation on the SICI and ICF paradigms and search for the optimal orientations to maximize the facilitation and suppression of the motor evoked potentials (MEP). Methods: We applied paired-pulse multi-channel TMS in healthy subjects to generate SICI and ICF with conditioning and test pulses in the same, opposite, and perpendicular orientations to each other. The conditioning- and test-stimulus intensities were 80% and 110% of the resting motor threshold, respectively. Results: Both SICI and ICF were significantly affected by the conditioning- and test-stimulus orientation. MEP suppression and facilitation were strongest with both pulses delivered in the same direction. SICI with a 2.5-ms and ICF with a 6.0-ms interstimulus interval (ISI) were more sensitive to changes in stimulus orientation compared with SICI at 0.5- and ICF at 8.0-ms ISIs, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that SICI and ICF at specific ISIs are mediated by distinct mechanisms. Such mechanisms exhibit a preferential orientation depending on the anatomical and morphological arrangement of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations. We also demonstrate that the SICI and ICF can be maximized by adjusting the TMS-induced electric field orientation.

	<p>At birth, the vestibular system is fully mature, whilst higher order sensory processing is yet to develop in the full-term neonate. The current paper lays out a theoretical framework to account for the role vestibular stimulation may have driving multisensory and sensorimotor integration. Accordingly, vestibular stimulation, by activating the parieto-insular vestibular cortex, and/or the posterior parietal cortex may provide the cortical input for multisensory neurons in the superior colliculus that is needed for multisensory processing. Furthermore, we propose that motor development, by inducing change of reference frames, may shape the receptive field of multisensory neurons. This, by leading to lack of spatial contingency between formally contingent stimuli, may cause degradation of prior motor responses. Additionally, we offer a testable hypothesis explaining the beneficial effect of sensory integration therapies regarding attentional processes. Key concepts of a sensorimotor integration therapy (e.g., targeted sensorimotor therapy (TSMT)) are also put into a neurological context. TSMT utilizes specific tools and instruments. It is administered in 8-weeks long successive treatment regimens, each gradually increasing vestibular and postural stimulation, so sensory-motor integration is facilitated, and muscle strength is increased. Empirically TSMT is indicated for various diseases. Theoretical foundations of this sensorimotor therapy are discussed.</p>

	<p>Since 2020, the master’s program “Multiple Sclerosis Management” has been running at Dresden International University, offering structured training to become a multiple sclerosis specialist. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many planned teaching formats had to be changed to online teaching. The subject of this paper was the investigation of a cloud-based digital hub and student evaluation of the program. Authors analyzed use cases of computer-supported collaborative learning and student evaluation of courses and modules using the Gioia method and descriptive statistics. The use of a cloud-based digital hub as a central data platform proved to be highly successful for learning and teaching, as well as for close interaction between lecturers and students. Students rated the courses very positively in terms of content, knowledge transfer and interaction. The implementation of the master’s program was successful despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting extensive use of digital tools demonstrates the “new normal” of future learning, with even more emphasis on successful online formats that also increase interaction between lecturers and students in particular. At the same time, there will continue to be tailored face-to-face events to specifically increase learning success.</p>

	<p>Background: Acute regression has been reported in some individuals with Down syndrome (DS), typically occurring between the teenage years and mid to late 20s. Characterized by sudden, and often unexplained, reductions in language skills, functional living skills and reduced psychomotor activity, some individuals have been incorrectly diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Methods: This paper compares five individuals with DS who previously experienced acute regression with a matched group of 15 unaffected individuals with DS using a set of AD biomarkers. Results: While the sample was too small to conduct statistical analyses, findings suggest there are possible meaningful differences between the groups on proteomics biomarkers (e.g., NfL, total tau). Hippocampal, caudate and putamen volumes were slightly larger in the regression group, the opposite of what was hypothesized. A slightly lower amyloid load was found on the PET scans for the regression group, but no differences were noted on tau PET. Conclusions: Some proteomics biomarker findings suggest that individuals with DS who experience acute regression may be at increased risk for AD at an earlier age in comparison to unaffected adults with DS. However, due to the age of the group (mean 38 years), it may be too early to observe meaningful group differences on image-based biomarkers.</p>

	<p>The trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, cluster headache (CH), is one of the most painful disorders known to man. One of the disorder’s most striking features is the reported diurnal rhythmicity of the attacks. For a majority of patients, the headache attacks occur at approximately the same time every day. Genetic variants of genes involved in the circadian rhythm such as Period Circadian Regulator 1, 2, and 3 (PER1, 2 and 3) are hypothesized to have an effect on the rhythmicity of the attacks. Six PER1, 2 and 3 genetic markers; the indel rs57875989 and five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2735611, rs2304672, rs934945, rs10462020, and rs228697, were genotyped, using TaqMan® or regular polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in a Swedish CH case control material. Logistic regression showed no association between CH and any of the six genetic variants; rs57875989, p = 0.523; rs2735611, p = 0.416; rs2304672, p = 0.732; rs934945, p = 0.907; rs10462020, p = 0.726; and rs228697, p = 0.717. Furthermore, no difference in allele frequency was found for patients reporting diurnal rhythmicity of attacks, nor were any of the variants linked to diurnal preference. The results of this study indicate no involvement of these PER genetic variants in CH or diurnal phenotype in Sweden.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strong gamma frequency oscillations in the adolescent prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Working memory ability continues to mature into adulthood in both humans and non-human primates. At the single neuron level, adolescent development is characterized by increased prefrontal firing rate in the delay period, but less is known about how coordinated activity between neurons is altered. Local field potentials (LFP) provide a window into the computation carried out by the local network. To address the effects of adolescent development on LFP activity, three male rhesus monkeys were trained to perform an oculomotor delayed response task and tested at both the adolescent and adult stage. Simultaneous single-unit and LFP signals were recorded from areas 8a and 46 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). In both the cue and delay period, power relative to baseline increased in the gamma frequency range (32 - 128 Hz). In the adult stage, high-firing neurons were also more likely to reside at sites with strong gamma power increase from baseline. For both stages, the gamma power increase in the delay was selective for sites with neuron encoding stimulus information in their spiking. Gamma power and neuronal firing did not show stronger temporal correlations. Our results establish gamma power decrease to be a feature of prefrontal cortical maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bantam regulates the adult sleep circuit in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a highly conserved feature of animal life characterized by dramatic changes in behavior, neural physiology and gene expression. The gene regulatory factors responsible for these sleep-dependent changes remain largely unknown. microRNAs are post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression which have been implicated in sleep regulation. Our previous screen identified 25 sleep-regulating microRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster, including the developmental regulator bantam (ban). Here we show that ban promotes early nighttime sleep through a population of glutamatergic neurons- the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral Mushroom Body Output Neurons (MBONs). We found that knockdown of ban in these neurons led to a reduction in early night sleep. The {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs were previously shown to be wake-promoting, suggesting that ban acts to inhibit these neurons. GCaMP calcium imaging revealed that bantam inhibits the neural activity of the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs during the night but not the day. Blocking synaptic transmission in the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs rescued the effect of ban knockdown on sleep. Together these results suggest that ban promotes night sleep via the inhibition of the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs. RNAseq further revealed that bantam negatively regulates the wake-promoting mRNAs Kelch and CCHamide-2 receptor in the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs. These experiments establish bantam as an active regulator of sleep and neural activity within the fly brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BIFURCATING NEURONS IN THE ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI</a></h4>

              
                The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) form a nodal point within a hippocampal-cingulate-diencephalic memory system. ATN projections to different brain structures are conventionally viewed as distinct, but ATN neurons may send collaterals to multiple structures. The anteromedial subregion (AM) is the primary source of efferents to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Using a dual-retrograde neurotracer strategy, we discovered bifurcating AM neurons for tracers placed in the mPFC when paired with other regions. A semi-quantitative analysis found a high proportion of AM neurons (~36%) showed collateral projections when the mPFC was paired with dorsal subiculum (dSub); 20% were evident for mPFC paired with caudal retrosplenial cortex (cRSC); and 6% was found for mPFC and ventral hippocampal formation (vHF). About 10% of bifurcating AM neurons was also identified when the mPFC was not included, that is, for cRSC with dSub, and cRSC with vHF. Similar percentages of bifurcating neurons were also found within the anterior region of the adjacent nucleus reuniens (Re). The high frequency of bifurcating neurons suggests a new perspective for ATN function. These neurons would facilitate direct coordination among distal neural ensembles to support episodic memory and may explain why the ATN is a critical region for diencephalic amnesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beyond dimension reduction: Stable electric fields emerge from and allow representational drift</a></h4>

              
                It is known that the exact neurons maintaining a given memory (the neural ensemble) change from trial to trial. This raises the question of how the brain achieves stability in the face of this representational drift. Here, we demonstrate that this stability emerges at the level of the electric fields that arise from neural activity. The electric fields, in turn, can act as 'guard rails' that funnel higher dimensional variable neural activity along stable lower dimensional routes. We show that electric fields carry information about working memory content. We obtained the latent space associated with each memory. We then confirmed the stability of the electric field by mapping the latent space to different cortical patches (that comprise a neural ensemble) and reconstructing information flow between patches. Stable electric fields can allow latent states to be transferred between brain areas, in accord with modern engram theory.

	<p>Background: Despite an alarming rise in the global prevalence of dementia, the available modalities for improving cognition and mental wellbeing of dementia patients remain limited. Environmental enrichment is an experimental paradigm that has shown promising anti-depressive and memory-enhancing effects in pre-clinical studies. However, its clinical utility has remained limited due to the lack of effective implementation strategies. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the usability (tolerability and interactivity) of a long-term virtual reality (VR)- based environmental enrichment training program in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia. A secondary objective was to assess the effect of VR-based environmental enrichment on stabilization of cognitive functioning and improvement of mental wellbeing in older adults with MCI and mild dementia. Methods: A total of seven participants (four patients with MCI and three with mild dementia) received biweekly VR-based environmental enrichment over a course of 6 months. The tolerability and interactivity of the participants in the VR training was serially assessed via virtual reality sickness questionnaire (VRSQ) and recording of input-error ratio. Cognitive functioning was assessed through Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) before and after the study. Mental wellbeing was assessed through Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS). Results: VR-based environmental enrichment was well-tolerated by the patients with significant decrease in VRSQ scores (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and input-error ratio (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) overtime. VR training was also effective in stabilization of MoCA scores over the course of therapy (non-significant difference in the MoCA scores before and after the therapy) and was associated with a trend (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.1) towards improvement in WEMWBS scores between the first and the last assessments. Qualitative observations by the care-givers further corroborated a noticeable improvement in mental wellbeing of patients. Conclusions: This pilot study shows that VR can be a feasible, tolerable, and potentially effective tool in long-term support of older adults with MCI and mild dementia.</p>

	<p>Background: Coffin–Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability, in which specific associated facial, hand, and skeletal abnormalities are diagnostic features. Methods: In the present study, an unreported missense genetic variant of the ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) gene has been identified, by next-generation sequencing, in two related males with two different phenotypes of intellectual disability (ID) and peculiar facial dysmorphisms. We performed functional studies on this variant and another one, already reported in the literature, involving the same amino acid residue but, to date, without an efficient characterization. Results: Our study demonstrated that the two variants involving residue 189 significantly impaired its kinase activity. Conclusions: We detected a loss-of-function RSK2 mutation with loss in kinase activity in a three-generation family with an X-linked ID.</p>

	<p>Altered connectivity within and between the resting-state networks (RSNs) brought about by anesthetics that induce altered consciousness remains incompletely understood. It is known that the dorsal attention network (DAN) and its anticorrelations with other RSNs have been implicated in consciousness. However, the role of DAN-related functional patterns in drug-induced sedative effects is less clear. In the current study, we investigated altered functional connectivity of the DAN during midazolam-induced light sedation. In a placebo-controlled and within-subjects experimental study, fourteen healthy volunteers received midazolam or saline with a 1-week interval. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired before and after intravenous drug administration. A multiple region of interest-driven analysis was employed to investigate connectivity within and between RSNs. It was found that functional connectivity was significantly decreased by midazolam injection in two regions located in the left inferior parietal lobule and the left middle temporal area within the DAN as compared with the saline condition. We also identified three clusters in anticorrelation between the DAN and other RSNs for the interaction effect, which included the left medial prefrontal cortex, the right superior temporal gyrus, and the right superior frontal gyrus. Connectivity between all regions and DAN was significantly decreased by midazolam injection. The sensorimotor network was minimally affected. Midazolam decreased functional connectivity of the dorsal attention network. These findings advance the understanding of the neural mechanism of sedation, and such functional patterns might have clinical implications in other medical conditions related to patients with cognitive impairment.</p>

	<p>Stress seems to contribute to the neuropathology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), possibly by dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Oxidative distress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors involved in the pathophysiology of PD and neuronal glucocorticoid-induced toxicity. Animal PD models have been generated to study the effects of hormonal stress, but no in vitro model has yet been developed. Our aim was to examine the impact of corticosterone (CORT) administration on a dopaminergic neuronal cell model of PD induced by the neurotoxin MPP+, as a new combined PD model based on the marker of endocrine response to stress, CORT, and oxidative-mitochondrial damage. We determined the impact of CORT, MPP+ and their co-incubation on reactive oxygen species production (O2−•), oxidative stress cellular markers (advanced-oxidation protein products and total antioxidant status), mitochondrial function (mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate) and neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade staining). Accordingly, the administration of MPP+ or CORT individually led to cell damage compared to controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), as determined by several methods, whereas their co-incubation produced strong cell damage (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The combined model described here could be appropriate for investigating neuropathological hallmarks and for evaluating potential new therapeutic tools for PD patients suffering mild to moderate emotional stress.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is essential for spatial learning and memory. To assess learning we used contextual fear conditioning (cFC), where animals learn to associate a place with aversive events like foot-shocks. Candidate memory mechanisms for cFC are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), but there is little direct evidence of them operating in the hippocampus in vivo following cFC. Also, little is known about the behavioral state changes induced by cFC. To address these issues, we recorded local field potentials in freely behaving mice by stimulating in the left dorsal CA1 region and recording in the right dorsal CA1 region. Synaptic strength in the commissural pathway was monitored by measuring field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) before and after cFC. After cFC, the commissural pathway's synaptic strength was potentiated. Although recordings occurred during the wake phase of the light/dark cycle, the mice slept more in the post-conditioning period than in the pre-conditioning period. Relative to awake periods, in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep the fEPSPs were larger in both pre- and post-conditioning periods. We also found a significant negative correlation between the animal's speed and fEPSP size. Therefore, to avoid confounds in the fEFSP potentiation estimates, we controlled for speed-related and sleep-related fEPSP changes and still found that cFC induced long-term potentiation, but no significant long-term depression. Synaptic strength changes were not found in the control group that simply explored the fear-conditioning chamber, indicating that exploration of the novel place did not produce the measurable effects caused by cFC. These results show that following cFC, the CA1 commissural pathway is potentiated, likely contributing to the functional integration of the left and right hippocampi in fear memory consolidation. In addition, the cFC paradigm produces significant changes in an animal's behavioral state, which are observable as proximal changes in sleep patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabidiol activates neuronal Kv7 channels</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical found in the Cannabis sativa plant, is a clinically effective antiepileptic drug whose mechanism of action is unknown. Using a fluorescence-based thallium flux assay, we performed a large-scale screen and found enhancement of flux through heterologously-expressed human Kv7.2/7.3 channels by CBD. Using patch clamp recordings, we found that CBD at low concentrations activates Kv7.2/7.3 channels at subthreshold voltages, with 100 nM CBD producing a doubling of current at -50 mV. CBD shifted the voltage-dependence of channels in the hyperpolarizing direction, producing a shift in the midpoint of activation by [~]-14 mV at 300 nM. CBD also effectively enhanced native M-current in both mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons and rat hippocampal neurons. The potent enhancement of Kv2/7.3 channels by CBD seems likely to contribute to its effectiveness as an antiepileptic drug by reducing neuronal hyperexcitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron-specific coding sequences are the most highly conserved in the mammalian brain</a></h4>

              
                Neurons have become highly diverse in cell size, morphology, phenotype and function in mammalian evolution, whereas glial cells are much less varied in size and types across species. This difference in diversity suggests that neuron-specific protein-coding gene sequences have admitted more variation in evolution, that is, are less evolutionarily conserved than those expressed in glial cells. We calculated values of dN/dS from Ensembl98 for coding sequences expressed specifically in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells in the brain across 92 mammalian species with reference to either mouse or human. Surprisingly, we find that protein-coding sequences that are specifically expressed in neurons are far less variable than those specific to other cell types in the brain. We next analyzed phastCons values for the same genes and found that neuron-specific promoter sequences are at least as conserved as other cell type-specific promoter sequences. Moreover, neuron-specific coding sequences are as highly conserved across mammalian species as ATPase coding sequences, the benchmark of evolutionary conservation, followed by heart and skeletal muscle-specific sequences. Neuronal diversity in mammalian evolution thus arises despite high levels of negative selection on neuron-specific protein-coding sequences. We propose that such strong evolutionary conservation is imposed by excitability, which continually exposes cells to the risk of excitotoxic death, and speculate that variability of neuronal cell sizes arises as a consequence of variability in levels of activity, possibly constrained by energy supply to the developing brain.

Significance StatementThe majority of cells in the mammalian body, including glial cells in the brain, maintain a constant size across species from mice to elephants. The exception is neurons, whose size varies over 100-fold both within each brain and across species, often becoming larger in larger brains. What evolutionary mechanism allows neurons to be so exceptionally diverse in size? We show that neuron-specific genes are some of the most highly conserved in mammalian evolution, which implicates alternate causes of diversity in neuronal cell size beyond heritable genetics. We propose a novel direction of research into how neuronal cell size diversity might be a self-organized response to variations in levels of activity, which are an exclusive property of excitable cells like neurons.

                Tau becomes abnormally hyper-phosphorylated and aggregated in tauopathies like Alzheimers disease (AD). As age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD, it is important to understand how tau protein itself, and the pathways implicated in its turnover, change during aging. We investigated age-related changes in total and phosphorylated tau in brain samples from two cohorts of cognitively normal individuals spanning 19-74 years, without overt neurodegeneration. One cohort utilised resected tissue and the other used post-mortem tissue. Total soluble tau levels declined with age in both cohorts. Phosphorylated tau was undetectable in the post-mortem tissue but was clearly evident in the resected tissue and did not undergo significant age-related change. To ascertain if the decline in soluble tau was correlated with age-related changes in autophagy, three markers of autophagy were tested but only two appeared to increase with age and the third was unchanged. This implies that in individuals who do not develop neurodegeneration, there is an age-related reduction in soluble tau which could potentially be due to age-related changes in autophagy. Thus, to explore how an age-related increase in autophagy might influence tau-mediated dysfunctions in vivo, autophagy was enhanced in a Drosophila model and all age-related tau phenotypes were significantly ameliorated. These data shed light on age-related physiological changes in proteins implicated in AD and highlights the need to study pathways that may be responsible for these changes. It also demonstrates the therapeutic potential of interventions that upregulate turnover of aggregate-prone proteins during aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different neural codes serve long and short-term memory functions in primate Hippocampus and Lateral Prefrontal Cortex during virtual navigation</a></h4>

              
                The primate hippocampus (HPC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are two brain structures deemed essential to long- and short-term memory functions respectively. Here we hypothesize that although both structures may encode similar information about the environment, the neural codes mediating neuronal communication in HPC and LPFC have differentially evolved to serve their corresponding memory functions. We used a virtual reality task in which animals navigated through a maze using a joystick and selected one of two targets in the arms of the maze according to a learned context-color rule. We found that neurons and neuronal populations in both regions encode similar information about the different task periods. Moreover, using statistical analyses and linear classifiers, we demonstrated that many HPC neurons concentrate spikes temporally into bursts, whereas most LPFC neurons sparsely distribute spikes over time. When integrating spike rates over short intervals, HPC neuronal ensembles reached maximum decoded information with fewer neurons than LPFC ensembles. We propose that HPC principal cells have evolved intrinsic properties that enable burst firing and temporal summation of synaptic potentials that ultimately facilitates synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. On the other hand, LPFC pyramidal cells have intrinsic properties that allow sparsely distributing spikes over time enabling encoding of short-term memories via persistent firing without necessarily triggering rapid changes in the synapses.

	<p>Little data are available for women diagnosed with a dual diagnosis. However, dual diagnosis in women presents increased stigma, social penalties, and barriers to access to treatment than it does for men. Indeed, it increases the probability of suffering physical or sexual abuse, violent victimization, gender-based violence, unemployment, social exclusion, social-role problems, and physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Thus, a transversal sex and gender-based perspective is required to adequately study and treat dual diagnosis. For this, sex and gender factors should be included in every scientific analysis; professionals should review their own prejudices and stereotypes and train themselves specifically from a gender perspective; administrations should design and provide specific treatment resources for women; and we could all contribute to a structural social transformation that goes beyond gender mandates and norms and reduces the risk of abuse and violence inflicted on women.</p>

	<p>Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance memory consolidation. It is currently unknown whether TMR reinforced by simultaneous tDCS has superior efficacy. In this study, we investigated the complementary effect of TMR and bilateral tDCS on the consolidation of emotionally neutral and negative declarative memories. Participants learned neutral and negative word pairs. Each word pair was presented with an emotionally compatible sound. Following learning, participants spent a 20 min retention interval awake under four possible conditions: (1) TMR alone (i.e., replay of 50% of the associated sounds), (2) TMR combined with anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC, (3) TMR combined with anodal stimulation of the right DLPFC and (4) TMR with sham tDCS. Results evidenced selective memory enhancement for the replayed stimuli in the TMR-only and TMR-sham conditions, which confirms a specific effect of TMR on memory. However, memory was enhanced at higher levels for all learned items (irrespective of TMR) in the TMR-anodal right and TMR-anodal left tDCS conditions, suggesting that the beneficial effects of tDCS overshadow the specific effects of TMR. Emotionally negative memories were not modulated by tDCS hemispheric polarity. We conclude that electrical stimulation of the DLPFC during the post-learning period globally benefits memory consolidation but does not potentiate the specific benefits of TMR.</p>

	<p>The distribution of single Stop Signal Reaction Times (SSRT) in the stop signal task (SST) has been modelled with two general methods: a nonparametric method by Hans Colonius (1990) and a Bayesian parametric method by Dora Matzke, Gordon Logan and colleagues (2013). These methods assume an equal impact of the preceding trial type (go/stop) in the SST trials on the SSRT distributional estimation without addressing the relaxed assumption. This study presents the required model by considering a two-state mixture model for the SSRT distribution. It then compares the Bayesian parametric single SSRT and mixture SSRT distributions in the usual stochastic order at the individual and the population level under ex-Gaussian (ExG) distributional format. It shows that compared to a single SSRT distribution, the mixture SSRT distribution is more varied, more positively skewed, more leptokurtic and larger in stochastic order. The size of the results’ disparities also depends on the choice of weights in the mixture SSRT distribution. This study confirms that mixture SSRT indices as a constant or distribution are significantly larger than their single SSRT counterparts in the related order. This result offers a vital improvement in the SSRT estimations.</p>

Here, we investigated a straightforward approach based on erythrocyte binding to promote antigen-specific tolerance to both peptides and proteins. We first identified a robust erythrocyte-binding ligand. A pool of one million fully d-chiral peptides was injected into mice,...

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Subsynaptic positioning of AMPARs by LRRTM2 controls synaptic strength</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent evidence suggests that nano-organization of proteins within synapses may control the strength of communication between neurons in the brain. The unique subsynaptic distribution of glutamate receptors, which cluster in nanoalignment with presynaptic sites of glutamate release, supports this hypothesis. However, testing it has been difficult because mechanisms controlling subsynaptic organization remain unknown. Reasoning that transcellular interactions could position AMPA receptors (AMPARs), we targeted a key transsynaptic adhesion molecule implicated in controlling AMPAR number, LRRTM2, using engineered, rapid proteolysis. Severing the LRRTM2 extracellular domain led quickly to nanoscale declustering of AMPARs away from release sites, not prompting their escape from synapses until much later. This rapid remodeling of AMPAR position produced significant deficits in evoked, but not spontaneous, postsynaptic receptor activation. These results dissociate receptor numbers from their nanopositioning in determination of synaptic function and support the novel concept that adhesion molecules acutely position receptors to dynamically control synaptic strength.</p>

                <p>Soft robotics revolutionized human-robot interactions, yet there exist persistent challenges for developing high-performance soft actuators that are powerful, rapid, controllable, safe, and portable. Here, we introduce a class of self-contained soft electrofluidic actuators (SEFAs), which can directly convert electrical energy into the mechanical energy of the actuators through electrically responsive fluids that drive the outside elastomer deformation. The use of special dielectric liquid enhances fluid flow capabilities, improving the actuation performance of the SEFAs. SEFAs are easily manufactured by using widely available materials and common fabrication techniques, and display excellent comprehensive performances in portability, controllability, rapid response, versatility, safety, and actuation. An artificial muscle stretching a joint and a soft bionic ray swimming in a tank demonstrate their effective performance. Hence, SEFAs offer a platform for developing soft actuators with potential applications in wearable assistant devices and soft robots.</p>

                <p>Mothers contribute cytoplasmic components to their progeny in a process called maternal provisioning. Provisioning is influenced by the parental environment, but the molecular pathways that transmit environmental cues between generations are not well understood. Here, we show that, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, social cues modulate maternal provisioning to regulate gene silencing in offspring. Intergenerational signal transmission depends on a pheromone-sensing neuron and neuronal FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe)&ndash;like peptides. Parental FMRFamide-like peptide signaling dampens oxidative stress resistance and promotes the deposition of mRNAs for translational components in progeny, which, in turn, reduces gene silencing. This study identifies a previously unknown pathway for intergenerational communication that links neuronal responses to maternal provisioning. We suggest that loss of social cues in the parental environment represents an adverse environment that stimulates stress responses across generations.</p>

                <p>Intensive building energy efficiency improvements can reduce emissions from energy use, improving outdoor air quality and human health, but may also affect ventilation and indoor air quality. This study examines the effects of highly ambitious, yet feasible, building energy efficiency upgrades in the United States. Our energy efficiency scenarios, derived from the literature, lead to a 6 to 11% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and 18 to 25% reductions in particulate matter (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>) emissions in 2050. These reductions are complementary with a carbon pricing policy on electricity. However, our results also point to the importance of mitigating indoor PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> emissions, improving PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> filtration, and evaluating ventilation-related policies. Even with no further ventilation improvements, we estimate that intensive energy efficiency scenarios could prevent 1800 to 3600 premature deaths per year across the United States in 2050. With further investments in indoor air quality, this can rise to 2900 to 5100.</p>

                <p>A three-dimensional microengineered human coronary artery&ndash;on&ndash;a&ndash;chip was developed for investigation of the mechanism by which low and oscillatory shear stress (OSS) induces pro-atherogenic changes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that OSS induced distinct changes in endothelial cells (ECs) including pro-inflammatory endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). OSS promoted pro-inflammatory EndMT through the Notch1/p38 MAPK&ndash;NF-B signaling axis. Moreover, OSS-induced EC phenotypic changes resulted in proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein up-regulation in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) through the RANTES-mediated paracrine mechanism. IL-37 suppressed OSS-induced pro-inflammatory EndMT and thereby abrogated SMC proliferation and ECM protein remodeling. Overall, this study provides insights into endothelial heterogeneity under atheroprone shear stress and identifies the mechanistic role of a novel EC subtype in promoting adverse vascular remodeling. Further, this study demonstrates that anti-inflammatory approach is capable of mitigating vascular pathobiology evoked by atheroprone shear stress.</p>

                <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)/graphene (Gr) heterostructures constitute a key component for two-dimensional devices. The operation of TMD/Gr devices relies on interfacial charge/energy transfer processes, which remains unclear and challenging to unravel. Fortunately, the coupled spin and valley index in TMDs adds a new degree of freedom to the charges and, thus, another dimension to spectroscopy. Here, by helicity-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy, we find that photoexcitation in TMDs transfers to graphene by asynchronous charge transfer, with one type of charge transferring in the order of femtoseconds and the other in picoseconds. The rate correlates well with energy offset between TMD and graphene, regardless of compositions and charge species. Spin-polarized hole injection or long-lived polarized hole can be achieved with deliberately designed heterostructures. This study shows helicity-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy as a powerful and facile approach to reveal the fundamental and complex charge/spin dynamics in TMD-based heterostructures, paving the way toward valleytronic and optoelectronic applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Identification and architecture of a putative secretion tube across mycobacterial outer envelope</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tuberculosis-causing mycobacteria have thick cell-wall and capsule layers that are formed from complex structures. Protein secretion across these barriers depends on a specialized protein secretion system, but none has been reported. We show that <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> Rv3705c and its homologous MSMEG_6251 in <I>Mycobacterium smegmatis</I> are tube-forming proteins in the mycobacterial envelope (TiME). Crystallographic and cryo-EM structures of these two proteins show that both proteins form rotationally symmetric rings. Two layers of TiME rings pack together in a tail-to-tail manner into a ring-shaped complex, which, in turn, stacks together to form tubes. <I>M. smegmatis</I> TiME was detected mainly in the cell wall and capsule. Knocking out the TiME gene markedly decreased the amount of secreted protein in the <I>M. smegmatis</I> culture medium, and expression of this gene in knocked-out strain partially restored the level of secreted protein. Our structure and functional data thus suggest that TiME forms a protein transport tube across the mycobacterial outer envelope.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Enhancing the heat tolerance of reef-building corals to future warming</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reef-building corals thriving in extreme thermal environments may provide genetic variation that can assist the evolution of populations to rapid climate warming. However, the feasibility and scale of genetic improvements remain untested despite ongoing population declines from recurrent thermal stress events. Here, we show that corals from the hottest reefs in the world transfer sufficient heat tolerance to a nai&#x0308;ve population sufficient to withstand end-of-century warming projections. Heat survival increased up to 84% when nai&#x0308;ve mothers were selectively bred with fathers from the hottest reefs because of strong heritable genetic effects. We identified genomic loci associated with tolerance variation that were enriched for heat shock proteins, oxidative stress, and immune functions. Unexpectedly, several coral families exhibited survival rates and genomic associations deviating from origin predictions, including a few nai&#x0308;ve purebreds with exceptionally high heat tolerance. Our findings highlight previously uncharacterized enhanced and intrinsic potential of coral populations to adapt to climate warming.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Organic and conservation agriculture promote ecosystem multifunctionality</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ecosystems provide multiple services to humans. However, agricultural systems are usually evaluated on their productivity and economic performance, and a systematic and quantitative assessment of the multifunctionality of agroecosystems including environmental services is missing. Using a long-term farming system experiment, we evaluated and compared the agronomic, economic, and ecological performance of the most widespread arable cropping systems in Europe: organic, conservation, and conventional agriculture. We analyzed 43 agroecosystem properties and determined overall agroecosystem multifunctionality. We show that organic and conservation agriculture promoted ecosystem multifunctionality, especially by enhancing regulating and supporting services, including biodiversity preservation, soil and water quality, and climate mitigation. In contrast, conventional cropping showed reduced multifunctionality but delivered highest yield. Organic production resulted in higher economic performance, thanks to higher product prices and additional support payments. Our results demonstrate that different cropping systems provide opposing services, enforcing the productivity&ndash;environmental protection dilemma for agroecosystem functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">X-ray free-electron laser studies reveal correlated motion during isopenicillin N synthase catalysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Isopenicillin <I>N</I> synthase (IPNS) catalyzes the unique reaction of <scp>l</scp>--(&alpha;-aminoadipoyl)-<scp>l</scp>-cysteinyl-<scp>d</scp>-valine (ACV) with dioxygen giving isopenicillin <I>N</I> (IPN), the precursor of all natural penicillins and cephalosporins. X-ray free-electron laser studies including time-resolved crystallography and emission spectroscopy reveal how reaction of IPNS:Fe(II):ACV with dioxygen to yield an Fe(III) superoxide causes differences in active site volume and unexpected conformational changes that propagate to structurally remote regions. Combined with solution studies, the results reveal the importance of protein dynamics in regulating intermediate conformations during conversion of ACV to IPN. The results have implications for catalysis by multiple IPNS-related oxygenases, including those involved in the human hypoxic response, and highlight the power of serial femtosecond crystallography to provide insight into long-range enzyme dynamics during reactions presently impossible for nonprotein catalysts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Predicting and characterizing a cancer dependency map of tumors with deep learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Genome-wide loss-of-function screens have revealed genes essential for cancer cell proliferation, called cancer dependencies. It remains challenging to link cancer dependencies to the molecular compositions of cancer cells or to unscreened cell lines and further to tumors. Here, we present DeepDEP, a deep learning model that predicts cancer dependencies using integrative genomic profiles. It uses a unique unsupervised pretraining that captures unlabeled tumor genomic representations to improve the learning of cancer dependencies. We demonstrated DeepDEP&rsquo;s improvement over conventional machine learning methods and validated the performance with three independent datasets. By systematic model interpretations, we extended the current dependency maps with functional characterizations of dependencies and a proof-of-concept in silico assay of synthetic essentiality. We applied DeepDEP to pan-cancer tumor genomics and built the first pan-cancer synthetic dependency map of 8000 tumors with clinical relevance. In summary, DeepDEP is a novel tool for investigating cancer dependency with rapidly growing genomic resources.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Identification and assessment of cardiolipin interactions with E. coli inner membrane proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>Integral membrane proteins are localized and/or regulated by lipids present in the surrounding bilayer. While bacteria have relatively simple membranes, there is ample evidence that many bacterial proteins bind to specific lipids, especially the anionic lipid cardiolipin. Here, we apply molecular dynamics simulations to assess lipid binding to 42 different <I>Escherichia coli</I> inner membrane proteins. Our data reveal an asymmetry between the membrane leaflets, with increased anionic lipid binding to the inner leaflet regions of the proteins, particularly for cardiolipin. From our simulations, we identify &gt;700 independent cardiolipin binding sites, allowing us to identify the molecular basis of a prototypical cardiolipin binding site, which we validate against structures of bacterial proteins bound to cardiolipin. This allows us to construct a set of metrics for defining a high-affinity cardiolipin binding site on bacterial membrane proteins, paving the way for a heuristic approach to defining other protein-lipid interactions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A dual-phase alloy with ultrahigh strength-ductility synergy over a wide temperature range</a></h4>

              
                <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs), as an emerging class of materials, have pointed a pathway in developing alloys with interesting property combinations. Although they are not exempted from the strength-ductility trade-off, they present a standing chance in overcoming this challenge. Here, we report results for a precipitation-strengthening strategy, by tuning composition to design a CoNiV-based face-centered cubic/B2 duplex HEA. This alloy sustains ultrahigh gigapascal-level tensile yield strengths and excellent ductility from cryogenic to elevated temperatures. The highest specific yield strength (~150.2 MPa&middot;cm<sup>3</sup>/g) among reported ductile HEAs is obtained. The ability of the alloy presented here to sustain this excellent strength-ductility synergy over a wide temperature range is aided by multiple deformation mechanisms i.e., twins, stacking faults, dynamic strain aging, and dynamic recrystallization. Our results open the avenue for designing precipitation-strengthened lightweight HEAs with advanced strength-ductility combinations over a wide service temperature range.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Gene therapy with AR isoform 2 rescues spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy phenotype by modulating AR transcriptional activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked, adult-onset neuromuscular condition caused by an abnormal polyglutamine (polyQ) tract expansion in androgen receptor (AR) protein. SBMA is a disease with high unmet clinical need. Recent studies have shown that mutant AR-altered transcriptional activity is key to disease pathogenesis. Restoring the transcriptional dysregulation without affecting other AR critical functions holds great promise for the treatment of SBMA and other AR-related conditions; however, how this targeted approach can be achieved and translated into a clinical application remains to be understood. Here, we characterized the role of AR isoform 2, a naturally occurring variant encoding a truncated AR lacking the polyQ-harboring domain, as a regulatory switch of AR genomic functions in androgen-responsive tissues. Delivery of this isoform using a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector type 9 resulted in amelioration of the disease phenotype in SBMA mice by restoring polyQ AR&ndash;dysregulated transcriptional activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">First two years of reimbursed enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of Fabry disease in Poland [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Fabry disease (FD) is an ultra-rare genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by pathologic gene variants resulting in insufficient expression of α-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine in plasma and in different cells throughout the body, causing major cardiovascular, renal, and nervous system complications. Until 2018, reimbursed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD was available in all European Union countries except Poland.             We present the preliminary results of the first two years of reimbursed ERT in Poland. We obtained data from the seven largest academic centers in Katowice, Kraków, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk, Warszawa, and Łódź. The questionnaire included the following data: number of patients treated, number of patients qualified for ERT, and patient characteristics.             All centers returned completed questionnaires that included data for a total of 71 patients (28 men and 43 women) as of June 2021. Thirty-five patients with the diagnosis of FD confirmed by genetic testing (22 men and 13 women) had already qualified for reimbursed ERT. Mean (SD) age at the commencement of the ERT program was 39.6 (15.5) years (range 18-79 years). Mean time from the first clinical symptoms reported by the patients to the FD diagnosis was 21.1 (8.9) years, and the mean time from the final diagnosis of FD to the beginning of ERT was 4.7 (4.6) years.             FD is still underdiagnosed in Poland. To identify undiagnosed FD patients and to ensure that patients in Poland benefit fully from ERT, implementation of an effective nationwide screening strategy and close cooperation with a network of rare disease centers is advised.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modifications to the delivery of NHS face-to-face general practice consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in England [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To minimise transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, delivery of English general practice consultations was modified in March 2020 to enable separation of diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 patients from others. Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted face-to-face contact used only when clinically necessary. This study aimed to identify the modified face-to-face delivery models used nationwide in spring/summer 2020. Information was also sought concerning COVID-19 outbreaks linked to English general practice. Methods: In June 2020, a survey was sent by email to the 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England to identify local organisation of face-to-face general practice consultations since March 2020. An email was  sent to Public Health England (PHE) requesting data on COVID-19 outbreaks linked to general practice. Results: All CCGs responded. Between March and July 2020, separation of COVID-19 patients from others was achieved using combinations of the following models: zoned surgeries (reported by 47% of CCGs), where COVID-19 and other patients were separated within their own practice; ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ hubs (reported by 90% of CCGs), separate sites where COVID-19 or other patients registered at one of several collaborating practices were seen; ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ home visits (reported by 70% of CCGs). One of seven combinations of these models was used across each CCG, with some flexibility shown according to changing demand through hub availability. PHE data indicated 25 possible or confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks or clusters in English general practice to July 31st 2020. Conclusions: Varied, flexible ways of delivering face-to-face general practice consultations were identified.  Analysis of the modified delivery in terms of management of COVID-19 and other conditions, and impacts on staff and patients, together with learning from investigations into confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks, may both aid future pandemic management and identify beneficial elements for practice beyond this.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The interplay between vaccination and social distancing strategies affects COVID19 population-level outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sharon Guerstein, Victoria Romeo-Aznar, Ma’ayan Dekel, Oren Miron, Nadav Davidovitch, Rami Puzis, Shai Pilosof</p>

Social distancing is an effective population-level mitigation strategy to prevent COVID19 propagation but it does not reduce the number of susceptible individuals and bears severe social consequences—a dire situation that can be overcome with the recently developed vaccines. Although a combination of these interventions should provide greater benefits than their isolated deployment, a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between them is missing. To tackle this challenge we developed an age-structured deterministic model in which vaccines are deployed during the pandemic to individuals who do not show symptoms. The model allows for flexible and dynamic prioritization strategies with shifts between target groups. We find a strong interaction between social distancing and vaccination in their effect on the proportion of hospitalizations. In particular, prioritizing vaccines to elderly (60+) before adults (20-59) is more effective when social distancing is applied to adults or uniformly. In addition, the temporal reproductive number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> is only affected by vaccines when deployed at sufficiently high rates and in tandem with social distancing. Finally, the same reduction in hospitalization can be achieved via different combination of strategies, giving decision makers flexibility in choosing public health policies. Our study provides insights into the factors that affect vaccination success and provides methodology to test different intervention strategies in a way that will align with ethical guidelines.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating the conditional probability of developing human papilloma virus related oropharyngeal cancer by combining machine learning and inverse Bayesian modelling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Prerna Tewari, Eugene Kashdan, Cathal Walsh, Cara M. Martin, Andrew C. Parnell, John J. O’Leary</p>

The epidemic increase in the incidence of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) related Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinomas (OPSCCs) in several countries worldwide represents a significant public health concern. Although gender neutral HPV vaccination programmes are expected to cause a reduction in the incidence rates of OPSCCs, these effects will not be evident in the foreseeable future. Secondary prevention strategies are currently not feasible due to an incomplete understanding of the natural history of oral HPV infections in OPSCCs. The key parameters that govern natural history models remain largely ill-defined for HPV related OPSCCs and cannot be easily inferred from experimental data. Mathematical models have been used to estimate some of these ill-defined parameters in cervical cancer, another HPV related cancer leading to successful implementation of cancer prevention strategies. We outline a “double-Bayesian” mathematical modelling approach, whereby, a Bayesian machine learning model first estimates the probability of an individual having an oral HPV infection, given OPSCC and other covariate information. The model is then inverted using Bayes’ theorem to reverse the probability relationship. We use data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, SEER Head and Neck with HPV Database and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), representing the adult population in the United States to derive our model. The model contains 8,106 OPSCC patients of which 73.0% had an oral HPV infection. When stratified by age, sex, marital status and race/ethnicity, the model estimated a higher conditional probability for developing OPSCCs given an oral HPV infection in non-Hispanic White males and females compared to other races/ethnicities. The proposed Bayesian model represents a proof-of-concept of a natural history model of HPV driven OPSCCs and outlines a strategy for estimating the conditional probability of an individual’s risk of developing OPSCC following an oral HPV infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Faculty readiness for online teaching at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University during the COVID-19 crisis: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education sector around the world. In order to control the spread of the virus, eLearning practice has been introduced in Saudi higher education. Such online communication has become an important tool to narrow the teaching practice gap. This study assessed the characteristics of eLearning and distance learning and the inclination of Imam Abdulrahman BinFaisal University (IAU) faculty members in terms of skills, and managing classes and tests using online learning tools. Methods: A QuestionPro questionnaire with 22 questions on eLearning experience, training experience, and skills and knowledge in the educational process of IAU teaching faculty was conducted through the online university e-mail domain. The questionnaire was sent to the IAU’s teaching faculty. The questionnaire’s reliability was studied using Cronbach’s a coefficient. The criterion value was statistically studied using the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) and Bartlett’s test. The variables associated with the present survey model were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results: The study showed positive responses and readiness (skills and abilities) and the effectiveness of IAU’s faculty members to perform e-learning activities during COVID-19. IAU faculty received a strong positive response, and the respondents were also impressed with and agreed on trainer knowledge, session management, communication and expertise on training topics. Conclusions: The positive response indicates the readiness of IAU to provide the necessary support (tools, information and updates) required for a successful online educational process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A signaling pathway-driven bioinformatics pipeline for predicting therapeutics against emerging infectious diseases [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a novel Betacoronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. The virus has since caused a worldwide pandemic that highlights the need to quickly identify potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments that can reduce the signs, symptoms, and/or spread of disease when dealing with a novel infectious agent. To combat this problem, we constructed a computational pipeline that uniquely combines existing tools to predict drugs and biologics that could be repurposed to combat an emerging pathogen. Methods: Our workflow analyzes RNA-sequencing data to determine differentially expressed genes, enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and dysregulated pathways in infected cells, which can then be used to identify US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that target human proteins within these pathways. We used this pipeline to perform a meta-analysis of RNA-seq data from cells infected with three Betacoronavirus species including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; MERS), and SARS-CoV-2, as well as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus to identify therapeutics that could be used to treat COVID-19.  Results: This analysis identified twelve existing drugs, most of which already have FDA-approval, that are predicted to counter the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results were cross-referenced with interventional clinical trials and other studies in the literature to identify drugs on our list that had previously been identified or used as treatments for COIVD-19 including canakinumab, anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, and baricitinib. Conclusions: While the results reported here are specific to Betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, our bioinformatics pipeline can be used to quickly identify candidate therapeutics for future emerging infectious diseases.

                Urbanization contributes to the emerging urban areas across the world. The importance of geology to ensure sustainability, has led to many research publications in the urban geology. This paper aims to discover the research trends through a bibliometric analysis of articles indexed within the Scopus database from 1950 to 2018 on topics related to geology and urban. The analysis found a significant increase in publications during 1999-2016, especially after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami disaster. The next finding of this study is related to research interest clusters: engineering geological hazard investigation and risk assessment in the urban area (EGR); social geology and urban sustainability (SGS); and urban hydrology and water management (HGW). The EGR studies were mostly in underground engineering geology (geotechnics). In contrast, the least attention was given to the interaction between geology and land-use planning, due to the SGS issues (e.g., urban planning and land use suitability assessment). This study may serve as a platform for scholars to understand the current status and future directions of urban geology.

     alt="A sex-specific feedback projection from aromatase-expressing neurons in the medial amygdala to the accessory olfactory bulb"/>
<p>Aromatase neurons are distributed in clustered populations primarily in a network of brain regions (red) devoted to social behavior. Out of all potential sources of aromatase neurons, only the ventral medial amygdala projects back to the accessory olfactory bulb. The population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the ventral medial amygdala also expresses Erα and displays two sex differences: 1) aromatase-expressing neurons are larger in females; 2) there are more aromatase-expressing neurons in male mice.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) plays a critical role in classifying pheromonal signals. Here we identify two previously undescribed sources of aromatase signaling in the AOB: 1) A population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the AOB itself; 2) A tract of aromatase-expressing axons which originate in the ventral medial amygdala (MEA) and terminate in the AOB. Using a retrograde tracer in conjunction with a transgenic strategy to label aromatase-expressing neurons throughout the brain, we found that a single contiguous population of neurons in the ventral MEA provides the only significant feedback by aromatase-expressing neurons to the AOB. This population expresses the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and displayed anatomical sex-differences in the number of neurons (higher in male mice) and the size of cell bodies (larger in females). Given the previously established relationship between aromatase-expression, estrogen signaling, and the function of sexually dimorphic circuits, we suggest that this feed-back population is well-positioned to provide neuroendocrine feedback to modulate sensory processing of social stimuli in the AOB.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1, α2, and α3 subunits cause a wide range of disabling neurological disorders, and dysfunction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to neuronal injury in stroke and dementia. To better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is important to determine the expression patterns of the different Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits within the brain and among specific cell types. Using two available scRNA-Seq databases from the adult mouse nervous system, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of the different isoforms of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α, β and <i>Fxyd</i> subunits at the single cell level among brain regions and various neuronal populations. We subsequently identified specific types of neurons enriched with transcripts for α1 and α3 isoforms and elaborated how α3-expressing neuronal populations govern cerebellar neuronal circuits. We further analyzed the co-expression network for α1 and α3 isoforms, highlighting the genes that positively correlated with α1 and α3 expression. The top ten genes for α1 were <i>Chn2</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Selm, Kcnc1</i>, <i>Snrk, Snap25, Ckb and Ccndbp1</i> and for α3 were <i>Sorcs3</i>, <i>Eml5</i>, <i>Neurod2</i>, <i>Ckb</i>, <i>Tbc1d4, Ptprz1, Pvrl1, Kirrel3, Pvalb, and Asic2</i>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">TRAIT2D: a Software for Quantitative Analysis of Single Particle Diffusion Data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Single particle tracking (SPT) is one of the most widely used tools in optical microscopy to evaluate particle mobility in a variety of situations, including cellular and model membrane dynamics. Recent technological developments, such as Interferometric Scattering microscopy, have allowed recording of long, uninterrupted single particle trajectories at kilohertz framerates. The resulting data, where particles are continuously detected and do not displace much between observations, thereby do not require complex linking algorithms. Moreover, while these measurements offer more details into the short-term diffusion behaviour of the tracked particles, they are also subject to the influence of localisation uncertainties, which are often underestimated by conventional analysis pipelines. we thus developed a Python library, under the name of TRAIT2D (Tracking Analysis Toolbox – 2D version), in order to track particle diffusion at high sampling rates, and analyse the resulting trajectories with an innovative approach. The data analysis pipeline introduced is more localisation-uncertainty aware, and also selects the most appropriate diffusion model for the data provided on a statistical basis. A trajectory simulation platform also allows the user to handily generate trajectories and even synthetic time-lapses to test alternative tracking algorithms and data analysis approaches. A high degree of customisation for the analysis pipeline, for example with the introduction of different diffusion modes, is possible from the source code. Finally, the presence of graphical user interfaces lowers the access barrier for users with little to no programming experience.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of tuberculosis training on community health workers’ knowledge: a cluster randomized control trial in South Nigeria [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intensified efforts to improve tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are needed to meet global EndTB targets. Community health workers’ (CHWs) knowledge with respect to case finding is vital in tuberculosis elimination. This study aimed to determine the effect of tuberculosis training on the knowledge of community health workers in Nigeria. Methods: As part of a larger multicomponent intervention study, a randomised control trial was conducted with CHWs in 18 primary health care (PHC) clusters in Nigeria. The clusters were allocated to three arms: training and cash incentive (A), training only (B), and control (C) arms. Arms (A) and (B) received training on tuberculosis symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment while the control arm (C) did not receive training. Participants’ knowledge on tuberculosis was assessed using questionnaires administered pre- and post-intervention. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Descriptive data was presented in tables and bivariate data was analyzed using chi square. Statistical significance was set as P<0.05. Results: There was a significant increase in the total knowledge score (25.4%), knowledge of general symptoms (24.4%), prevention (22.6%) and diagnosis and treatment (30.0%) across all study arms post-intervention (p<0.0001). Compared with the control arm, the training arm (A) had a higher proportion of good total knowledge score (94.4%) and arm (B) had a lower proportion of good total knowledge score (83.1%) when compared to the control group (93.1%). These were, however, not statistically significant. Conclusions: An improvement in the CHWs’ knowledge of symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis was observed after a training intervention was done. Integration of routine tuberculosis training is recommended to improve tuberculosis case finding in high burden communities.

                Novel SARS-CoV-2 antigenic variants jeopardize the efficacy of immunotherapies. Makdasi et al. re-evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs previously shown to be highly effective against the original version of the virus. Some of the inspected antibodies retain their neutralization ability and in vivo protective efficacy against various viral variants.

                Performance monitoring is a key cognitive function, allowing to detect mistakes and adapt future behavior. Post-decisional neural signals have been identified that are sensitive to decision accuracy, decision confidence and subsequent adaptation. Here, we review recent work that supports an understanding of late error/confidence signals in terms of the computational process of post-decisional evidence accumulation. We argue that the error positivity, a positive-going centro-parietal potential measured through scalp electrophysiology, reflects the post-decisional evidence accumulation process itself, which follows a boundary crossing event corresponding to initial decision commitment. This proposal provides a powerful explanation for both the morphological characteristics of the signal and its relation to various expressions of performance monitoring. Moreover, it suggests that the error positivity –a signal with thus far unique properties in cognitive neuroscience – can be leveraged to furnish key new insights into the inputs to, adaptation, and consequences of the post-decisional accumulation process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">N501Y mutation of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 strengthens its binding to receptor ACE2</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world for the past year. Recently, several variants such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma), sharing a key mutation N501Y on the RBD, appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed cell surface binding assay, kinetics study, single-molecule technique, and computational method to investigate the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction, with a faster association rate and slower dissociation rate. Consistently, atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force microscopy quantifies their strength showing a higher binding probability and unbinding force for the mutation. Molecular dynamics simulations of RBD-ACE2 complexes indicated that the N501Y introduced additional π-π and π-cation interaction for the higher force/interaction. Taken together, we suggested that the reinforced interaction from N501Y mutation in RBD should play an essential role in the higher transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants and future mutations in the RBD of the virus should be under surveillance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An engineered transcriptional reporter of protein localization identifies regulators of mitochondrial and ER membrane protein trafficking in high-throughput CRISPRi screens</a></h4>

              
                The trafficking of specific protein cohorts to correct subcellular locations at correct times is essential for every signaling and regulatory process in biology. Gene perturbation screens could provide a powerful approach to probe the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking, but only if protein localization or mislocalization can be tied to a simple and robust phenotype for cell selection, such as cell proliferation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To empower the study of protein trafficking processes with gene perturbation, we developed a genetically-encoded molecular tool named HiLITR. HiLITR converts protein colocalization into proteolytic release of a membrane-anchored transcription factor, which drives the expression of a chosen reporter gene. Using HiLITR in combination with FACS-based CRISPRi screening in human cell lines, we identified genes that influence the trafficking of mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored proteins. We show that loss of the SUMO E1 component SAE1 results in mislocalization and destabilization of many mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate a distinct regulatory role for EMC10 in the ER membrane complex, opposing the transmembrane-domain insertion activity of the complex. Through transcriptional integration of complex cellular functions, HiLITR expands the scope of biological processes that can be studied by genetic perturbation screening technologies.

                Using a self-generated hypoxic assay, we show that the amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> displays a remarkable collective aerotactic behavior. When a cell colony is covered, cells quickly consume the available oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and form a dense ring moving outwards at constant speed and density. To decipher this collective process, we combined two technological developments: porphyrin-based O<sub>2</sub> -sensing films and microfluidic O<sub>2</sub> gradient generators. We showed that <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells exhibit aerotactic and aerokinetic response in a low range of O<sub>2</sub> concentration indicative of a very efficient detection mechanism. Cell behaviors under self-generated or imposed O<sub>2</sub> gradients were modeled using an in silico cellular Potts model built on experimental observations. This computational model was complemented with a parsimonious ‘Go or Grow’ partial differential equation (PDE) model. In both models, we found that the collective migration of a dense ring can be explained by the interplay between cell division and the modulation of aerotaxis.

                Identifying the key vector and host species that drive the transmission of zoonotic pathogens is notoriously difficult but critical for disease control. We present a nested approach for quantifying the importance of host and vectors that integrates species' physiological competence with their ecological traits. We apply this framework to a medically important arbovirus, Ross River virus (RRV), in Brisbane, Australia. We find that vertebrate hosts with high physiological competence are not the most important for community transmission; interactions between hosts and vectors largely underpin the importance of host species. For vectors, physiological competence is highly important. Our results identify primary and secondary vectors of RRV and suggest two potential transmission cycles in Brisbane: an enzootic cycle involving birds and an urban cycle involving humans. The framework accounts for uncertainty from each fitted statistical model in estimates of species' contributions to transmission and has has direct application to other zoonotic pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Probing the effect of clustering on EphA2 receptor signaling efficiency by subcellular control of ligand-receptor mobility</a></h4>

              
                Clustering of ligand:receptor complexes on the cell membrane is widely presumed to have functional consequences for subsequent signal transduction. However, it is experimentally challenging to selectively manipulate receptor clustering without altering other biochemical aspects of the cellular system. Here, we develop a microfabrication strategy to produce substrates displaying mobile and immobile ligands that are separated by roughly one micron, and thus experience an identical cytoplasmic signaling state, enabling precision comparison of downstream signaling reactions. Applying this approach to characterize the ephrinA1:EphA2 signaling system reveals that EphA2 clustering enhances both receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling activity. Single molecule imaging clearly resolves increased molecular binding dwell times at EphA2 clusters for both Grb2:SOS and NCK:N-WASP signaling modules. This type of intracellular comparison enables a substantially higher degree of quantitative analysis than is possible when comparisons must be made between different cells and essentially eliminates the effects of cellular response to ligand manipulation.

                DLK is a key regulator of axon regeneration and degeneration in response to neuronal injury. To understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the DLK function, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening analysis and identified FKBPL as a DLK-binding protein that bound to the kinase domain and inhibited the kinase enzymatic activity of DLK. FKBPL regulated DLK stability through ubiquitin-dependent DLK degradation. We tested other members in the FKBP protein family and found that FKBP8 also induced DLK degradation as FKBPL did. We found that Lysine 271 residue in the kinase domain of DLK was a major site of ubiquitination and SUMO3-conjugation and responsible for FKBP8-mediated degradation. In vivo overexpression of FKBP8 delayed progression of axon degeneration and neuronal death following axotomy in sciatic and optic nerves, respectively, although axon regeneration efficiency was not enhanced. This research identified FKBPL and FKBP8 as new DLK-interacting proteins that regulated DLK stability by MG-132 or bafilomycin A1-sensitive protein degradation.

                Motor systems must continuously adapt their output to maintain a desired trajectory. While the spinal circuits underlying rhythmic locomotion are well described, little is known about how the network modulates its output strength. A major challenge has been the difficulty of recording from spinal neurons during behavior. Here, we use voltage imaging to map the membrane potential of glutamatergic neurons throughout the spinal cord of the larval zebrafish during fictive swimming in a virtual environment. We mapped the spiking, subthreshold dynamics, relative timing, and sub-cellular electrical propagation across large populations of simultaneously recorded cells. We validated the approach by confirming properties of known sub-types, and we characterized a yet undescribed sub-population of tonic-spiking ventral V3 neurons whose spike rate correlated with swimming strength and bout length. Optogenetic activation of V3 neurons led to stronger swimming and longer bouts but did not affect tail-beat frequency. Genetic ablation of V3 neurons led to reduced locomotor adaptation. The power of voltage imaging allowed us to identify V3 neurons as a critical driver of locomotor adaptation in zebrafish.

                2Perception cycles through periods of enhanced and reduced sensitivity to external information. Here, we asked whether such infra-slow oscillations arise as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited processing capacity or, alternatively, represent a structured mechanism of perceptual inference. Using two large-scale datasets, we found that humans and mice waver between alternating intervals of externally- and internally-oriented modes of sensory analysis. During external mode, perception was more sensitive to external sensory information, whereas internal mode was characterized by enhanced biases toward perceptual history. Computational modeling indicated that dynamic changes in mode are governed by two interlinked factors: (i), the integration of subsequent stimuli over time and, (ii), infra-slow anti-phase oscillations in the perceptual impact of external sensory information versus internal predictions that are provided by perceptual history. Between-mode fluctuations may benefit perception by enabling the generation of stable representations of the environment despite an ongoing stream of noisy sensory inputs.

                The dynamical and physiological basis of alpha band activity and 1/f{beta} noise in the EEG are the subject of continued speculation. Here we conjecture, on the basis of empirical data analysis, that both of these features may be economically accounted for through a single process if the resting EEG is conceived of being the sum of multiple stochastically perturbed alpha band damped linear oscillators with a distribution of dampings (relaxation rates). The modulation of alpha-band and 1/f{beta} noise activity by changes in damping is explored in eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting state EEG. We aim to estimate the distribution of dampings by solving an inverse problem applied to EEG power spectra. The characteristics of the damping distribution are examined across subjects, sensors and recording condition (EC/EO). We find that there are robust changes in the damping distribution between EC and EO recording conditions across participants. The estimated damping distributions are found to be predominantly bimodal, with the number and position of the modes related to the sharpness of the alpha resonance and the scaling ({beta}) of the power spectrum (1/f{beta}). The results suggest that there exists an intimate relationship between resting state alpha activity and 1/f{beta} noise with changes in both governed by changes to the damping of the underlying alpha oscillatory processes. In particular, alpha-blocking is observed to be the result of the most weakly damped distribution mode becoming more heavily damped. The results suggest a novel way of characterizing resting EEG power spectra and provides new insight into the central role that damped alpha-band activity may play in characterising the spatio-temporal features of resting state EEG.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Hybrid Drive: a chronic implant device combining tetrode arrays with silicon probes for layer-resolved ensemble electrophysiology in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the function of brain cortices requires simultaneous investigation at multiple spatial and temporal scales and to link neural activity to an animals behavior. A major challenge is to measure within- and across-layer information in actively behaving animals, in particular in mice that have become a major species in neuroscience due to an extensive genetic toolkit. Here we describe the Hybrid Drive, a new chronic implant for mice that combines tetrode arrays to record within-layer information with silicon probes to simultaneously measure across-layer information. The flexible, open-source design allows custom spatial arrangements of tetrode arrays and silicon probes to generate areas-specific layouts. We show that large numbers of neurons and layer-resolved local field potentials can be recorded from the same brain region across weeks without loss in electrophysiological signal quality. The drives light-weight structure ({approx} 3.5 g) leaves animal behavior largely unchanged during a variety of experimental paradigms, enabling the study of rich, naturalistic behaviors. We demonstrate the power of the Hybrid Drive in a series of experiments linking the spiking activity of CA1 pyramidal layer neurons to the oscillatory activity across hippocampal layers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fine multi-coil electronic control of transcranial magnetic stimulation: effects of stimulus orientation and intensity</a></h4>

              
                Despite the evident benefit of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe human brain function and treat neurological diseases, current technology allows only a slow, mechanical adjustment of the electric filed orientation. Automated and fast control of the TMS orientation is critical to enable synchronizing the stimulation with the ongoing brain activity. We overcome these limitations with a two-coil electronically controlled TMS transducer to define precisely the pulse orientation ([~]1{degrees} steps) without mechanical movement. We validated the technology by determining the dependency of motor evoked responses on the stimulus orientation and intensity with high angular resolution. The motor response was found to follow a logistic function of the stimulus orientation, which helps to disentangle the TMS neuronal effects. The electronic control of the TMS electric field is a decisive step towards automated brain stimulation protocols with enhanced accuracy of stimulus targeting and timing for better diagnostics and improved clinical efficacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurons undergo pathogenic metabolic reprograming in models of familial ALS</a></h4>

              
                Normal cellular function requires a rate of ATP production sufficient to meet demand. In most neurodegenerative diseases (including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS), mitochondrial dysfunction is postulated raising the possibility of impaired ATP production and a need for compensatory maneuvers to sustain the ATP production/demand balance. We find in our rodent models of familial ALS (fALS), impairment in neuronal glycolytic flux with maintained or enhanced activity of the citric acid cycle. This rewiring of metabolism is associated with normal ATP levels and redox status, supporting the notion that mitochondrial function is not compromised in neurons expressing fALS genes. Genetic loss-of-function manipulation of individual steps in the glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway blunt the negative phenotypes seen in various fALS models. We propose that neurons adjust fuel utilization in the setting of neurodegenerative disease-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in a baleful manner and targeting this process can be healthful.

                NG2 glia represent a distinct type of macroglial cells in the CNS and are unique among glia because they receive synaptic input from neurons. They are abundantly present in white and grey matter. While the majority of white matter NG2 glia differentiates into oligodendrocytes, the physiological impact of grey matter NG2 glia and their synaptic input are ill defined yet. Here we asked whether dysfunctional NG2 glia affect neuronal signaling and behavior. We generated mice with inducible deletion of the K+ channel Kir4.1 in NG2 glia and performed comparative electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, molecular and behavioral analyses. Focussing on the hippocampus, we found that loss of the Kir4.1 potentiated synaptic depolarizations of NG2 glia and enhanced the expression of myelin basic protein. Notably, while mice with targeted deletion of the K+ channel in NG2 glia showed impaired long term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses, they demonstrated improved spatial memory as revealed by testing new object location recognition. Our data demonstrate that proper NG2 glia function is critical for normal brain function and behavior.

                Induced pluripotent stem cells generated from patients with geographic atrophy as well as healthy individuals were differentiated to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. By integrating transcriptional profiles of 127,659 RPE cells generated from 43 individuals with geographic atrophy and 36 controls with genotype data, we identified 439 expression Quantitative Trait (eQTL) loci in cis that were associated with disease status and specific to subpopulations of RPE cells. We identified loci linked to two genes with known associations with geographic atrophy - PILRB and PRPH2, in addition to 43 genes with significant genotype x disease interactions that are candidates for novel genetic associations for geographic atrophy. On a transcriptome-only level, we identified molecular pathways significantly upregulated in geographic atrophy-RPE including in extracellular cellular matrix reorganisation, neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial functions. We subsequently implemented a large-scale proteomics analysis, confirming modification in proteins associated with these pathways. We also identified six significant protein (p) QTL that regulate protein expression in the RPE cells and in geographic atrophy - two of which share variants with cis-eQTL. Transcriptome-wide association analysis identified genes at loci previously associated with age-related macular degeneration. Further analysis conditional on disease status, implicated statistically significant RPE-specific eQTL. This study uncovers important differences in RPE homeostasis associated with geographic atrophy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spinal cord synaptic plasticity by GlyRβ release from receptor fields and syndapin-dependent uptake</a></h4>

              
                Glycine receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission is key for spinal cord function. Recent observations suggested that by largely elusive mechanisms also glycinergic synapses display synaptic plasticity. We here identify syndapin I as critical player. Interestingly, syndapin I cooperates but in part also competes with gephyrin. Syndapin I deficiency led to fragmentation of glycine receptor fields, more disperse receptors and increased receptor mobility. Kainate treatment highlighted syndapin Is importance even more. Our analyses unveiled that PKC-mediated S403 phosphorylation-mediated glycine receptor {beta} decoupling from gephyrin scaffolds simultaneously promoted syndapin I association. In line, kainate-treated syndapin I KO spinal cords showed even more severe receptor field fragmentation. Furthermore, syndapin I deficiency completely disrupted kainate-induced glycine receptor internalization. Together, this unveiled important mechanisms controlling the number and organization of glycine receptor fields at inhibitory postsynapses during both steady-state and kainate-induced synaptic rearrangement - principles organizing and fine-tuning synaptic efficacy of inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord.

	<p>Survivors of severe brain injury may require care in a neurointensive care unit (neuro-ICU), where the brain is vulnerable to secondary brain injury. Thus, there is a need for noninvasive, bedside, continuous cerebral blood flow monitoring approaches in the neuro-ICU. Our goal is to address this need through combined measurements of EEG and functional optical spectroscopy (EEG-Optical) instrumentation and analysis to provide a complementary fusion of data about brain activity and function. We utilized the diffuse correlation spectroscopy method for assessing cerebral blood flow at the neuro-ICU in a patient with traumatic brain injury. The present case demonstrates the feasibility of continuous recording of noninvasive cerebral blood flow transients that correlated well with the gold-standard invasive measurements and with the frequency content changes in the EEG data.</p>

	<p>Mirror visual feedback (MVF) has been shown to increase the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) during asynchronous bimanual movement. However, the functional networks underlying this process remain unclear. We recruited 16 healthy volunteers to perform asynchronous bimanual movement, that is, their left hand performed partial range of movement while their right hand performed normal full range of movement. Their ongoing brain activities were recorded by whole-head magnetoencephalography during the movement. Participants were required to keep both hands stationary in the control condition. In the other two conditions, participants were required to perform asynchronous bimanual movement with MVF (Asy_M) and without MVF (Asy_w/oM). Greater M1 excitability was found under Asy_M than under Asy_w/oM. More importantly, when receiving MVF, the visual cortex reduced its functional connection to brain regions associated with perceptuo-motor-attentional process (i.e., M1, superior temporal gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). This is the first study to demonstrate a global functional network of MVF during asynchronous bimanual movement, providing a foundation for future research to examine the neural mechanisms of mirror illusion in motor control.</p>

	<p>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the standard procedure for feeding severely dysphagic patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is associated with prolonged survival and improvement in quality of life. Nasal inspiratory pressure during a sniff (SNIP) is a respiratory test used extensively in ALS for the assessment of inspiratory muscle strength. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of SNIP at baseline to predict PEG placement in ALS. Data from a clinical incident cohort of 179 ALS cases attending the multidisciplinary ALS unit of the University of Bari between April 2006 and December 2012 were retrospectively analysed. At baseline, patients underwent detailed neurological, nutritional and respiratory assessments, including measurements of SNIP and forced vital capacity (FVC). Patients were therefore followed up approximately every three to six months until they were able to attend the centre. The censoring date for the survival analysis was 15 April 2014, with PEG placement as the main outcome. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association between SNIP and PEG placement, adjusted for possible confounders. During the follow-up period, 75 participants (42%) received PEG implant. PEG placement was more frequent (57% vs. 31%; p = 0.001) and earlier (after 11.6 ± 14.0 months from the first visit, vs. 23.3 ± 15.5 months; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) in the group of patients with baseline SNIP ≤ 40 cm H2O. Baseline SNIP was a predictor of PEG placement even after correction for multiple potential confounders (HR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–0.99; p = 0.02). To conclude, the present study showed that SNIP at baseline is an early indicator of disease progression and therefore of the need for enteral nutrition in ALS.</p>

	<p>The phonology of prosody has received little attention in studies of motor speech disorders. The present study investigates the phonology of intonation (nuclear contours) and speech chunking (prosodic phrasing) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as a function of medication intake and duration of the disease. Following methods of the prosodic and intonational phonology frameworks, we examined the ability of 30 PD patients to use intonation categories and prosodic phrasing structures in ways similar to 20 healthy controls to convey similar meanings. Speech data from PD patients were collected before and after a dopaminomimetic drug intake and were phonologically analyzed in relation to nuclear contours and intonational phrasing. Besides medication, disease duration and the presence of motor fluctuations were also factors included in the analyses. Overall, PD patients showed a decreased ability to use nuclear contours and prosodic phrasing. Medication improved intonation regardless of disease duration but did not help with dysprosodic phrasing. In turn, disease duration and motor fluctuations affected phrasing patterns but had no impact on intonation. Our study demonstrated that the phonology of prosody is impaired in PD, and prosodic categories and structures may be differently affected, with implications for the understanding of PD neurophysiology and therapy.</p>

	<p>Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between the left and right primary motor cortices (M1) plays an important role when people perform an isolated unilateral limb movement. Moreover, negative blood oxygenation-level dependent signal (deactivation) obtained from the M1 ipsilateral to the limb could be a surrogate IHI marker. Studies have reported deactivation in the hand section of the ipsilateral M1 during simple unilateral hand movement. However, deactivation in the foot section during unilateral foot movement has not been reported. Therefore, IHI between the foot sections of the bilateral M1s has been considered very weak or absent. Thirty-seven healthy adults performed active control of the right foot and also passively received vibration to the tendon of the tibialis anterior muscle of the right foot, which activates the foot section of the contralateral M1, with brain activity being examined through functional magnetic resonance imaging. The vibration and active tasks significantly and non-significantly, respectively, deactivated the foot section of the ipsilateral M1, with a corresponding 86% and 60% of the participants showing decreased activity. Thus, there could be IHI between the foot sections of the bilateral M1s. Further, our findings demonstrate between-task differences and similarities in cross-somatotopic deactivation.</p>

	<p>Microglia are the first line of defense at the level of the central nervous system (CNS). Phenotypic change in microglia can be regulated by various factors, including the orexin system. Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory process mediated by cytokines, by the lack of interaction of specific receptors such as the OX2-OX2R complex, caused by systemic tissue damage or, more often, associated with direct damage to the CNS. Chronic activation of microglia could lead to long-term neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to explore how tocopherol (vitamin E) and the orexin system may play a role in the prevention and treatment of microglia inflammation and, consequently, in neurodegenerative diseases thanks to its antioxidant properties. The results of animal and in vitro studies provide evidence to support the use of tocopherol for a reduction in microglia inflammation as well as a greater activation of the orexinergic system. Although there is much in vivo and in vitro evidence of vitamin E antioxidant and protective abilities, there are still conflicting results for its use as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases that speculate that vitamin E, under certain conditions or genetic predispositions, can be pro-oxidant and harmful.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of aquatic exercise (AE) and land-based exercise (LE) on cardiorespiratory fitness, motor function, balance, and functional independence in stroke patients. Design: Through searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang Database, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were collected to study the effects of AE and LE on cardiorespiratory fitness, motor function, balance, and functional independence in patients with stroke. The included studies were evaluated for methodological quality by the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool, and statistical analysis was carried out by the Review Manage 5.3 and Stata 15.1 software. Results: The RCTs were collected between the earliest available date and April 2021. Eleven RCTs were included, including five studies with low risk and six studies with moderate risk. The total sample size used in the study was 369, which included 187 patients undertaking AE and 182 patients undertaking LE. The results of the meta-analysis showed that AE can significantly improve patients’ Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (MD = 5.19, 95% CI: 2.66 to 7.71, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) (MD = 3.49, 95% CI: 0.17 to 6.8, p = 0.04), Fugl–Meyer Assessment (FMA) (MD = 3.84, 95% CI: 1.64 to 6.04, p = 0.0006), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (MD = 6.1, 95% CI: 4.05 to 8.15, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two exercise modes in the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) (MD = −2.52, 95% CI: −5.95 to 0.91, p = 0.15) or the Functional Ambulation Category scale (FAC) (MD = 0.28, 95% CI: −0.21 to 0.76, p = 0.26). Conclusion: Based on the improvement in the Berg Balance Scale, peak oxygen uptake, Fugl–Meyer Assessment, and Functional Independence Measure, we can state that aquatic exercise offers better advantages than land-based exercise for patients’ balance, motor function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and functional independence.</p>

	<p>Decision making is crucial for animal survival because the choices they make based on their current situation could influence their future rewards and could have potential costs. This review summarises recent developments in decision making, discusses how rewards and costs could be encoded in the brain, and how different options are compared such that the most optimal one is chosen. The reward and cost are mainly encoded by the forebrain structures (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex), and their value is updated through learning. The recent development on dopamine and the lateral habenula’s role in reporting prediction errors and instructing learning will be emphasised. The importance of dopamine in powering the choice and accounting for the internal state will also be discussed. While the orbitofrontal cortex is the place where the state values are stored, the anterior cingulate cortex is more important when the environment is volatile. All of these structures compare different attributes of the task simultaneously, and the local competition of different neuronal networks allows for the selection of the most appropriate one. Therefore, the total value of the task is not encoded as a scalar quantity in the brain but, instead, as an emergent phenomenon, arising from the computation at different brain regions.</p>

	<p>Developing effective tools and strategies to promote motor learning is a high-priority scientific and clinical goal. In particular, motor-related areas have been investigated as potential targets to facilitate motor learning by noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). In addition to shedding light on the relationship between motor function and oscillatory brain activity, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which can noninvasively entrain oscillatory brain activity and modulate oscillatory brain communication, has attracted attention as a possible technique to promote motor learning. This review focuses on the use of tACS to enhance motor learning through the manipulation of oscillatory brain activity and its potential clinical applications. We discuss a potential tACS–based approach to ameliorate motor deficits by correcting abnormal oscillatory brain activity and promoting appropriate oscillatory communication in patients after stroke or with Parkinson’s disease. Interpersonal tACS approaches to manipulate intra- and inter-brain communication may result in pro-social effects and could promote the teaching–learning process during rehabilitation sessions with a therapist. The approach of re-establishing oscillatory brain communication through tACS could be effective for motor recovery and might eventually drive the design of new neurorehabilitation approaches based on motor learning.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) is a systemic and fatal neurodegenerative condition for which there is currently no cure. Informal caregivers play a vital role in supporting the person with ALS, and it is essential to support their wellbeing. This multi-centre, mixed methods descriptive exploratory study describes the complexity of burden and self-defined difficulties as described by the caregivers themselves. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during face-to-face interviews with informal caregivers from centres in the Netherlands, England, and Ireland. Standardised measures assessed burden, quality of life, and psychological distress; furthermore, an open-ended question was asked about difficult aspects of caregiving. Most caregivers were female, spouse/partners, and lived with the person with ALS for whom they provided care. Significant differences between national cohorts were identified for burden, quality of life, and anxiety. Among the difficulties described were the practical issues associated with the caregiver role and emotional factors such as witnessing a patient’s health decline, relationship change, and their own distress. The mixed-methods approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the burden and difficulties experienced. It is important to generate an evidence base to support the psychosocial wellbeing and brain health of informal caregivers.</p>
